   <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31. I will call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the need to address the situation whereby up to &euro;20 million has been spent over the past three years jointly by the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor defending cases where parents have taken legal action in an effort to get appropriate education for their children who have special educational needs. The &euro;20 million was mainly spent on legal fees rather than settlements, which indicates those taking cases seek educational rather than monetary settlements. The courts, in effect, decide policy and require delivery of services. There is an obvious need to put the services in place to deal with the queues of children waiting for assessments for school places or speech and language or occupational therapy, rather than spending taxpayers&rsquo; money defending what is often the indefensible.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the proposal of the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, to usher in a new generation of nuclear power in Britain with a vengeance; the attending consequences and increased risks for Ireland of an upgraded and intensified nuclear waste reprocessing plant a short number of miles away at Sellafield in Cumbria, the closure of which is our Government&rsquo;s stated aim; the continuing discharge of nuclear waste into an already excessively contaminated Irish Sea and the increased vulnerability of the upgraded British nuclear plants to terrorist attacks. I call on the Government to impress on <Col N="1610"/>the British the urgency for increasing renewable energy sources to meet its future energy needs without the necessity for additional nuclear power stations.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the need for the Government to resource adequately and increase the number of workers delivering youth programmes in Clonmel; the need to grant young people&rsquo;s facilities and services fund status to the town; the need to approve funding for a springboard project for the town and the need to provide adequate funding for projects under the drugs task force funding. The lack of these workers, resources and projects have precluded the development of important initiatives which would enhance social inclusion. Will the Minister make a statement on the matter?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the continuing hunger strike and protest by 41 Afghans in Dublin, the apparent failure of the Government to take into account that there is a war raging in Afghanistan, which the Minister disgracefully described as mere disturbances, and which last night alone claimed the lives of at least 60 civilians, policemen, rebels and soldiers in gun and bomb attacks in several areas, and the increasingly urgent need for the Minister to introduce a formal system of complementary protections for those persons who do not fit the narrow convention criteria for refugee status.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the need, following revelations about donations to politicians yesterday, to improve public confidence in the planning process by amending the planning laws to ensure that developers found in breach of planning conditions in one location in a local authority area are not allowed to develop in another part of that county.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: today&rsquo;s publication of a book, <i>Speaking Truth to Power</i>, which details the catalogue of events accompanying the dismissal from the Irish Army of Donal de R&oacute;iste in 1969, and that the Minister for Defence address this House stating what subsequent measures he intends to put in place to reverse this miscarriage of justice.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the critical need to ensure that essential social infrastructure, including adequate child care facilities, primary, secondary and third level educational institutions, primary <Col N="1611"/>health care and general hospital services, and public transport will be put in place in the huge north fringe development being built in the Dublin North-East constituency, an area of approximately 30,000 additional housing units which does not have a strategic development zone plan and where no school provision has yet taken place.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy must confine himself to the matter on which he notified the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health Service Executive&rsquo;s capital programme was published this morning and there is not a single grant for the Dublin North-East constituency, although it is represented in this House by two Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies. It is a disgraceful state of affairs.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the proposed closure of Tarbert power station in County Kerry with the loss of 129 jobs.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

   <Title>Death of Staff Member: Expressions of Sympathy.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is with sadness I would like to remember one of our reporters, Ms Breda Courtney, who died suddenly this week. Breda had been working with us in Leinster House since 1978. She was at her desk in front of me last week. I wish to express our deepest sympathy to all her family, friends and colleagues, especially her colleagues in the Debates Office.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>On my own behalf and that of the Government, I also express my sympathy to her family on the sad and sudden death of Ms Breda Courtney. Ms Courtney has worked in the Oireachtas since 1978 and was a parliamentary reporter since 1996. She was a Kerry woman with a strong interest in the GAA. She was completely committed to our work in this House, and it was with great regret that we learned yesterday of her sad death. I express our sympathy to her family and in particular to her sisters, Carmel, Marie and Ann.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with the T&aacute;naiste in this sentiment, an expression of sympathy on the death of Ms Courtney. I am sorry that I did not hear of it until now, but I saw her in the Houses last week. My sympathy and regrets go to her family and all her friends. The parliamentary reporters in this House have always done a fabulous job, and in that sense Ms Courtney did the <Col N="1612"/>State some service. We sympathise with her extended family on her passing.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I join the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the T&aacute;naiste and the leader of Fine Gael in adding words of sympathy on behalf of the Labour Party to the family of Ms Breda Courtney on her premature departure. I have known Ms Courtney for a long time, but only to say &ldquo;hello&rdquo; to. I agree with what Deputy Kenny has stated on the high standards met by the reporters in the Houses. I am very sad to hear of her premature death, and I convey our sympathies to her family.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Green Party I wish to express my shock on hearing of the sudden death of Ms Breda Courtney. It is particularly sad given that the quiet, professional and methodical way in which Ms Courtney carried out her work would not have drawn comment because she was so professional. It is at a time such as this, when she is not here to appreciate it, that people are reminded of the high standard of that work. All we can do, in sadness, is extend our sympathies to her family, friends and colleagues in the Houses.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I join colleagues in expressing sympathy to the sisters, extended family and all the bereaved on the death of Ms Breda Courtney. As it was with Deputy Kenny, this is unfortunately the first I have known of it. I would have liked the opportunity to have previously extended our sympathies to her work colleagues. I take the opportunity this morning to do so. We rarely get the opportunity to express our appreciation of the work carried out by people such as Ms Courtney and the reporting team here. She would not mind if we use the opportunity to convey our appreciation to all her colleagues here in their continuing work. Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a hanam uasal.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Independent group in this House I wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy on Ms Breda Courtney&rsquo;s death. It is a sorry day that we cannot see her at the reporter&rsquo;s desk.</P>

   <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to take No. 16<i>a</i>, motion on membership of committees; No. 16<i>b</i>, motion on referral to joint committee of proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for a Council framework decision on simplifying the exchange of information and intelligence between law enforcement authorities of the member states of the European Union; No. 16<i>c</i>, motion on address by the Honourable John Howard, MP, Prime Minister of Australia; No. 16<i>d</i>, motion on arrangements to facilitate address by the Honourable John Howard, MP, Prime Minister of Australia; No. 18, Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006 &mdash; Second Stage, resumed; <Col N="1613"/>and No. 19, statements on Transport 21, resumed, in accordance with the Order of the D&aacute;il of 2 March 2006.</P>
    <P Just="Left">It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 16<i>a</i> and 16<i>b </i>shall be decided without debate; that Nos. 16<i>c</i> and 16<i>d</i> shall be moved and debated together and the proceedings thereon shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 24 minutes by one question which shall be put from the Chair. The speeches shall be confined to a Minister or Minister of State and to the main spokespersons for Fine Gael, the Labour Party and the Technical Group, who shall be called upon in that order and who may share their time, and shall not exceed six minutes in each case.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two proposals to be put to the House. Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 16<i>a</i> and 16<i>b</i> without debate agreed to?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not agreed. I wish to speak to the motion on referral to the joint committee of the proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for a Council framework decision on simplifying the exchange of information and intelligence between law enforcement authorities of the members states of the European Union. I object to this matter being taken without debate. I acknowledge that it has been the practice heretofore to refer matters to committee without debate. What is involved is a further working out of the Hague programme that has been in place since 2004 but has yet to be addressed in this House.</P>
    <P>We have had no substantive debate on the Hague programme in any shape or form in this Chamber. That is a serious omission on the part of the House. Irrespective of where people may stand with regard to the specific proposition here, and that can only present itself in full debate, there is the principle of the import of this House properly addressing the Hague programme.</P>
    <P>With respect to the circularisation of the detail, it came with no COM reference number. Taken with all the other material circularised it creates confusion and makes it very difficult for people to properly prepare either for committee or for an opportunity to speak in the House. That is a technical deficiency.</P>
    <P>The bigger issue and the principle is that we have yet to have a full and proper debate here on the Hague programme. That must take precedence before any further referrals of motions arising therefrom. I object to this motion being taken in the way suggested by the T&aacute;naiste, and I urge her and the Chief Whip to properly note the need for that debate in this House as a matter of urgency.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>When this matter comes back from the committee there will be a debate in the House.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1614"/>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a commitment on that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 16<i>a</i> and 16<i>b</i> agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 16<i>c</i> and 16<i>d</i> agreed?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>No. While we appreciate the opportunity to speak on the motion, we must record our opposition to the way in which the arrangements have been made which sees a number of party leaders, myself included, not being given the opportunity of meeting Prime Minister Howard of Australia. That is at variance with precedent.</P>
    <P>I recall meeting on the same basis as other party leaders, Prime Minister Blair and former President Clinton. I am reminded by my colleagues of the Green Party in Australia that it would expect this country to afford equality to Prime Minister Howard in terms of facilitating a meeting with the Green Party here. Senator Bob Brown and my Green Party colleagues in Australia will have more to say on this issue. It will reflect badly on Ireland that it sees itself in such a partisan fashion, and it reminds us of some of the partisan politics we are trying to get away from, and which have bedevilled Australia as well as Ireland and other countries in the past. We should ensure censorship does not take place for the visit and cause rancour.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have a problem with the motion <i>per se</i> but record my agreement with Deputy Sargent on the absence of parity of esteem shown to the various political groupings represented in this House. We must defend at all times the right to equality of opportunity and that has been denied to a number of political parties, including Sinn F&eacute;in, in the proposals before us.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The announcement and the arrangements for this visit were made without the necessary diplomatic preparation or consultation with other Members of this House. They were also made without any serious consideration as to the purpose of the visit, which is unsatisfactory. When people have addressed this Chamber in the past there has been quite a long preparation so that people understood the purpose of the visit. We will have a six-minute opportunity when we come to discuss the motion to express our views on what the content of the exchange with the Prime Minister should be, but the preparations for the visit and the manner in which it was announced are quite unsatisfactory. There has been an elaborate ritual involving directives, orders and other such things as to how people will parade in and out of the Chamber, and the formation in which visitors will sit, which is always very impressive and dates back to Leonardo Da Vinci. It is important, however, that <Col N="1615"/>an inkling be given in advance as to the purpose and intent of the visit. I do not mean to be discourteous but any visit should be better and more thoughtfully arranged, with greater respect for this Parliament.</P>

	<P>The visit was announced before it was discussed in this House.</P>

	<P>The CPP agreed it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>It was announced by the Government before the CPP announced it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I read about it in the press before there was any communication from the Minister or the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. It may well be that the Government wishes to do it in this way but I am perfectly entitled to remind the House that both previous visits were organised differently. I make my suggestion for the purposes of propriety.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the CPP met to discuss the arrangements for this visit and that they were unanimously agreed. Furthermore, the Chief Whip agreed there would be a debate in the House this morning, at the request of Deputy Stagg and the Opposition.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is fine.</P>
</Speaker>
    <P>Question, &ldquo;That the proposal for dealing with Nos. 16<i>c</i> and 16<i>d</i> be agreed&rdquo;, put and declared carried.</P>
   
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte yesterday asked the Taoiseach a question, to which he answered that the former chief executive officer of Aer Lingus wished to steal the assets of the State company. The T&aacute;naiste has often complimented Mr. Willie Walsh for the condition in which he left the company. Does the T&aacute;naiste share the view of the Taoiseach as expressed in his statement yesterday? Is that the Government view?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>She was opening the door to let him in.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no legislation promised in this area. I repeat that the former chief executive of Aer Lingus did a fantastic job.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>He was not a thief.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1616"/>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the T&aacute;naiste share the view of the Taoiseach that the former chief executive officer of Aer Lingus wished to steal the assets of the State company?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a perspective I share. The Taoiseach may have intended to use the word &ldquo;strip&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;steal&rdquo;.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach did not withdraw the statement.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I get the impression the T&aacute;naiste thinks it acceptable to strip the assets of a State company&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and the Taoiseach thinks it acceptable to steal them.</P>
    <P>I refer the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to rulings and precedents of the House. One example reads: &ldquo;Members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official, either by name or in such way as to make him identifiable, as he is defenceless against accusations made under privilege in the House&rdquo;.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish Deputy Rabbitte knew that ruling. He does that on a weekly basis.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a ruling which has been enforced on many occasions by predecessors of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. Standing Order 58 reads: &ldquo;A member shall not make an utterance in the nature of being defamatory and where a member makes such an utterance it may be <i>prima facie</i> an abuse of privilege, subject to the provisions of this Standing Order&rdquo;. It goes on to state the Ceann Comhairle should intervene, but he did not. I have witnessed the Ceann Comhairle intervene in some of the most trivial causes in this House when the supposed offender was a Member of the Opposition benches. Why did the Ceann Comhairle not intervene on this occasion, nor leave any instructions with the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to cause the Taoiseach to come to the House to put the record straight? For the T&aacute;naiste to say the Taoiseach meant the former chief executive was trying to strip the assets of a State company only compounds the insult. The decision to sell Aer Lingus for a pittance is wrong but whatever it is worth, to accuse somebody of seeking to steal it was a serious abuse of privilege for populist purposes and electoral gain. That one of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s colleagues, speaking on radio this morning, should explain it as an example of the Taoiseach praising the integrity of the former executives beggars belief.</P>
    <P>I ask the T&aacute;naiste to again address the question put to her. Does she agree with the Taoiseach that the former senior executives of Aer Lingus attempted to steal the assets of the company?</P>
    <P>I call on the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to address an outrageous breach of privilege on the part of the Taoiseach. No Member on this side of <Col N="1617"/>the House would have got away with what the Ceann Comhairle pretended not to hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair cannot review the decisions made by another Chair, including the Ceann Comhairle. Standing Order 58 gives the right of reply to anyone aggrieved. The ruling quoted by the Deputy has not been rigidly applied in view of the fact there is a right of reply.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>How does one exercise the right of reply?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There cannot be a discussion on the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
 
   </Speaker>
     <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Leas-Cheann Comhairle cannot be expected to answer for the non-intervention of the Ceann Comhairle. I give notice that I intend to raise the matter with him. It is an entirely inadequate response to indicate that the aggrieved person may make a written complaint to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. The Taoiseach, in the time-honoured tradition of the House, should come into the Chamber and correct an outrageous, defamatory statement he made yesterday. I ask the T&aacute;naiste, on behalf of the Government and her own office, if she agrees with the Taoiseach describing the individuals in question as thieves in the House yesterday.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>As I made clear to Deputy Kenny, it is not my perspective on the matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputies must return to the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>On the same matter, but on the Order of Business, if the use of the word &ldquo;steal&rdquo; does not reflect the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s perspective on the matter, does the statement made by Deputy Glennon on the radio this morning, when he implied that the word &ldquo;steal&rdquo; was used as a noun and Aer Lingus was, therefore, being sold for a pittance or was going for a song, reflect her perspective? Perhaps she will reflect on this because people in my constituency of Dublin North are under the impression that the company is being sold off without giving value to workers or members of the public. Perhaps the use of the word &ldquo;steal&rdquo; as a noun rather than verb, as suggested by Deputy Glennon, is closer to the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s perspective. This is how Fianna F&aacute;il is trying to explain the matter. Does the T&aacute;naiste share this view?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Surely the issue here is the breathtaking hypocrisy of the Taoiseach who, while pretending to point out the greed of previous corporate executives who wanted to get their hands on the airline, is holding the door ajar for the corporate thieves, the biggest thieves in <Col N="1618"/>the international stock exchanges, who cannot wait to get their hands on our national airline courtesy of the Taoiseach and Government.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>No one protested about the Deputy&rsquo;s comments.</P>

	<P>They are defamation too.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Is all this not indicative of the fact that the Government is starting to feel some discomfort at its decision to sell Aer Lingus? Is it not the case that the Taoiseach is at sea and cannot even properly prepare himself in terms of the language he is to employ? Is it not the case that the arguments, as presented by other voices in the House against the proposed privatisation of Aer Lingus, are starting to ring true in Government? While I do not expect the T&aacute;naiste to be the first to realise the folly of the pursuit the Government is undertaking with regard to the future of Aer Lingus, I hope that on mature reflection &mdash; if that is possible &mdash; the Taoiseach and others in his party will recognise the folly of their decision not only to sell off but to discard our national carrier. This disgraceful intention is the most important issue, not word games about who stole or stripped what. The people are having their national carrier stolen from them by the very people they have entrusted to guard it.</P>

	<P>Three weeks ago, when my party leader, Deputy Rabbitte, raised the matter of having a debate on the proposed sale of Aer Lingus, the Taoiseach gave an undertaking that the Whips would arrange such a debate at an early date. I have raised the matter at Whips&rsquo; meetings every week since but it has been kicked to touch. The rationale behind the decision not to grant a debate is that it would embarrass the Government. The only reason for not having a debate when one is promised is that a Minister is abroad or otherwise not available. However, as the relevant Minister is available, there is no reason to postpone the debate the Taoiseach promised in the House three weeks ago. I ask that it be held next Thursday given that there is time available.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The housing (miscellaneous provisions) Bill will allow local authorities to sell flats if the courts so decide, thus allowing tenants, some of 40 years&rsquo; standing, to buy their rented dwelling. The difficulty caused by the delay in introducing the legislation is that the cost of housing is increasing by an estimated 10% per annum and the prices of the dwellings in question are becoming prohibitive for such tenants. The Bill also proposes to give local authorities the right to deal with anti-social behaviour as part of what the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform describes as his efforts to create a safer society. When will the Bill come before the House? Must we wait a further three years?</P>

	<P>Has the T&aacute;naiste, as Minister for Health and Children, examined the consequences of a European Court of Justice ruling on the liability of states regarding patients who must travel abroad for treatments? Will this ruling require her to introduce legislation?</P>
    <P>SI 171 of 2000 dealt with the dissolution and revocation order of the National Rehabilitation Board and SI 170 of 2000 dealt with the transfer of property rights and liabilities order of the National Rehabilitation Board. On 12 June 2000 the board employed 184 members of staff, the majority of whom have not received their pensions for the past six years. Elements of those pensions are outstanding, including abolition of office, added entitlements and the retention of unco-ordinated status. After six years of legal contest in the courts, one of those employees has been awarded his full entitlements under the appropriate pension requirements. Having been approved for that person yesterday, those legal entitlements were also due to the 184 members who were employed by the National Rehabilitation Board on 12 June 2000. I know she may not have an answer now, but will the T&aacute;naiste follow up on this matter to see that the legal entitlements of those former employees will be reflected in their pensions, so that the people concerned will not have to seek decisions in the courts?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Deputy Kenny on the same issue. It is grossly unfair that people are being treated in this way. I ask the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to take an interest in this. Even though her Department has a responsibility in this area, the matter is being shifted to the Health Service Executive which has absolutely no responsibility for it. I ask the <Col N="1621"/>T&aacute;naiste to address this issue which has gone on far too long. People have been seeking their rights for six years but have been treated shabbily and, ultimately, in a way that will cost the State money if it ends up in the courts again.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>

	<P>On promised legislation, I raised the hepatitis C and HIV compensation tribunal (amendment) Bill here last week and received what I can only describe as an unsatisfactory response. The situation concerning this legislation is unclear, so perhaps the T&aacute;naiste can clarify it. We have been waiting nine years for this legislation to be published. Many vulnerable people have been hurt over that period and are anxiously awaiting the advent of this legislation. Will it be published before the summer recess? What are the prospects of Second and further Stages being taken before the summer recess? I hope the prospects are good and that the T&aacute;naiste can confirm it will happen. The reply last week which has been oft times trundled out here suggested that the Bill will be introduced before the end of this term which the Taoiseach has advised us runs until the beginning of the following term, which means the entirety of the summer passing by. To be specific, will we have this legislation before the summer recess so that it can be debated and moved forward?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope so. I understand I will have clearance from the Parliamentary Counsel to take the Bill to Cabinet in approximately two weeks. The intention thereafter is to publish it quickly and, with the co-operation of the Deputies opposite, to take it through before the summer. The Taoiseach made that clear to Deputy McManus earlier this week. I am quite determined to do that if I can.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise two issues, one of which relates to the Department of Health and Children. It concerns the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s continued reluctance to answer questions of a financial nature on the record of the House and to refer them instead to the HSE. When is it likely that she will accept full responsibility for the running of her Department and answer parliamentary questions in the traditional fashion to safeguard both herself, her Department and the State?</P>
    <P>The second issue concerns the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. The T&aacute;naiste might be able to answer in this area. I refer to the unsatisfactory progress in providing broadband throughout the country, which has left some areas without a service or an indication of <Col N="1622"/>future service. As a matter of urgency, will the Minister call together all the service providers with a view to ensuring that a concerted effort is made, such as the dramatically successful one in Northern Ireland?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I take full responsibility for health matters but, clearly, operational issues have to be referred to the HSE. As Professor Drumm has made clear recently, the HSE is strengthening its parliamentary affairs division.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>We need someone here to answer questions in the House.</P>

	<P Just="Left">On a previous occasion, I asked the T&aacute;naiste whether the Government would consider introducing a refundable deposit on bottle and cans, which would have the almost immediate effect of halving the litter problem. Children and other offenders would not throw bottles and cans around if a 20 cent or 50 cent deposit could be recouped on each item. In her response, the T&aacute;naiste said that such legislation was not possible because it would be illegal under the packaging directive. Subsequently, I tabled a question on this matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government who clearly stated that it was not illegal under the packages directive. Therefore, I have two questions to ask. First, will the T&aacute;naiste clarify the record of the House that a refundable deposit on bottles and cans is not illegal? Second, given that the litter problem continues to grow, will the Government consider introducing such legislation?</P>

We are facing double digit price rises in electricity, while petrol and diesel prices on the forecourts are moving relentlessly over &euro;1.20 per litre. In that context, will the T&aacute;naiste ask the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey to withdraw the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform withdrew the Criminal Justice Bill and come back to the House with an energy Bill which includes the views of consumers&mdash;both householders and businesses&mdash;on energy prices? At the moment, there is no input by householders or the business sector into energy pricing. The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has not done anything over the past two and a half years to bring about any change in this regard. We are facing a disastrous situation concerning energy prices.

	<P>I move the following motions:</P>
    <P LI="1">That, to welcome the visit to Ireland of the Prime Minister of Australia, the Honourable John Howard, MP, and to mark the event in a signal manner, the Prime Minister be invited to address the D&aacute;il at 5.15 p.m. on Tuesday, 23 May, the proceedings at such address shall consist of a speech by the Ceann Comhairle welcoming the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister&rsquo;s address and an expression of thanks by the Ceann Comhairle for the address; and that the sitting be thereupon suspended until 7 p.m.: Provided that, in the unlikely event Prime Minister Howard, is unable to attend, the Ceann Comhairle may suspend the sitting until 7 p.m.</P>
    <P LI="1">That, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, and unless the D&aacute;il shall otherwise order, in order to facilitate an address by the Honourable John Howard, MP, Prime Minister of Australia, the following arrangements shall apply in relation to the sitting of the D&aacute;il on Tuesday, 23 May 2006:</P>
    <P LI="2">(1) The sitting shall be suspended at 4.50 until 5.15 p.m, whereupon the address by Prime Minister Howard, MP, shall then be heard;</P>
    <P LI="2">(2) Immediately following the address by Prime Minister Howard, MP, and the expression of thanks by the Ceann Comhairle, the sitting shall stand suspended until 7 p.m., whereupon the ordinary routine of business shall recommence with private members&rsquo; business;</P><Col N="1631"/>
    <P LI="2">(3) In the event of a private notice question being allowed, it shall be taken during the last thirty minutes of the time allowed for the taking of Oral Questions on that day (and the taking of Questions shall not resume thereafter).</P>
    <P FLI="0">The Prime Minister of Australia, the Right Honourable Mr. John Howard, will pay an official visit to Ireland from 20 to 24 May 2006. The Government proposes that he should be invited to address the D&aacute;il during his visit. This courtesy is one the D&aacute;il extends on occasion to visiting Heads of Government of countries with which Ireland has particularly close ties. Australia is certainly one such country. Its links with Ireland go back to its very foundation and have been reinforced by continuous waves of Irish people who for one reason or another have made Australia their home. We in Ireland are grateful to Australia for welcoming them and giving them the opportunity not only to integrate into Australian society but to mould, shape and develop it.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember that the Prime Minister&rsquo;s predecessors, Mr. Hawke and Mr. Keating, addressed the D&aacute;il during their visits to Ireland and I am delighted to propose that we ask Mr. Howard to continue the tradition. This is the first visit to Ireland by a Prime Minister from the Liberal Party of Australia and, given the close historical ties between our two countries, it is a landmark occasion. Historically, the Irish in Australia were linked to the Australian Labour Party but Irish-Australians are now active across the political spectrum. The Prime Minister himself claims some Irish ancestry.</P>
    <P>This will be the first visit by Mr. Howard to Ireland since 1977. We know from our preparations for his visit that he is interested in the transformation of the Irish economy and we will be pleased to demonstrate to him the success we have achieved. His visit will also permit us to return the warm hospitality he extended to the Taoiseach and to President McAleese during their respective visits to Australia.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The Prime Minister&rsquo;s official programme will begin on Monday, 22 May, with a wreath-laying ceremony at Kilmainham. He will then meet students from the Australian Studies Centre at University College Dublin. A civic reception will be held for him at the Mansion House, while a lunch organised by Dublin Chamber of Commerce, IBEC and Enterprise Ireland will provide the Prime Minister with an opportunity to meet Irish and Australian business interests. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs will hold official talks with the Prime Minister. Fortunately, our relations with Australia are very good and the talks will focus on how to develop and strengthen our mutual co-operation. The Prime Minister will also be received by President McAleese. The Ceann Comhairle has agreed to <Col N="1632"/>meet him, as have the leaders of the Opposition parties and, if the D&aacute;il approves this motion, the Prime Minister will address this House.</P>
    <P>The Prime Minister&rsquo;s visit to Ireland provides a valuable opportunity to build on the historically close and increasingly dynamic relationship between Australia and Ireland and to further pursue our mutual interests in expanding trade and investment, people-to-people links and practical co-operation in areas such as research and development, information technology and education.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral relations with Australia are excellent. Ireland has had an embassy in Canberra since 1946, the year in which Australia opened its embassy in Dublin. In 2000, Ireland opened a consulate general in Sydney. The President paid an official visit to Australia in March 2003 and her two immediate predecessors also paid State visits.</P>
    <P>People-to-people contacts have been widespread and frequent. The working holiday visa scheme for Australia continues to be very successful. Approximately 10,000 Irish young people visit Australia each year under the scheme, while 2,000 Australians visit Ireland. Australia is also an important market for Irish tourism. We estimate that 150,000 Australians visited Ireland in 2005 and we look forward to an increase in this figure with the introduction of better air links. The December 2005 introduction by Gulf Air of direct flights between Dublin and Bahrain, with onward connections to Australia, represented an important development. In March 2006, Aer Lingus introduced direct flights to Dubai, which can connect with Emirates flights to airports in Australia.</P>
    <P>Ireland and Australia have a shared interest in culture and sport. As our people moved, they extended the reach of our sport and culture. Australians have proved adept at taking what they inherited to a higher plain, be it Gaelic and Australian rules football, literature, painting, traditional music or Irish dancing. At the recent world Irish dancing championships in Belfast, two young Australians from Wallangra, New South Wales, beat top-class competitors from around the world to become the first male and female winners in the history of Australia&rsquo;s Irish dancing community.</P>
    <P>Our trading relations with Australia are healthy and the balance of trade is heavily in our favour. In 2005, two way trade was valued at &euro;864 million, with Irish exports valued at &euro;734 million and imports from Australia at &euro;130 million. In recent years, Irish software companies and farm machinery manufacturers have enjoyed significant success in Australia. Five years ago, I led a successful trade mission to Australia which targeted these sectors. Currently, 44 Irish companies operate in Australia, more than double the 19 that operated there five years ago. There are 35 Australian companies in Ireland, operating in the <Col N="1633"/>manufacturing, financial and international services sectors.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s discussions with the Prime Minister will also allow them to exchange views on the wider relationship between Australia and the European Union. The EU is Australia&rsquo;s largest single economic partner in terms of two way trade in goods and services, the largest investor in Australia and the second largest destination for Australian investment overseas. The Joint Declaration on Relations between the European Union and Australia reaffirms our determination to build up the relationship to support democracy and the rule of law and promote peace, security and non-proliferation. We are particularly interested in the excellent work done under the Agreement Relating to Scientific and Technical Co-operation Between Australia and the European Union.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Australia&rsquo;s genesis and history has fostered a strong interest there in Northern Ireland. Australia was an early contributor to the International Fund for Ireland and has strongly supported the Good Friday Agreement. Deputies will be aware of this Government&rsquo;s interest in developments in the Asia Pacific region and we look forward to hearing the Prime Minister&rsquo;s views on the matter. Closer relations with China and India are a priority for Australia. The Prime Minister has been to China several times and visited India earlier this year for the first time. Given the recent visits to Asia by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, there will obviously be fruitful ground for exchanges of views on this most important region. From my previous experience as Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with special responsibility for development co-operation, I am aware of our common interest in the development and well-being of the new state of East Timor. During my time as Minister of State, Ireland added East Timor as a priority country in its aid programme. There will also be an opportunity to discuss other political issues, including issues that have arisen in the United Nations.</P>
    <P>I believe the D&aacute;il as well as the Government will be interested in hearing Mr. Howard&rsquo;s views on relations between Australia, Ireland and on wider world issues. Deputies have strong links with their Australian counterparts, developed through exchanges of visits and information. Many Oireachtas committees have gained valuable experience from study visits to Australia. The proposed address to the D&aacute;il by the Prime Minister is another opportunity for a valuable exchange of information and a strengthening of our friendship with a long-standing and important friend. I commend the motions to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>After winning a fourth term in office in 2004, the Prime Minister of Australia, the Right Honourable Mr. John Howard, became the most electorally successful Australian politician of our time. A popular politician in his country, <Col N="1634"/>he is the elected representative of a nation of 20 million people. However, his premiership has not been without controversy. In this decade, international concerns about the war in Iraq, multi-culturalism and the determination of Iran to obtain a nuclear capability have exercised the Australian administration more than most.</P>
    <P>Australia and Ireland are bound by ties of friendship and family. We are all aware of the history of emigration from Ireland to Australia and that many Australians look to Ireland for their ancestral roots. Even in Ireland&rsquo;s more successful recent history, the flow from our country to Australia continued unabated, although these days our younger people largely choose to work in Australia as part of a one year visa programme. There is a saying that &ldquo;Eaten bread is soon forgotten&rdquo;. In this case, it is not good enough to forget the support from brave men and women, many who gave their lives, and contributed to building the type of peace and stability which we so casually take for granted in the western world.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I mention these facts to stress the real friendship between our two countries. As always, friends must be able to speak plainly with each other and our Government should be able to raise with Prime Minister Howard any issue that concerns it, either in terms of our unique relationship or in matters of international politics.</P>
    <P>As one pressing example, Prime Minister Howard&rsquo;s strong support for the war in Iraq will worry many, both inside this House and throughout the country. The war in Iraq took place without United Nations sanction and has not been a success &mdash; if any war is a success &mdash; according to any means of measurement. Fine Gael did not support the unilateral action taken by the United States and the United Kingdom, acting with the strong support of Australia, and which took place without the ratification of the international community through established mechanisms. The Taoiseach should raise this matter directly with the Prime Minister. While we have grave concerns about the manner in which this war was started, concerns that should be expressed clearly and openly, we must also address the dreadful situation which exists in Iraq and in which Iraqis now live. The international community cannot allow Iraq to slide ever closer to civil war, and yet the conditions in that state are so poor, and the actions of radical terrorists so frequent, that the appalling spectre of civil war is ever present.</P>
    <P>However, we cannot forget that Australia was also dealt a severe blow by terrorism. In the bombing of a Bali nightclub in October 2002, 202 people lost their lives, many of them young holiday-makers from Australia. In addition, the question of Iranian nuclear development has been to the forefront of international politics and diplomacy for some time. I have long since expressed the view that Ireland, as a non-aligned and non-nuclear country, could and should have a diplomatic role in dealing with Iran as part of the international response to this crisis. I spoke <Col N="1635"/>on that issue in the D&aacute;il on Europe Day last week, and I repeat we should not be passive on this issue. We should not allow the European Union position to be left to the United Kingdom, France and Germany, two of which are themselves nuclear nations. I am concerned that the European Union, in delegating the three countries mentioned to negotiate on its behalf, has overlooked some of the smaller member states which have a proven record in the promotion of nuclear disarmament and in combating nuclear proliferation. This matter should also be discussed with Prime Minister Howard, and the potential for Ireland&rsquo;s close involvement in seeking a resolution to this matter put forward.</P>
    <P>I would like the Taoiseach to also raise the matter of Australia&rsquo;s access to oil reserves off the coast of East Timor which I understand are disputed. The East Timorese people have suffered considerably, especially in recent decades, and East Timor was finally recognised as an independent state in 2002.</P>
    <P>I and my party are very supportive of the visit of Mr. Howard to Ireland, and of his upcoming address to the Oireachtas. We are friendly nations, countries bound by history, family and partnership. We are also linked closely on the playing fields. Australians are known to love their sport, and we have the compromise rules football series between this country and Australia. Being bound very closely, it is right that we should meet and discuss not only our similarities but also our differences, in a spirit of frankness, openness and honesty.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I very much appreciate the connection between the people of Australia and of Ireland. My grandmother&rsquo;s brothers and sisters emigrated to Australia. My uncle emigrated there after the Civil War and my aunt emigrated to Australia around the time of my father. We have long family connections with Australia. Moreover, there are many families in County Clare with connections with Queensland and New South Wales.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty in wanting to deepen the relationship between the people of Australia and Ireland, but Mr. Howard brings particular baggage with him. The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, mentioned how significant it is that Mr. Howard is the first Liberal Australian Prime Minister to visit Ireland. He does so with an extraordinary record. He has pioneered putting Australia outside the ambit of international law. He has shown no respect for human rights. I recall that the longest meeting held by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs, of which I am the longest-serving member, took place when there was an objection to the wording of a resolution we passed congratulating Australia on its constitution, because I had included a sentence referring to the original inhabitants of Australia. Around the time the <Col N="1636"/>members of my family at the end of the 19th century were emigrating to Australia, the Privy Council of the United Kingdom described Australia as attractive territory, practically unoccupied, without settled inhabitants or settled law. Later on, when it was advocating its theory of<i> terra nullius,</i> an empty country, it went on to refine the notion that it did not have civilised people or civilised law. When I asked that on the occasion of the celebration of the Australian constitution it was time that the original occupants of Australia be recognised, my suggestion was described as inaccurate, unhelpful and unfriendly.</P>
    <P>All this does not stop anyone raising any of these issues, although I have no confidence they will be raised. Will the Iraq issue be raised? As this House has already heard, Mr. Howard has supported the principle of pre-emption, which places a country outside the ambit of international law. He has spoken savagely against the rights of trade unions. He has changed the law with regard to the press, for example if a person is detained, and one comments on that in the public press. Allegedly he has a unique macho attitude towards boat people, those who come through the seas to Australia. We need not be coy about the relationship with East Timor, because the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, has an admirable record in assisting its people. Mr. Howard, instead of robbing all their oil and granting them 20% as was formerly the case, is now willing to concede to them 50%. Should he be thanked for that? We could also question Mr. Howard&rsquo;s general attitude towards Asia.</P>
    <P>Mr. Howard comes with a unique background and record. Our friendship with the people of Australia is mediated through the millions of people there of Irish extraction. They will be looking to us to make sure Mr. Howard hears the full Irish view, that it expresses our official position of neutrality and of &mdash; I believe &mdash; our official position of being against the Iraq war, with our nuanced assistance to the war effort through Shannon Airport. Those people will also want to hear from us that the strength of a small country and its influence in the international world is in its respect for law and its respect for the most vulnerable boat people. We do not admire the dragging of a boat through the seas and watching it sink, nor the placing of people in detention camps, nor the abuse of law in all its principles in the name of an anti-terrorist campaign.</P>
    <P>All of that having been said, the representative of the Australian people will always be welcome here. People who are elected should be spoken to. However, it is not a curiosity nor an exotic achievement that Mr. Howard is the first Liberal Australian Prime Minister visiting Ireland. There were people who visited before who were not without blemish, in different times, but they came with a particular kind of connection to things we could share in the international labour movement, the international human rights movement, <Col N="1637"/>the United Nations and all these areas. I suggest that on this occasion, our valuable economic relationships should be a footnote in the preparations for Mr. Howard&rsquo;s visit, and we should be determined to &mdash; with courtesy, courage and frankness &mdash; present the Irish view, and the view of Irish in Australia, on all of these issues to Mr. Howard, for his reflection. Our Parliament, in a small country, is at its best when it speaks on and defends issues of principle. It is probably at its worst when it decides to sideline those issues of principle for any flimsy, narrow or shallow advantage.</P>

	<P>I will share time with Deputy Joe Higgins and Deputy Gormley.</P>
    <P>Prime Minister Howard will visit Ireland as a representative of all the people of Australia and, therefore, should be accorded a dignified and inclusive welcome in the House. His and his Government&rsquo;s involvement in the war in Iraq is, of course, an issue of great concern to me and other Members of the House. However, it is also a concern for the more than 50% of the Australian people who openly oppose their armed forces&rsquo; presence in Iraq. I stand shoulder to shoulder with them in their campaign of opposition to the illegal occupation of Iraq, just as I vehemently oppose the disgraceful accommodation of US armed forces at Shannon by the Irish Government. Prime Minister Howard should be advised clearly of our views.</P>
    <P>Last week, a committee of the D&aacute;il accommodated the presence and participation of a visiting EU Commissioner, an unelected voice of the European Union. Next Tuesday, we will hear an address by Mr. John Howard, the Prime Minister of Australia. Both of these events have been and will be facilitated and supported by the leaders of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties. When will these two parties recognise the insult they have delivered to over 1.5 million of our fellow Irish citizens in the Six Counties whose chosen Members of Parliament they have blocked from receiving the same accommodation, a committee of the whole D&aacute;il, as was accorded to Commissioner Fischer Boel? There are real issues to be addressed in the context of both of these visits.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Australian Prime Minister, Mr. Howard, is not welcome in Ireland. Prime Minister Howard is a warmonger, complicit with Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair in the criminal invasion of Iraq and compliant with the ongoing occupation of Iraq, with Australian troops in that country. Prime Minister Howard is the author of vicious, anti-trade union legislation designed to strip away workers&rsquo; rights which were hard won by the Australian working class over many generations. During the Australian general election of 2001, in order to win votes from an entrenched bigoted minority, Prime Minister Howard pedalled the monstrous falsehood that desperate refugees fleeing Iraq had thrown their children <Col N="1638"/>over the side of a ship as they were prevented from landing in Australia by the Australian navy. When it was proved that this was a vicious lie, he did not retract it or apologise.</P>
    <P>Every day the Australian Government steals &euro;1 million worth of oil and gas from the Timor Sea, resources that by international law belong to East Timor. The unfortunate Timorese people live in abject poverty while their resources are stolen by the Australian Government. Not too many generations ago, an imperial power sent thousands of Irish people in chains to Australia after waging war against them, robbing their resources and telling the world of that time that they were savages. With Prime Minister Howard at its head, the Australian Government, now acting as a local imperial power, is replicating these injustices against the poorest people on earth.</P>
    <P>The noted Australian folk hero, Ned Kelly, in his famous Jerilderie letter, railed against the repression of the poor by the powerful and the rich. I believe that is also the instinct of the Australian working class, one of the reasons Ned Kelly is held in fond memory. I do not know what he would say today with regard to Mr. Howard coming to this House given what he had to say about those in authority who repressed and brutalised his family and community. There should be a c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte roimh Australian people in Ireland but not the Prime Minister.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Australian Greens do not have a good relationship with Prime Minister John Howard. My Australian colleague, Senator Bob Brown, has been one of his harshest critics. Mr. Howard is on the same side as George W. Bush on a plethora of international issues. Australia has not signed up to the Kyoto Protocol even though global warming is one of the biggest challenges facing humanity. Mr. Howard has been a supporter of the Iraq war and while he said during the campaign that no further troops would be allocated to Iraq, that promise was broken. He claimed, together with George Bush and Tony Blair, that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, which of course turned out to be a lie.</P>
    <P>This was not the first occasion where we saw Mr. Howard&rsquo;s tenuous relationship with the truth. The famous &ldquo;children overboard&rdquo; story also turned out to be a lie, which was unscrupulously exploited during a campaign to make people fearful about what was perceived as an invasion by foreigners.</P>
    <P>He also has a poor relationship with the gay community in Australia.</P>
    <P>In November of last year, he tried to introduce the anti-terrorism Bill, again stoking fears, and a number of raids were made on houses throughout Melbourne and Sydney. As the Greens said on that occasion, this showed anti-terrorism legislation was not required because sufficient powers existed in any event to perform raids and so forth. Others have alluded to his total contempt for the <Col N="1639"/>trade union movement which has resulted in approximately 560,000 people demonstrating on Australia&rsquo;s streets in protest against many of the legislative proposals Mr. Howard is introducing.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Mr. Howard is a neo-liberal who, I believe, is changing the world for the worse. I would certainly like the opportunity, as would my party leader, Deputy Sargent, to articulate some of our concerns to him. We will not get that opportunity but we will be happy to sit here and listen to what he has to say. However, as far as his politics are concerned, we in the Green Party are very critical of the man.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy"><NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this Bill. It is a topical issue, as we have already heard with references to the price of petrol in the House this morning. The Bill will address all-Ireland markets, electricity interconnection, gas and electrical safety, full gas market opening, greater powers of policy direction for the regulator and safety measures.</P><Col N="1640"/>
    <P>With the rapidly changing situation in China and former Soviet states, and the general problem of diminishing supplies of oil and gas, it is important that all energy users examine their own use of fuels and that we examine in a logical fashion with the national interest to the fore all possible sources of energy.</P>
    <P>Without wishing to interfere, the difficulties that have arisen in Mayo concern me. In the past, we found offshore gas fields at Kinsale and managed the supply and use of that gas and I welcome the renewed interest in offshore exploration by a number of companies. People who claim we should spend money on exploration ourselves, however, are asking us to do much the same as putting the State&rsquo;s money on a horse. Oil and gas exploration are among the costliest commercial exercises in any area and we do not have the wherewithal to get involved directly with them. It is easy after the event to say how much a company has made from a find but the exploration costs show that we would not have been able to get involved.</P>
    <P>We begin to appreciate the value of any commodity at a time of shortage, we never miss the water until the well runs dry. At a time of shortage we get the best proposals for alternatives. During the last major shortage, there was action on combined heat and power projects and it is a pity we grew lazy. I recall a combined ESB and Bord G&aacute;is heat and power project in Cork University Hospital. I would have seen those groups as competitors in the past but they got together and did a good job that repaid the money invested in a short time.</P>
    <P>Energy conservation and the maximisation of our natural resources have never been so much in focus with the continuing fluctuation in the world&rsquo;s energy markets. There are increasing demands on fuel resources, the majority of which are totally outside our control. This need to develop an all-Ireland electricity market and liberalise the gas market demonstrates the importance of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill will allow for the all-Ireland approach. It is 16 years since we held discussions at the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body on a unified, all-island approach to energy supplies, particularly electricity and natural gas. We discussed the interconnector gas pipe from Scotland and a North-South electricity connector. The greatest impediment we faced was not engineering or commerce, but the real possibility of such links being blown up during or after construction. Thankfully we have moved from that situation to one where we can do what is needed for people North and South and, by working together, minimise the wholesale cost of electricity and offer alternative gas supplies. It will allow users to shop around and encourage value for money driven initiatives among energy providers. We saw the value of this approach in the telecoms market, with the increased competition and cheaper prices when the market was opened up.</P><Col N="1641"/>
    <P>The energy debate in Ireland is framed within the context of the need for a common European policy, availability of supply and the control of such supplies. Those are among the serious concerns being addressed by the Minister in this Bill. The recent stand-off between Russia and the Ukraine over gas supplies demonstrates the potential seriousness of this issue and shows how those with supplies can control matters for those who remain dependent on them.</P>
    <P>Under various sections of the Bill, the Commission for Energy Regulation will be equipped with increased powers. The independent regulatory body will play a significant role in implementing the provisions set out for the gas market and the facilitation of competition in the electricity market. The CER will be responsible for the registration of electrical contractors and gas installers and will be empowered to inspect works carried out by these registered members, review training procedures and suspend or revoke membership for unsafe or unsatisfactory work. It will also have greater powers in the area of public safety, an important aspect of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I recall the change-over in Cork city from household gas to natural gas. There were dangerous incidents, with footpaths glowing as a result of flames burning underneath because full engineering consideration had not been taken of the cleansing power of natural gas, which wiped away the old lagging used in lower specification household gas pipes. I am glad there is now total control over safety. The commission will have some say over the level of gas in the Mayo pipeline. We need a permanent, independent governing body to monitor such situations.</P>
    <P>The British and Irish Governments are committed to achieving a market that allows for mutual advantage in terms of pricing and security of supply. We must ask if the two energy markets on the island are better off operating as two small entities or should they come together and operate together. Many of us have argued for years that health, tourism, fisheries, agriculture and energy would benefit enormously from the latter approach. I co-chaired the interparliamentary committee which dealt with the energy issue in the early 1990s. It was obvious that great benefits could accrue from such co-operation. Studies would have been carried out for our benefit and we would have received information which was not released to the public. It showed how crazy the situation was, involving as it did the detouring of the gas interconnector, which involved putting elbows into it to take it away from the danger zone and moving it miles at considerable cost, as well as pylons which could not be constructed at the time. There are considerable benefits to be had from working closely on an all-island basis.</P>
    <P>Effectively, this Bill also means that domestic users of gas will benefit from the liberalisation of the market, which has, to date, been enjoyed solely by industrial and commercial agencies. I can draw on my previous experience in Irish Steel, which saved more than &pound;100,000 per week <Col N="1642"/>by simply shutting down for ten or 15 minutes by agreement with the ESB at a given time. This shows the type of benefits enjoyed by industry but not by ordinary households. The Bill also affords us a platform on which to look at the energy market in Ireland more closely and gives us a chance perhaps to widen the debate and look at alternative energy sources to counter our dependence on imports.</P>
    <P>One need only look outside the front door most days to realise the potential of wind power. Spain is an EU leader in this regard and if it can use wind power, we can certainly harness coastal wind power in a better fashion and utilise it more efficiently. Apart from being a more environmentally friendly way of providing energy, wind power would allow us to play to our natural strengths. We must examine, as a matter of urgency, the objections to wind farms to see what can be done to ensure there is no valid reason for people to object to them. Many issues, some of which arouse emotions, such as the future survival of a species of bird, have been drawn into the argument. Many of these arguments have not been tested but we must test them to find out whether there are valid objections to wind farms.</P>
    <P>Biomass, energy crops and tidal power are also alternatives which we should actively examine and consider for our future needs. There is a tendency for some critics to ridicule any suggestions in that regard. They usually say that these sources could only supply a fraction of any power required but if this is the case, we should utilise every possible source and unit of power to lower our dependence on other suppliers. These small numbers of units will mount up if they are properly utilised and put together.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Some years back, Cork City Council harnessed the outlet of methane gas from the former landfill site at Kinsale Road. This source now supplies the equivalent of the needs of approximately 1,500 houses. It is an old question as to whether we wait to curse the darkness or work to gain that one candlewatt of power. When looking for alternative sources of energy, we should concentrate on our strengths, whether they are the sources to which I have referred or any alternatives available to us.</P>
    <P>When it comes to alternatives, some sectors are adding fuel to the fire by talking up the potential of nuclear energy. The fact that this year we are commemorating the 20th anniversary of the worst ever nuclear disaster in Chernobyl in 1986 means we should tread carefully in this regard. We should bear in mind that the Government is also battling to close down the reprocessing plant at Sellafield which itself has plans for expansion. Nuclear power does not appear to be the logical way forward and if we work hard at our alternatives, it should not be necessary.</P>
    <P>People are now much more aware of their responsibilities towards the environment. This awareness is obvious from the high take-up of recycling and other such waste management schemes. There is also a growing consciousness of <Col N="1643"/>the need to be more efficient when it comes to the whole spectrum of energy sources, such as gas, oil, electricity or coal, which is why alternatives should be examined in the same way that recycling has overtaken landfill as the preferred way of dealing with waste.</P>
    <P>One alternative which has become caught up in the question of large-scale incinerators is the option of converting waste to energy. Individuals who mention this option are almost demonised. Commentators, some of whom do not appear to be very knowledgeable about the issue, tell us that it would be an environmental disaster if any waste were to be burned. I admit to having a limited knowledge of the environmental and engineering aspects of the topic, although I worked for 20 years in steel-making which involved using the largest ever incinerators. However, I would not set myself up as an expert on the topic. I have tried to talk people down in respect of it.</P>
    <P>I was interested to read in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> last week that Matt Murphy, of Sherkin Island fame, suggested such a course of action. I understand that he was not referring to massive multi-thousand tonne incinerators but that he believes there is room for waste-to-power projects. Of all of the commentators I have listened to or read on environmental matters, Matt Murphy is the one to whom I would listen most carefully. In addition to his excellent work at the Sherkin Island Marine Centre, Mr. Murphy was caring for our environment long before it became a popular topic. Those who would question the motivation or integrity of the rest of us would do well to listen to him when he puts forward such a suggestion and listen to his views on the subject. All his life, he has been willing to walk the walk rather merely talk the talk in respect of the environment. His commitment to the environment is legendary and his work speaks for itself. He is politically unbiased. When he gives an opinion on an environmental issue, it behoves people to listen to him.</P>
    <P>I briefly discussed the topic with him at a social occasion and following the publication of his comments in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>. He told me of his grave concerns about the cost of transferring waste paper and other materials and the mountain of material on our hands and of his belief that there is room for a waste-to-energy facility and outlet in this country.</P>
    <P>This issue should be teased out and discussed, particularly in view of Mr. Murphy&rsquo;s comments on it. He has never been known for floating topics simply to get a newspaper headline. He has always examined issues in depth. He believes the present method of recycling is unsustainable. The costs involved in transporting material, the considerable storage problems, the continued need to put much of the residue into landfill and the fact that the mountain of material now finds fewer sources for alternative use must be examined. We need an honest and open debate on the issue. There is a considerable range of possibilit<Col N="1644"/>ies but we must be honest about it and address any difficulties which arise.</P>
    <P Just="Left">It is easy to oppose everything but we must be honest about this issue. It is far better to examine any problems associated with recycling and related energy issues before they become insurmountable rather than ignore them on a point of principle. I stress that most Members from all parties in this House are opposed to super incinerators and super landfill sites. However, we must examine this question and some of our current practices.</P>
    <P>On 4 April 2006, Forf&aacute;s launched its oil dependency study. This is a baseline assessment of Ireland&rsquo;s oil dependency and key policy considerations in this regard. To put it bluntly, the report makes frightening reading. Ireland is one of the largest users of oil <i>per capita</i> in Europe. Obviously, it does not have any independent supplies and, as an island, must transport all its oil. I was involved in the construction of the original refinery in Whitegate and continued to take an interest in it. However, we do not appear to support early initiatives. We need to think 20 years ahead, an approach taken by the Minister in this Bill and in respect of this issue. The Minister has been willing to stand up and say what he believes is right rather than what is popular. It is essential that the Government does this. If I were in Opposition, I would take a different tack on various subjects and might take the populist route rather that the accurate or futuristic route. We must be honest about our needs and what we are doing. The Bill relates to one niche in the market and will stabilise some of the situations with which we have been dealing. I hope a better future in respect of energy will arise from this debate.</P>

	<P>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm deis a fh&aacute;il<?oasys _jy ?>labhairt ar an mBille Fuinnimh (For&aacute;lacha Ilghn&eacute;itheacha) 2006. Ba mhaith liom mo chuid ama a roinnt le mo chara, an Teachta Gogarty.</P>
    <P>Is ceart f&eacute;achaint siar agus ansin chun cinn. For many years, we have known about the limitations of the types of energy we use. Media reports date back decades and 1973 was the start of a real debate on the finite nature of the energy sources on which we depend. The significant increase in demand corresponds to some extent with population increases. Between 1860 and 1991, the world&rsquo;s population increased by a factor of four but the use of inanimate energy increased by a factor of 93. This is unsustainable and the issue must be dealt with.</P>
    <P>It is neither popular nor politically expedient to set out all of the answers but it must be done. If this case is to be argued, skilful political debate is required because we are discussing the future well-being as well as the current well-being of people living on this planet. While the extraction of crude oil has doubled in each decade, the basic understanding of what needs to be done requires more education and energy literacy instead of technology. My colleague, Deputy Gogarty, is the Green Party&rsquo;s education spokesperson and has <Col N="1645"/>regularly spoken about literacy but energy literacy is not prominent in our education system. We are busy getting the other types of literacy up to standard. However, energy literacy is becoming more important.</P>
    <P>This is a considerable issue. The earth is nearly 5 billion years old. In that time, solar energy has beamed down irrespective of whether it was used by or suited people when they came along. It has been trapped in some ideal conditions. Today, we use it as oil, coal and gas. Effectively, a large battery or storehouse of solar energy has beamed down over millions of years. If we believe we can replace this accumulated store of energy with oilseed rape, windmills or the other 21 types of renewable energy technology available, there is a fundamental mismatch in our mathematics. That intense energy, which we use as oil or kerosene to get large aeroplanes into the air, has accumulated over millions of years.</P>
    <P>Unless we wait another several millions years for more to accumulate, we must change our way of living. However, we have engaged in an orgy of energy use. The fact that the energy was there and will remain for a time, albeit in increasingly small amounts, has produced an addiction to its consumption. We have taken it for granted. This is the problem that politics must face. Partly due to energy illiteracy, the denial of this addiction, which is known as agnosia in terms of people who suffer strokes but do not recognise their symptoms, is a problem.</P>
    <P>We find ourselves listening to debates on nuclear energy and statements to the effect that it will still our addiction and help us along. However, the supply of uranium, on which nuclear energy depends, is also finite. People say that it can be reprocessed, but this leads to the additional problem of significant waste in liquid form. Not only the current generation must deal with it, as it has a half life of 250,000 years. What type of legacy is this? Where is the morality and what can be said to justify that legacy? It is deeply selfish to consider it as an option. It will not even address our energy needs in terms of transport, our fastest growing energy demand sector. Significant costs in terms of waste, security, construction, the transportation of nuclear material, decommissioning and insurance &mdash; as Deputy Dennehy mentioned, this might mean the cost of accidents such as occurred at Chernobyl &mdash; make this option unaffordable and immoral irrespective of its environmental impact or the effects of radiation, such as cancer.</P>
    <P>We have a choice. Do we use money to go down that dangerous and expensive road or do we spend it more cost effectively on insulation? I am proud to say that my area&rsquo;s local authority has been leading the national debate on energy insulation and has doubled the number of new energy efficient houses in its development plan. It has passed the point that Sustainable Energy Ireland believed we could reach. I am beginning to sound like the introduction to a &ldquo;Star Trek&rdquo; film.</P><Col N="1646"/>
    <P>Fingal County Council is pushing the frontier in terms of energy insulation by requiring a 30% renewable energy component in new housing in Balbriggan north-west, Ballymun and other areas. The Minister has acknowledged this requirement, which should be replicated around the country. That is beginning to be the case but it should be done as the norm rather than as the exception. It highlights the fact that we must plan for a post-oil economy. For example, every roof space should have solar panels and every house should have maximum insulation.</P>
    <P>The Bill addresses the powers of the Commission for Electricity Regulation, but that is only a small element in facing our energy challenges. The situation must change. It is interesting to read in <i>New Scientist</i> and other scientific journals that if we were to burn all of our current energy resources, there would be a climate change of disastrous proportions. It is not a matter of finding the last drop, as Deputy Dennehy said. From the points of view of world security and health we cannot afford to burn that last drop.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The Green Party has tried to get all parties to work in the same way as social partnership. This matter goes beyond the term of a single Government and ensures that we set ourselves the targets that 50% of all of our energy will be derived from non-fossil fuel sources by 2020, which could be made more achievable through reducing energy demands, and that we should be totally oil-free by 2050. As the situation will grow worse, I hope we do not wait that long before reaching that target. Sweden has aimed for 2020 in this respect.</P>
    <P>These targets are not overly ambitious. Rather, we are trying to be realistic, pragmatic, scientific and responsible in our long-term planning. As a country we are becoming less competitive and one of the main reasons for this is our 90% dependency on imported energy. That has to change.</P>
    <P>We cannot wait for the oil to run out. The permafrost in Siberia is melting, releasing enormous amounts of methane, which is 20% more powerful than carbon dioxide. The Gulf stream has slowed down by 30% in the past 50 years. The warning signs are already clear. We must create a solar society and communities where people walk and are not oil dependent. We must also develop clean energy sources, intermediate technologies during the transition from fossil fuel use and reusable energy resources.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;waste to energy&rdquo; tag is used in an attempt to sanitise incineration and make it more acceptable to people. However, people in the recycling industry are aghast that the tag is not challenged in trade description. If one was serious about generating energy from waste, one would re-use the material rather than burn it. Once it is burnt, it must be replaced. It takes twice as much energy to replace PET plastic, for example, as is generated from burning it. In that sense, one is wasting energy by burning waste material. It is a lazy, stone-age methodology and no matter how many<?oasys _jy ?><Col N="1647"/><?oasys _fp ?><?oasys _cl11.2- ?>bells, whistles or filters on an incinerator, it is essentially a method of waste disposal that should have gone out with the Ark. We must be serious about energy literacy so that we are not using terms like &ldquo;waste to energy&rdquo; when we mean &ldquo;waste of energy&rdquo; and that argument stands up to scrutiny.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate that today we are dealing with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, every Department must become involved in this area. The agriculture and education sectors, the health sector in terms of the energy we use in our hospitals, for example, will be affected by high energy costs. I urge the Minister to develop a cross-departmental approach, similar to what is happening in Sweden and, as a former Minister with responsibility for the environment to encourage all local authorities to adopt the same standards as those set by Fingal County Council.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>My party leader and Deputy Eamon Ryan have eloquently and cogently outlined the energy crisis and the lack of a meaningful response from the Government. I will focus on the issue of gas safety, which I have raised in this House before. I welcomed the statement on 3 February 2005 by the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen that the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill would deal with all of the safety issues. However, having studied the legislation, I see that this is not the case.</P>
    <P>There are sections of the Bill which I welcome because they will go some way towards improving the situation with regard to gas safety from now on. Section 11, which proposes to insert the new sections 9F to 9K, inclusive, in the 1999 Act, provides for a fine of &euro;5,000 for a person who is not a registered gas installer or, on conviction on indictment, a fine not exceeding &euro;15,000 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding three years. I welcome this because it sends out the message that cowboys will not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the issue of the discharge of duties. Under the proposed new section 9K, the commission &ldquo;may appoint persons to be gas safety officers&rdquo; for various purposes. I hope the Minister will consider replacing &ldquo;may&rdquo; with &ldquo;will&rdquo; or &ldquo;shall&rdquo; because it is important that gas safety officers are appointed. We also need to know how many such officers will be appointed and the funding that will be provided to allow them to discharge their duties. Otherwise, the situation will be similar to that pertaining to the Department of Education and Science, where an Educational Welfare Board is in place but only a fraction of its staff are working on the ground, discharging the board&rsquo;s statutory remit. We must ensure that if rules, regulations and strict fines are in place, we have the required number of personnel to tackle the cowboy operators. There is no evidence in this Bill that this will be the case. Giving powers to commissions allows Ministers to <Col N="1648"/>pass the buck in terms of answering questions in the D&aacute;il. If I ask the Minister a question in the future on gas safety, he will say it is a matter for the commission. As an elected representative, I have no way of influencing a commission so the legislation enacted must enable me and other Members of the Oireachtas to raise with the Minister issues relating to how operations on the ground are progressing.</P>
    <P>I was thrown out of this House on a previous occasion when I raised the issue of gas safety. The proposed new section 9H states that &ldquo;The Commission, having consulted with such persons as it considers appropriate, and with the consent of the Minister, may by regulations designate a class or classes of gas works to be designated gas works&rdquo;. Again, the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; should be replaced by &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. I hope the commission and the Minister will make sure that a triple lock mechanism is put in place to ensure that any cowboys are dealt with from now on. However, I am more concerned about the cowboys who have been operating up to now. As I have argued before, and my comments during the adjournment debate on 2 March this year were accidentally misrepresented, the Government must order a nationwide audit of domestic gas installations from meter to house. This is necessary because a considerable number of gas installations do not conform to IS 813, which clearly states that the gas pipe must be properly insulated, both inside and outside the house. Such insulation has not happened and is still not happening. I have been informed that there are gas installation works currently under way in a housing development at City West where the proper insulation standards are not being met. Some operators may not be adhering to the standards through ignorance, but ignorance is no excuse.</P>
    <P>When I raised this issue on 2 March, the response from the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment was that &ldquo;the Minister has been advised by the Department&rsquo;s chief technical adviser and by Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann that as the pipeline contains gas, not a liquid, there is no requirement for thermal insulation on any pipe work from the meter to the House&rdquo;. That advice directly contravenes IS 813, which states that insulation from the meter to the house and within the house is required.</P>
    <P>Most types of concrete will eventually corrode a gas pipe and nobody has ever denied that fact. Representatives of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann said on TV 3 that this might only happen to a small number of pipes. No one, either inside or outside the House, has ever shown me scientific proof that concrete does not corrode the copper in gas pipes. There are tens of thousands of houses that are not properly insulated to IS 813. Some of the pipe work will eventually corrode. Some people will be lucky and that will not happen, but it is a lottery of life and death. Some of the pipes will corrode and when they do, the gas will escape <Col N="1649"/>and find the quickest way to the surface. If it is outside, the gas will travel under the concrete and may end up inside the house. If it is already in the house, it will build up to a certain quantity and if the oxygen content in the air is at the correct level, the gas will explode.</P>
    <P>If the provisions in the current Bill are implemented properly, the Minister may stop the cowboys in the developments that are taking place right now, but what does he intend to do about the houses that have already been built, where the gas pipes are not insulated? I have called for a nationwide audit so that every householder knows what the situation is with regard to the gas installation in his or her house. Even if this was only done on the pipe work from the meter to the house, that would be a step in the right direction with regard to safety. Otherwise, perhaps in five years&rsquo; time in an older house, someone will burn to death in an explosion caused by leaking gas. If the Minister does nothing, it will be his and the Government&rsquo;s responsibility because they are supposed to tell Bord G&aacute;is to implement the regulations and, if there is a problem, to deal with it. It may try to hide it and the issue has not been covered by the media for whatever reason but scientific evidence shows that concrete corrodes gas pipes and that gas pipes are not installed with the proper insulation. I hope it is not the case that someone will die and that, instead, the Government will take cognisance of the threat to people.</P>

	<P>On a point of information, the Deputy mentioned a response given to an Adjournment matter he raised may have been inadvertently misleading. I acknowledge the fact there was a misunderstanding about the terms of the Private Members&rsquo; motion and I will ask people to correspond directly with the Deputy to correct it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Bill. It also gives Members an opportunity to speak on the broader issues of energy, conservation and how we progress as a nation. Interest is shown by the number of speakers on the Bill. Many people alluded to the problems this country and the world will face in years to come because of our dependence on fossil fuels.</P>
    <P>While I acknowledge the major concern which now exists, much of it is driven by financial reasons and the fact that the price of oil has substantially increased in recent times. It seems like it is set on an upward trend. That has concentrated people&rsquo;s minds which, in itself, is positive because at least it encourages people to examine alternative ways of addressing the future energy crisis.</P>
    <P>Ireland has probably been very slow in understanding the need to move away from fossil fuels and our dependency on imports of oil and gas. Our consumption <i>per capita</i> would be judged as <Col N="1650"/>very dependent. We provided for hydroelectricity at an early stage of the State&rsquo;s existence, but we seemed to stop and gave no further consideration to innovative ways of delivering energy to the people other than importing oil without addressing other issues.</P>
    <P>I must pose a question on energy consumption. If we oppose nuclear energy on moral and ethical grounds, is it right for us to import electricity generated in nuclear stations in other European countries? As a country, we highlighted our view that nuclear energy could impact on mankind for generations to come. However, we are willing to sit at home by our electric heaters and watch our televisions possibly using energy produced in a nuclear station in another part of Europe.</P>
    <P>It is the same ethical principle as the arms trade. A neutral country which condemns the arms trade should not allow any company based in the country to get involved in that activity. A recent report recommended that Ireland should examine a nuclear option to address what will happen because of the future shortage of fossil fuels. We should debate that. Years ago we protested in Carnsore Point when it was proposed that we place a nuclear plant there. There is a strong feeling that we should not engage in nuclear power. We should debate whether it is ethically or morally right to purchase electricity. The liberalisation of the electricity market in Europe is becoming a very pertinent issue. While we condemn nuclear power out of hand, we are happy to use the energy from it generated in other countries.</P>
    <P>This country has a great opportunity to develop wind energy, wave energy, solar power, biofuels and biomass. We have the innovation and we have built up an entrepreneurial instinct to come up with innovative ideas on the provision of alternative energies. Encouraging innovation needs assistance from the State on a number of fronts, such as tax exemptions or reliefs. We have major potential for wave and wind energy.</P>
    <P>Regarding wind energy, we have a dilemma in that while it is positive from a position of protecting the environment from global warming, windmills and turbines have a visual impact on communities and scenery. Most wind energy projects seek planning permission in scenic areas on the western seaboard in high ridge mountainous areas. Guidelines and guidance must be brought forward on how one applies for planning permission for windmills and turbines. This should be given to local authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la. One regularly reads in newspapers that an application for a windmill or a wind farm has been rejected by a local authority or an appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la has been turned down.</P>
    <P>If we keep turning down applications and do not allow wind energy to become part of the solution to the problem we face, it creates a poor base from which to start. We must have real debate on how we provide alternatives. I am sure if applications were made for wave and tidal <Col N="1651"/>energy, we would have similar difficulties. That refusal saps people&rsquo;s abilities to develop wind energy farms. I am not sure whether they must be placed on high ridges on the seaboard. In other countries they also seem to be near the coast.</P>
    <P>We could come up with imaginative ideas which would protect us from our dependence on fossil fuels and, as important, protect the scenic amenities of the areas in which they are developed. The councils do not have the expertise or intimate knowledge to adjudicate on planning applications for large-scale wind energy farms as many planners deal with normal planning applications. Perhaps this could be included in the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Bill in terms of a certain number of turbines.</P>
    <P>We should be able to exploit wind energy but it does not seem to be getting off the ground as quickly as we would like. Much of it is owing to difficulties and objections at planning stage. I understand why people object. However, if we are to progress, we must have clear guidance. Perhaps if this debate leads to further debate, guidelines will be drawn up and local authorities will be instructed on how to approach them. If it is Government policy, An Bord Plean&aacute;la should be encouraged to support applications. We must also have balance with the sensitivity of scenic areas.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>Previous speakers referred to solar power. I recently built a house and I must confess the only action I took to address dependence on fossil fuels was to ensure it had good insulation. Other than that, the traditional oil burner went into the garage and the traditional radiators went into the house. Local authorities should give thought to encourage the examination during the planning process of alternatives such as solar panelling on roofs and wood burning. A person submitting a planning application could be asked whether he or she is considering solar panelling, wood burning or other alternatives which are not fossil fuel dependent. That would at least make people aware. Often when people are building a house, they may be more concerned about their mortgage or the spiralling running costs that could come about. Long-term planning of how to heat the house and water may be far down the list of priorities. There could be some encouragement in the planning process for people to examine that option, and architectural and engineering firms have a role to play as well. The issue should be to the fore in the initial stages of planning a house or a scheme of houses.</P>
    <P>Huge building projects are taking place with 80,000 units being built per year. Houses powered with solar energy or which have energy-saving measures built into them are few and far between, if one discounts the regulations they are obliged to meet anyway. The Minister has recently announced grants relating to greener homes, which is welcome. The issue should be <Col N="1652"/>encouraged. With many people, the priority is to construct the house and they may be struggling through a planning permission process which is laborious and tedious. They may be facing a big mortgage. and the idea of energy-efficient housing is far down the list of priorities.</P>
    <P>The all-Ireland energy market is an area relating to issues such as the Good Friday Agreement and the need for cross-Border co-operation. We spoke of key areas, such as agriculture, tourism and infrastructural development, in that respect. Energy would clearly be a high priority. As time goes on, the liberalisation of the markets can only be beneficial to the consumer and it will ensure we are a cost-efficient economy. It will ensure we do not have spiralling fuel costs other than normal global rises. There would be no inhibiting factors in ensuring that we could get gas and electricity at the most cost-effective price possible in the open market. This has been a positive step and I commend the Minister on bringing this Bill forward and ensuring that we set up a commission to adjudicate on these matters.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to biofuels, an issue on which there has been much discussion in recent times. It was brought to the fore recently as a result of the closure of the Mallow sugar beet factory in County Cork. The question has arisen of whether beet can be converted into biofuels. I have a cutting from an interesting newspaper article from Spain entitled &ldquo;Deadline is near for bioethanol wheat contracts&rdquo;. A Spanish company is producing bioethanol from wheat.</P>
    <P>I have done some research on the Internet and spoken to some people who have a greater knowledge of biofuels than I. We should explore the use of crops such as wheat, oilseed rape and potatoes in this manner. We know definitively that we will run out of fossil fuels. If we had the foresight of knowing we were going to have a vibrant economy with large budget surpluses, we may have started our infrastructural development some years earlier than we did. Now we are trying to play catch-up.</P>
    <P>With regard to future generations, we must become innovative and encourage the idea of biofuels. There are large tracts of land which are under-utilised because of surpluses and quota restrictions, etc. This is a key area which we should consider. The company in Spain, Abengoa, is even importing wheat for this purpose. It has been looking to the UK for wheat growers.</P>
    <P>We must explore the area of biofuels, and I know the Minister is supportive of this and there is goodwill towards the issue. Any difficulties and obstacles to progress in the area should be lifted as quickly as possible to allow innovation and allow such fuels to become cost-effective. Speaking to people who are trying to develop biofuels, the biggest problem appears to be the economies of scale. These people need to reach a certain economy of scale whereby the producers can become cost-efficient and profitable in providing alternatives to fossil fuels.</P><Col N="1653"/>
    <P>Bus companies, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and others, such as local authorities with large fleets of vans and trucks for carrying out work, should be encouraged to use biofuels. Dublin Bus, for example, belches out fumes on a daily basis in the inner city. These key areas, where it is known that a certain amount of fuel had to be delivered to Dublin Bus or Cork County Council, for example, should be considered. These bodies could become innovative, investing their money and knowing that at least they have a good chance of getting a contract. They could reap rewards on their investment.</P>
    <P>That is a difficulty at the current time. There is no point in discussing the matter unless we can get those economies of scale. Currently we have people scratching at the surface trying to develop the area but still caught because they cannot get companies to take on biofuels on a long-term basis. Cork City Council has been innovative in that area, and the park and ride buses which Bus &Eacute;ireann runs for the local authority are run on biofuels. This is a positive step, although it is only a few buses. It is a start, but we must be really imaginative in encouraging local authorities and bus companies to use biofuels. Obstacles should be removed.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Bill, previous speakers have mentioned the need to ensure safety in the provision of services, which is important. This Bill deals with certain aspects of that matter. While we have a liberalisation of the market, it is equally important to have a system in place which can monitor and ensure works carried out, with electricity or gas installations, for example, comply with certain safety standards. I am sure the Minister, those who drafted the Bill and everybody else involved knows this as an issue of concern. We do not want to alarm people, but the issue of safety should always be to the fore.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House. It is clearly necessary in the context of what is taking place in Europe and the liberalisation of the electricity market in 2007. It is time for us to consider our dependence, as a nation, on fossil fuels and imports of oil. We may be hoping that, next week or next month, there will be news of a discovery of a huge oil field in some part of the world and that oil reserves will be there for another five, six or ten years, meaning there is no immediate need to switch to other fuels. That is just prolonging the agony in a way. If we are to be innovative and have a hands-on approach, we should begin to encourage the use of alternative resources.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the issue of nuclear power earlier in the context of morals and ethics. We should have a debate on it. Many people speak emotively on the issue because of what happened in Chernobyl and as a result of the strong commitment we have had since the protests at Carnsore Point in the 1970s. We should find out more about the issue so that we can inform people about the concerns and have an informed debate. I am not stating I am in favour of nuclear power, <Col N="1654"/>as I have already highlighted ethical issues relating to its use.</P>
    <P>An informed debate would also be welcome with regard to incineration. Incineration is often debated in an emotive way, and emotions can sometimes be irrational. We should have a genuine and informed debate on the matter. I support the principle of incineration because I do not believe that we can, as a country, continue to export waste to other countries. Following the polluter pays principle, we should deal with our waste. I am concerned that incinerators encourage people to burn waste that is eminently recyclable. I worry that, rather than reusing and recycling, people will go back to throwing everything in the bin to be incinerated. I ask the Minister to avoid feeding the monster of incineration, as has happened in other countries, at the expense of recycling, where people separate their waste into two or three bins to leave out on different days for the local authority or private collectors. Incineration is not designed to allow people to throw everything in the bin, eventually to go up the chimney. It should be used sparingly and only for waste that cannot be reused or recycled.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House. I know the Minister is committed to biofuels and other alternative energy sources and that over the next year or two some guidelines will emerge on the issues to which I have referred, particularly on wind energy.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Like previous speakers I welcome this Bill and I am delighted to have the opportunity to make some points on the subject of energy. I welcome the main provisions of the Bill &mdash; to expand the functions of the Commission for Energy Regulation and to underpin its work on an all-Ireland energy market. There should be far more co-operation between both sides of this island and most of our policies should operate on a 32-county basis.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the provision allowing emergency measures to be taken by ministerial order in the event of a sudden crisis in the energy market and the creation of an open gas market.</P>
    <P>I will reflect on a number of issues. First, the Fine Gael energy policy is set out in a national plan for alternative energy in the future. It was criticised by a number of people, including the Minister. Sometimes we are criticised when we do not bring forward a policy. Then when we do the policy is criticised. As somebody who has a deep interest in energy policy I have not seen many policies brought forward by parties in the past, apart from the Green Party, but the Fine Gael policy was comprehensive. Just because we are in Opposition we do not agree with everything the other Opposition parties bring forward. However, we recognise good elements that deserve to be adopted if they can be of use.</P>
    <P>The policy on biofuels should be taken seriously. With the diminishing role of agriculture <Col N="1655"/>and farmers leaving the land there is a major role for biofuels. For the first time the IFA is taking biofuels very seriously. The fact it meets with the Green Party on a regular basis to discuss energy policies reflects a major change in attitude on the part of the IFA toward that party. It is a new era and the proposals for biofuels in the Fine Gael policy warrant fair consideration.</P>
    <P>It also deals with energy in the home. Solar energy is not considered to the extent it should be in this country. My home town football club in Kerry decided to install solar panels to heat the water in the dressing room and they work very well. I am encouraged that a number of other clubs in Kerry have contacted me to find out how they work and how effective they are. I recently asked the Minister to include in the capital development programme for national lottery funding a provision for the installation of solar panels, as well as dressing rooms, lighting, pitch renewal etc. Because of the cost and our huge dependence on oil and the general cost of electricity, solar panels have the potential to reduce clubs&rsquo; energy bills. Perhaps the Minister will take the matter up with the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism with a view to securing grant aid for that purpose. Fine Gael proposes a number of grant incentives for people to install solar panels in houses.</P>
    <P>The use of turbines for domestic energy needs is a practical way forward but there is a problem obtaining planning permission. Recently a person from Holland, where they have wind turbines everywhere and make effective use of them, inquired as to the possibility of a wind turbine to meet his energy requirements. When I inquired of Kerry County Council, the planning section did not give an enthusiastic response, despite the fact it has a positive wind policy. County Kerry designated preferred areas for wind turbines before any other area. I was taken aback by that response and, as a result of that policy, very few houses in the whole of County Kerry use wind energy.</P>
    <P>The wind industry in Europe is currently worth approximately &euro;30 billion and produces over 30,000 MW of power. Ireland is one of Europe&rsquo;s windiest countries but our wind resources remain largely untapped, and are likely to remain so in the future. The wind resource in Ireland is the envy of Europe. Earlier speakers mentioned what has been done in Spain. If any Member visited the Canaries he or she would see wind turbines on all the islands. Even now they are locating them on the hills, having previously had an embargo in that regard. We have never grasped the advantage we have with our wind energy, nor capitalised on favourable wind speeds, as they have done in other European countries. One of the reasons for that is that we are still very dependent on coal and oil which are, in a sense, the easy options. Also, because we cannot store energy we cannot make use of surplus energy, which is why <Col N="1656"/>the interconnector is so important. What is the current position regarding the interconnector? Unless an interconnector is provided, Ireland will never be fully able to capitalise on its wind energy resource.</P>
    <P>I recently learned of a practical problem facing people involved in providing wind farms. The case in question concerned three farmers who propose to move into wind energy generation to earn additional income, as farmers are being encouraged to do. However, this is proving a difficult process. Having received planning permission and secured connection to the grid, which is fortunately close to them, the farmers in question are faced with the prospect of waiting for two years for the turbines to arrive. This is the waiting period for delivery of a turbine once an order has been placed, a long time given that technology and circumstances can change in the meantime. As the Minister is aware, an average turbine, which produces approximately 2.3 MW of electricity, costs roughly &euro;1.8 million. This is a major investment particularly as one quarter of the cost must be paid up-front and no income is generated for two years.</P>
    <P>Demand for turbines, which are manufactured in Germany and the Netherlands, is especially strong in the United States where all types of turbine are permitted. In Ireland, however, the rules appear to be more demanding in that only one turbine &mdash; a more sophisticated model &mdash; is compatible with the national grid. Has consideration been given to manufacturing turbines here to avoid the lengthy wait for delivery? Given that most products can be manufactured in Ireland and this country has a technological edge and several other advantages, we should be able to manufacture turbines. This question may not be directly related to the provisions of the Bill but Second Stage debate usually affords Deputies an opportunity to raise a wide range of issues. I ask the Minister to comment.</P>
    <P>As regards wind energy, I understand planning permission has been given for facilities that would produce approximately 4,000 MW of electricity and average daily requirement for wind energy is approximately 4,000 MW. Is it the case that any farmer, company or other individual or entity who decides to enter the wind energy market will not be permitted to develop a project until 2013 because the grid will not accept further wind energy resources until that year? How does the Minister, who will probably be replaced in his portfolio within a year, possibly by Deputy Durkan, expect the wind energy market to develop?</P>

   <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister will be aware, yesterday evening the ESB announced plans to close Tarbert Island power station. This came as a major shock to everyone concerned, partic<Col N="1657"/>ularly the plant&rsquo;s workforce, because it had earlier been proposed to make a major investment in the station which would guarantee its role in electricity production until at least 2015. For this reason, while I accept the need to reduce Ireland&rsquo;s dependency on oil, I question the decision to close down the facility. Tarbert Island power station has a generating capacity of 620 MW of oil fuelled power. Yesterday, for example, it produced 500 MW of power, while on Tuesday, working at full capacity, it produced 625 MW of power. The decision to close the plant, therefore, strikes me as strange. As the Bill provides that the Minister may take emergency measures by ministerial order in the event of a sudden crisis in the energy market, I ask him to take an interest in this decision.</P>
    <P Just="Left">To give a brief history of the electricity generation station at Tarbert, the ESB purchased the 65 acre site for an oil-fired power station in the 1960s. The choice of location was based on the availability of deep water facilities for off-loading fuel oil tankers and an abundant supply of cooling water. Oil tankers carrying more than 80,000 tonnes of fuel have unloaded at the ESB jetty in Tarbert, which has a storage capacity of 250,000 tonnes of fuel. Such reserves provide security against temporary disruption and contribute to the national strategic reserves. The site&rsquo;s other advantages include its connection to the grid, the availability of major infrastructure and the fact that it is one of the best sites for a power generating station in Europe. Will the Minister comment on the strange decision to close the facility?</P>
    <P>As a result of the closure of Tarbert Island power station, the locality will lose 129 jobs. While the employees concerned will be redeployed within the network, nevertheless the unit in which they work, which provides direct employment for 129 people, will be lost to the area which has experienced no State, semi-State or private development in recent years. Despite being acknowledged as one of the prime natural ports in Europe, the area has been largely neglected due to its lack of basic political clout &mdash; no representative from north Kerry has had ministerial responsibility for some time. In addition, as many as 200 people working with service providers, such as maintenance operations and suppliers of the restaurant, will also be affected by this highly questionable decision. I ask the Minister, who is in charge of the ESB, to review the company&rsquo;s decision and discuss it with a delegation from Tarbert as soon as possible with a view to finding a way forward. Failing a move to reverse the decision, Tarbert Island must be singled out for a new power station. Maybe that is what the ESB intends to do but we should hear the ESB&rsquo;s view on this matter. We have a prime site, strategically located with all the infrastructure in place, and with a connection to the national grid, which apparently represents 50% of the provision of a new station. It is in place with an abundant supply of water and is located <Col N="1658"/>in what could be the nerve centre of the future development of the mid-west region. A major review of this decision should be undertaken.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to make some points concerning wind energy, having been involved in such a project. The issue of biofuels is important for the agricultural industry, as is the question of solar panels, although we do not seem to have any policy to promote solar energy.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>The jolt of increased energy prices, whether gas or oil, in the past year has served to focus minds on the conservation and renewal of energy as well as examining new ways of producing it. The controversy surrounding gas supplies through Ukraine was a wake-up call for everybody, demonstrating how interdependent we all are when it comes to energy supplies. Deputy Deenihan referred to the ESB&rsquo;s decision on Tarbert but, according to the same report, the Ringsend power station in Dublin may face the same fate. We need to examine that matter.</P>
    <P>Yesterday&rsquo;s announcement by the British Prime Minister that he will pursue a nuclear energy policy with renewed vigour was unfortunate but he is free to make it. Given the renewed debate at national, European and international level, it is particularly appropriate that this Bill is being considered by the House. When enacted, the Bill will provide an important component in driving forward the Government&rsquo;s progressive energy agenda. In this context, I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister for introducing the Second Stage debate.</P>
    <P>At national level, we have been discussing the changing energy landscape internationally, including how to deal with the recent increases in oil prices, while striving to liberalise our national energy market. That will not be easily achieved and we should all be acutely aware that there will be winners and losers. Places like Tarbert could be among the losers.</P>
    <P>With regard to competition, I pay tribute to this Minister and previous Ministers for working towards a more liberal energy market to allow an opening up of competition. We have new independent power plants in Mulhuddart, Galway and Shannon. I can speak with some knowledge of the one operated by Viridian at Huntstown, which is a fine, modern plant producing an important component of electricity into the national grid. There has been progress but as the slogan put it, &ldquo;A lot done, more to do&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>At European level, there have been discussions on the need for a common European energy policy. The Bill is timely, given Europe&rsquo;s dependence on a small number of external suppliers and security of supply issues, such as occurred in Ukraine. Increasing demand on fuel resources and concerns about long-term availability of supplies are driving the need for consensus on a wide range of energy issues. There are two sides to the energy crisis coin: supply and consumption. If we consider that energy is at the core of any econ<Col N="1659"/>omy, being vital to the way people live and work, it is imperative to put in place the proper structures to manage both our supply and consumption of electricity. The challenge can be ascertained from thriving emerging economies such as China and India. Europe has been somewhat complacent about energy issues for quite some time. Although Ireland is not unique in this respect, we have certainly taken our eye off the ball in terms of seeking alternative sources of energy and have been over-reliant on traditional ones. I will revert to that point later.</P>
    <P>The Bill is significant in terms of energy supply and a key feature is a move towards all-island markets and electricity interconnections, which underscores the interdependency to which I referred. We must ensure that both economies on this island and all communities have access to safe, secure and sustainable energy supplies obtained through competitive energy markets. There is no doubt that this challenge can be met more effectively, and to our mutual benefit, if we work together. From my contacts with our parliamentary counterparts in Northern Ireland and Britain through the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, I know issues such as an all-island energy market and the need for proper interconnections have come to the fore. I envisage that body will play a proactive role in the ongoing debate.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that in the forthcoming national development plan there will be a concentration on all-island development, including all-island energy regulation and production. The Bill will provide a legal basis for the energy regulator, the Commission for Energy Regulation, to engage in the development of an all-island energy market. Such a project involves collaboration on issues ranging from improved interconnection, competitive markets and harmonised trading arrangements to generation adequacy, security of supply, sustainable energy and energy efficiency measures. No so long ago it was not possible to operate the famous interconnector linking North and South, but as a result of the peace process the facility is now functioning without fear of interruption. I hope supplies will never be interrupted again.</P>
    <P>A milestone date of 1 July 2007 for a single electricity market North and South has been established. There is a long way to go in terms of how the two regulatory frameworks, North and South, will marry. Fortunately, there is extensive and wholehearted support for the all-island energy market and this legislation marks another step in that process. I hope that when the Northern Assembly and executive are fully functioning, with North-South bodies, we will see a renewed effort in this area.</P>
    <P>The benefits of an all-island market are clear. This larger market will remove market distortions and minimise the wholesale cost of electricity. That is the objective which I hope will be <Col N="1660"/>achieved. There should be open and transparent competition at all levels and for all energy sources, including combined heat and power, and renewables. It will also mean a more stable and attractive investment location and provide a boost to the competitiveness of the wider industrial sector. There are times when we underestimate our capacity to avail of what is literally at our shores, doorsteps and mountain tops. I am referring to wave and wind power, to which I will revert later. Our natural gas and other resources should be fully explored and exploited. I compliment the Minister on his initiatives in this regard, including the current issue at Rossport in County Mayo. I hope that source of supply can be exploited safely and for the benefit of all, including the people of that hinterland, at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>The major test by which the value of an all-island market will be judged is that energy users throughout the 32 counties are better off than they would be in two smaller markets. Clearly, that is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>Another important aspect of the Bill is the redefinition of the energy regulator&rsquo;s role. At times, it seems the regulator&rsquo;s responsibilities have been in conflict with each other and the question is one of prioritising them. As a lay person, there have been times when I have not been clear about the regulator&rsquo;s policies and decisions. Unfortunately, until now, political direction could not be given. However, it is essential that there is political direction stemming from a coherent and agreed policy. The Bill allows for this.</P>
    <P>Accessing electricity and gas within more competitive markets is another facet of our energy supply policy. The Bill includes provisions enabling the Minister to introduce the full opening of the gas market by ministerial order. Benefits of liberalisation have previously been enjoyed by industrial and commercial consumers, a point that has been undersold. It is a few years since liberalisation was introduced. When one talks to significant employers throughout the country, they are very conscious of the benefits that have accrued to their companies from this new approach. The opening of the market has benefited customers by broadening customer choice and already some 42% of the market is supplied by independent suppliers.</P>
    <P>There is now scope for all customers, household and non-household alike, to seek out keener prices in the competitive market, which must be welcomed. While the process is more difficult than the telecoms industry shifting from one telecoms provider to another, nonetheless, a clear policy needs to be established by Ireland, on its own and within the European Union, to facilitate a greater level of competition leading to reduced prices in a more competitive market.</P>
    <P>As many speakers have noted, the dominance of the ESB is a major hurdle to true competition. The all-island market will deal to some extent with the dominance of the ESB, as will other sec<Col N="1661"/>tors of the market. I welcome that the Bill provides that some utility other than the ESB can provide interconnection facilities. It has been suggested the market is so small that there may not be a great take-up for this, but I do not agree. If there is the environment, the take-up will follow. Independent energy companies are keen to provide this and I hope the Minister will be favourably disposed towards it.</P>
    <P>We must take strong action and take care how we proceed on the question of dominance. Airtricity has indicated that the market is not viable and we must take its reservations seriously. The question of regulation, which changes so often, and the lack of a coherent policy make it difficult for companies to conduct business here, or so they suggest. I hope the Bill, by providing policy direction from the Minister, will facilitate progress in this area.</P>
    <P>Through rationalisation of functions in regulation and system operation, the Bill also aims to bring about more efficient and secure energy generation. In doing so, it will undoubtedly result in longer-term savings, including in rationalisation and consolidation.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes provisions to enhance further the safety of energy consumers and the public, ensuring Ireland continues to meet international best practice in respect of electrical and natural gas safety. When one considers the horrific incidents near Lagos in Nigeria last week, one realises how serious we need to be in terms of safety.</P>
    <P>The regulator has been given robust new safety functions which include the regulation of electrical contractors and natural gas installers. Considerable progress has been made in this area but further progress is necessary. Thankfully, we have passed the stage where we had a fair number of &mdash; I am sorry to use the phrase &mdash; cowboy operators in this area. I compliment organisations such as RECI which have done a great deal in the area of self-regulation of the electrical industry. The regulator has also been granted additional powers to ensure rigorous enforcement, including the power to designate safety supervisory bodies, as well to establish standards for training and registration, introduce certification schemes and prosecute rogue installers.</P>
    <P>In the current environment, where there is high employment and many new employees are coming to our shores to work, it is imperative the highest safety standards apply to all. If this necessitates the introduction of multilingual training and safety programmes such as those run by the Health and Safety Authority on construction sites, for example, that should be done. As that process has possibly begun, the House will forgive me if I refer to what is already happening.</P>
    <P>While the Bill will bring about very real and welcome benefits, it is certainly not the answer to all concerns surrounding the energy issue. For example, although we are making progress on improved energy supply in terms of electricity <Col N="1662"/>and gas, there has not been enough progress in the adoption of new technologies. We all realise that we will be playing catch-up. However, if we invest in a targeted way in research and development, we probably can catch up. The Institutes of Technology Bill which was before the House yesterday will enable the institutes of technology sector to become more engaged in research in that area. I realise they already have some involvement in this regard but the institutes are not a significant actor like the mainline universities. This research should be spread more widely into the institutes of technology sector.</P>
    <P>We have not provided enough encouragement to the wind energy sector. We often seem to be taking two steps forward and one step back in terms of encouragement and discouragement. I appeal to the Minister to do all he can to radically encourage a dramatic increase in supply from the wind energy sector. Today&rsquo;s weather forecast anticipates that there will be wind speeds in the region of 100 km/h before evening. Perhaps we should be battening down the hatches. I note that Deputy Durkan is already looking concerned about the prospect, although I do not want to be facetious. A resource is available and we ought to be able to exploit it. When one considers that the Danes produce approximately 20% of their energy requirements from wind energy, there is no reason Ireland cannot do the same.</P>
    <P>Another under-exploited area, given that the west has some of the most spectacular waves in the world, is that of generating energy from wave power.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are good at making waves also.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy can never resist the temptation to laugh at his own jokes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It would not be because of the material coming from the other side of the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>We should exploit the resources we have. While we are playing catch-up, let us try to make use of wind and wave power.</P>
    <P>Some of our problems in this area arise from the moratorium placed on the wind industry by the regulator in December 2004, the results of which we are only now experiencing. We need more radical proposals before the House to encourage not only wind energy but also the solar, ethanol and biofuel sectors. A caller to a radio programme this morning suggested he was interested in installing solar panels in his house but to buy two panels would cost &euro;4,000 and to install them would cost more. We need to consider new ways, and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Minister for Finance have&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>The grant is too small.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1663"/>
   <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>Grants are rarely the issue. Rather, it is the selling and marketing of the idea that is important.</P>
    <P>On the consumption side, we must continue to do more to reduce our dependence on natural fossil fuels. The Government is doing much in the competition sector but it needs to do more in the consumption area and needs to encourage, by subsidy or otherwise, the use and production of alternative fuels. Progress has been made in the past two years. Everybody from George Bush up, or down, depending on one&rsquo;s point of view, is proposing all sorts of plans to exploit renewables. More research should be carried out in this area. From my limited knowledge in this regard, I am not convinced, for example, that sugar beet can be exploited as a major provider of energy &mdash; I understand Fine Gael proposes this in its energy policy document.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>We do. However, inspiration from the other side of the House is sadly lacking.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>When ideas are brought forward, they should be well rehearsed because there is always a danger that we might rush in and suggest something that is not fully worked through. My understanding, from those who claim to know of these matters, is that the suggestion that sugar beet could be a significant provider of energy is exaggerated. I would not condemn anyone for suggesting the issue should be explored but we must seriously consider whether it is worth pursuing over a longer term.</P>
    <P>Some progress has been made in this area over the past two years. In 2004, the Minister for Finance introduced a relief from mineral tax on pilot projects producing biofuel and testing the technical viability of biofuel as a motor fuel. In the most recent Finance Bill the Minister significantly expanded this provision into a five-year scheme for mineral oil tax relief to commence in 2006 and end in 2010. This will cost approximately &euro;20 million this year, &euro;35 million next year and &euro;50 million in each of the following years. When fully operational, the relief scheme is expected to support the use and production in Ireland of about 163 million litres of biofuels per year.</P>
    <P>The developing world is ahead of us in exploiting alternative energy sources. Brazil plans to become self-sufficient in the biofuel sector within the next five years and African and Caribbean countries are seeking to exploit sugar cane as an alternative fuel source.</P>
    <P>Energy has shot to the top of the political agenda and will remain there for quite some time. Coherent energy policies are needed in Ireland and internationally. We have to develop innovative and efficient ways of developing new energy sources. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>Speaking on this Bill, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources stated: &ldquo;This is a key statutory initiat<Col N="1664"/>ive driving forward a progressive energy agenda against a backdrop of a new global energy landscape with increasing demands on fuel resources.&rdquo; According to an explanatory note from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, the intentions of the Bill are:</P>
    <P LI="1" FLI="0">to expand the functions of the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) to underpin its work on an all-island energy market;</P>
    <P LI="1" FLI="0">to remove a legislative constraint to facilitate regulated electricity interconnection not owned by ESB;</P>
    <P LI="1" FLI="0">to provide for the taking of emergency measures, by means of Ministerial Order, in the event of a sudden crisis in the energy market;</P>
    <P LI="1" FLI="0">to confer power on the Minister to issue policy directions to the CER;</P>
    <P LI="1" FLI="0">to provide for the regulation of the electrical contracting sector by the CER;</P>
    <P LI="1" FLI="0">to make provision in relation to gas safety in the context of the new multi-operator environment;</P>
    <P FLI="0">The Bill also provides for other technical measures pertaining, for example, to EU directives and the Electricity Regulation Act 1999. While these measures are welcome, the Bill is minimalist at best. We need robust policies if we are to challenge the current difficult energy environment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>That environment has not come about overnight but has developed over many years. We have become more conscious of the challenge because oil and gas prices have increased significantly in recent times and have put huge pressures on commerce and economies throughout the world. Oil now costs $70 per barrel and will probably remain at that price or even increase, a prospect which will not be easy to manage. The dispute between Russia and Ukraine over the cost of gas brought home to us our dependency on fossil fuels. We need to take a broader approach to conserving energy and making best use of our known and potential energy resources if we are to meet the demands made by the cost of energy.</P>
    <P>People of my age cannot easily accept that energy resources are finite and will not last forever. Some argue that more resources will be found or that the problem can be solved by means of interconnectors between North and South or between Ireland and the European Union, but that is not the case. Over the past century, the world&rsquo;s population has increased fourfold but energy consumption has increased one hundredfold. It will not be possible to continue to produce energy from a finite resource. As a matter of urgency, we should introduce energy <Col N="1665"/>modules into primary and secondary school curricula to ensure the population in generation and young people in particular are made aware of issues such as energy, conservation and environment.</P>
    <P>A number of countries have set targets for reducing the use of oil and one Nordic country, Sweden, expects to be 50% oil-free by 2020 and completely oil-free by 2050. Deputy Carey referred to other countries which are almost self-sufficient in terms of biofuel production. We should set similar targets to reduce our oil and gas usage, conserve energy and diversify energy sources.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>A number of energy sources were mentioned, including wind energy. I am surprised that a country like Ireland, which is surrounded by hills, has been slow in developing wind energy. Difficulties arise in respect of equipment, connections to the grid and the environment. Clearly, wind farms need to be sensitively built not to interfere with areas of natural beauty. However, they have the potential to grow and to give us a significant amount of energy in the future. They may also be a source of additional income to some farmers experiencing significant difficulties in terms of farm income. Wave energy should also be considered, given that we are an island nation, with seas all around our coast, and it has the potential to produce significant energy resources.</P>
    <P>The issue of nuclear energy and fuel has been put back on the agenda this week by the British Prime Minister. Nobody in this House believes we should pursue that option. It involves major initial cost and there is serious downstream difficulty with reprocessing uranium, while the pollution issue rules the option out. Safety is another issue and this year we have the 20th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster.</P>
    <P>We should look at biofuels. It has been mooted that the Mallow sugar plant, now closed, could be used for the production of ethanol. While it may not produce significant amounts of energy, in a situation of finite energy resources and major energy costs, every new process that produces even a small amount of energy should be looked at and welcomed as part of an energy strategy and policy, particularly for a country such as Ireland.</P>
    <P>In line with what I said earlier with regard to education, the energy question should be dealt with on a cross-departmental basis because it touches all Departments. All aspects of life, whether in the health or education services, roads or industry, are touched by the energy debate, energy resources and their cost. It is only by means of a cross-departmental approach that the real importance of the issue will be brought home, not just to us but to the country at large.</P>
    <P>In the event of this Bill passing, I hope we will not have a situation similar to that in many other areas, whereby the Minister of the day effectively evades his or her responsibility by referring all <Col N="1666"/>D&aacute;il questions and queries to the Commission for Energy Regulation. This is something we have most recently seen in the Health Service Executive and also with the National Roads Authority. Members of this House have found it impossible to get replies either from the Minister of the day or his or her Department with regard to those issues. I trust this will not happen in this instance.</P>
    <P>On the issue of insulation and conservation of energy, while I welcome the grants for solar panels and so on, as introduced recently by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, they are inadequate and must be increased significantly. Insulation and conservation of energy are issues which must be tackled urgently. The building regulations could be used to do this. We need at least twice if not three times the recognised level of insulation in our buildings. That should be introduced by means of building regulations. It has been done in a couple of local authority areas and it should be done countrywide. The only effective way to do that is to introduce it by way of regulation or legislation, whichever is the most appropriate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Second Stage debate on the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006. The Bill is comprehensive, dealing with a number of aspects of the energy sector. It provides for regulation on all-island markets, it deals with electricity interconnection, with gas and electrical safety, with the full opening of the gas market and the issues that arise from this. It also deals with the need for greater powers of policy direction for the regulator. A number of other emergency measures are provided for in the Bill. By any standards it is a comprehensive Bill and deserves a thorough debate in this House.</P>
    <P>It is timely that we are discussing energy matters generally in the House, as energy is fast becoming a major political and economic issue and is now on top of our agenda in this House and on top of the Government agenda. I say that because of a number of factors. There is the issue of ever-increasing oil and energy prices. Currently, a peak in oil production is forecast. We also have the issue of the Kyoto Protocol and the need to significantly reduce our carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions. As Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government, I am very conscious of that problem. It is an issue that is beginning to catch the public imagination. Certainly, business is now familiar with the obligations placed on it to adhere to the national allocation plan and our obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. There is also the global situation with regard to the exponential growth in demand from China, India and other dynamically growing economies. It is obvious, therefore, that a debate on energy regulation and energy supplies is overdue. We must deal with these major issues now.</P>
    <P>There has been much debate recently, and particularly this week, about nuclear power. The <Col N="1667"/>debate was initiated by the publication of a Forf&aacute;s report on energy and by developments in the United Kingdom, particularly remarks by the British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, in advance of a consultation process in the UK on energy needs. The British Prime Minister has put nuclear power firmly back on the agenda in the UK and has expressed the view that the nuclear option is the way to proceed, having regard to the issues I mentioned.</P>
    <P>We should reject many of the recommendations in the recent Forf&aacute;s report on energy. We should reject the tone it adopted in recommending that Ireland develop a nuclear energy strategy. The Government and the Minister are strongly opposed to nuclear power. A Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government introduced the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, which makes it illegal to produce nuclear energy in Ireland. Those who have suggested there are good economic or business grounds for pursuing the nuclear option need to look at the full picture.</P>
    <P>We cannot sacrifice the future of the environment for current electricity demand. Neither can we allow the debate on nuclear energy to be hijacked by concerns about global warming and energy supplies, despite the recent decision by the UK Government to reconsider building new nuclear power plants. There is no justification for the adoption of a nuclear energy policy. The industry carries with it serious environmental, nuclear proliferation and safety risks. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government visited the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant earlier this year and what the members witnessed there was uninspiring and certainly would not encourage those who suggest we should pursue a nuclear energy policy.</P>
    <P>It is the Government&rsquo;s duty to protect the health and well-being of its citizens. The introduction of nuclear power in Ireland would jeopardise this, despite the Forf&aacute;s recommendation. The Forf&aacute;s report ignores the real economic costs and the unsustainable environmental legacy for future generations. The solution would in the long run be worse than the problem.</P>
    <P>The environment committee visited the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant. There have been many accidents during the years at the plant. The members of the committee were anxious to investigate the recent accident at THORP where a leak occurred but was undetected for a long time. I welcome the efforts of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to hold the authorities in the United Kingdom to account for these incidents. The Minister has been strong on this issue. In a press release earlier this month, he welcomed the decision of the UK safety regulator to bring a criminal prosecution against British Nuclear Group Sellafield Limited in respect of the leak at the THORP plant in 2005.</P><Col N="1668"/>
    <P>The members of the environment committee sought explanations as to why the leak was undetected and sought assurances regarding the response of the authorities at the time. We did not get those assurances. The decision by the UK safety regulator to being a criminal prosecution is welcome. I hope lessons will be learned from the incident.</P>
    <P>The Sellafield plant continues to be a major issue for Irish people. It is a threat to our environment and to the health and safety of the people, particularly those living on the east coast. The recent RTE drama on this issue, while a little over the top, did some good in that it focused attention on the issue and on how we might respond to such an accident should it occur. The Minister is pursuing a number of legal actions under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Following an initial legal action taken by the State, it has established a right to be informed of all events relating to Sellafield. A genuine dialogue and consultation is taking place.</P>
    <P>I accept there are problems with the legal action initiated under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We have received the judgment of the Advocate General of the European Union suggesting that this case should have been initiated in the EU institutions. The final judgment on this issue is awaited. We must be alert to that judgment and be ready to pursue every available option through the EU institutions to highlight our serious concerns about the operation of the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant. I have every confidence in the Government to deal effectively with this. In March the UK authorities decided to privatise the Sellafield facility, which raises concerns in Ireland. There is no suggestion that privatisation is automatically bad. We need, however, to be conscious of the structure of the UK nuclear industry and how privatisation may compromise health and safety in the operation of these plants. The UK Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, has put nuclear power back on the agenda with his recent suggestion that ten new nuclear power plants be built in the United Kingdom. For Ireland, it raises concerns over which locations will be chosen for the sites. It seems several locations will be on the United Kingdom&rsquo;s west coast and the Wylfa site, particularly, is under discussion.</P>
    <P>There are also concerns about the waste generated by nuclear power. That waste will be brought to the Sellafield reprocessing plant. When it comes to waste, nuclear fuel is not a clean option. The Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government viewed the highly active storage tanks at the Sellafield plant. It was an interesting experience to stand atop a large concrete silo and feel the heat on the concrete coming from the stored waste underneath in what I thought were like Guinness kegs. I could not wait to get out of that particular section of the plant. What can be done with nuclear waste in the long term? Should it be buried deep in caverns in <Col N="1669"/>the Irish Sea? Are we postponing the problem for several more generations? Although global warming raises concerns, the nuclear option also has serious environmental consequences.</P>
    <P>There is also the issue of a terrorist attack on any of these nuclear power stations. While there are confidential exchanges between the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Defence and the UK security authorities on the issue, it does raise serious concerns.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
    <P>Yesterday was national biodiversity day. I congratulate the <i>Irish Independent</i> on the supplement it produced to celebrate the day. It contained a series of interesting articles on the subject that reflected on the fragility of our biodiversity systems and how they can be impacted upon. Energy is one particular factor which can greatly impact upon a system. There is more renewed interest in biodiversity.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for the initiative he recently announced for the production of electricity from renewable energy technologies. It intends to double the contribution of renewable sources in electricity production to 13.2% by 2010. Additional capacity will supply the electricity needs of 260,000 homes. The renewable energy feed-in tariff programme will support the construction of an initial target of at least 400 MW of new renewable energy powered electricity generating plants.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement earlier this year of grants for the domestic sector for renewable energy. Grants are available for householders who wish to install solar panels, wind generators and so forth. Television programmes by Duncan Stewart and others have demonstrated there is a large interest in this technology which has been underestimated by the House. Many people are installing these devices on their own initiative. I warn the Minister that there will be a huge take-up of the grants scheme and he may want to watch the financing of it.</P>
    <P>This is an important Bill that has initiated a worthwhile discussion on our energy needs and I commend it to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I belatedly wish all Members a happy biodiversity day. I am surprised Hallmark has not already merchandised it and established an elaborate marketing scheme so we can all exchange biodiversity cards on the auspicious day.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is because there are no biofuels to make the cards.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure every fossil fuel available will be burned to produce millions of cards for the day. That is, however, a rather cynical analysis of the situation.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been introduced at an important time when oil prices are high and renewable energy technologies are being improved. Chal<Col N="1670"/>lenges with planning and infrastructure are being addressed by the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Bill 2006, which will be debated in the D&aacute;il next week. The cost of renewables is much greater than that for oil and gas. The question is whether the gap can be closed and, if so, what can the Government do to assist in closing it. Although it is still cheaper for an individual to run his or her home heating off oil and gas, certain changes have occurred. When 2006 is considered 40 years from now, the offers of support for renewable energy sources may be described as quaint. However, they are on the right track and I am pleased with the Government&rsquo;s support for it. Ireland has a rare opportunity to take advantage of renewable energy sources because of our exposed position on the western seaboard of Europe. It has been said that Ireland could be the Saudi Arabia of renewable energy, which would be very exciting, we would all become sheiks and be very wealthy and have our own golf courses. It would be fantastic.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>That will happen under the next Government.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>All joking aside, Saudi Arabia experienced great wealth from oil but everyone is now saying we have reached peak oil point and it is now making its slow but inevitable exit from the energy market to be replaced by something else. If oil had not reached that point, however, there would still be a moral imperative to pursue renewable energy.</P>
    <P>We have been here before. The oil price crisis in the 1970s saw huge amounts invested in renewable energy and quite a few people had their fingers burnt at that time. Many said they would never go near the area again and that it was a total waste of money. Since the 1970s things have changed. In the past year the price of oil has risen from $40 a barrel to $70 a barrel. Even when it was $40 a barrel, the cost of production of renewable energy was closing the gap in terms of efficiency. It is now attracting venture capital from the major energy companies such as BP and Shell, which are investing huge amounts of money in renewable energy. It no longer requires baby-sitting by Government regulation, it is attracting private investors who have seen the closing of the gap in technology and who have learned the lessons of the 1970s.</P>
    <P>The unusual individual nature of the renewable energy sources, such as the variability in delivery of solar power because of cloud cover and the variable nature of wind power, caused problems in the past. There are now smart solar metres which charge on the basis of time of delivery and there has been growth in the size of wind turbines, steps forward since the 1970s. This technology is closing the gap, along with Government regulation and oil price rises.</P><Col N="1671"/>
    <P>Ireland faces a challenge. We are blocked by our NIMBY outlook, something of which we are all guilty. These changes are necessary. The planning and infrastructure Bill will fast-track some of the more important gas and oil projects that must be developed while we develop renewable energies.</P>
    <P>The debate today has also touched on nuclear energy, particularly since the British announced their intention to expand their nuclear programme. Deputy Kelleher noted that we use electricity that comes from a grid fuelled by nuclear energy and asked if it is not the height of hypocrisy if we object to it on a moral basis. France has around 60 nuclear power stations and would not survive without nuclear energy. It is not far enough away that we would be immune to a terrorist attack on a nuclear facility there. The fall-out from Chernobyl in 1996 severely affected countries as far away from the Ukraine as Sweden. The threat from Britain is greater but the threat from nuclear power in other countries will not go away. We must consider that and see if we are posturing about this issue.</P>
    <P>The same could be said about incinerators. Whatever the challenges about building incinerators around Ireland, trying to deliver a thermonuclear reactor in a constituency would be nearly impossible.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>We could build it in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>We have no space there. There are places elsewhere where I would be happy to support a nuclear reactor. However, I am only joking. On a visit to the Netherlands recently, a Dutch politician explained to me that 17% of the electricity in the grid in Amsterdam is a by-product of incineration. Amsterdam city council is run partially by the Dutch Green Party and the Dutch Labour Party. We might be behind our cousins in those countries.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there no Dutch Fianna F&aacute;il Party?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I have always said the Labour Party is Fianna F&aacute;il in disguise, a rump that never evolved in the same way as the rest of us.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>We might take the party over yet.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a philosophical question that might not be appropriate to today&rsquo;s debate.</P>
    <P>Local authorities can play a role in this. Earlier this year we were the first country to auction carbon emissions and greenhouse gas allowances. Businesses were able to pay off their obligations. All small and medium size businesses should be told that if they make strides in terms of adopting <Col N="1672"/>renewable energy, they will be rewarded and encouraged. The local authorities collect commercial rates and should be able to offer a waiver for those businesses that adopt best practice in renewable energy. That would require a change in legislation but local authorities could use such an opportunity to make progress in the area.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I compliment the Minister on the tremendous work he is doing in the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. Anytime I have requested a meeting, he has been forthcoming. Recently I have been in contact with the Minister&rsquo;s office about two groups from north Meath, one of which has put a great deal of work into wind energy in the area and another that has bought premises and will create jobs in alternative energy sources. I know that when the Minister receives the request, he will meet both groups. These groups comprise very energetic people who are prepared to put their money where their mouths are, do everything in their power to examine alternative energy and at the same time create jobs in north Meath, which would be very welcome.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food recently discussed this issue in great detail. An official from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources gave an excellent presentation on energy at the meeting. The committee also heard from an official from the Department of Agriculture and Food and an official from Teagasc. I agreed to Deputy Blaney&rsquo;s request to hold a meeting on this issue because agriculture is changing so rapidly. The growing of biofuel crops is one of the topics discussed in meetings I have held with some of the farming organisations in recent months, both on behalf of the committee and in a private capacity. I welcome the fact that the farming organisations, particularly, the IFA, make considerable efforts to encourage their members to grow biofuel crops.</P>
    <P>This is a wide-ranging Bill, which when enacted will play a vital role in driving forward a progressive energy agenda in a new global energy environment with ever increasing demands on fuel resources. A key feature of the Bill is a move towards an all-Ireland market. The Bill also addresses east, west, north and south electricity interconnection, which is a significant part of energy policy. Interconnection provides strong physical links with Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK and will integrate Ireland into a wider European market. The Bill removes a current impediment in law by facilitating regulated electricity interconnection which is not owned by the ESB and gives the regulator the power, with ministerial consent, to secure interconnector bills by various means, including competitive tendering, <Col N="1673"/>direct authorisation or through the transmission system operator.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides the legal basis for the Commission for Energy Regulation to engage in the development of an all-Ireland energy market, with a date of 1 July 2007 set for the establishment of an all-Ireland single electricity market. This single market will, over time, remove market distortions and minimise the wholesale cost of electricity. It will also create a more attractive location for new electricity generation investment and help improve the security and reliability of electricity supplies throughout the island.</P>
    <P>It is vital to ensure that both communities and economies have access to safe, secure and sustainable energy supplies obtained through competitive energy markets. There is no doubt that this challenge can be met more effectively to the mutual benefit of both parts of the island if they work together. This is particularly fitting when considered in the context of the regional approach to the development of energy markets being pursued as part of the EU drive to create an EU-wide internal market in electricity and natural gas.</P>
    <P>The creation of an all-Ireland energy market involves collaboration on issues ranging from improved interconnection, competitive markets, harmonised trading arrangements, generation adequacy, security of supplies, sustainable energy and energy efficiency measures. A key priority is to establish all-Ireland wholesale electricity trading arrangements, while another priority is the establishment of an all-island gas market in line with the commissioning of the infrastructure. It is also vital to maximise the benefits of environmentally sustainable energy from rapidly maturing wind generation and the combined heat and power business through to the growing rural biomass energy industry and the future promise of substantial energy from the sea.</P>
    <P>There is extensive and wholehearted support for an all-Ireland energy market. Sometimes, competing issues are involved and not all of the benefits can be achieved immediately. However, the long-term reward will be a market which is much better placed to meet the future energy needs of the island. Given that a cross-Border energy market already exists, there is an acknowledged requirement for us to ensure that policy developments both North and South are progressed in a way that advances the goal of improved economic and energy supply benefits for both parts of the island.</P>
    <P>We must also act to ensure that policies are developed to exploit opportunities for enhancing the value of the energy industry in the island through external links with Great Britain and continental Europe. The energy policy agenda must be widened beyond traditional market development issues to take account of national and international concerns about combating <Col N="1674"/>climate change. More particularly, there is a requirement that we follow renewable energy and energy efficiency opportunities where benefits can be enhanced by acting on an all-Ireland basis. Market structures must be integrated and infrastructure investment secured to improve island-wide efficiencies.</P>
    <P>Co-ordination is needed in the activities of the regulatory authority and transmission system operators. In the final analysis, it must lead to unified regulatory and system operator arrangements for the entire island which are geared to the delivery of measurable benefits. Energy issues are complex, frequently interconnected and often related to long-term investment decisions. One must also take into account the different stages of development between the electricity and natural gas markets and infrastructure. This means that achieving the most advantageous outcome for the entire range of energy policy issues will be protected.</P>
    <P>The support, dedication and active co-operation of all stakeholders will be required if the benefits of an all-Ireland market are to be secured. Ministers North and South have confirmed that any policy, legislative, structural, institutional or resource issues that may arise during the course of implementing this strategy and unfavourably affect the development of the effective functioning of the all-Ireland energy market will be carefully examined and addressed in conjunction with the relevant agencies. The aim will be to pursue complementary actions as far as possible.</P>
    <P>The test by which the value of a fully integrated all-Ireland energy market should be judged is whether users on both parts of the island are better off than they would be in two smaller markets that are mutually supportive good neighbours but trade together rather than systematically. The potential benefits of a mature all-Ireland energy market would include a large single market with competitive prices. There should be open and transparent competition at all levels and for all energy sources, including combined heat and power and renewable sources. It should also mean a more stable and attractive investment location. It should provide a boost to the competitiveness of the wider industrial sector. There would be a greater security of supply, an integrated infrastructure and a sharing of a more diverse energy mix.</P>
    <P>Greater energy efficiency will undoubtedly result in long-term savings through the rationalisation of functions in regulation, system operation and transmission areas, asset planning and ownership. It will also facilitate greater consumer choice of energy supplies or services and enhance the organisation of energy research to allow for the emergence of an all-Ireland network of academic and industrial expertise. The Bill includes provisions to further enhance the safety of energy <Col N="1675"/>consumers and the public, ensuring that Ireland continues to meet international best practice in respect of electricity and natural gas safety.</P>
    <P>The regulator will be given robust new safety functions, including the regulation of electricity contractors and natural gas installers. The regulator will also be granted additional powers to ensure rigorous enforcement, including the designation for the first time of electrical and gas safety supervisory bodies and the establishment of standards for training and registration, the introduction of certification schemes and powers to prosecute rogue installers.</P>

	<P>I thank contributors to the debate, the general tone of which I found to be constructive and positive. I thank Members for their welcome of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions and I welcome the opportunity to reply to those various observations. I was not available for the early part of the Second Stage discussion on 6 April and I formally thank my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, for taking the debate. It has been a frank and open discussion and I look forward to a continued positive response during subsequent Stages of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As Deputies indicated in their contributions, a number of the concepts in the Bill are of a technical nature. I hope the accompanying detailed explanatory memorandum was of assistance to Deputies in their consideration of the Bill and it will be helpful on Committee Stage. I welcome the overwhelming support of Deputies for sections 4 and 11 relating to safety issues and the regulation of electrical contractors and gas installers. I appreciate comments relating to the important work carried out by industry bodies such as RECI in providing for the self-regulation of electrical contractors. The Bill will considerably strengthen this area and will provide a firm and transparent legal foundation for such regulation, which all sides will welcome.</P>
    <P>It was not long after I became the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources that I was lobbied by individuals involved in RECI and individual contractors who were concerned that regulations and objective standards on safety should be put in place. In the absence of regulation or a legal framework, it was difficult to tackle the issue of a small number of &ldquo;cowboys&rdquo; operating in this sector. They gave registered, good quality contractors a bad name and caused difficulties in the industry. The Bill&rsquo;s legal foundation for the sector&rsquo;s regulation will be welcomed by everyone.</P>
    <P>I also appreciate the welcome extended by Deputies to section 6 relating to a proposed new ministerial power to issue policy directions to the CER. This is based on similar provisions in the <Col N="1676"/>Communications Regulation Act 2002. While it is intended to use this power sparingly, it remains a necessity. Such a measure will provide a mechanism for the political leadership mentioned by Deputy Eamon Ryan while also respecting the independent role of the regulator as mentioned by Deputy James Breen.</P>
    <P>Crucially, the safeguard in and benefit of having this type of policy direction is the public consultation process associated with the development of such future policy directions. I also thank Deputy O&rsquo;Flynn for raising this issue. It is important to have that discussion and make a decision in an open and transparent fashion.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>Comments and criticisms have been aired in recent days, and over the last 12 to 18 months, when various applications were made for increases in electricity and gas charges and the Commission on Energy Regulation granted large increases to the companies concerned. Some of that criticism was based on the belief the commission was only looking at one aspect of the issue, that is, providing an economic return for the companies and trying to attract other competitors into the market. While I am not saying I agree with that criticism, it was expressed widely. People raised concerns about consumer protection, which is also a role for the regulator and one it has tried to balance with the competition elements of its remit. It is foreseeable that in future, depending on the operation of political leadership, a Government or this House might be unanimous in the view that the balance between the weighting the CER gives to issues like competitiveness as opposed to that given to consumer protection is wrong. The power provided for in section 6 of the Bill will allow the House and the Government to have a say on such matters, in an open and transparent fashion.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
    <P>I wish to refer to concerns raised by various Deputies during the course of this debate, particularly those expressed by Deputies Eamon Ryan, Boyle, Durkan, O&rsquo;Flynn and Coveney, many of which will be addressed by the forthcoming green paper on energy policy, which I intend to publish by the middle of this year. The general thrust of the statements made by Deputies on all sides was that there is a need to set out medium and long-term perspectives and directions for national energy policy and I strongly agree with that. It was for that reason that I set out on the route of drafting and putting in place an energy policy paper, shortly after I became Minister in the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, approximately two and a half years ago. There was not much discussion about energy policy on either side of the House at that time but energy is a critical issue and is inextricably linked to our economy and competitiveness.</P>
    <P>I recently read a document on energy policy which was published in 1978 by a former member of this House, Mr. Desmond O&rsquo; Malley. I will <Col N="1677"/>deal with nuclear energy later, but I noted there was also a debate about nuclear energy at that time. One of the fascinating elements of the document is how it dealt with the nuclear issue. I was surprised to note that the price tag in 1978 for a nuclear power station was &pound;350 million, indicating that it was a very expensive way to generate power even then.</P>
    <P>The green paper will set the debate in the context of the considerable and complex future challenges for Irish energy policy. It will take into account developments at EU level, including the recent publication of the European Commission&rsquo;s green paper on energy. It will also take into account the global trends. The paper will be open to people to comment upon and the whole policy development process will be finalised by the end of the year. There has been a considerable degree of discussion on various aspects of energy policy, particularly in the last 12 months and in that context, there is no need for a very long, drawn out consultation process.</P>
    <P>With regard to renewable energy, we have spoken to various expert groups and a number of reports that have been, or are about to be, published will also inform the policy document. Deputies in the House, through the work they have done in the committees that shadow the Department, have made constructive contributions to the debate on the issue and their document will be a useful part of our deliberations.</P>
    <P>Deputies Durkan and Broughan raised the question of the publication of the Deloitte and Touche consultancy report on the electricity sector. I intend to publish that report around the time of the release of the green paper. It is important that we have the wider energy policy document in the public domain before the specifics of the electricity document are&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the report be taken into account in the green paper?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>It will, generally, yes. Obviously it will set the context but it is extremely important that the wider energy policy is put in place and the framework is outlined. Within that framework, one important element is the electricity sector and the structures needed to meet the energy needs of the country into the future.</P>
    <P>One of the important functions of the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is contained in section 3, which most Deputies have welcomed, and relates to the development of an all-island energy market. The single electricity market is scheduled to go live by 1 July 2007. That is obviously a critical milestone and intensive preparation has been under way for some time now, both North and South. I thank everybody involved in that work in both Departments, the regulators and others. It is extremely important, <Col N="1678"/>technical work and it is vital that we get it absolutely right.</P>
    <P>In light of comments made by Deputies Broughan, Connolly and Kelly, I advise the House that work on the single electricity market is now well advanced, on a joint basis with our Northern colleagues. The successful delivery of the single electricity market by July 2007 presents an enormously challenging timeframe for all concerned and I wish again to acknowledge the work of the all-island energy market joint steering group, its official title, which consists of senior officials in the Departments and the two regulators, who are driving it forward. I am sure everybody in the House will commend them for the work they have done to date and will agree that such a co-operative effort is a good model for North-South co-operation. I firmly intend, notwithstanding any legal difficulties, to have the final text of that Bill published before the summer recess.</P>
    <P>In response to comments made by Deputy Eamon Ryan and Deputy Coveney on section 7 of the Bill, I emphasise that security of energy supply remains the key imperative for Ireland and the European Union. The relatively small size of the Irish electricity market underlines the need for greater interconnection as a means of enhancing security of supply. It also underlines the importance of promoting competition and integrating the Irish electricity market into regional and wider European markets.</P>
    <P>In that context, it is very important we refer to the prospects of the east-west electricity interconnector, as a number of Deputies did, delivery of which remains a key priority for the Government. The date consistently mentioned is 2011, which remains a key date for us. I will shortly bring proposals to Government on progressing that strategically vital infrastructure. There is now a willingness and interest in delivering it quickly for a host of reasons. Security of supply is important, and if we are to develop our renewables significantly, especially intermittent renewables such as wind energy, it is vital that we have an interconnector to assist in that.</P>
    <P Just="Left">A number of Deputies, namely, Deputies Broughan, Eamon Ryan, Catherine Murphy, Coveney, Cassidy, Neville and Fiona O&rsquo;Malley, raised Ireland&rsquo;s potential for the exploitation of wind energy. I agree with the Deputies, particularly Deputy Coveney who remarked that to meet our collective ambitions for enhanced use of wind resources, the necessary infrastructure must be <i>in situ</i>. We mentioned the interconnector, which is part of that. Work to ensure the infrastructure is <i>in situ</i> is already under way.</P>
    <P>I refer Deputies to the recent statement by the national grid which clearly indicated that we have doubled our renewable generating capacity over the past two years with 846 MW of capacity now fully connected to our electricity system. That is <Col N="1679"/>a significant increase over the past 12 months. We have more than 50 individual wind farms with 574 MW of wind capacity connected to the grid and a further 630 MW is fully consented with signed connection agreements. With all of that, we are well on our way to achieving our 2010 renewable electricity targets.</P>
    <P>In the recent past I heard a Deputy, who is not present in the House, stating that is not ambitious enough and we should aim higher, and I agree. However, 12 months ago the same Deputy told us that we would not achieve the target. Now that he knows we will achieve and probably exceed the target, he immediately states we are not ambitious enough.</P>
    <P>The ability to reach those short-term targets is welcome. However, I do not intend to limit our ambition to this and an additional 1,300 MW of wind projects was released into the connection process in recent weeks. That clearly underpins our commitment to developing this area as quickly as possible. People seem to think we could have an entire electricity sector based on wind power.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very windy outside at the moment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is. I have not been outside since early this morning. In some cases when the wind blows too hard, it is not good for wind energy.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The turbines would take off.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Those who think we can meet all our energy needs from the wind or want to connect 20,000 MW of wind to the system should cop themselves on a bit. A balance must be kept.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boyle referred to the new renewable energy feed in tariff, REFIT, programme, which was launched recently. This programme will assist developers to construct new renewable energy powered generating projects. The programme, which will cost approximately &euro;120 million over 15 years, will ensure the viability of these projects by offering 15-year contracts to developers.</P>
    <P>While wind projects will contribute the bulk of any new energy sourced, I want to emphasise the programme is also available to projects based on the use of biomass, hydro-power and landfill gas emissions. This represents a major step by the Government in delivering on Ireland&rsquo;s commitments under the Kyoto agreement. It is a good beginning and we will reach and exceed our targets. However, we must be much more ambitious. Given that this programme is a direct response to market demand for a move away from competitive tendering, I encourage project developers to seize this opportunity, and deliver projects quickly. Some earlier schemes did not deliver as quickly as we wanted.</P><Col N="1680"/>
    <P>On the wider issue of renewable sources of energy, Deputies Broughan, McEntee, Neville, Crowe, Finian McGrath, Catherine Murphy, Coveney, Connolly, Cassidy and Mulcahy stressed the potential of renewable sources of energy. The renewables directive obliges Ireland to develop and implement a programme capable of increasing the amount of electricity from renewable energy sources to 13.2%, or 1,450 MW, of total consumption by 2010. As I already stated, we will meet this target.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the target for 2030?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy must wait and see the policy document.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister will not be concerned about it. He will not be in Government then. He will be on this side of the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>He will be the Leader of the Opposition.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister give way to a question?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The question has been asked and I have answered that the targets will be clearly laid out and we will be very ambitious and realistic. There is no point in being ambitious without realism attached.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is worth considering.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is clear that the Government is strongly committed to renewable energy and underpins the commitment with significant financial support. The multi-annual financial package announced in the 2006 budget provides for up to &euro;65 million over the next five years for renewable energy schemes. These include renewable heat, electricity and transport initiatives, and cover the gamut of renewable energy sources, including biofuels, biomass and combined heat and power.</P>
    <P>Under this initiative, and in partnership with my Department, Sustainable Energy Ireland launched the greener homes scheme in March of this year. This scheme provides for up to &euro;27 million in grant aid for domestic renewable heat technologies. I am sure Deputies will be pleased to know that this scheme is already meeting with considerable success. More than 1,150 applications were made in the first four weeks of the scheme and the figure is now well above that. A package worth &euro;205 million has been set aside to provide for a ramped up excise relief programme for biofuels.</P>
    <P>I share the sentiments expressed by Deputies that nuclear energy is not an option for this country. It has been the policy of successive Governments to oppose the use of nuclear energy. It <Col N="1681"/>remains the policy of the Government, as was recently reiterated by the Taoiseach. Furthermore, given that section 18 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 specifically precludes the use of nuclear fission for the generation of electricity in this country, only the Oireachtas has the power to change this situation.</P>
    <P Just="Left">A great deal of discussion has taken place about nuclear energy. Those who are most vociferous in opposition to it generally speak in terms of the possible environmental impact of nuclear energy if something goes wrong. That is a factor and the major issue in everybody&rsquo;s mind in opposing nuclear energy. This emerges from the well-known accidents which took place, such as the Windscale fire, the Three Mile Island accident in the US in 1979 and the accident at Chernobyl in 1986. Those accidents, particularly at Chernobyl, which was horrific, ruled out any expansion of nuclear energy for a long time. The fear of nuclear energy is still strong with many people.</P>
    <P>There are other reasons for nuclear energy not being an option in Ireland. Nuclear energy is poor in economic terms compared with fossil fuel options such as natural gas. This has become clear as understanding increases of the costs involved in the long-term storage of nuclear waste products and the cost of decommissioning nuclear power stations. The costs of the fuel are very low, amounting typically to only 2% of the overall cost of generation. However, there are capital costs in maintaining power stations. I mentioned to Deputy Broughan earlier that in 1978, some &pound;350 million would&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>What would be the modern equivalent of that?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>There would be an over-run.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy could multiply the figure by three or 3.5. It would amount to well over &euro;1 billion.</P>
    <P>Taking the environmental aspects into account as well as the economic aspects, nuclear power is not all that good. In particular, to put a sufficiently large power plant in Ireland would mean installing a plant capable of between 1200 MW or 1250 MW at a minimum. That would give rise to the same type of problem that would arise with regard to putting too much wind or other type of power on the electricity system. As a result of the size of our market, the largest plants we have would be between 400 MW and 500 MW. One or two plants would be slightly larger. One must be consistently aware of the possibility of outages on some of those and the effect this would have on supply.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister concerned about the closure of the Tarbert station? It is capable of 650 MW.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1682"/>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is capable of 620 MW, and I will come to that issue. I am not concerned as it will be a four-year lead in, according to the ESB statement. That gives us time. There is a requirement in law for the ESB, or another power generation company, to give us at least two years notice of closure of a power plant. That allows us to plan in advance.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the temporary closure of Shannonbridge and Lanesboro stations?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to security of supply and capacity, it is not a concern.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Where does the Minister expect to leave the ESB as a percentage of the market generation in 2010?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>We can get into a discussion on matters like this, such as the percentage of the market met by the ESB. I am more concerned about the percentage of plants they have, which sets the price for everything else. That is about 99.7%.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will it not be 67% in July of next year?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Deputy referring to generation capacity?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I am referring to the marginal price, which will be at 67% next July.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The ESB sets price in 99.7% of the time. That is nearly 100%.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>What of the all-island market?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The all-island market will not make a significant difference to the ESB&rsquo;s capacity to set price. That is where a difficulty arises.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">To get back to the Bill, Deputies Broughan, Eamon Ryan, Crowe, Finian McGrath, Mulcahy and Cowley referred to emergency measures relating to oil. The increased cost of oil, taken with the issues of dwindling resources and geopolitical tensions, are all a cause of concern. I advise Deputies that as a member of the International Energy Agency, Ireland is required to maintain oil stocks equivalent to at least 90 days of net imports in the previous year. The EU imposes a similar requirement based on consumption.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Are we in compliance with that?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>We are over our requirements.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1683"/>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>By how much are we over our requirements?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Much of the stock is outside Ireland.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Stocks are required to be available. We have such stocks and agreements. The last time I checked, which was several months back, there were well over 100 days available.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister had to check the dipstick.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department has also associated obligations to maintain contingency plans, including arrangements for the release of national oil reserves to minimise the adverse effects of a major oil shortage within the framework of a co-ordinated international response. The Fuel Acts 1971 and 1982, and the European Communities (Minimum Stocks of Petroleum Oils) Regulations 1995, put in place measures to safeguard the supply and distribution of oil in an emergency, to meet EU and IEA stockholding obligations, and to ensure the gathering of adequate data regarding consumption, trade and stocks of oil products.</P>
    <P>The European Communities (Minimum Stocks of Petroleum Oils) Regulations 1995 provide for the setting up of a national oil reserves agency with delegated responsibility for the maintenance of national oil stock reserves. On 21 July 2004, the Government approved the drafting of the national oil reserves agency Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is this the NORA Bill?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is NORA, dearly loved by Deputy Durkan.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>We have been waiting for NORA for years.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>This will enable the national oil reserves agency to be established as a stand-alone body under the aegis of the Minister. I intend to publish the Bill before the summer recess.</P>
    <P>The Fuel Acts provide for significant State intervention in the market in the event of a major disruption to oil supplies. It is therefore not necessary to provide for such measures within the scope of the Bill before us. That is the reason they are not in this Bill, as they are catered for in other legislation. Under these Acts, the Government may make an order authorising the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to intervene &ldquo;whenever the Government is of the opinion that the exigencies of the common good necessitate the regulation or control by the Minister on behalf of the State of the <Col N="1684"/>acquisition, supply, distribution or marketing of fuels&rdquo; held by private sector oil companies.</P>
    <P>I refer to a point made by Deputy Gogarty, who made a request some time ago during an Adjournment debate. It was to discuss &ldquo;the need for the Government to order a nationwide audit of domestic gas installations from meter to house, where originally connected by Bord G&aacute;is, as there is evidence that pipes have not been properly insulated in a large number of cases, leaving an ever-present risk of gas explosion&rdquo;. I reiterate that there was misunderstanding and I acknowledge that the Deputy was suspended from the House when he tried to raise the matter again. In preparing its reply, the Department was unsure whether the Deputy referred to thermal or electrical insulation. Because of the tight timeframe in which it was drafted the Department assumed he meant thermal insulation.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>As a member of the EU and the World Trade Organisation, Ireland is in a position to avail of opportunities for trade that are essential for the development of our open economy. Membership of these organisations also brings reciprocal trade obligations. All imports must come from third countries or areas of third countries that have been approved by the EU authorities for export to the EU. In the current WTO discussions in the Council of Ministers, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, has always pressed very strongly the non-trade aspect of market <Col N="1685"/>access, which I regard as a crucial element in the overall negotiations. The Minister will do so again on Monday next when WTO will be discussed in the Council and will remind the Commission once again of the importance of equivalence in standards, particularly in regard to all exporting countries, including Brazil.</P>
    <P>I fully support the policy that animal products imported into the EU from third countries meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, EU member states. In this context the Minister contacted the Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, Mr. Markos Kyprianou, concerning the sanitary rules applying to the import of livestock products, especially beef, into the European Union.</P>
    <P>The Commissioner pointed out that, with respect to traceability and controls of residues of veterinary medicines, the purpose of EU legislation is not to impose on exporting third countries a system of guarantees that is equal to the EU system, but that the exporting country provides guarantees that are equivalent to the standards applied in the EU.</P>
    <P>The Commissioner indicated his service is committed to protect the health of European consumers and European livestock. Adoption of safeguard measures over imports, for example in the matter of dealing with the risk to the EU of the spread of high pathogenic avian influenza, in the finding of residues of unauthorised substances in poultry meat and in the quick and proportionate protective measures applied to imports of beef as a result of the recent outbreaks of foot and mouth disease, demonstrates the Commission&rsquo;s primary objective of maintaining the high sanitary status of the Community and respecting the EU&rsquo;s commitment under the WTO agreement on sanitary and phytosanitary measures.</P>
    <P>The Commission has assured us that it will not hesitate to take the appropriate protection measures if a product, imported from a third country or produced in the domestic market, represents a risk for the health of EU consumers, livestock or plants.</P>
    <P Just="Left">An EU food and veterinary office, FVO, inspection to evaluate animal health and public health control systems, traceability and certification procedures in place in Brazil was carried out in September of last year. The FVO recently published its findings following a period of consultation with the Brazilian competent authorities and a review of action plans that have been submitted by the Brazilian authorities to the Commission. This report, as well as all previous FVO reports on inspection of third countries&rsquo; controls for export, may be accessed from the European Commission&rsquo;s website.</P>
    <P>While the report comments on a general improvement in the structure, organisation and <Col N="1686"/>tasks of the Brazilian competent authorities it has listed a number of recommendations to the authorities to address deficiencies that were recorded in the course of its audit. The Brazilian authorities have undertaken to submit an action plan in response to these recommendations and the Department of Agriculture and Food will continue to monitor the position.</P>
    <P>The Department is seeking assurances from the Commission that the FVO will undertake further missions to Brazil to evaluate the implementation of its action plan. At a recent meeting of the standing committee on the food chain and animal health, where the matter was again raised by Ireland, the Commission indicated that a FVO mission is being planned to take place some time before the end of the summer.</P>
    <P>In the meantime additional health certification requirements have been introduced for imported beef from Brazil under Commission decision 2006/259/EC, requiring guarantees concerning animal contacts, vaccination programmes and surveillance. These certification provisions took effect from 31 March 2006 and they are checked by the EU approved border inspection posts, through which all third country imports must first be submitted.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>It is obvious from the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply that he did not have the opportunity to read today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i>, which highlights deplorable standards and intolerable practices in Brazilian farming. A leading world expert on foot-and-mouth disease control, who works with the Brazilian authorities, writes that the current foot-and-mouth eradication scheme is doing more to spread the disease than eradicate it in Brazil. He adds that the current testing procedures in Brazil are wholly inadequate and unable to differentiate between animals that have been infected with foot-and-mouth disease and those which have been vaccinated. Is it not the case that, as this and the EU food and veterinary office report make clear, traceability is non-existent and the vast majority of cattle in Brazil do not have tags? The EU food and veterinary office seem to go to Brazil for a holiday rather than to produce a report that can be taken seriously by the European Commission. The last report was a damning indictment of what has been happening in Brazil and nothing has been done about it. Today&rsquo;s report is a damning indictment of what has been happening in Brazil and nothing has been done about it.</P>
    <P>The McDonalds hamburger chain will not take beef from Brazil because it believes it is an accident waiting to happen. McDonalds is not prepared to take Brazilian beef but the European consumer must accept it, and with it the risk of the importation of foot-and-mouth disease.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I said, as I did when Deputy Upton asked a similar question, that the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, had consistently raised this issue at meetings of the EU Council of Ministers. It will arise again in the context of the WTO negotiations and deliberations at the EU Council of Ministers next Monday. There will be a further European audit and a further FVO inspection before the end of this summer. It is unfair of Deputy Naughten to suggest that eminent professionals who have the confidence of the FVO would treat their work as a holiday and I do not believe that, on reflection, he would consider it true. They are people of the utmost competence and professional ability.</P>
    <P>We have raised the issues of concern over equivalence in the standards that apply. At present, EU legislation only authorises imports from Brazil of de-boned and maturated bovine meat, without offals, from certain parts of Brazil. Other organisations, as well as public representatives and Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas, have quite rightly raised their concerns over standards that apply in South America and elsewhere and the Minister has been active in raising it at all Council of Ministers meetings. She wrote a comprehensive letter to the Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection. The Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, in response to a question from Deputy Naughten a week ago, said the issue had been referred to the Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection on numerous occasions. This is an issue we will continue to keep on the agenda because it demands the utmost diligence and attention.</P>

     <Quest>her views on appointing an <Col N="1688"/>independent expert, agreed upon by her Department and a person (details supplied), to investigate the possible cause of high mortality of cattle and the low productivity of other animals on a person&rsquo;s farm; if she will ensure that all reports, test results and analyses carried out by or on behalf of her Department are made available to the owner of the farm; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms M. Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department, with other agencies and the private veterinary practitioners of the person named, has been carrying out investigations to try to establish the source of the problems on the farm in question. The problems relate mainly to ill thrift and stunted growth of a number of cattle on the farm as well as severe milk yield loss in the dairy herd.</P>
    <P>It had been suggested that one of the possible causes of the problems might relate to possible exposure of the cattle to fluorine being emitted from a nearby factory. My Department has examined this aspect and carried out elective and general post mortem examinations on some animals from the farm. The findings of the post mortems, coupled with results from live animals, have not provided any evidence to date that the problems reported on the farm are related to fluoride exposure.</P>
    <P>It was also been agreed that a herd health programme would be developed by private veterinary practitioners of the person concerned supported by my Department to deal with endemic diseases in calves and mastitis in cows. This programme is ongoing. In addition, it was decided that further environmental, ecological and epidemiological work would be undertaken to seek to determine whether other factors might be uncovered to identify the source of the problem. This work involves experts from a number of academic institutions as well as the Environmental Protection Agency and my Department. The person named and his veterinary practitioners have also been involved.</P>
    <P>In view of the expertise already engaged in this investigation and its ongoing nature, the appointment of an independent expert would not necessarily contribute in bringing the matter to a satisfactory conclusion. The person named has been kept fully informed of the Department&rsquo;s investigations and test results have been made available to his private veterinary practitioners. The Department will continue to keep them informed and provide access to results related to work carried out by or on behalf of the Department on the farm. I appreciate the difficult position of the person named in this ongoing matter and my Department will continue to give priority and assistance to the investigations in conjunction with other agencies.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1689"/>
   <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State will agree that this is an unusual case in that Teagasc, local veterinary practitioners and a UCD professor of forestry, Professor Gardiner, all agree that the problems on the farm in question are not related to farm management or nutritional factors. Professor Gardiner, for instance, indicated in his report that the problems are consistent with pollution damage.</P>
    <P Just="Left">One of the factors missing from this scenario is the information gathered by the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA, in its commentary, states that while the company has exceeded the emissions levels specified in the licence, the level is within the specified margin of error. It is unacceptable that the company should exceed the specified emissions levels. Furthermore, the details on emissions levels and the EPA report have not been made available to the farmer in question. This information is crucial to enable him to make a decision on how to address the issue. For this reason, an independent inspector should be appointed, with the agreement of the Department and the farmer, to investigate the matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><NameTxt>Ms M. Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>It has not yet been proven that pollution damage is the cause of the problems on the farm. It is clear from the reports available to the Department that no evidence of a fluorine problem has been found thus far. Investigations into this issue are ongoing and while results from EPA monitoring of emissions from the factory in question are becoming available, they have not yet been analysed. Preliminary indications suggest, however, that there has been little deposition on the farm and levels of fluorine have been barely detectable.</P>
    <P>The Department hopes to arrange for 2 June another meeting attended by all the parties involved. It is also hoped the EPA will make available further information on its findings at this meeting and that the farmer, veterinary practitioners and officials from the Department and various agencies involved will be present. Several meetings have taken place since last August when the herd health programme, an important aspect of this case, was put in place.</P>
    <P>The Department has great sympathy for the farmer concerned given all that he has experienced. We advise him to continue to take expert advice on the segregation of animals, feed trials and management of the farm while tests are ongoing. I hope the meeting on 2 June will provide further information on the environmental position.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the farmer has fully co-operated with the Department and agencies on the feed trials and experiments taking place on his farm. The evidence suggests that all his farm practices are entirely in line with normal <Col N="1690"/>practice and should not have any impact on the problems experienced on his farm for several years. I am particularly concerned that the EPA has not provided scientific data it must have accumulated through its routine monitoring of fluorine, a substance proposed as one of the possible causes of the problems on the farm.</P>
    <P>Professor Gardiner from UCD states that the die-back in relation to foliage does not appear to have been caused by any fungal, bacterial or insect pest and is consistent with pollution damage. This gives a clear indication of the professor&rsquo;s views on where the problem lies. I ask that the Department and EPA make every effort to monitor all aspects of pollution at the farm, including historical matters.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><NameTxt>Ms M. Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure the Deputy that the Department and all the players at the table, including the EPA, Teagasc and the veterinary faculty of UCD, will continue to make an important input into this issue and make every effort to resolve it. I stress, however, that no specific source of the problems on the farm in question has been identified to date, despite the commitment of considerable expert and financial resources by the Department and other agencies.</P>
    <P>As regards management changes on the farm, hutches were provided to facilitate segregation of calves and funding was provided for the treatment of mastitis and a vaccination programme. A great deal of work has already been carried out and a new crop of calves is being monitored to assess the impact of segregation.</P>
    <P>To clarify the position, while results from the EPA&rsquo;s monitoring of emissions are becoming available, they are still being analysed. The Department hopes more information will be made available at the next meeting on 2 June. Decisions were taken at the previous meeting on 9 February on other matters which could be assessed at that point and further work that could be undertaken on epidemiology, the ecology and the environment. The results of work carried out since that date should be available to the farmer at the 2 June meeting. Although there are difficulties in providing the farmer concerned with the results of tests as they become available, the EPA is still analysing data on emissions.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>While the decision to hold a meeting on 2 June is welcome, I ask that these matters be expedited because the farmer in question has suffered for a long time for reasons which appear to be outside his control. This has cost him and his family an enormous amount of money, which is a matter of great concern.</P>
    <P>Surely EPA results from continuous monitoring should have been made available. I am concerned that no results have been made available. I hope all the relevant data will be provided to the farmer at the meeting of 2 June.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1691"/>
   <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><NameTxt>Ms M. Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope we emerge from the meeting on 2 June knowing much more than we do today. The Department&rsquo;s veterinary department is preparing a detailed report on all the work carried out on specific animals on the farm and other matters. A large number of people have carried out a considerable amount of work on this issue. More will be done, however, and there will be no difficulty in making available to the farmer information as it arises.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
     <Quest>her plans in relation to the opposition from most farmers, especially those in the horticultural sector, to an introduction of genetically modified seed, crops or animals to Ireland and of the genetically modified organism trial planned for a farm (details supplied) in County Meath; if her attention has been drawn to the unanimous vote by Meath County Council that the county be declared a GMO free zone; and if she will request within the EU the right of self-determination for a region or a country to be declared free of GM seed, crops or animals as the Austrian Government has demanded.</Quest>
     <QRef>[18993/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I am well aware of the degree of opposition by some members of the public to the cultivation and use of GM crops here and of concerns about those crops from both a health and an environmental perspective. It has been for these very reasons that the European Union has adopted a series of legislative measures in recent years that ensure the most stringent conditions are in place in the regulation and control of GM crops and their products within the European Community.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that in the adoption of this GMO legislation protracted debates and readings took place before the texts were finally agreed by the European Parliament and Council of Ministers under the co-decision procedure. This legislation is binding on all member states and must be compatible with our international commitments. In this regard, we are awaiting the final report of the WTO disputes panel on the claims by the US, Argentina and Canada that the <i>de facto</i> moratorium on the approval of new GM products within the EU constituted an economic barrier to trade.</P>
    <P>To take stock of the current situation on the cultivation of GM crops, the Austrian Presidency organised an informative conference in Vienna last month, which I attended along with officials from the Department of Agriculture and Food, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. In addressing the conference, Commissioner Fischer Boel strongly restated EU policy as meaning that European farmers should be able to choose between conventional, organic and GM pro<Col N="1692"/>duction. EU legislation facilitates this freedom of choice. However, enshrined in this freedom is the understanding that farmers who would like to continue with their current farming practices should be able to do so.</P>
    <P>In recognising the diversity of farm patterns across Europe, the European Commission has placed the responsibility on each member state to draw up its own national strategy to ensure effective co-existence. Ireland, like the majority of member states, is in the process of deciding on what strategies should be employed if the farming community decides to commence the cultivation of GM crops in this country.</P>
    <P>For the sake of clarity, I remind the House that the control and legislation of GMOs and GM products in Ireland cuts across three different Departments. The Minister for Health and Children, in conjunction with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, deals with issues relating to GM foods. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is responsible, in conjunction with the EPA, for matters relating to the authorisation of new GM crops for their deliberate release into the environment. The EPA also deals with applications to carry out trials for GM crops in this country similar to the recent GM potato application made by BASF for a trial in County Meath, to which the EPA has given its approval.</P>
    <P>The responsibility of the Department of Agriculture and Food relates to the growing of authorised GM crops alongside non-GM crops in a way that is harmonious to all crop production types and is in compliance with the legal obligations for labelling and purity criteria. This is generally referred to as GM co-existence. In 2003, we established an interdepartmental-interagency working group to identify the issues and implications for Ireland of the cultivation of GM crops and to develop proposals for a national strategy and best practices. The working group completed its work in December last and a public consultation process has just been completed. I am in the process of considering the observations received in conjunction with the recommendations made in the report and I hope to be in a position to bring forward some strategies and procedures to facilitate co-existence of GM and non-GM crops by the end of the year.</P>
   
  <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department has taken over responsibility for future applications for approval of GM feeds and will deal with the issue of threshold for GM seeds when agreed by the Council of Environment Ministers.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the vote taken by Meath County Council to have that county declared as a GM-free zone but, as I have indicated to the House on previous occasions, EU legislation on the culti<Col N="1693"/>vation of GM crops, which was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council and which is binding on all member states, does not provide for the unilateral declaration of a GM-free country. There are, however, options available to restrict the growing of GM crops within regions of a country such as voluntary measures or in cases where, on the basis of sound scientific evidence, individual GM crops cannot be cultivated in certain areas of the country.</P>
    <P>On the final issue raised by the Deputy regarding my intervention within the EU to seek the right of self-determination for a region or a country to be declared GM free, I am of the view that a considerable amount of work has been invested by both the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers over the past decade to have in place a suite of GM legislation which provides for one of the most effective and stringent GM authorisation procedures in the world. While it is prudent to review the operation of this legislation regularly, I do not believe that there are logical grounds at this time to initiate any radical changes to the regime.</P>
</Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I expected that answer from the Minister of State and I thank him for it. However, I have to ask whether he would be so sanguine about co-existence if we were discussing foot-and-mouth disease.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not talking about that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I know we are not but if we were talking about co-existence in one area where there was foot-and-mouth disease and another area where we wanted to keep it out, I do not think the Minister of State would be so sanguine about the issue. I know the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply is probably as up to date as possible but I have a leak of information from the World Trade Organisation ruling which follows the complaint by the US, Canada and Argentina. It states that the World Trade Organisation has ruled that the EU has violated international rules. However, a Commission spokesperson with more integrity than some, said that Europe will continue to set its own rules on the import and sale of GMO foods. It is a matter of making a stand and not just going along with what seems to be the most powerful corporate interests that are not operating in the interests of Irish farmers. Neither do they operate in the interests of the EU&rsquo;s population, 79% of whom are consistently opposed to GM products. We depend on those people for our markets.</P>
    <P>More than 3,400 local authorities throughout the EU, including Meath County Council, Clare County Council and Bray Town Council, have declared themselves as GMO-free areas. Does the Minister of State consider it important to stand with the democratically declared decisions of those local authorities and ensure that their <Col N="1694"/>rights to self-determination are protected? Will he also take on board the failure of co-existence? It is clear from a report in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> that co-existence is not working in Spain, for example. Two Spanish farming organisations tested 40 farms and found unwanted GM material on seven of them. In one case, the contamination was 12.6%. The Minister of State may consider that co-existence is the bee&rsquo;s knees but he will get a rude awakening when people come banging on his door saying he said it would work but it did not.</P>
    <P>We should apply the rigours of scientific evidence to date. We should also apply the precautionary principle we were supposed to be signing up to in the EU and ensure we do not find ourselves closing the stable door when the horse has bolted. If we effectively become a GM country it will be serious in terms of our future status as a clean, green food island. The Minister of State should encourage farmers who have already taken the initiative of having GM-free farms.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is this a question or a display of information?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking whether the Minister will encourage farmers to put those GM-free notices on their farm gates so they will be able to ensure their wishes are upheld.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>No bother.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>If we get a chance. I want to emphasise that we will continue to adopt our precautionary approach in this area. Decisions have not yet been made on co-existence. GM co-existence is the one area where subsidiarity is permitted within the GMO regulatory framework. Co-existence refers to the ability of farmers to make a practical choice between conventional, organic and GM crop production. EU legislation provides that all three types of agriculture are permitted within the EU.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sargent referred to GM-free zones. Under EU legislation it is not possible unilaterally to declare a GM-free area. The only two possibilities are where there is a voluntary agreement among all growers in a region not to grow a GM crop or crops, or where the safeguard clause is enacted. That clause concerns a member state which has detailed grounds, on the basis of scientific evidence, that a GMO constitutes a risk to human health or the environment. In that case, the member state may provisionally restrict or prohibit the growing of that GM crop on its territory or in a region within its territory. The Commission must then be immediately informed and will decide within 60 days if the ban is scientifically based and will give its decision.</P>
    <P>Following questions from Deputy Sargent on a previous occasion, I stated that our Department has been involved in a widespread consultative <Col N="1695"/>process. That consultation process has now been completed. Individuals and organisations were invited to put forward views, all of which will be considered, analysed and dealt with before co-existing measures are finalised.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>As regards co-existence, I would argue that the Irish Sea is the only satisfactory buffer one can stand over scientifically when it comes to the pollen we are talking about.</P>

	<P>Following a number of successful years for the Irish dairy industry on international and EU markets, 2006 is proving to be more challenging for the industry. The butter market, in particular, is under severe pressure on both the EU and international markets. Exports of dairy products, except cheese, are considerably lower than in 2005, with EU butter exports 35% less than the volumes exported during the previous GATT year.</P>
    <P>The euro-dollar exchange rate has a significant impact on our competitiveness and the current weakness of the dollar is adding to the difficulties of EU traders. The internal butter market is also weak and butter prices in most member states are at or below intervention level. The intervention limit of 50,000 tonnes is likely to be reached within the next month after which a tendering system for intervention purchases will be introduced.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>As this situation developed over recent months, I have urged the Commissioner on several occasions to use the market management tools in a more effective manner to ensure the overall stability of the milk sector. In particular, my key concern was to see the export refund regime used to maximum effect to dispose of product onto international markets outside the EU. I am pleased the Commission responded by increasing export refunds for butter and whole milk powder at the end of April and again at the last milk management committee when the tender refunds were accepted at a higher level for butter and butter oil. I have again asked the Commissioner to keep the focus for 2006 on the need to maintain the competitiveness of EU dairy exports, with particular reference to butter and to manage the introduction of the new tender arrangements for butter intervention in a manner that avoids causing further instability in the market.</P><Col N="1696"/>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
    <P>I would of course emphasise that dairy farmers&rsquo; incomes are not alone dependent on EU market supports although I fully appreciate the importance of internal aids and export subsidies for competitive trading conditions. Other elements impacting on farmers&rsquo; incomes include direct payments, scale, efficiency and returns from the market. This year&rsquo;s milk price, taken together with the single payment entitlement of 3.6 cent per litre, is similar to recent years although clearly there is greater pressure on producer prices than heretofore.</P>
    <P>Since the Luxembourg agreement of 2003 the dairy sector is operating in a new policy framework where market forces have an even greater influence on the price paid for milk. It is critical that we continue to manage the market so we maintain relative competitiveness. I will continue to focus on managing the transition to the next stage of intervention price reductions in July with the aim of maintaining and enhancing industry competitiveness and, ultimately, farm incomes.</P>
    <P>At national level I have already announced my intention to move to a more open market system of transferring milk quotas between producers with the ultimate aim of increasing the scale and long-term efficiency of dairy production in Ireland. My Department also has a number of support schemes providing grant assistance to dairy farmers with the aim of facilitating dairy farmers to increase efficiencies and improve their facilities, thereby safeguarding their long-term farm income. These include the dairy hygiene scheme, whereby grant aid is available to assist dairy farmers in the upgrading of their dairying facilities. In addition, dairy farmers are eligible for grants under the new farm waste management scheme, while young dairy farmers are also eligible for a grant under the installation aid scheme. Collectively, these grant schemes are designed to assist farmers who wish to upgrade, modernise and increase the efficiencies of their operations.</P>
    <P>I am confident as we complete the final phases of the 2003 Luxembourg agreement and make the necessary market adjustments intended by that agreement, instability in the dairy market will recede. In the meantime I will continue to impress upon the Commissioner the importance of maintaining a competitive market for EU dairy products.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for an intensive and long answer. Unfortunately, it does not change the situation with regard to the income of dairy farmers. The Minister suggested that scale will solve the problem.</P>

	<P>No, I did not.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1697"/>
   <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>Can she explain why the biggest single dairy farmer in County Monaghan has opted to sell out? It is simply because there is no income. Does the Minister acknowledge there is absolute panic in this regard? Currently, for whatever reason, farm leaders are bringing that panic to bear on co-ops but co-ops are only passing on the result of the Minister&rsquo;s predecessors&rsquo; negotiations at WTO and European level, namely, a collapse in milk prices. When the Commissioner was in the Chamber last week, it was clear she had no knowledge whatsoever of the seriousness of the situation. I ask the Minister to treble her efforts at EU level to make sure that instead of the pittance handed back to us at the last management committee meeting, the next meeting delivers real help to the industry so prices can be maintained.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister considered increasing funding for research and development? I understand that only 4% of the overall national funding towards research and development goes to the food industry whereas the industry accounts for one fifth of net exports. Has she considered removing the disease and dairy inspection levies? The co-op to which I send my milk &mdash; I have a personal interest in this regard &mdash; takes most of its supply from Northern Ireland. Farmers in Northern Ireland do not have to pay a dairy inspection levy or a disease levy. These issues are within the control of the Minister. Will she consider giving the &euro;500 to &euro;800 cost of the levies back to farmers at a time when the country is awash with money?</P>
    <P>Farmers are under extreme pressure, the like of which I have never seen. One need only consider the results of the Lakeland Dairies meeting in Cavan or any other dairy meeting throughout the country to understand the frustration. If it had not been for the change in the milk quota regime for this year, there is no doubt many more farmers would have opted out. We will see that happen next year.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The accusation that the changes I am promoting in the policy framework in any way had a detrimental effect on the price of milk is totally erroneous. Moreover, the Commissioner did not say that she had no knowledge of the implications of the 2003 Luxembourg agreement on dairy prices. That is factually incorrect.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>She made it clear she was not aware of it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>To be exact, she stated the product mix in Ireland was causing us difficulties, which is true. This concerns the issue of butter, a fact the Deputy, as a dairy farmer, understands.</P>
    <P>The price of milk is not an issue for me as Minister. It is an issue between the farmers, who are professionals, and the co-ops to which they send their milk. I am acutely aware of the issues that <Col N="1698"/>arise and the concerns expressed by the two groups, the dairy farmers and the co-ops, most particularly with regard to competitiveness. I will continue to support the necessity of the export refund mechanism in order to address some of those issues. However, in the medium to long term we will have to examine the product mix. This will not be done instantly but we will have to consider the issue. It is a big decision and one we will all have to work towards in the context of the future of the dairy sector.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issue of scale, I did not say scale is the only way forward. It is one part of the issue, but there are other factors such as access to quota, efficiencies, issues with the co-op movement, access to new markets and new product development. The Deputy was correct to suggest the issue of research and development in the dairy sector will be vital to its future development. I have greatly supported the research and development movement in many aspects, including with regard to the university sector, the institutes of technology, Teagasc and working with the dairy sector. I agree with the Deputy it is very important for the future development of the sector.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of initiatives have been made available through my Department and Enterprise Ireland. We will continue to work with the sector to enhance and increase the research and development capability. That will be an absolute priority for me.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I must repeat my questions because they are very serious. Will the Minister redouble her efforts in Brussels? I did not blame the Minister personally for what happened in Brussels under the regime of her predecessor and the Taoiseach. They led the negotiations and the results are there in black and white. The Irish Dairy Board can spell out day by day and week by week how the results happened. The Minister&rsquo;s comments are erroneous.</P>
    <P>Will she make decisions at ministerial level that will increase the income of dairy farmers, not by much but by enough to act as a gesture of goodwill? If she has not already examined the disease and dairy inspection levies, will she please do so to make some gesture of goodwill towards a good industry, which was the best industry in the country but which is now under severe pressure?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is vital that certain issues in the dairy sector are dealt with. The issue of cost and how it is to be removed from the sector is one on which I have worked continuously and will continue to work. We will achieve delivery on that. Other issues arise such as that of the world trade talks and their impact on the dairy sector, which is serious. I will work to the best of <Col N="1699"/>my ability to ensure we get the best outcome, that we achieve safeguard clauses and that we have as much protection for the sector as possible.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the view that my predecessor or the Taoiseach in any way undermined the dairy sector in the 2003 Luxembourg agreement. I will explain why this is so. The then Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, led the discussions on this issue in the 2003 agreement on the basis of the best way forward for farming, namely a decoupled reorientation of a policy framework that would allow us to develop. If not for the Taoiseach&rsquo;s negotiating skills, we would not have had the necessary support mechanisms and guarantees until 2013. He succeeded in that task despite the objections of many of his colleagues, for whom agriculture was less important than it is for this economy.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
     <Quest>if she will make a statement on the closure of the Irish Sugar plant at Mallow; and if she will agree to meet workers&rsquo; representatives from the plant to discuss issues arising from the closure and the future of the plant and Greencore.</Quest>
     <QRef>[18940/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The decision by Greencore to discontinue sugar production and close the Irish Sugar plant at Mallow was a commercial decision by the company, having regard to market forces and the agreement on reform of the EU sugar regime. Throughout the negotiations on reform of the EU sugar regime, my primary objective was to seek to modify the Commission&rsquo;s proposals to ensure the continuation of an efficient sugar processing sector in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I held several meetings with the Commissioner in that regard and Ireland played an active role in a group of 11 member states with common cause in seeking to modify the proposals. The group remained steadfast in its opposition to the reform proposals from the time they were first mooted in July 2004 until the final Council meeting in November 2005. When it became evident at the Council meeting that there was not sufficient political support to adapt the proposals to the extent necessary, I focused my efforts on securing a compensation package worth &euro;310 million to Irish stakeholders. I also succeeded in having the reform arrangements introduced in a manner that opened up the possibility of continuing sugar processing in Ireland for a further two campaigns. Unfortunately, the subsequent deterioration in the market was obviously a decisive factor for Greencore and on 15 March the company announced its decision to cease sugar production.</P>
    <P>Since the announcement of the closure of the Mallow plant, I have met workers&rsquo; representatives and arranged to meet the unions involved to <Col N="1700"/>provide whatever clarification is required on the sugar reform agreement and the emerging Commission implementing rules.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to learn the Minister met the workers, with whom I have also been in contact. They are alarmed, to say the least, about the severence package. In the context of the State&rsquo;s golden share in the company, has the Minister met any success in using her influence to ensure the payment of the agreed severance package?</P>
    <P>I presume the Minister has met beet producers&rsquo; representatives. The figure I have been quoted with regard to the compensation package to these producers is &euro;106 million. Does the Minister support that figure and, if so, will she ensure Greencore lives up to its responsibilities? This company, which has benefitted from the public purse, presided over the loss of hundreds of jobs and the threat to the livelihood of several thousand others in ancillary businesses, not to mention 3,800 beet producers, yet it claims the final say on compensation. Will the Minister ensure the Government has the final say and that compensation for beet producers will be adequate?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The golden share only comes into play if a certain percentage of the company&rsquo;s sugar assets are sold. It does not allow me to interfere with the day-to-day management of the company or to influence decisions on severance pay. However, a number of my colleagues expressed their concerns to me about the Labour Court agreement. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, and I have urged the company to adhere to the agreement and I believe it will do so. In light of the concerns of workers at the plant, it is important that the matter is addressed.</P>
    <P>With regard to compensation to beet producers, the figure of &euro;106 million was proposed prior to the finalisation of the Council regulation. A 45 day process has been put in place so that Greencore can hold discussions with all those involved in the fund, following which it will bring proposals to me. A decision has to be made within the following 30 days as to whether the proposal will be accepted. The Government has appointed someone to advise on the basis of the proposals, after which the decision will be made. The Commission, which has a limited timeframe to consider the proposal, hopes to finalise the matter by the end of September and the funds will then be distributed according to a programme that has already been established. I cannot now make a definite estimate on the amount of money that will be made available because the process has yet to be completed.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the concerns of those in the sugar beet sector, including workers, hauliers, contractors and the company itself but these concerns will have to be addressed in the context of <Col N="1701"/>the process which began last Friday. My Department has placed advertisements to seek the views of people on the basis of the consultation period.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is welcome that the Minister believes the company will agree to the Labour Court recommendations. I presume she made her views known to workers&rsquo; representatives, who are concerned that Greencore is preparing to refute the agreement it reached some time ago.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister, Deputy Martin, and I have publicly expressed the opinion that the company should agree to the Labour Court recommendations. The process will be completed shortly and I will meet union representatives again on this matter.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
     <Quest>the steps her Department has taken in 2006 to raise awareness of animal health conditions regarding personal imports of meat and milk; the methods she is considering to overcome the problem of targeting non-EU originating passengers who arrive here via hub airports from high risk countries such as Nigeria, China, Malaysia, Thailand and Russia; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[18878/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><NameTxt>Ms M. Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>Harmonized EU regulations have been introduced to control the import and trade in meat and milk products. Imports of these products, including the imports for personal use, are banned, other than where products are presented at approved border inspection posts.</P>
    <P>My Department has a number of measures in place to raise awareness of these regulations. Transport operators who bring passengers from third countries into the EU are required to bring the regulations, including the ban, to the attention of passengers. Announcements are made on airlines and posters are on display at arrivals halls in airports and at disembarkation points for sea passengers. Amnesty bins have been provided in the main airports for surrender of any animal product that has been inadvertently carried. My Department has posted information on its website and transport operators, foreign embassies accredited to this country and Irish embassies abroad have been requested to inform travellers to this country of the position regarding personal imports of these products and invited to include a link to my Department&rsquo;s web page.</P>
    <P Just="Left">My Department also liaises with Customs and Excise in respect of personal and commercial import controls of animal and food products. Officials from my Department are deployed at <Col N="1702"/>border inspection posts and other disembarkation points to carry out passenger interviews and bag searches on a random basis. This approach is particularly useful in the identification of passengers coming here from third countries, most of whom arrive here through hub airports in other EU member states. Customs and Excise and departmental officials co-operate locally at these points. Customs and Excise also operates controls in respect of the worldwide ban on import of animal and animal products of endangered species. The countries listed by the Deputy are those where my Department&rsquo;s officers intercepted the highest level of personal import of these products during 2005. I assure the Deputy that our controls continue to operate in 2006 and that satisfactory measures are in place to prevent illegal personal imports. My Department will continue to review its controls in this area.</P>
    <P>The Commission also monitors operation of personal import controls by the member states through its food and veterinary office. It is considering proposals including the introduction of a requirement for a written declaration to be made by each third country originating passenger concerning meat and milk products in their personal possession.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been looking at some information given recently to my colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Shea, and I notice that quite a substantial amount of meat and milk products has been detected, but there is no specific targeting. My understanding is that it is only where searches are carried out by Customs and Excise for excisable goods that any food or food products have been detected. If that is so, I would have some concerns, given our concerns about foot and mouth disease, for example, which we debated earlier. Other exotic diseases may now be imported into the country.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I would not expect the Minister for Agriculture and Food to provide exact figures, but has anyone ever voluntarily presented at the border posts to admit possession in luggage of exotic meat, for example, which the person would like to hand over? I am curious if any volunteers have ever come forward. In all the times I have passed through Dublin Airport, I have yet to see anyone but myself declaring for example that he or she has been on a farm while abroad. I wonder if anyone has ever presented carrying a food product.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><NameTxt>Ms M. Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>Our understanding is that there is very active vigilance and great co-operation between our Department and the Customs and Excise personnel searching for excisable goods. Searches are carried out in conjunction with both. One of the key ways we have of identifying people coming from third countries is to interview them. We find the interviews are a suc<Col N="1703"/>cess in that respect, and they are followed by the searching of bags.</P>
    <P>With regard to voluntary disclosures in the airports, bins are provided and the hope is that with extensive advertising, announcements on aircraft and the substantial number of posters provided by our Department in several languages, somebody who inadvertently carries a product might realise they should dispose of the product in the bin provided.</P>
    <P>We also encourage the embassies to be actively involved, as well as the transport operators, whom we ask to suggest that passengers check our website. Between all of that, and the postering, we feel the message should get across.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>To clarify my earlier comments with regard to the food and veterinary office, I was trying to say the officials might as well be on holidays in Brazil in terms of the impact the reports are having when they return.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not our office. It is the European office to which the Deputy refers.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, the European office, sorry. The Minister of State noted the posters. We all have experience of going through Dublin Airport and the reality is that it is a fair achievement to see the monitors in baggage control, never mind look at posters, when people are coming through the airport.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister looked at reviewing the fines in place, or providing multi-language information on flights, on the website and on the monitors in Dublin Airport in particular, as well as in the other airports? Has the Minister considered enhancing the presence of the Department of Agriculture and Food there? I have never seen an official from the Department at Dublin Airport.</P>

	<P>Is the bin full?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>This is quite a serious issue. Looking at the figures, there are almost 1,000 kg of identified meat products alone carried. There seems to be nothing proactive in targeting any of that, and finding it is coincidental when people are stopped for other reasons. There seems to be no process in place for identifying food products being brought in. It happens only coincidentally through the activities of the Customs and Excise staff. Against the background of our concerns about importing other animal diseases, there is a <Col N="1704"/>need for a more proactive role for the Department in this area.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>When I hear the Garda talk for example of estimating that only some 10% of cocaine brought in is intercepted, I wonder if there is a similar estimate in this area. Can the Minister give a percentage? What training is provided by the Department of Agriculture and Food for Customs and Excise officers and garda&iacute; who are also at points of entry? I am sure the officials in the Department are not the only ones asked to carry out this duty.</P>
    <P>What comparison is made with other countries which have the white status as a clean food country, in terms of their mechanisms? Are we comparing notes with other countries which have a lot to lose, as we do, if we were to lose that status?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><NameTxt>Ms M. Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to a multi-language campaign, I was in the Department today to see the number of posters available in 52 different languages, so that shows the effort in that area.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Yet it does not do much good.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><NameTxt>Ms M. Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to departmental staff at Dublin Airport, the Minister of State, Deputy Smith, is whispering in my ear to complain that a person from his office was recently transferred to the airport. The airport staff has been enhanced recently.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it the case that people do not get transferred to the islands now, but to Dublin Airport?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><NameTxt>Ms M. Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is complaining he has lost a good member of staff, so the best of staff are being transferred to Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>Deputy Upton asked about identifying food. One area currently under consideration is the deployment of sniffer dogs specially trained to detect food. Anything else that can be done with regard to this issue will be done, but our current experience indicates that interviewing and bag searching produces the high quantities, so to speak, and the success we have in finding illegal consignments.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Sargent&rsquo;s question on statistics, in 2005 there were approximately 565 illegal consignments in personal luggage and of those almost 3,000 kg of meat products and 237 kg of milk products were involved.</P>
    <P>With regard to staff, there has to be Department staff on duty at the three main airports at all times. As for Deputy Sargent&rsquo;s question about other countries, we are obliged to send annual reports to the European Commission, which monitors the situation very closely in Ireland and the other EU countries. The Commission is continually reviewing the situation and is considering <Col N="1705"/>a written declaration for passengers originating from third countries. We already fill in such declarations when we travel to the United States.</P>
    <P>The situation is constantly under review both in the Department and in the EU. We have provided the necessary staff at the ports.</P>

     <asker>Mr. Gogarty</asker>
     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
     <Quest>the number of cases and the respective charges made under the Noxious Weeds Act 1936; and if a review of the legislation is being planned to include, for example, the dangerous giant hogweed which at present is an impediment to the development of farm tourism.</Quest>
     <QRef>[18756/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The Noxious Weeds Act 1936 provides for the control of the spread of the following six noxious weeds: thistle, ragwort, dock, common barbery, male wild hop plant and wild oat. Under the Act, it is an offence not to prevent the spread of these noxious weeds. The owner, occupier, user or manager of lands on which these weeds are growing is liable, upon conviction, to be fined. In the case of fences and margins of public roads, the local authority charged with the maintenance of such roads is the responsible body.</P>
    <P>While the last prosecution under the Act was in June 1988, the Department continues to enforce the Act by issuing a notice to destroy when it is aware of the presence of noxious weeds. In 2005, 12 notices to destroy were issued and these were followed up by a visit from an officer to ensure the notice was complied with. Under the EU single farm payment scheme farmers are obliged to keep their land free from noxious weeds under the cross-compliance measures of the scheme. Failure to do so may result in a reduction of their payment entitlements.</P>
    <P>The need to raise public awareness of the importance of controlling these weeds has been an ongoing activity in my Department. This year two publicity campaigns were launched. The first campaign in February consisted of posters which were forwarded to public bodies, including Garda stations, local authorities, Department of Agriculture and Food regional offices, Teagasc offices and agricultural merchants, for display in public places and press notices in the national and regional newspapers.</P>
    <P>The second campaign this month has been launched to remind landowners and users that ragwort can still be controlled on farmed grasslands by spraying, cutting or pulling, followed by removal and destruction of the weed. The reason for removal is that following spraying, cutting or pulling, ragwort is still poisonous and becomes more palliative to animals. In addition, all local authorities will again be reminded of their responsibilities under the Act.</P><Col N="1706"/>
    <P>My Department is currently examining the provisions of the Act with a view to updating and strengthening them in accordance with good agricultural and environmental practice. The Noxious Weeds Act 1936 was introduced to deal with specific weeds that posed a threat to farm productivity. Giant hogweed has not been classified as a noxious weed under the Noxious Weeds Act 1936 on the basis that it has no agricultural significance as it is not generally found in productive agricultural areas. Accordingly, I have no plans to list giant hogweed under the Noxious Weeds Act.</P>
    <P>Giant hogweed is an invasive species and is the responsibility of the national parks and wildlife service under the aegis of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>

	<P>Please do not draw the picture.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that the last prosecution was in 1988, there is probably a need for a review, whether that is of the fines or of the context in which the legislation was framed. The threat to farm productivity condition should also be reviewed. Farming has changed significantly and farm tourism is now a large part of diversification. Will the Minister acknowledge that the giant hogweed appears in productive areas, whether it be in grassland or in areas close to watercourses? It spreads rampantly along watercourses. Will the Minister consider that in the context of the criterion of the weed being a threat to farm productivity? Just because it is not harmful to cattle does not mean it is not a threat to farm productivity. Perhaps he will review the legislation on that basis.</P>

When was the last occasion a local authority was prosecuted? The Minister of State might not have those figures to hand but perhaps he will forward them to us. While the enforcement takes place with regard to farmers, and there is a threat to the single farm payment, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the local authorities are not enforcing their part of the legislation. Are there any plans to enhance enforcement of this legislation now that additional staff are available in the Department?</P>
    <P>There is an ongoing review with regard to coexistence with GM crops. As I travelled <Col N="1707"/>throughout the country in recent weeks I noticed a substantial amount of rapeseed growing on roadsides. If at some future date a GM rapeseed crop is introduced in this country, it will be critical to address the issue of wild rapeseed. It is important that such plants and crops are also considered in the context of the review of this legislation.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The report of the joint committee covered a range of issues and I responded to it in detail. A number of the committee&rsquo;s recommendations are precluded by the EU regulations under which the current scheme and its predecessor operate. I saw some merit in certain other aspects of the committee&rsquo;s report, specifically those relating to income limits and the maximum age of transferees in the current scheme. However, this scheme will close to new applications in December and the practical effect of any such changes would now be very small.</P><Col N="1708"/>
    <P>The committee paid particular attention to two issues. One was the implications of decoupling for retired farmers who had leased out quota as well as land to transferees during the single payment reference period. We have secured the best deal we could for people in this situation, in spite of the fact that the Commission was unsympathetic at the outset. In family cases, where a farm reverted to the retired farmer at the end of a lease without any entitlements, a family member taking it over will have access to the national reserve. Retired farmers in the current scheme who farmed during the reference period can activate entitlements and lease them to their transferees. At the end of the lease they can either sell the entitlements with or without land or lease the entitlements with land.</P>
    <P>The other issue the joint committee focused on was the levels of payment under the two schemes. The European Commission has repeatedly ruled out the idea of indexation in the current scheme and has pointed out that the rate in the earlier scheme was set at the maximum amount for co-funding that the regulation allowed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>The huge frustration that exists is mainly due to the fact that it has not been index linked. It has not kept pace with inflation or with the social welfare increases in recent years. The differential at present is quite marginal. Is it possible to ensure any future scheme will be linked to social welfare payment increases? Is there a mechanism that can increase the rate of pension available to people under the farm retirement scheme?</P>
    <P>The clawback is causing much frustration for farmers. Those in receipt of the early retirement scheme pension were subsequently deemed eligible for a State pension. However, in some cases the farmer did not inform the Department of Agriculture and Food and the payments had to be clawbacked. In one instance in the Cavan-Monaghan constituency, an individual has received a bill for &euro;35,000. Will the Minister address the issue?</P>
    <P>There are several tax-related anomalies in the system regarding the long-term lease of stamp duty, the agricultural relief for the retired person, once the ten years are over, tax affairs and forestry grants. Will some of the anomalies be addressed to encourage participation in the scheme or any future scheme?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>As I indicated, the issue of indexation is a principle that is not accepted by the Commission. However, a new scheme will be introduced. The decision on the scheme&rsquo;s emphasis will be based on the outcome of the partnership negotiations and overall funding for the rural development package. There are concerns about the issue of the clawback. There were cases where some farmers may not have advised the Depart<Col N="1709"/>ment that they had an entitlement to a State pension. That is now being dealt with in that the two Departments communicate with each other on the matter. There was an issue with the data protection officer who indicated that direct access between the two Departments&rsquo; computer systems was not allowed. On the basis of the application, we are in a position to ensure the administrative difficulty is addressed.</P>
    <P>Several years ago when the scheme was introduced, the State pension was much lower. Now, thanks to this good Government, the State pension is at a high level. The difference between the two pensions has been reduced and there is no enticement to enter the scheme.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Should there not be a mechanism to increase it incrementally?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the EU regulation, there is a ceiling at which a payment is allowed to be made. That ceiling will be considered for the new rural development package. The Commission does not believe in indexation. I agree the anomaly can cause some serious issues.</P>
    <P>The other issue of concern is that once the Commission&rsquo;s auditors and the Comptroller and Auditor General examine the schemes, they put pressure on the Departments to ensure the clawback is paid. There are people who are old and vulnerable and through no fault of their own find themselves in these difficulties. We try to consider each case individually to see what can be done. Unfortunately, often we are so precluded by these regulations that we do not have the flexibility that we would have ourselves. It is an ongoing issue and we will continue to evaluate the recommendations of the report from the Oireachtas committee.</P>

	<P>The framework agreement for the current WTO round which was concluded in Geneva in August 2004 commits member countries, including the EU, to negotiate detailed rules, including an end-date for the parallel elimination of all forms of export subsidies and for the introduction of disciplines on export measures with equivalent effect. The framework agreement covers export refunds, export credits, the trade-distorting practices of state trading enterprises and food aid practices which are not in conformity with disciplines to be introduced.</P>
    <P>At the WTO Hong Kong ministerial conference in December 2005 agreement was reached on an end date of 2013 for all forms of <Col N="1710"/>export subsidy. The EU&rsquo;s acceptance of this end date was conditional on the application of equivalent disciplines on all forms of export subsidy. The parallel elimination of all export subsidies should ensure equal competition on the world market for all exporters.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Negotiations on the new WTO round are continuing and I am committed to ensuring full parallel elimination of all forms of export subsidy is delivered by our negotiating partners and that, in so far as EU export refunds are concerned, the most flexible phasing-out arrangements are achieved.</P>
   
  <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House</P>
    <P>The elimination of export subsidies is only one element of the current negotiations. Market access is another key element of the negotiations and, in that regard, in addition to tariff reductions and sensitive products issues, I will be seeking to ensure non-trade concerns are fully taken on board. I fully support the policy that animal products imported into the EU from third countries meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, EU member states. I have concerns that there is not real equivalence regarding animal traceability, controls on veterinary medicines, prohibited substances and residue monitoring programmes in respect of imports from certain third countries. I have already been in contact with the Commissioner on this matter on several occasions and I will continue to use every opportunity to voice my concerns.

    <sTitle>Nursing Home Subventions.</sTitle>
   <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>Nursing home subvention levels are payable by the HSE. The subvention is means-tested and there are considerable problems associated with the means by which applicants are measured. The most substantive issue, however, is the subvention amount. Prevailing market conditions among private nursing homes makes the means-testing and the subvention amounts meaningless.</P>
    <P>I have received many complaints about this. In Ennis, I have one instance where an individual is paying &euro;1,500 a month to a nursing home. Despite the resident being on the top level of subvention &mdash; &euro;400 of this is for a special bed &mdash; he must pay an enormous sum to make up the deficit. For a person on a modest salary, paying &euro;1,100 a month for a relative in a nursing home is the equivalent to paying a sizeable mortgage.</P>
    <P>I have examined nursing home charges in County Clare. With the exception of public nursing homes, the amounts charged bear no relation to the subvention amounts paid. Six private nursing homes in County Clare charge between &euro;560 and &euro;657 a week for a private room. The cheapest rate I could find in the private sector was &euro;540 a week for a twin room. In contrast the amounts payable by the HSE for subvention are &euro;114, &euro;152.40 and &euro;190.50 a week, according to the level of dependency of the patient. Nursing home charges, therefore, amount to between three and four and a half times the subvention rate, without the luxury of a private room. If the modest old age pension of less than &euro;200 a week is applied, <Col N="1712"/>there is still a considerable shortfall which very often has to be met by hard-pressed relatives struggling with their own financial problems. If one is paying the more expensive nursing home charges being levied in the cities, such as in the Minister of State&rsquo;s area of Dublin, the gap widens even more.</P>
    <P>The Government&rsquo;s continuing failure to tackle the accident and emergency crisis has led to some people opting to stay at home to die rather than face the drudgery of the health service, as highlighted in last week&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme. Furthermore, due to the costs of private nursing home care and the State&rsquo;s failure to provide more realistic subvention levels, people are being forced to stay at home in more problematic conditions. Hardship cases cannot be taken on directly by the State because of the lack of sufficient numbers of public nursing home beds. Only applicants with nursing home needs can make it through the assessment criteria even though they must often wait a year or more before a place comes up. Those who are particularly vulnerable are bachelors and spinsters with no near relatives. Even if they have assets such as land or a home, for one reason or another they often cannot realise them. These people end their days in poverty. They may not be in ill health but cannot cook for themselves or carry out some basic tasks and they fall through the State safety net. This year is the 90th anniversary of the 1916 Rising and it is astonishing that elderly people are still treated in such a shabby manner. It is appalling that those who built the State should have to end their days in such conditions.</P>
    <P>I was amazed to learn that despite the huge rises in nursing home care costs, the Minister has not deemed it necessary to increase the subvention levels or to relax the means testing criteria in recent years. The Minister should also look at the discretionary hardship payments from the HSE. In County Clare, it is &euro;65 per week. This is not just discretionary it is subject to budgetary constraint and varies from region to region. Why is it not standardised and separate from budgetary conditions?</P>
    <P>I implore the Minister to look at this area, which is of great concern to the people of County Clare and other areas, and to increase subvention levels or authorise the HSE to provide finance to allow for the relaxation of the means test and standardisation of the discretionary hardship payment. The money should be spent where it is needed, not on wasteful projects such as electronic voting.</P>

	<P>I will take the Adjournment on behalf of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children. I thank the Deputy for raising the question as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to this <Col N="1713"/>House the current situation with regard to the nursing home subvention scheme.</P>
    <P>A nursing home subvention may be paid towards the cost of private nursing home care where a person is unable to meet the cost and where he or she has been assessed as needing nursing home care by the Health Service Executive and where the person has satisfied a means test. The amount of subvention granted will depend on the degree of nursing home care required, medium, high or maximum, and the amount of the person&rsquo;s assets, including property, stocks and shares, savings, etc. The rates of subvention payable are: medium dependency &euro;114.30 per week, high dependency &euro;152.40 per week and maximum dependency &euro;190.50 per week. The nursing home subvention scheme was introduced to assist with the cost of private nursing home charges and was not intended to cover the entire cost of nursing home care.</P>
    <P>Under Article 22.3 of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations 1993, the HSE may enter into an arrangement with a registered private nursing home to provide inpatient services under section 52 of the Health Act 1970. In making an arrangement with a private nursing home under Article 22.3, the HSE may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention, as mentioned already, relative to an individual&rsquo;s level of dependency, for example in cases where personal funds are exhausted, in accordance with Article 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) (Amendment) Regulations 1996. The application of these provisions, however is a matter for the HSE in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions. The average rate of subvention paid by the HSE generally exceeds the current approved basic rates.</P>
    <P>Spending on the nursing home subvention scheme has increased from &euro;5 million in 1993, when it was introduced, to &euro;140 million in 2005. Additional funding for services for older people and palliative care amounting to &euro;150 million was allocated in the 2006 budget. This is the largest ever increase in funding for services for older people and palliative care services and demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to older people and putting them at the centre of health policy now and in the future.</P>
    <P>The investment package is primarily focused on caring for people at home, in accordance with their expressed wishes. This is in line with international trends and reflects the growing independence of older people who want to stay living in their communities. However, for those requiring residential care, the Government has allocated an additional &euro;20 million towards the nursing home subvention scheme for 2006 to provide for extra subvention payments. The Department of Health and Children is also currently working on primary legislation to expand the policies and principles of the subvention scheme to facilitate implemen<Col N="1714"/>tation of the scheme by the HSE throughout the country and this legislation is currently proceeding through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The thresholds contained in the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations 1993 for an applicant&rsquo;s assets and the value of an applicant&rsquo;s primary residence, were increased by regulation on 14 December 2005 to bring them into line with today&rsquo;s values.</P>
    <P>A working group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and comprising senior officials from the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs was established following on from the publication of the Mercer report entitled, Study to Examine the Future Financing of Long-Term Care in Ireland. The objective of this group was to identify the policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care, taking account of the Mercer report, the views of the consultation that was undertaken on that report and the review of the nursing home subvention scheme by Professor Eamon O&rsquo;Shea. The report of the group has been submitted to Government, where it is being considered.</P>

	<P>This issue concerns a couple who do not wish to be publicly identified so I will refer to them as Mary and Tom. Mary was a lone parent with three children, who are now aged seven, two and nine months. She had been renting a home privately in my constituency for &euro;1,200, for which she was in receipt of a rent allowance of &euro;999 per month. On 7 April, she married Tom. Because Tom is in full-time employment, the couple immediately lost their rent allowance. Tom&rsquo;s income, however, is quite low, &euro;505 per week, which is clearly not sufficient to pay &euro;300 rent a week while maintaining a family of five on the balance.</P>
    <P>The couple notified the community welfare officer of their new circumstances after their wedding and were informed that they no longer qualify for rent allowance because one of them was in full-time employment. They subsequently notified their landlord that the rent allowance would be discontinued and the landlord has issued them with notice to quit, effective from next Thursday.</P>
    <P>They are on the local authority housing list and inquired as to their prospects of a local authority house. They are placed 199 on a list which has some 4,000 applicants on it. The council stated that it could not offer them housing at this stage and that they would be waiting for some time. It advised them to make contact with the homeless persons unit. The homeless persons unit informed them that it could possibly provide them with emergency accommodation from Thursday but the family would have to be separated as it could not access accommodation to house them as a family.</P><Col N="1715"/>
    <P>Recently, on behalf of the Labour Party, I proposed a motion calling for the replacement of the rent allowance system with a new form of housing support which would be related to income and would not discriminate between those in work and those in receipt of social welfare. I pointed out during the debate that the existing rent allowance system creates a massive poverty trap, acts as a disincentive to work and discriminates against working families. The Government voted down that motion. Now I have this case in my constituency and I would like the Minister to address a number of questions.</P>
    <P>How is this family to be housed from next Thursday? They will lose their private rented accommodation, will not have housing from the local authority, will not have rent allowance to pay rent and the best the homeless persons unit can do is to send the husband and son in one direction and the wife and daughters in the another direction &mdash; back to the workhouse. Will the family get some form of assistance towards paying their rent to resolve this problem? The community welfare officer cannot do anything about it. I have spoken to the superintendent community welfare officer and his hands are tied. The regulations explicitly state that if someone is in full-time employment, he cannot get the rent allowance.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>There is a question mark over the constitutionality of the situation. The Constitution protects marriage but here a person marries and loses an entitlement she previously had and will now lose her home. This case highlights the need to reform the rent allowance scheme and provide for the housing needs of low-income working families. This case requires urgent action to deal with the housing needs of this family which will become critical next Thursday.</P>

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive on behalf of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, provides for the payment of rent supplement to eligible people whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs.</P>
    <P>Under standard assessment rules, rent supplements are calculated to ensure that an eligible person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of basic supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum contribution, currently &euro;13, which each recipient is required to pay from his or her resources. Where a person has an additional income as a result of participation on a training course or in part-time employment, the standard means test now provides for a weekly disregard of up to &euro;60 per week of additional income, with half of any additional income between &euro;60 and &euro;90 also disregarded for means <Col N="1716"/>assessment purposes. For those participating in approved training courses, any lunch or travel allowances paid may also be disregarded. In addition, certain training courses now provide a child care allowance to participants on certain courses. The 2006 budget provided that these child care allowances are to be treated in the same manner as a lunch or travel allowance and disregarded.</P>
    <P>With the exception of those participating in approved employment schemes, people engaged in full-time remunerative employment are excluded from receiving assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. This requirement is set out in the Social Welfare Act and has been a feature of the scheme since it was established in 1977. In recent years, this provision had been bypassed by the practice of applications being made by the spouse or partner of a person in full-time employment.</P>
    <P>In the 2004 budget, measures were introduced to give effect to the original intention that the supplementary welfare allowance should not be paid in households with full-time open market employment. Paying a rent supplement to working households clearly goes beyond the income support objective of the rent supplement scheme and into the areas of housing provision and wage subsidisation.</P>
    <P>The Health Service Executive has been contacted concerning this case and has advised that the person concerned had been in receipt of rent supplement of &euro;999.90 per month. As part of a routine review, the executive requested details of income and tenancy from the person concerned. The executive suspended payment of rent supplement when the details were not forthcoming from the person concerned.</P>
    <P>The community welfare officer subsequently discovered that the person concerned had been married in April 2006. Following further investigation, it came to light that the husband of the person concerned is in full-time remunerative employment. The executive has further advised that the person concerned would not have an entitlement to rent supplement from the date of her marriage as, under social welfare legislation, a person may not receive rent supplement if that person or his or her spouse or partner is engaged in full-time employment.</P>
    <P>The executive has further advised that any arrears due to the person concerned for the period prior to her marriage would be payable upon receipt of the outstanding documentation. It is open to the person concerned to appeal the decision to the designated appeals officer within the Health Service Executive.</P>

   <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to discuss an airspace change proposal currently before the Irish Aviation Authority. The proposal was prepared <Col N="1717"/>by consultants for Weston Limited in conjunction with the Irish Aviation Authority, the Irish Air Corps and Dublin Air Traffic Control. The Irish Aviation Authority, which was party to the drawing up of the proposal, will decide whether to approve the proposal so it is valid to ask whether it will be impartial in its judgement.</P>
    <P>The proposal seeks to add instrument control to Weston Aerodrome in conjunction with visual control for take-off and landings. It proposes that, for the first time, night flying be allowed and it will permit Air Corps airspace, or part of it, to be used when it is not active by Weston. The proposal states that stakeholders have been consulted but I suggest that it is vested interests which have been consulted rather than stakeholders. The local authorities and the surrounding communities were not consulted and found out about the proposal by accident.</P>
    <P>The only conclusion that can be drawn from reading the proposal is that the intention is to intensify use at the aerodrome. The local view is that a commercial airport is being introduced by stealth. Many people in the surrounding towns of Lucan, Leixlip, Celbridge and Maynooth do not trust Weston Limited because of a litany of unauthorised developments and uses, some of which were the subject of enforcement notices and one of which resulted in the owner of the company facing proceedings in the High Court last summer. Weston Limited has not complied with the order made against it. People wonder why a company which has not complied with a High Court order is being entertained by State authorities.</P>
    <P>When Kildare County Council was in the process of producing its development plan last year, it consulted different parties because the aerodrome straddles two local authority areas. According to a letter sent by the Department of Defence to Kildare County Council:</P>
    <P LI="1">As the Department understands it, the proposal to make use of, <i>inter alia</i>, the paved stopway/clearway would in fact be an actual extension to the runway at Weston. This would constitute an unauthorised use of the facilities and would be contrary to the planning permission granted.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The letter then goes on:</P>
    <P LI="1">Against this background, it would be entirely inappropriate for this Department to enter into formal discussions with Weston with a view to agreeing procedures, which might then be seen to legitimise the use and operation of what we understand is an unauthorised development or unauthorised use of a facility. In the event that Weston did apply for planning permission or retention for its runway extension, I understand that the GOC Air Corps, in his role as Director of Military Aviation, would have a major problem in relation to the larger aircraft <Col N="1718"/>which could then land, and more particularly, take off from Weston, as their requisite flight path would compromise the safety of the flight paths currently used by the Air Corps into Baldonnel.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Since this letter was sent to Kildare County Council, a High Court order has been issued against Weston Limited with which it has not complied. When airspace is widened, different ground support services are required. Neither of the two local authorities concerned has been consulted. In a landmark decision of 8 December 2005, An Bord Plean&aacute;la ruled that if larger aeroplanes were to operate at Weston Aerodrome or the use of the aerodrome were to be intensified, further planning permission would be required.</P>
    <P>The local view is that none of the agencies involved in the matter &mdash; the two local authorities, the Departments of Transport, Defence and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government; and the Irish Aviation Authority &mdash; is taking control. It appears to local people that if a company has enough money, wants something badly enough and forges ahead with its plan, it will eventually receive what it is looking for. As a result, there is considerable anger in the communities surrounding the aerodrome.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the concerns of local people about developments at Weston Aerodrome. However, I must deal with the facts and address this issue primarily from a transport perspective and, in particular, from a safety perspective.</P>
    <P>It is not appropriate to say the Irish Aviation Authority, the Department of Defence and Weston Limited have combined to consider this matter. These are three separate bodies with very different roles. Weston Limited, as the owner of the aerodrome, is fully entitled to make proposals to the Irish Aviation Authority concerning the regulation of airspace at the aerodrome. The Department of Defence has an interest in the matter because of the close proximity of Baldonnel Aerodrome to Weston and the need to ensure the safe management of flying at both aerodromes.</P>
    <P>The Irish Aviation Authority is the body responsible for issuing aerodrome licences and is responsible for the regulation of safety at civilian aerodromes and the general safety and efficiency of aviation in this country. The authority deals with these matters independently in accordance with its statutory mandate. As the statutory body responsible for airspace design, the authority received the airspace change proposal from Weston Limited. The proposal requested a change in the airspace from class G to class C. I understand the basis of the application is that it would enhance safety in the airspace involved. The classification of airspace as class C requires <Col N="1719"/>permission for entry from air traffic control and, when operating within such airspace, all flights are subject to air traffic control.</P>
    <P>The airspace change proposal was developed by Weston Aerodrome. In its role as safety regulator, the authority facilitated discussion between the various air traffic services in the Dublin area and dealt with queries and other matters in connection with the application. This is a normal feature of the authority&rsquo;s role to ensure that the highest standards of aviation safety are achieved. The Irish Aviation Authority has recently completed public consultations in respect of this proposal. It is not legally obliged to consult on airspace changes but it considered it appropriate to do so on this occasion in the interests of transparency.</P>
    <P>I understand the matter received wide publicity in the media and that a large number of submissions were received on foot of these public consultations, including from local residents&rsquo; interests. The IAA is currently assessing and considering the content of the submissions received. Whatever decision it may take in respect of the airspace change proposal, it will not relieve Weston from complying with the full range of planning requirements.</P>
    <P>South Dublin County Council and Kildare County Council are responsible for land use and planning at and in the vicinity of Weston. Planning decisions take account of the nature and extent of operations at the aerodrome and their impact, including noise, in the locality. Environment impact statements are also part of the planning process administered by the local authorities. My Department has no statutory role in any of these areas.</P>

    <sTitle>School Enrolments.</sTitle>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>To date, more than 20 children who applied for places next September have been turned away from St. Ciaran&rsquo;s national school in Hartstown, Dublin West, where overcrowding has reached crisis proportions. An excellent school, it appears to have allocated places on the basis of age. Consequently, all children under the age of four years and nine months have been told there are no places for them next September. Children must be four years of age before 31 December 2005 to get a place in September 2006, which is a new policy that parents were not told about until ten days ago or so.</P>
    <P>The children in question include some who have older siblings in the school. Parents bought houses in the area on the expectation that their children would be accommodated. As the Minister of State knows, the other schools there are fairly full to the door. Unless the Minister addresses this situation, these children will have no places in September. St. Ciaran&rsquo;s is the most overcrowded school in Dublin 15. Of its 24 <Col N="1720"/>classes, 19 have 30 or more pupils, which is completely unacceptable and a damning indictment of the Minister&rsquo;s failure. She must take responsibility for the considerable distress caused to teachers, parents, the principal and the whole community.</P>
    <P>Last night, the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy de Valera, singled me out for &ldquo;trying to create panic over this matter&rdquo;. She continued: &ldquo;This is despite having been told of these plans time and again by the Minister, Deputy Hanafin. It may be colourful and headline grabbing...&rdquo;. I do not know whether the Minister of State has ever had the opportunity to set foot in Dublin 15 or if she knows that a ground-hog day of sorts occurred when school after school turned away hundreds of pupils. Like me, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is probably worn out by firefighting exercises to try to get extra places. I resent the cheap shot remarks that tried to blame this problem on the Opposition. The Government has been in office for nine years but has sat on its hands and done practically nothing to address the crisis.</P>
    <P>A feature of St. Ciaran&rsquo;s and other schools is the large number of international children catered for, particularly in junior classes. Many immigrants settling in west Dublin have children of primary school age, the majority of whom need intensive language support. As such, the pressure on schools to cater for Irish children and the special needs of international children is enormous. To date, it has been the dedication of principals, teachers and parents that has enabled schools to cope. However, they cannot continue without significant additional resources. While welcome, the Minister&rsquo;s promise of a couple of extra schools in recent years is too little, too late.</P>
    <P>I have repeatedly made positive proposals for a long-term solution to these ongoing crises, including a round table conference with all of the interested parties, a proper assessment of needs in line with expected new housing during the next five to ten years and the immediate purchase of sites for housing in Dublin 15. Currently, the Government only seems to serve the interests of the developers and their cronies. I have a list of this week&rsquo;s Dublin 15 planning applications to Fingal County Council, which includes applications for no fewer than eight prefab classrooms in two schools under intense pressure. This says everything about the Fianna F&aacute;il Government. Despite 15,000 extra houses in Dublin 15, the only solution is the old sticking plaster approach of prefabs &mdash; so much for the Celtic tiger and the hard-working parents being tortured by the Government in this regard.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter in both general terms and in respect of St. Ciaran&rsquo;s national school in Hartstown, as it <Col N="1721"/>gives me an opportunity to outline to the House the extensive actions being taken by the Department of Education and Science to address the school accommodation needs in the Dublin 15 area, including those of the school in question.</P>
    <P>The Department is aware that Dublin 15 is one of the most rapidly developing areas in the country and, as a result, there has been a marked increase in the demand for primary school places. Incidentally, the catchment area of St. Ciaran&rsquo;s national school is not a rapidly developing area, but there has been a marked increase in the demand for primary school places.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the House that a number of significant interventions have been made by the Department to tackle the general issues to which the Deputy referred. These include measures to increase the capacity of existing schools and the development of new schools to meet the growing demand. All building projects arising from these interventions are awarded a band 1 priority rating under the Department&rsquo;s prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects, which means that they will be delivered in the fastest timeframe possible. There is no point in having round table conferences when the Department has already awarded a rating that means the Department, the Minister and I recognise the fact that this is an emergency area requiring constant attention.</P>
    <P>In the Littlepace-Castaheaney area, a new school building has recently been completed at Mary Mother of Hope national school, with an additional project under way with a target delivery date of September 2007. Half of the prefabricated accommodation to which the Deputy referred is intended to ensure that the community has additional classroom space until the building is ready. A new primary school campus is planned for a school site in Ongar, which will have a minimum of 32 classrooms. Part of this project will provide a permanent accommodation solution for Castaheaney Educate Together national school, which also has a target completion date of September 2007. Over and above this provision, significant additional school places will be available this coming September through the expansion of existing provider&rsquo;s facilities.</P>
    <P>Discussions took place between Educate Together and the Minister in regard to a possible additional class of junior infants at Castaheaney Educate Together school. The Minister has fast-tracked the recognition of a new primary which will commence operation this year under the patronage of the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin.</P>
    <P>In the Diswellstown area, St. Patrick&rsquo;s national school has recently moved into a new 24-classroom school. This will facilitate an annual three-stream intake. As an exceptional measure, the board of management has agreed to take a fourth stream of junior infants this year. In addition, the board of management of St. Mochta&rsquo;s national <Col N="1722"/>school, which has an intake of three junior infant classes, has agreed to enrol a fourth class for September 2006. An extension project to cater for this development will also be expedited. Other developments in the Dublin 15 area include the planned expansion of St. Brigid&rsquo;s national school in Castleknock and the extensions to St. Brigid&rsquo;s boys&rsquo; and girls&rsquo; national schools, Blanchardstown.</P>
    <P>In Tyrrellstown, a new Educate Together school opened in September 2005. The Department has approved the provision of six additional classrooms for September 2006 to cater for new enrolments and special education teachers. It is anticipated that this school will enrol three junior infant classes. Under the scheme for devolved grants, the Church of Ireland national school at Castleknock will also acquire two additional classes.</P>
    <P>With regard to St. Ciaran&rsquo;s national school at Hartstown, the Department was put on notice last week that it may require additional accommodation for next September to facilitate an extra junior infant intake. However, in light of all the interventions made by the Department in the Dublin 15 area, the board wanted to be definite that potential enrolments would materialise. It is important to realise that it is common practice in areas of rapid population development for parents to enrol their children in more than one school. However, as Deputy Burton has stated, and I agree with her, several of the parents affected by the restriction on admissions to St. Ciaran&rsquo;s national school at Hartstown lived in the immediate area.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>All of them live in Hartstown.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The board was aware of this phenomenon and decided to carry out a comprehensive survey in its area to determine whether there is an actual shortfall in junior infant places. The Minister is impressed with the school&rsquo;s attitude to the position it has found itself in and welcomes the approach it has adopted. We should all be equally sensible and await the outcome of the school&rsquo;s survey before talking about a crisis situation that may not exist.</P>
    <P>The board has been in communication with the Department of Education and Science about the provision of additional accommodation. The Department will respond positively and quickly to whatever the needs of the school, as identified by the board, might be this year. Furthermore, it will review the school&rsquo;s long-term accommodation needs for the purposes of expediting the provision of permanent accommodation if significant extra enrolments are going to be a continuing feature.</P>
    <P>I commend the school on the measured and calm approach it is taking in this matter. I appreciate its willingness to play its role in meet<Col N="1723"/>ing the demands in its area and I assure the board and the parents that the Department will not be found wanting if extra accommodation resources are required.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and assure her that just because significant interventions are now being made in Dublin 15 does <Col N="1724"/>not mean the Department considers that its job is finished. Departmental staff are well aware that more accommodation may be needed in Dublin 15 and are engaging with the key school patron authorities that are active in the area in this regard.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
     <Quest>if she will capitalise on the heightened awareness of the potential for direct sales of farm produce following popular campaign to have farmers and the wider community exercise traditional market rights before 1 May 2006 in towns and villages and even some designated crossroads throughout the country; and if she will meet with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to establish a programme of re-establishing such community run farmers&rsquo; markets.</Quest>
     <QRef>[18750/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Casual Trading Act 1995 gives local authorities responsibility in matters of market rights. Section 7 of the Act provided for a 10 year time-frame within which market rights could be revived, even if these had not been used for some time. Some have been exercised recently.</P>
    <P>I do believe that farmers markets represent an important route to market and a real growth opportunity for farmers and small-scale food producers. Farmers Markets initiatives provide producers with direct access to consumers, assist the development of local and regional speciality foods, and present consumers with an alternative retail experience. There are also a variety of indirect benefits in terms of community spirit, increased employment and added value for tourism.</P>
    <P>An Bord Bia, which operates under the aegis of my Department, works closely with other State and local agencies to exploit the growing opportunities for markets. In co-operation with Invest Northern Ireland, they have published a comprehensive information guide on the operation of farmers markets. Bord Bia has a dedicated person in the Small Business Department to assist pro<Col N="1726"/>ducers and individuals, and performs a vital support function through the provision of advice and mentoring assistance as well as creating awareness of their potential contribution to the local economy.</P>
    <P>Bord Bia established the very successful &rsquo;Food at Farmleigh&rsquo; programme which has tens of thousands of visitors each year. This year, the programme will be extended on a one day seasonal basis to five regional Heritage sites in Cork, Wexford, Kildare, Donegal and Laois. This is one example of ways in which food and tourism can be merged at local level. I have been delighted to hear that the first seasonal market at Fota Island Cork, where Bord Bia worked closely with the Office of Public Works and local interests, has stimulated the holding of fortnightly markets in that location.</P>
    <P>There are over 100 such markets operating throughout the country at present, with numbers growing each week. I am aware that a Food and Craft Market run by community groups from both Donegal and Strabane is opening in Donegal town next Saturday and I wish them every success with this very worthwhile project. The diversity in structure of such markets, whether public, private sector or community based, is a measure of their responsiveness to local circumstances. No one template will suit all areas or all crossroads.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
     <Quest>the position regarding the implementation of the Nitrates Directive; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[18558/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The implementation of the Nitrates Directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. In December, the Minister made Regulations giving legal effect to Ireland&rsquo;s <Col N="1727"/>National Action Programme under the Nitrates Directive. These Regulations were finalised following difficult negotiations between the European Commission and officials of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P Just="Left">In January, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government announced a short <i>de facto</i> deferral of Part 3 of the Regulations, which covers nutrient management. This was to allow Teagasc to submit revised advice in relation to phosphorus limits. In March Teagasc provided a detailed submission which dealt with phosphorus and also with other aspects of the Regulations. Officials of the two Departments and representatives from Teagasc met the Commission on 22 March where the Teagasc experts were given the opportunity to present the revised scientific advice and to clarify certain aspects.</P>
    <P>The Commission did not offer any definitive conclusions on the new advice at that meeting, but indicated that it was up to Ireland to make proposals for changes in the Regulations. In this connection, officials of the two Departments and senior Teagasc personnel have since had detailed technical discussions on the main elements of the Teagasc submission. I and my officials have maintained close contact with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and his staff in considering the changes in the Regulations. This work has progressed well and I understand that Minister Roche is now about to send his proposals for changes to the Commission.</P>
    <P>The Commission&rsquo;s agreement will be required for any changes but I am satisfied that they are open to arguments that are scientifically robust. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and I will continue to work together to bring this matter to a conclusion and at the same time create the conditions for the negotiations on a derogation, which is vital to a large number of more intensive farmers to proceed.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Following receipt of the required EU approval, the revised Farm Waste Management Scheme was launched by my Department on 24 March 2006. Application forms, together with the accompanying terms and conditions, are available from the local Agricultural Environment and <Col N="1728"/>Structures (AES) offices of my Department and are also available on my Department&rsquo;s web-site.</P>
    <P>The principal changes to the Scheme include (a) an increase in the standard grant-rate from 40% to 60%, with 70% being available in the four Zone C counties; (b) an extension of the Scheme for the first time to sectors such as horses, deer, goats, pigs and poultry, and mushroom compost; (c) the removal of any minimum income requirements from farming from the Scheme so that all small farmers can participate in the Scheme; and (d) an increase in the maximum eligible investment from &euro;75,000 to &euro;120,000 per holding.</P>
    <P>As the Scheme closes for applications at the end of 2006, I have also arranged that applications will be accepted by my Department as soon as any required planning permission has been applied for to the relevant local authority. This will ensure that any delays in obtaining such permission will not impinge on the farmer&rsquo;s entitlement to the new grant rates available under the Scheme. I would urge farmers to make use of this opportunity to participate in the Scheme by ensuring that their application forms are received in good time.</P>

     <asker>Mr. G. Mitchell</asker>
     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
     <Quest>her plans to introduce a bovine vaccination programme for tuberculosis; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[18772/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no TB-vaccine licensed anywhere in the world for use in a food producing animal and therefore there is no possibility of introducing a bovine vaccination programme for TB. Indeed, the position is that vaccine trials in the past demonstrated that vaccination did not prevent disease.</P>
    <P>Apart from the foregoing, cattle vaccinated against TB could not be traded because they would be unable to comply with Council Directive 64/432/EEC on animal health problems affecting intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine. This Directive provides that, prior to export, bovine animals for breeding and production must come from an officially tuberculosis-free herd and, in the case of animals more than six weeks old, must have reacted negatively to an intradermal tuberculin test carried out during the 30 days prior to leaving the herd of origin. Given the difficulties that would arise in distinguishing between real infection and vaccine immunity, vaccinated animals could not be certified as complying with the requirements of the trade Directive and the export of live cattle to other Member States would not be permitted.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I should point out that my Department, in conjunction with a badger vaccine research group based at University College Dublin, is currently seeking to develop a vaccine for badgers, which <Col N="1729"/>is not a food producing animal. It is accepted that the availability of such a vaccine is a prerequisite if eradication of tuberculosis from the cattle population is to be achieved. The objective of the project is to secure an orally delivered preparation of BCG vaccine for use in badgers that will result in lower TB levels in that species. With this in mind, a large scale field trial of BCG in badgers is planned to test the efficacy of the vaccine, as testing carried out to date under experimental conditions has shown encouraging results. However, any vaccine will not be available for wider use in the immediate future and the existing strategy will remain in place for some time.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the consensus is that the existing test and slaughter policy is currently the only effective mechanism for dealing with the disease.</P>
    <P>The measures in place are effective as evidenced by a significant reduction in the incidence of the disease from 4.2 reactors per thousand in 1998 to 2.9 in 2005. The 2005 TB eradication programme was completed with 97% of the 123,322 cattle herds tested within the twelve-month period. A total of approximately 6.5 million animals were subject to at least one test within twelve months and approximately 9 million animal tests were carried out.</P>

     <asker>Mr. Naughten</asker>
     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

     <Quest>the steps she intends to take to secure the maximum level of compensation for beet growers; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The compensation package negotiated in the context of reform of the EU sugar regime is worth over &euro;310m to Irish stakeholders. There are three elements to the compensation package.</P>
    <P>The first element is the compensation to beet growers of up to 64% of the reduction in the minimum price for beet. This compensation, which will be incorporated in the existing Single Payment Scheme and will be payable from 2006, is worth approximately &euro;123m to Irish beet growers over the next seven years.</P>
    <P>The second element of the compensation package is the restructuring aid covering the economic, social and environmental costs of restructuring of the sugar industry involving factory closure and renunciation of quota. In Ireland&rsquo;s case, this would be worth up to &euro;145m.</P>
    <P>The third element of the package is the diversification aid, worth almost &euro;44m in Ireland&rsquo;s case, which would be drawn down in the framework of a national restructuring programme.</P>
    <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the second element of the compensation package, the restructuring aid. This aid is subject to the submission by the processor of a detailed restructur<Col N="1730"/>ing plan for the industry, following consultations with the beet growers. The reform agreement provides that at least 10% of the restructuring aid shall be reserved for sugar beet growers and machinery contractors. That percentage may be increased by Member States after consultation of interested parties provided that an economically sound balance between the elements of the restructuring plan is ensured. In that context, my Department has recently issued an open call for submissions which will be subject to scrutiny by Indecon International Economic Consultants who have been appointed by the Government to provide me with independent expert advice on matters relating to the implementation of the restructuring fund. A final decision on the percentage will be made in due course having regard to this advice and following the adoption in the near future of the Commission Regulation laying down detailed rules for the implementation of the restructuring aid.</P>
    <P>The timescale for implementing the restructuring aid is very tight where restructuring takes place in the first year of the new regime especially having regard to the delay in finalisation of the Commission regulations. The Council Regulation requires that the application for restructuring aid must be made by 31 July 2006. A decision on the granting of the aid must then be made by the Member State at the latest by 30 September 2006.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the restructuring aid will be implemented in a fair and equitable manner and strictly in accordance with the relevant EU regulations.</P>

	<P>My Department is aware of this recently published research that was carried out in the UK and its findings are being evaluated. It should be noted that this study rates to a small number of farms and therefore some caution is required in relation to the findings. My Department is currently considering running a similar study in Ireland.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department operates a Rural Environment Protection Scheme which includes funding for farmers to conserve, maintain and enhance farm boundaries in the interest of stock control, bio-security, wildlife and scenic appearance of the area. My Department also encourages farmers to take bio-security measures, such as the placement of water troughs, against infection by badgers.</P><Col N="1731"/>
    <P>My Department implements a wildlife strategy, which involves the targeted removal of badgers, under licence, where they are implicated in an outbreak of TB. In addition, it is also committed to a research project with UCD on the development of a vaccine for use in badgers that would lead to a reduction in the level of infection in that species, thereby reducing the number of organisms being shed and subsequently the level of transmission to the cattle population. Work on this objective is progressing. However, any vaccine will not be available for wider use in the immediate future and the existing strategy will remain in place for some time.</P>

	<P>In March I announced my intention to move to a more open market system for transferring milk quotas, which will come into effect on the 1st April 2007.</P>
    <P>My Department and I have made solid progress in the continuing consultation process on the detailed arrangements to give effect to my decision. This comprised of meetings with the relevant farm organisations and with representatives of the milk-processing sector and individual co-ops. The issue of future milk quota policy has also been discussed with the participating farm organisations at the partnership negotiations, most recently this morning.</P>
    <P>We are now undertaking a comprehensive analysis of the issues raised and the options for dealing with them, with a view to designing an appropriate transfer mechanism. Further consultations will take place before finalising the new system, and the operational details will be announced in good time to allow for all parties concerned to make appropriate plans before the start of the 2007/2008 milk quota year.</P>

	<P>The only circumstances in which exotic birds may be legally imported from Third Countries is as pet birds accompanying their owners who are permanently changing their resi<Col N="1732"/>dence. This is an EU-wide provision and relates only to importations of individual consignments of five or fewer birds. The conditions under which such importations are permitted are very stringent and include quarantine, vaccination or testing for avian influenza. An EU-wide ban is in place in relation to all other captive birds from Third Countries.</P>
    <P>Intra-community trade in exotic birds is permitted under EU rules, which do not include a quarantine requirement. Such consignments must comply with the requirements of a General Authorisation issued under the European Communities (Diseases of Animals Acts, 1966 and 1979 Orders) (General Authorisations for Imports) Regulations 1985, the conditions attaching to which require that the birds must:</P>
    <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p10- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>come from a holding which has been registered for export by the competent authority of the country of origin in accordance with Article 4 of Council Directive 92/65/EEC;</P>
   <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p10- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>come from a holding in which Avian Influenza has not been diagnosed in the 30 days preceding the dispatch;</P>
    <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p10- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>come from a holding and an area not subject to restrictions under Council Directive 92/66/EEC introducing Community measures for the control of Newcastle Disease;</P>
 <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p10- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>be accompanied by a declaration to this effect completed and signed by the owner of the hobby birds on the day of movement;</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p10- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>in the case of psittacidae, be accompanied by a certificate signed by an official veterinarian of the country of export.</P>
    <P el="5" FLI="0">In addition to these requirements, advance notice is required to be given to my Department not less than 24 hours prior to the intended date of importation and for animal disease control measures, an official notification of the consignment (TRACES) is dispatched from the District Veterinary Office of the country of origin to the District Veterinary Office of the country of destination.</P>
    <P>While my Department does undertake inspections at points of import, it must be noted that the Department is precluded, by EU rules, from inspecting all import consignments; rather a spot-check regime is in place based on risk assessment for disease purposes.</P>
    <P>In the context of avian influenza, my Department has introduced a robust range of precautionary measures and fully implements all EU controls, including those relating to the importation of exotic birds. It should be noted that imports of pet birds from within the EU represent a low risk to Ireland&rsquo;s health status; the avian &rsquo;flu virus being more prevalent in wild birds whose entry cannot be controlled or certified.</P>

	<P>The designation of land under the EU Birds and Habitats Directives is a function of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The question of compensation for farmers in the Shannon Callows area is a matter, in the first instance, for that Department, and I understand that discussions on the matter with the farming bodies have been going on for some time and are still continuing.</P>
    <P>As far as REPS is concerned, arrangements are already in place designed specifically to address the situation of farmers in the Shannon Callows. Farmers in this area who wish to join REPS, but believe that the REPS payments do not fully offset any income loss arising from the restrictions placed on their farming activities because of designation under the Birds and Habitats Directives, may now also apply to the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for additional compensation. Before this arrangement was introduced in September 2004, such farmers had to choose between REPS and the compensation arrangements operated by NPWS but could not benefit from both.</P>
    <P>This further concession was additional to the inclusion of a new Supplementary Measure in REPS when REPS 3 was introduced in June 2004. Designated areas are already eligible for payments under REPS Measure A of &euro;242 per hectare for the first 40 hectares and lesser amounts for areas over 40 hectares. The new Supplementary Measure provides for an additional payment of &euro;100 per hectare on particular sites in the Callows which are important corncrake habitats. Those sites are monitored by BirdWatch Ireland, and REPS farmers can qualify for the additional payment by subscribing to BirdWatch Ireland management prescriptions for them.</P>
    <P>I believe that the arrangements I have outlined should address the situation in the Shannon Callows adequately as far as my Department is concerned. Nevertheless I have asked my officials to examine the issue again in the context of the current consultation process on REPS, out of which proposals will be sent to the Commission for a revised Scheme.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Following a number of successful years for the Irish dairy industry on international and EU markets, 2006 is proving to be more challenging for the industry. The butter market, in particular, is under severe pressure on both the EU and international markets. Exports of dairy products, except cheese, are considerably lower than in 2005, with EU butter exports currently 35% less than the volumes exported during the previous GATT year.</P>
    <P>The euro/dollar exchange rate has a very significant impact on our competitiveness and the current weakness of the dollar is adding to the difficulties of EU traders. The internal butter market is also very weak and butter prices in most member States are at or below intervention level. The intervention limit of 50,000 tonnes is likely to be reached within the next month after which a tendering system for intervention purchases will be introduced.</P>
    <P>As this situation developed over recent months I have urged the Commissioner on several occasions to use the market management tools in a more effective manner to ensure the overall stability of the milk sector. In particular my key concern was to see the export refund regime used to maximum effect in order to dispose of product onto international markets outside the EU. I was very pleased that the Commission responded by increasing export refunds for butter and Whole Milk Powder at the end of April and again at the last Milk Management Committee when the tender refunds were accepted at a higher level for butter and butter oil.</P>
    <P>I have again asked the Commissioner to keep the focus for 2006 on the need to maintain the competitiveness of EU dairy exports, with particular reference to butter and to manage the introduction of the new tender arrangements for butter intervention in a manner that avoids causing further instability on the market.</P>
    <P>I would of course emphasise that dairy farmers incomes are not alone dependent on EU market supports though I fully appreciate the importance of internal aids and export subsidies for competitive trading conditions. Other elements impacting on farmers&rsquo; incomes include direct payments, scale and efficiency and returns from the market. This year&rsquo;s milk price, taken together with the single payment entitlement of 3.6 cent per litre is similar to recent years though clearly there is greater pressure now on producer prices than heretofore.</P>
    <P>Since the Luxembourg Agreement of 2003 the dairy sector is operating in a new policy framework, where market forces have an even greater influence on the price paid for milk. It is critical that we continue to manage the market so that we maintain relative competitiveness and I will continue to focus on managing the transition to the next stage of intervention price reductions in July with the aim of maintaining and enhancing <Col N="1736"/>industry competitiveness and ultimately farm incomes.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The compensation package negotiated in the context of reform of the EU sugar regime is worth over &euro;310m to Irish stakeholders. There are three elements to the compensation package.</P>
    <P>The first element is the compensation to beet growers of up to 64% of the reduction in the minimum price for beet. This compensation, which will be incorporated in the existing Single Payment Scheme and will be payable from 2006, is worth approximately &euro;123m to Irish beet growers over the next seven years.</P>
    <P>The second element of the compensation package is the restructuring aid covering the economic, social and environmental costs of restructuring of the sugar industry involving factory closure and renunciation of quota. In Ireland&rsquo;s case, this would be worth up to &euro;145m.</P>
    <P>The third element of the package is the diversification aid, worth almost &euro;44m in Ireland&rsquo;s case, which would be drawn down in the framework of a national restructuring programme.</P>
    <P>The restructuring aid is subject to the submission by the processor of a detailed restructuring plan for the industry following consultations with the beet growers. The reform agreement provides that at least 10% of the restructuring aid shall be reserved for sugar beet growers and machinery contractors. That percentage may be increased by Member States after consultation of interested parties provided that an economically sound balance between the elements of the restructuring plan is ensured. In that context, my Department has recently issued an open call for submissions which will be subject to scrutiny by Indecon International Economic Consultants who have been appointed by the Government to provide me with independent expert advice on matters relating to the implementation of the restructuring aid. A final decision on the percentage will be made in due course having regard to this advice and following the adoption in the near future of the Commission Regulation laying down detailed rules for the implementation of the restructuring aid.</P>
    <P>The timescale for implementing the restructuring aid is very tight where restructuring takes place in the first year of the new regime especially having regard to the fact that the Commission regulations are not yet finalised. The Council Regulation requires that the application for <Col N="1737"/>restructuring aid must be made by the processor by 31 July 2006. The application must include a detailed restructuring plan for the industry. A decision on the granting of the aid must then be made by the Member State by 30 September 2006 at the latest.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the restructuring aid will be implemented in a fair and equitable manner and strictly in accordance with the relevant EU regulations.</P>

    <P>The Animal Remedies Regulations 2005 (SI 734/2005), which transpose EU Directive 2004/28, were signed into effect by me on 17 November 2005. On the outstanding issue in regard to bringing all medicines for food producing animals under veterinary prescription control, my Department made a submission to the Commission on 17 March with a view to having draft exemption criteria published by the Commission on 9 February adapted to better reflect the risk/benefit profile of veterinary medicinal products and to facilitate decisions on the route of supply to be taken on a scientific basis. However, the Commission has not yet come forward with formal proposals for the exemption criteria. My Department will engage fully with the Commission and other Member States in the course of the deliberations on the formal proposals, when adopted by the Commission. My best estimate is that the process will not be completed at least until late Summer.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated publicly, I will review the national prescription and distribution arrangements in consultation with stakeholders when the final shape of the EU exemption criteria is clearer. In particular I will, depending on the likely outcome, consider whether persons other than vets should be permitted to prescribe veterinary medicines. My intention is to complete the consultative process in time to permit decisions on this issue to be taken well in advance of the 1 January 2007 deadline provided for in the EU legislation.</P>

This legislation does not include provision under which a person can be precluded from keeping farmed animals.</P>
    <P>In the case of the person named, I can confirm that his herd number was cancelled in August 2002 following an earlier conviction and direction of the Courts.

	<P>The sheep sector plays a very important role in the agricultural sector in Ireland and makes a very valuable contribution to the economy. I am aware that the sector has been affected by various factors in recent years. Two major factors should be mentioned, the outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease in 2001 and the reform of the CAP leading to the Single Farm payment. The former disrupted supply and distorted prices and it has taken some time for the market to normalize. The reform of the CAP decoupled premia from production and led to <Col N="1740"/>high disposals in 2004 and 2005 of ewes which were no longer required for premia purposes.</P>
    <P>There is general agreement in the industry, however, that changes need to be made to ensure that the market provides adequate returns. It was decided that a study group should be established, which was representative of all interests, to draw up a development plan for the future. The sheep industry strategy group was established in December 2005 under the chairmanship of Mr. John Malone, former Secretary General of my Department. All sectors are represented in the group including the processors, producers, Teagasc, Enterprise Ireland, Bord Bia and my Department.</P>
    <P>Its report, whose publication is imminent, is expected to cover all aspects of the sector, including production, breeding, price, product development and promotion for different markets and consumer preferences.

In addition an all-island food label would require negotiation between the relevant authorities regarding its status and conditions for use and general acceptance from consumers and buy-in by producers and processors island-wide.</P>

    <P FLI="0">While the above table gives details relating to approvals many projects did not proceed or were not grant aided for a variety of reasons. In excess of 400 horticultural producers proceeded and over &euro;13m in grant aid was paid to support investments to the value of &euro;38m.</P>
    <P>The scheme continues to attract strong interest from producers. In 2006, my Department has approved proposals from 150 producers involving grant aid of &euro;6.3m to support capital investments of &euro;18m. The average grant paid to the end of <Col N="1742"/>2005 was &euro;32,500. The maximum grant payable per applicant over the period of the scheme is &euro;444,500 and so far 3 producers have received up to the maximum limit.</P>
    <P>The scheme has been of significant benefit to Horticulture Producers and to the overall development of the sector. While the number of growers has declined to a current estimate of 900, overall output has increased by 25% in the period to &euro;300m in 2005. There has been considerable rationalisation of the sector, particularly in the mushroom industry with the result that the scale of operations of individual growers has increased considerably over the period. The sector now employs some 10,000 people across the production and distribution chain.</P>
    <P>The grant aid scheme has been a major catalyst for improving the competitiveness and market orientation of the horticulture sector and preparing it for the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. It is critical to the ongoing development of the sector at farm level given the capital-intensive nature of projects and large-scale investments required in some sectors.</P>

	<P>Food business operators who mislead consumers in believing that food which is not of Irish origin is Irish may be committing an offence under existing food labelling legislation. Any such instances should be brought to the attention of the FSAI which is the central authority for the enforcement of food labelling.</P>
    <P>&lsquo;Substantial transformation&rsquo; is a procedure used in normal business operations to allow operators to declare goods as being manufactured in the country where considerable processing has taken place. I am very concerned that this practice might be used to mislead consumers as to the origin of the product. I have raised this issue directly with the Commission on a number of occasions and indeed have been in contact with the EU Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, Mr. Kyprianou again earlier this year about the matter.</P>
    <P>Subsequently the Commission decided to review EU labelling. In this context the Commission recently published a consultative document on &lsquo;Labelling: Competitiveness, Consumer Information and Better Regulation in the EU&rsquo; and invited Member States for submissions by mid June 2006. My Department is currently preparing a submission in which we will again raise this matter.</P>

	<P>The mandate for the current round of WTO negotiations, the Doha Development Agenda, states that special and differential treatment for developing countries shall be an integral element of all elements of the negotiations.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the negotiating mandate, agreement was reached in August 2004 on a &ldquo;Framework for establishing modalities in agriculture&rdquo; which sets out the main elements of a new agreement. The Framework provides for the establishment of a Special Safeguard Mechanism for developing countries and the designation of an appropriate number of Special Products, based on their food security, livelihood security and rural development needs, which will be subject to more flexible treatment that other products in relation to market access arrangements.</P>
    <P>I fully support the principle of special and differential treatment for developing countries and agree with the aspects included in the Framework agreement. Detailed arrangements for their implementation will be agreed as part of the on-going negotiations on the terms of the final agreement. The negotiations cover a broad range of issues for a new multilateral trade agreement in which all WTO member countries participate and contribute. My objective is to achieve a balanced outcome to the negotiations that recognises the agriculture market access and other sensitivities of both developed and developing countries.</P>

Under the agreement on reform of the EU sugar regime, the Single Payment Scheme is being extended to cover sugar beet compensation.</P>
    <P>The sugar reform agreement also provides for the introduction of aid for diversification measures in the event that sugar beet production completely ceases. This aid, worth almost &euro;44m, <Col N="1744"/>would be drawn down in the framework of a national restructuring programme.

   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The general food labelling legislation comes within the remit of the Department of Health &amp; Children. My Department has responsibility for specific labelling regulations such as the labelling of beef. It is governed by comprehensive EU regulations that were introduced in 2000 and is underpinned by a full national cattle identification and traceability system. However, these labelling requirements only apply as far as retail level. Primary legislation to allow for the extension of these regulations to the catering sector was enacted by the Oireachtas in March 2006 by way of an amendment to the Health Act 1947. Following consultation with the FSAI, my Department has submitted the necessary draft Beef Regulations to the Department of Health and Children. It is expected that the Regulations will be in place this summer.</P>
    <P>The amended Heath Act 1947 will also facilitate the extension of country of origin labelling to all meats including poultry meat. The EU Commission, however, is opposed to Member States introducing legislation on compulsory labelling that is over and above the common EU requirement. There would also be serious challenges in the implementation and enforcement of national legislation in the absence of harmonised EU provisions due to such factors as the amount of processing and repackaging operations that poultry in particular may be subjected to before arrival in this country. Therefore, the preferable way forward is that the EU Commission would progress the question of origin labelling of poultry. I have raised this issue with Commissioner Kyprianou and am taking every opportunity to press for progress on the matter. I will also raise this matter in the context of the current EU review of food labelling.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that if no action is taken at EU level, I will put forward proposals for the extension of country of origin labelling on all meats at retail and catering levels here and to submit such proposals for EU approval.</P>

	<P>There is already a long history of co-operation between the administrations north and south on animal health issues. The administrations have traditionally shared information at local and national levels on disease control and surveillance issues and have worked together to combat illegal movements of animals and animal products. The Foot and Mouth emergency of 2001 is a testament to the extent of co-operation and consultation that exists at official, Ministerial and political levels. Likewise, both administrations are co-operating on measures relating to avian influenza.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the North South Ministerial Council offered an opportunity to build on existing co-operation arrangements and provided a framework for the development of an all-island animal health policy.</P>
    <P>The main objectives of the Council are to foster co-operation and to devise a common, unified animal health strategy for the island as a whole. This involves the convergence of animal health policies and the development of joint strategies for dealing with animal diseases. The ultimate objectives are to establish a common import regime and equivalent internal arrangements with a view to achieving free movement of animals and animal products within the island.</P>
    <P>The programme of work mandated by the NSMC to agree a common animal health and welfare strategy for the island has been taken forward by nine working groups at official level. The remit of these groups includes TB and Brucellosis, TSEs (BSE and Scrapie), veterinary medicines, other Zoonoses and animal diseases, disease surveillance, animal welfare, import and export of live animals and animal products, animal identification, traceability and cross-border aspects of fraud.</P>
    <P>These working groups meet regularly and their work has focused on three main themes:</P>
   <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p10- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Common or equivalent controls at points of entry to the island;</P>
   <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p10- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Convergence of internal animal health policies; and</P>
   <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p10- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Development of joint strategies for the control of animal disease.</P>
    <P FLI="0" el="5">The main achievements to date are the development of a co-ordinated and complementary approach towards import policies and portal controls at points of entry to the island, the convergence of policies in regard to animal identification and Scrapie and the strengthening of co-ordination and co-operation between both administrations on a variety of issues such as FMD, BSE and cross-border fraud. These groups continue to report progress in exchange of infor<Col N="1746"/>mation and in implementation of initiatives aimed at policy convergence and the development of a common unified strategy for the island as a whole.</P>
    <P>It must also be recognised that the achievement of such an all-island animal health strategy involves complex dialogue and negotiation over a range of areas between the Irish, Northern Irish and British authorities. Ultimately, the agreement of the European Union will be required.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above, there has been a significant deepening and strengthening of co-operation, information exchange and ongoing co-ordination between the two administrations on a variety of issues such as FMD, BSE, Avian Influenza and cross-border fraud while the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council includes representation from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, (DARD). DARD was also represented at a recent meeting of the Avian Influenza Advisory Group and will also be represented at future meetings of the Group which indicates the collaborative approach taken by Dublin and Belfast in relation to challenges ahead. On cross-border fraud, the two administrations have worked together successfully in a number of joint enforcement actions and ongoing exchanges of expertise and information are taking place.</P>
    <P>In relation to the EU decision to lift the BSE ban on exports from the United Kingdom from 3 May 2006, arrangements have been agreed and put in place between our two administrations to facilitate the trade of cattle from Northern Ireland for slaughter, breeding and production.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that veterinary practices are primarily commercial entities and their locations are driven by commercial realities. However, insofar as State involvement is concerned, I can point to a number of recent measures which will alleviate difficulties which may arise in certain parts of the country. Under the new Veterinary Practice Act 2005, effective from 1 January 2006, there is a provision which for the first time enables the Veterinary Council to recognize qualifications from applicants in Third Countries generally. This, taken with the enlargement of the EU, will make for improved availability of practitioners to meet shortfalls that may arise on the supply side. Furthermore, the Animal Remedies Regulations 2005, which I signed into law on the 17 November 2005, contain a number of measures which facilitate veterinary practitioners and their farmer clients to avoid difficulties in this area. These include changes to the prescribing rules in terms of the ending of the requirement to clinically examine an animal prior to writing a prescription and the extended validity period of prescriptions. The Regulations also include a provision, which in a genuine emergency situation and subject to appropriate safeguards, allows a pharmacist to supply a prescription medicine in advance of receiving a written prescription. Finally, I understand that Udaras na Gaeltachta provides funding to subsidise veterinary practices in remote areas in consultation with the local farming community.</P>

	<P>The Food Agency Co-operation Council was established in 2000 under the aegis of my Department to promote the fullest practical co-operation between the State Agencies involved in the food industry, in the interests of the optimum development of the industry. The Council met on 20 occasions between 2000 and 2003. During 2004 and 2005 priority was given instead to meetings of the food development agencies directly concerned with the food programme components of the National Development Plan 2000-2006. Two such meetings took place in 2004, one in 2005 and one in 2006 to assess progress on the Plan in preparation for meetings of the NDP Monitoring Committees.</P>
    <P>The Food Agency Co-Operation Council has produced a number of publications, which have <Col N="1748"/>been well received by the industry. In 2001 the Council was instrumental in the drawing up of a Human Resource Development programme for the food processing industry and produced a publication Market Trends &mdash; Implications for Suppliers and State Agency Initiatives. In December 2002, the Council&rsquo;s publication &mdash; A National Food Incident Management Plan &mdash; was launched. The Market Led New Product Development Guide, launched in April 2003, provides guidance to food and drink companies in relation to New Product Development best practice and this has subsequently been promulgated to County Enterprise Boards. The Council has also played a significant role in increasing co-operation, at formal and informal level, between the state agencies involved in the food industry and this has led to a number of &ldquo;Memorandums of Understandings&rdquo; being agreed between agencies.</P>
    <P>In the light of a more market orientated CAP, the 2015 Agri-Vision Report and the Enterprise Strategy Report my Department has been examining future co-operation between agencies to most effectively develop the agri-food industry. Arising from this, I have included in the Plan of Action, which I launched to implement the 2015 Agri-Vision Report, the establishment of a high level group of CEOs of food agencies, which will subsume and develop the role of the Council, and also a Food Industry Committee. Both will be chaired at Ministerial level and will ensure a consolidated approach towards the development of the food sector as a whole and identify and address issues impeding the development of the sector.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37, 96 and 104 together.</P>
    <P>The compensation package negotiated in the context of reform of the EU sugar regime is worth over &euro;310m to Irish stakeholders. There are three elements to the compensation package.</P>
    <P>The first element is the compensation to beet growers of up to 64% of the reduction in the <Col N="1749"/>minimum price for beet. This compensation, which will be incorporated in the existing Single Payment Scheme and will be payable from 2006, is worth approximately &euro;123m to Irish beet growers over the next seven years.</P>
    <P>The second element of the compensation package is the restructuring aid covering the economic, social and environmental costs of restructuring of the sugar industry involving factory closure and renunciation of quota. In Ireland&rsquo;s case, this would be worth up to &euro;145m.</P>
    <P>The third element of the package is the diversification aid, worth almost &euro;44m in Ireland&rsquo;s case, which would be drawn down in the framework of a national restructuring programme.</P>
    <P>The restructuring aid is subject to the submission by the processor of a detailed restructuring plan for the industry following consultations with the beet growers. The reform agreement provides that at least 10% of the restructuring aid shall be reserved for sugar beet growers and machinery contractors. That percentage may be increased by Member States after consultation of interested parties provided that an economically sound balance between the elements of the restructuring plan is ensured. In that context, my Department has recently issued an open call for submissions which will be subject to scrutiny by Indecon International Economic Consultants who have been appointed by the Government to provide me with independent expert advice on matters relating to the implementation of the restructuring aid. A final decision on the percentage will be made in due course having regard to this advice and following the adoption in the near future of the Commission Regulation laying down detailed rules for the implementation of the restructuring aid.</P>
    <P>The timescale for implementing the restructuring aid is very tight where restructuring takes place in the first year of the new regime especially having regard to the fact that the Commission regulations are not yet finalised. The Council Regulation requires that the application for restructuring aid must be made by the processor by 31 July 2006. The application must include a detailed restructuring plan for the industry. A decision on the granting of the aid must then be made by the Member State by 30 September 2006 at the latest.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the restructuring aid will be implemented in a fair and equitable manner and strictly in accordance with the relevant EU regulations.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38, 39, 48, 63 and 76 together.</P>
    <P>In March I announced my intention to move to a more open market system for transferring milk quotas, which will come into effect on the 1st April 2007. I made this decision because the current restructuring model will not meet the future needs of the industry and a more effective response is required in order to meet future competitive pressures.</P>
    <P>My Department and I have made solid progress in the continuing consultations with the farm organisations and with representatives of the milk processing sector. We are now in the process of undertaking a comprehensive analysis of the issues raised and the options for dealing with them, with a view to designing an appropriate transfer mechanism. My aim is to have the new system in place before the start of the 2007/2008 milk quota year.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 69 together.</P>
    <P>The current negotiations on a new World Trade Agreement, which cover a broad trade liberalization agenda, have been under way since they were launched in Doha in November 2001 and further progress towards agreement was reached at the WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong in December 2005. The Conference <Col N="1751"/>reached agreement on a number of issues and set clear deadlines for the completion of the negotiations on agriculture. The end of April 2006 was set as the deadline for the completion of the modalities, or detailed provisions, of the new agreement and a further deadline of end July 2006 was set for the submission of schedules, or specific commitments, by all WTO member countries. Despite intensive negotiations, the end of April deadline has passed without agreement on modalities. The negotiations are now continuing with a view to reaching agreement by the end of July.</P>
    <P>I am continuing to monitor closely the progress of the negotiations. The Commission negotiates on behalf of EU Member States on the basis of a mandate agreed in the Council of Ministers. My objective is to secure a balanced outcome across all sectors and between the different elements of the agriculture negotiations and to ensure that the final agreement on agriculture will not require further reform of the Common Agriculture Policy.</P>
    <P>Market access is, for me, a key element of the negotiations and, in that context, in addition to tariff reductions and sensitive products issues, I will be seeking to ensure that non-trade concerns are fully taken on board. I fully support the policy that animal products imported into the EU from Third Countries meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, EU Member States. I have concerns that there is not real equivalence regarding animal traceability, controls on veterinary medicines, prohibited substances and residue monitoring programmes in respect of imports from certain third countries. I have already been in contact with the Commissioner on this matter on a number of occasions and I will continue to use every opportunity to voice my concerns. Indeed, I will be raising this matter again at next Monday&rsquo;s Council of Ministers meeting in Brussels.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>According to the CSO there were 135,100 farmers in 2003, which is the most recent data available. Of this figure, 15,000 or 11% are under 35 years of age compared to the EU-15 average of 8%. This favourable demographic situation has been brought about by a series of policies and schemes to attract young people into farming.</P>
    <P>Schemes to encourage earlier farm transfers include: (a) An Installation aid grant of &euro;9,520 to farmers under 35 years of age who meet specific <Col N="1752"/>criteria. (b) Young trained farmers are eligible for 100% stock relief. (c) New entrants were also catered for under the 2005 National Reserve for the Single Payment Scheme. (d) Young trained farmers are eligible for higher dairy hygiene and farm waste management grant rates. (e) Young farmers/new entrants have also been prioritised under various milk quota schemes.</P>
    <P>In terms of taxation measures, young trained farmers are eligible for 100% stamp duty relief on the transfer of agricultural land and buildings to them. A young farmer is also eligible for generous capital acquisitions tax agricultural relief, which reduces the market value of all agricultural property by 90%, thus exempting most family farm transfers from a capital acquisitions tax liability. Commissioner Fischer Boel, in her recent address to the D&aacute;il, stated that Ireland and the EU may expect fierce competition in key agricultural markets such as beef and dairy production in the context of a new WTO agreement. The statement was not unexpected and reflects my own opinion that there will be increased competition on international markets in the future. The WTO negotiations are ongoing and the objective of the talks is a fair and equitable balance between the three pillars within agriculture of market access, domestic support and export competitiveness.</P>
    <P>As regards market access I have stated repeatedly that there should be no further concessions granted to our negotiating partners and that we have already exceeded the limits of our generosity. I have never wavered from that opinion and provided that it is maintained I would be confident of our ability to maintain a competitive edge on EU dairy markets. As regards domestic supports the bottom line is that there will be no further reform of the CAP and the system of decoupled payments will be fully acceptable as WTO green box compatible. On export competitiveness the EU offer includes the elimination of export refunds by 2013 and clearly this offer will test our ability to compete in third countries. Nonetheless, with careful management of the phasing out process, together with increased scale and efficiency at both producer and processor levels.</P>
    <P>I am confident that Irish dairy exports will continue to compete successfully on international markets with products that reach the highest standards demanded by consumers, reflecting emerging trends and tastes.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42, 67, 72 and 75 together.</P>
    <P>The position throughout Europe is relatively stable. To date thirteen Member States have had cases/outbreaks of H5N1 Avian &rsquo;flu, of which only three have been in poultry/game. The number of cases in wild birds notified to the EU fell by over 50 per cent between March and April (from 355 cases to 158).</P>
    <P>I have, since last September, put in place a comprehensive range of contingency measures aimed at minimising the risk of the virus being introduced to Ireland and ensuring that the Department is equipped, in the event of an outbreak, to ensure its very early identification and speedy eradication. A particular focus in terms of minimising the risk posed to our poultry flocks is to encourage very high levels of biosecurity on poultry farms and the Department has written to over 8,000 poultry farmers enclosing an Information Booklet for Registered Poultry Flockowners. The main objective is to avoid contact between wild birds and domestic poultry, their litter and feed. Further advice issued to all poultry flockowners advising them of the need to ensure that all water sourced from surface supplies used for poultry is treated to inactivate any viruses. This is a key message from my Department, which we have repeated given the potential for the virus to be spread by water to which wild birds may have had access.</P>
    <P>In February, I appointed an Expert Advisory Group, comprised of veterinary, scientific, medical and ornithological experts to advise me in relation to animal health control measures. That Group has now met on three occasions and has consistently concluded that the control measures currently in place are appropriate, given the current level of risk posed by avian &rsquo;flu. The day-to-day disease management responsibility and planning with regard to avian &rsquo;flu rests within my Department.</P>
    <P>Contingency planning is continuing and contact is being maintained with other Government Departments / Offices and State Agencies on whose assistance we may rely including an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces, the Civil Defence, <Col N="1754"/>the National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service etc. Due to the potential public health aspect associated with avian &rsquo;flu, my Department has engaged the services of an Occupational Health Specialist and I am also availing of the assistance of the School of Public Health in UCD who have just finalised occupational health protocols for those involved in disease control activities. These are being made available to the various supporting agencies as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In the event of an outbreak in either wild birds or domestic poultry, the immediate measures to be put into place are provided for in EU legislation and have already been put into effect in those Member States affected by the disease. My Department has circulated all registered poultry flockowners setting out the measures to be implemented in the event of avian &rsquo;flu in wild birds or an outbreak in poultry and the implications of those measures for those located in the areas.</P>
    <P>Finally, because of the obvious mutual concerns shared by authorities on both sides of the border, there has been and continues to be close ongoing contact between my Department and DARD in Belfast and DEFRA in Britain.</P>
    <P>With regard to the importation of birds, an EU-wide ban is in place in respect of the importation of exotic or hobby birds from Third Countries, with the exception of consignments of five or fewer pet birds accompanying their owners who are permanently transferring their residence. The intra-community trade in such birds is provided for subject to the requirements of a General Authorisation issued under the European Communities (Diseases of Animals Acts, 1966 and 1979 Orders) (General Authorisations for Imports) Regulations 1985, and the conditions attaching thereto.</P>
    <P>My Department undertakes inspections of import consignments, at points of import, on the basis of a spot-check regime which is itself based on risk-assessment for disease purposes.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The precautionary measures in place are robust and provide for the full implementation of all EU controls, including those relating to the importation of exotic birds. It should be noted that imports of pet birds from within the EU represent a low risk to Ireland&rsquo;s health status; the avian &rsquo;flu virus being more prevalent in wild birds whose entry cannot be controlled or certified.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied, given the range of measures in place and the vigilant approach being taken to the threat posed, that our contingency arrangements are fully proportionate to the current risk and will continue to be kept under constant review and I will not hesitate to revise our controls should circumstances so demand.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43, 45 and 83 together.</P>
    <P>Overall responsibility for energy policy rests with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, who is leading a cross-Departmental, cross-agency approach in developing and implementing renewable energy policy. As Minister for Agriculture and Food, I have a special interest in the development of the renewable energy sector &mdash; and of biofuels in particular, given that agriculture is the source of most of the raw materials used to manufacture biofuels. My Department has accordingly been working closely with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources on the matter.</P>
    <P>Biofuels is one element in the development of renewable energy. Agriculture and forestry has the potential to be the source of many feedstocks for biofuels. For example, oilseed rape, wheat and sugar beet can be used for the manufacture of liquid transport biofuels, while forestry by products and other farming and food by-products such as meat and bone meal and tallow, can be used for energy/heat generation. Tallow can also be used for biodiesel production. Other energy crops such as short rotation coppice and miscanthus can be used for heat and electricity generation.</P>
    <P>Apart from the need to lessen dependence on fossil fuels for environmental and cost reasons, the development of biofuels, through the growing of energy crops, presents a new opportunity for rural communities and economies. The reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) which was agreed in 2003 gives farmers the freedom to exploit new farming opportunities, including agricultural production for non-food uses.</P>
    <P>Support to farmers for the growing of energy crops may only be granted in accordance with EU regulations. Currently, such support is provided by way of the Energy Crops Scheme which was introduced under the reform of the CAP and which is administered by my Department. Under this scheme, energy crops may qualify for aid of <Col N="1756"/>&euro;45 per hectare provided they are intended primarily for use in the production of biofuels and electric and thermal energy produced from biomass. In addition to this scheme, set aside land can be used for a variety of non-food uses including the growing of crops for energy purpose and will therefore qualify to activate set-aside entitlements under the Single Payment Scheme. The EU has agreed that sugar beet will be eligible for aid under the scheme and may also be grown as an energy crop on set aside land. The aid of &euro;45 per hectare available under the Energy Crops Scheme has proven not to be sufficiently attractive in itself to stimulate the growing of such crops. For this reason at the February Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting I called for a review of the premium and I am pleased to say that the EU Commission has undertaken to review the operation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The production and utilisation of agricultural products for energy purposes can only be sustained in the longer term if biofuels generate a more favourable return than traditional market outlets. I am confident that the extension in the last Budget of excise relief of &euro;205m which, when fully operational, will support the use and production of 163 million litres of biofuels annually, will help drive additional demand for the production of energy crops.</P>
    <P>On the wider agricultural and energy policy agenda, biomass is of increasing importance and significance. Biomass energy in Ireland is mainly derived from wood products, which are converted into heat. I believe that the exploitation of the wood resource especially pulpwood, sawmill residues and harvestable forest residues offers enormous potential and could contribute significantly to our energy and heat requirements. Ireland has an excellent growing climate and an ongoing supply of raw material for wood fuel.</P>
    <P>Wood residues are already being used to produce heat for sawmills across the country and the wood energy market is poised for growth with a number of commercial start-ups and a supply chain emerging. The &euro;27m &ldquo;Greener Homes&rdquo; grant programme for the domestic sector announced by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources recently will help drive demand for wood biomass. The grant aid for commercial scale biomass boilers to be announced in the coming weeks will stimulate demand even further. My Department is also actively promoting the use of wood biomass through grants to promote and develop sustainable forestry, including alternative timber uses and we are close to finalising a scheme of supports for the purchase of specialist wood biomass harvesting equipment. We are directly promoting the use of wood biomass by the installation of a wood heating system at the Department&rsquo;s offices at Johnstown Castle.</P>
    <P>Short rotation coppice and miscanthus have considerable potential for heat/electricity gener<Col N="1757"/>ation. In Ireland, however, the production of short rotation coppice is relatively undeveloped. Thus costs of production, especially the substantial initial establishment costs, will be high due to lack of economies of scale. My Department is currently pursuing a proposal to reactivate establishment grants for short rotation coppice. I have received a number of proposals for the introduction of establishment grants for miscanthus and these are also being considered.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile my Department in conjunction with Teagasc and COFORD has examined the potential of energy crops, wood biomass and farming and food by products. Last year, we began providing direct funding, on a competitive basis, to support priority research projects in relation to biofuels. This funding is channelled through the Department&rsquo;s Research Stimulus Fund Programme. Three of the projects selected under the 2005 call for proposals directly relate to biofuels and energy crops and received total grant assistance of some &euro;0.9m. The funding available under the Programme has now been substantially increased and a further call for projects was recently advertised in the national press. This call also includes the non-food uses of agricultural land.</P>
    <P>Apart from purpose grown energy crops and wood biomass, there are several by-products of the farming and food processing industries that can be recovered and used in various ways as biofuels. These are mainly animal by-products such as meat and bone meal, tallow, animal manures and food by-products. There are significant opportunities for the use of animal by-products as biofuels some of which are being considered actively. Commercial realities are driving these proposals. The disposal of by-products imposes a cost on industry and it makes economic sense to offset this cost by realising the potential of the by-products as an energy source. Tallow is used at present as a biofuel in thermal boilers in rendering plants and larger meat export plants to provide energy. A recent EU Regulation provides for the conversion of tallow to biodiesel. Some rendering plants are considering building biodiesel plants for this purpose using various combinations of tallow, recovered vegetable oil and rapeseed oil.</P>
    <P>The importance of biofuels and bioenergy is recognised in the AGRI Vision 2015 ACTION Plan and I will continue to work closely with my colleague the Minister for Communications Marine and Natural Resources to ensure that agriculture contributes to the development of biofuels as part of a coherent energy policy.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44, 47, 93 and 99 together.</P>
    <P>One of my main objectives since assuming office as Minister for Agriculture and Food, was to ensure the efficient implementation of the decoupled Single Payment Scheme &mdash; the most significant change to agricultural support since our accession to the European Community.</P>
    <P>This huge task was successfully implemented when over &euro;1 billion in Single Payments issued to 118,500 farmers last December, meeting the target we had set ourselves of making the payments on the first possible date. This was a major undertaking and the outcome, after painstaking preparatory work in establishing individual entitlements, was, by any standards, a major achievement. Total payments to date amount to &euro;1,162 million, involving over 99% of farmers, who hold entitlements and who applied for the 2005 Single Payment Scheme.</P>
    <P>Under EU legislation, Member States may commence payment under the Single Payment Scheme on 1 December of the year of application, with payments being fully processed by the following 30 June. My priority in 2005, the first year of this new Scheme, was to maximize the number of payments to eligible applicants by the earliest date possible of 1 December and I am satisfied that this was achieved. Since then, it has been my absolute priority to ensure that the issues that are holding up the remaining cases are resolved with the applicants concerned and that payments are made without undue delay. To this end, I have arranged that payments issue on a very regular basis, as soon as the problems with the outstanding cases are resolved.</P><Col N="1759"/>
    <P>To date, almost 127,000 farmers have been paid under the Scheme, while there are 795 applicants with entitlements with outstanding issues to be resolved before payment can be made.</P>
    <P>In common with the Direct Payment Schemes, which the Single Payment Scheme replaced, delays in processing can be caused by many factors, including incomplete application forms, errors on applications and discrepancies highlighted following computer validation, which must be resolved via correspondence with the applicant. In many cases, payment could not be made because applicants did not submit an application to transfer the Single Payment entitlements, with lands, by way of inheritance, gift, lease or purchase. Many of these applications were only received after my Department made direct contact with the farmers in question, and some have yet to be submitted. Every effort is being made by my Department to resolve the outstanding cases but many of these are extremely complex and, in other cases, my Department is still awaiting documentation before payment can be made.</P>
    <P>I should add that the changeover to the Single Payment was undertaken while work continued on winding up the coupled schemes. The successful introduction of the Single Payment Scheme in Ireland in 2005 is testimony to the efforts of all concerned. It is my intention that this success will be built on into the future.</P>
    <P>With regard to the 2006 Single Payment Scheme, the Deputy will be aware that the closing date for receipt of applications was Monday of the week, 15 May 2006. While there is a facility for farmers to lodge applications after this date, up to 9 June 2005, any such applications will be subject to a regulatory 1% per working day penalty. I am very encouraged, however, by the pattern of application under the 2006 Scheme and have every reason to believe that late applications will be fewer than the 1,000 under the 2005 Scheme.</P>
    <P>While initial processing commenced immediately, the first 2006 applications were received in my Department, it will be appreciated that dealing with the volume of applications involved is an enormous task. However, it is hoped that fewer errors will be revealed in the validation process, particularly given the refinements in the application form. Similarly, farmers themselves are more familiar with the requirements of the new scheme, having had the experience of 2005.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Currently, the regulations provide for payments to commence on 1 December of the year of application. However, conscious of farmers&rsquo; cash flow and mindful that Christmas makes additional demands on all, including farmers, I have instructed my officials to seek the approval of the EU Commission for making advance payments, effective from 16 October, the first day of the EU financial year.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Commissioner Fischer Boel, in her recent address to the D&aacute;il, stated that Ireland and the EU may expect fierce competition in key agricultural markets such as beef and dairy production in the context of a new WTO agreement. The statement was not unexpected and reflects my own opinion that there will be increased competition on international markets in the future. The WTO negotiations are ongoing and the objective of the talks is a fair and equitable balance between the three pillars within agriculture of market access, domestic support and export competitiveness.</P>
    <P>As regards market access I have stated repeatedly that there should be no further concessions granted to our negotiating partners and that we have already exceeded the limits of our generosity. I have never wavered from that opinion and provided that it is maintained I would be confident of our ability to maintain a competitive edge on EU dairy markets. As regards domestic supports the bottom line is that there will be no further reform of the CAP and the system of decoupled payments will be fully acceptable as WTO green box compatible. On export competitiveness the EU offer includes the elimination of export refunds by 2013 and clearly this offer will test our ability to compete in third countries. Nonetheless, with careful management of the phasing out process, together with increased scale and efficiency at both producer and processor levels.</P>
    <P>I am confident that Irish dairy exports will continue to compete successfully on international markets with products that reach the highest standards demanded by consumers, reflecting emerging trends and tastes.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49, 71, 79 and 100 together.</P>
    <P>Following receipt of the required EU approval, the revised Farm Waste Management Scheme was launched by my Department on 24 March 2006. The principal changes to the Scheme include &mdash; (a) an increase in the standard grant-rate from 40% to 60%, with 70% being available in the four Zone C counties; (b) an extension of the Scheme for the first time to sectors such as horses, deer, goats, pigs and poultry, and mushroom compost; (c) the removal of any minimum income requirements from farming from the Scheme so that all small farmers can participate in the Scheme; and (d) an increase in the maximum eligible investment from &euro;75,000 to &euro;120,000 per holding.</P>
    <P>As far as funding is concerned, a sum of &euro;43 million is available in this year&rsquo;s estimates for the Scheme and I am satisfied that sufficient funding will be made available for the duration of the Scheme to finance the likely demand. The Standard Costings for the Scheme are currently under review. Pending the outcome of that review, my Department&rsquo;s current Standard Costings are being used. Detailed figures in regard to the average rise in the cost of steel over the previous five years, this being only one of the components taken into account when revising the Standard Costings, will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>As regards rainwater, the technical specifications for farm buildings operated by my Department for the purposes of the Scheme require the installation of adequate arrangements for the separation of clean and dirty water as part of the conditions of any new investment. In <Col N="1762"/>addition, I have added the installation of guttering on existing buildings as a further new eligible item in the terms of the revised Scheme.</P>

	<P>Under the EU Animal By-products Regulation (Regulation (EC) No. 1774/2002), which came into effect on 1 June 2003, Category 3 meat-and-bone meal, which is derived from animals deemed fit for human consumption, can be used in pet food. By contrast Category 1 meat-and-bone meal, which is derived from high-risk material including BSE carcases and suspects, is totally excluded from the food chain based on scientific grounds; and Category 2 meat-and-bone meal, which is derived from material including condemned meat, manure and gut contents, can only be used in limited circumstances for biogas production. This categorization is based on scientific risk-based assessment by the appropriate EU authorities.</P>
    <P>For a number of years, because of concerns in relation to BSE since its discovery here in 1989, national legislation went beyond EU legislation and prohibited the use of Category 3 meat-and-bone meal for feed purposes to prevent the danger of possible exposure of cattle to the infective BSE agent through feed and in order to ensure the safety of consumers of beef.</P>
    <P>During 2005 the situation was reviewed, having regard to the EU legislation, the declining number of BSE cases and the fact that some legally imported pet food containing Category 3 meat-and-bone meal was coming in to Ireland from other EU countries. I was also conscious of the need to provide productive outlets for the disposal of certain animal by-products where these do not pose a risk to public or animal health.</P>
    <P>I decided in all the circumstances to allow the use of Category 3 meat-and-bone meal in the manufacture of dried packaged pet food. SI 248 of 2003 was amended by SI 707 in November 2005 to introduce this change.</P>
    <P>Strict conditions apply in the pet food manufacturing process and controls are in operation covering the receipt of meat-and-bone meal in sealed bags; microbiological testing for salmonella; the need for a dedicated intake/ storage area; and facilities for the safe disposal of unused meat-and-bone meal through rendering or incineration.</P>

	<P>The mission of my Department is to lead the sustainable development of a competitive, consumer focused agrifood sector and to contribute to a vibrant rural economy and society.</P>
    <P>Agri-Vision 2015 is a comprehensive action plan for the future of the agrifood sector. Built on the three pillars of Competitiveness, Innovation and Consumer-Focus, the Plan sets out a new vision for the future of the sector in the light of new changes impacting on it such as the change to a decoupled payments regime, a more liberalised trade policy, changes in lifestyle, the clear emergence of technology and R&amp;D as significant market drivers and major changes in the structures of farming and retailing. There are also many actions to be taken in the other areas such as small-scale enterprises, horticulture and the organic sector, forestry, renewable energy and rural development. The Plan contains 166 specific actions under a series of headings to be implemented in the near future with the objective of ensuring that the Irish agrifood sector compares to the best in the EU and in the world in terms of knowledge base, competitiveness, innovation and marketing.</P>
    <P>As regards specific measures for the development of local and regional food economies, I initiated a series of regional food fora involving my Department, An Bord Bia and the other food development agencies. The first forum was held in Donegal in late 2005 on the theme &ldquo;Market Focus for small food enterprises&rdquo;. Speakers shared experiences on regional food development with food enterprises from Counties Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim. State agencies and service providers were on hand to assist producers and food enterprises interested in growing their business and food products from the North West were showcased to highlight the importance of food to the Region&rsquo;s economy.</P>
    <P>The next Food Forum will be held in the North-East on 12th June and this will offer small food entrepreneurs from counties Cavan, Monaghan, Louth and Meath good opportunities to showcase products, build business linkages and obtain advice on what development agencies have to offer. By working closely with farmers, small food producers and local agencies we can successfully promote food enterprise and innovation to develop unique products reflecting the strengths of each region.</P>
    <P>An Bord Bia which operates under the aegis of my Department recently hosted a very successful International Speciality Food Forum, at the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, Dublin on the theme &rsquo;Regional and Local Foods &mdash; An Oppor<Col N="1764"/>tunity for Growth&rsquo;. The objective of the event was to support and develop sales of Irish small business and speciality food companies on the core markets of Ireland and the UK. Up to 80 Irish speciality and premium food and drink producers showcased their products to some 150 trade buyers attending from Ireland and the UK. This represented the largest showcase of speciality Irish food and drink companies under one roof in 2006 and provided a valuable framework for networking with innovative regional and local companies.</P>
    <P>An Bord Bia, works closely with other State and local agencies to exploit the growing opportunities for small food producers. In co-operation with Invest Northern Ireland, they have published a comprehensive information guide on the operation of farmers markets. Bord Bia has a dedicated person in the Small Business Department to assist producers and individuals, and performs a vital support function through the provision of advice and mentoring assistance. They have, in co-operation with Teagasc, undertaken research on the opportunities for Irish speciality and local foods in Great Britain, in particular the motives of speciality food consumers, to assist and orient small food companies interested in that market and have also undertaken research into the authentic ingredients which form part of Ireland&rsquo;s food tradition and which could raise awareness of local and regional foods and so assist producers with production diversification.</P>
    <P>The output of the Irish artisan and speciality food sectors grew 10% in 2005 to reach &euro;475m. This strong performance demonstrates the opportunities that exist for the right products.</P>

	<P>A comprehensive range of incentives and supports is available from my Department to encourage the planting of forestry.</P>
    <P>Under the Forestry Grant and Premium Scheme, grants are available to cover 100% of planting costs, as well as a 20-year tax-free premium for farmers (15 years for non-farmers) of up to &euro;500 per hectare, depending on the species planted. Substantial tax concessions are also in place for forest-owners.</P>
    <P>The Single Farm Payment Scheme enables farm-foresters to plant up to 50% of their eligible claimed areas with forestry, attracting immediate payment of forestry premiums, while still drawing down their full Single Farm Payment.</P>
    <P>Supports are also available for the growing forest in the form of grants for the shaping of broadleaves and pruning of conifers, and for the construction of forest roads.</P><Col N="1765"/>
    <P>In addition to these direct supports, funding is provided for research, advisory services and promotion. Free and independent advice on all forestry matters is available from Teagasc. This advice is provided with funding support from my Department.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that sustainable forestry is of major importance to the securing the viability of rural Ireland and underpinning quality of life. It represents a major option for effective land-use in Ireland.</P>

     <Quest>the incentives which are available, the incentives she is empowered to make available and the incentives she is prepared to make available to ensure that the site of the Mallow sugar plant is used for the production of an agricultural commodity that can at least fill some of the gap left by the closure of the factory on that site by Greencore; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The question of full dismantling or partial dismantling and the continued use of the Mallow plant for production of another agricultural commodity is a matter for commercial decision by Greencore itself and the initiative on this rests with the Company. If Greencore were to submit an application for the maximum amount of restructuring aid under the terms of the reform agreement that would require full dismantling of the plant. There is also the option of partial dismantling of a factory and its use for non-sugar production while still attracting 75% of the aid available.</P>
    <P>I raised the possibility of using Mallow for ethanol production with Greencore having regard to the incentive under the restructuring scheme, the inclusion of sugar beet in the energy crops scheme and the extension in the last budget of excise relief of &euro;205m which, when fully operational will support the use and production of 163 million litres of biofuels annually. The company has informed me that it does not intend to produce bioethanol in Mallow but the incentives remain in place which allow other potential developers to consider the option.</P>

	<P>Food business operators who mislead consumers in believing that food which is not of Irish origin is Irish may be committing an offence under existing food labelling legislation. Any such instances should be brought to the attention of the F.S.A.I. which is the central authority for the enforcement of food labelling.</P>
    <P>&rsquo;Substantial transformation&rsquo; is a procedure used in normal business operations to allow operators to declare goods as being manufactured in the country where considerable processing has taken place. I am very concerned that this practice might be used to mislead consumers as to the origin of the product. I have raised this issue directly with the Commission on a number of occasions and indeed have been in contact with the EU Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, Mr. Kyprianou again earlier this year about the matter.</P>
    <P>Subsequently the Commission decided to review EU labelling. In this context the Commission recently published a consultative document on &rsquo;Labelling: Competitiveness, Consumer Information and Better Regulation in the EU&rsquo; and invited Member States for submissions by mid June 2006. My Department is currently preparing a submission in which we will again raise this matter.</P>
    <P>The report to which the Deputy refers was an internal report of the FSAI on an audit to determine compliance with labelling and traceability requirements. The FSAI undertook this audit to determine whether food business operators in the fish, beef and poultry industries have in place a system of product traceability and recall.</P>
    <P>The FSAI copied to my Department the findings in the Report that relate specifically to premises that come within its remit. The Veterinary Inspectorate in my Department examined each of the issues identified in the report. While some breaches of labelling legislation were noted during the audit, there was no threat to public health and all of the issues identified have been addressed to the satisfaction of the FSAI.</P>

	<P>Teagasc has an ongoing programme of research that investigates the potential risks and benefits associated with the growing of GM crops in Ireland including, inter alia, the economic implications. Preliminary research completed by them to date does indicate that the cultivation of certain crops with certain modifications may provide a financial incentive to the Irish farmer.</P>
    <P>In order to establish greater clarity in the matter I requested Teagasc to carry out an evaluation of the possible national economic implications for the Agri-Food industry from the use of GMOs in crop and livestock production. Teagasc have completed their study which was based on two scenarios: </P>
    <P LI="1">(i) The economic implications of only allowing the importation into Ireland of certified GM-free soyabean and maize livestock feed ingredients; and </P>
       <P LI="1">(ii) The economic implications of GM-free crop cultivation in Ireland.</P>
    <P FLI="0">In the first scenario the study showed that substantial additional costs would be placed on the livestock sector, particularly on specialist dairy and beef farmers, if they were to use certified GM free soya and maize only in feeding stuffs. In the second scenario the study examined five hypothetical GM crops which could be grown here &mdash; <Col N="1768"/>herbicide tolerant sugar beet, Septoria resistant winter wheat, Fusarium resistant winter wheat, Rhyncosporium resistant spring barley and blight resistant potatoes. This study showed that increased profits could be generated for growers of these crops compared to their conventional equivalent. However, the study showed that there is a significant cost in relation to Identity Preservation for conventional growers in a coexistence arrangement.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of farm incomes and viability is dependant on a number of factors. It should be noted that 82% of net aggregate farm income earned by farmers in 2005 was derived from direct payments; these payments totalled &euro;2.3 billion.</P>
    <P>Reform of the Common Agriculture Policy since the early 1990&rsquo;s has emphasised supporting farm income through direct payments and reducing market supports (such as intervention, aid for private storage, and export subsidies) which impact on farm gate prices. This policy, which was enhanced in the Agenda 2000 reform of the CAP, helped to achieve better market balance for most commodities while farm incomes were supported by direct payments.</P>
    <P>With the implementation of decoupling, farmers are now supported by the substantial income platform of the Single Farm Payment and can base their production decisions on the requirements of the consumer and the returns obtained from the market. This provides the best basis for facilitating the viability of farming households.</P>

	<P>The implementation of the Nitrates Directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. In December, the Minister made Regulations giving legal effect to Ireland&rsquo;s National Action Programme under the Nitrates Directive. These Regulations were finalised following difficult negotiations between the European Commission and officials of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Govern<Col N="1769"/>ment and the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>In January, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government announced a short de facto deferral of Part 3 of the Regulations, which covers nutrient management. This was to allow Teagasc to submit revised advice in relation to phosphorus limits. In March Teagasc provided a detailed submission which dealt with phosphorus and also with other aspects of the Regulations. Officials of the two Departments and representatives from Teagasc met the Commission on 22 March where the Teagasc experts were given the opportunity to present the revised scientific advice and to clarify certain aspects.</P>
    <P>The Commission did not offer any definitive conclusions on the new advice at that meeting, but indicated that it was up to Ireland to make proposals for changes in the Regulations. In this connection, officials of the two Departments and senior Teagasc personnel have since had detailed technical discussions on the main elements of the Teagasc submission. I and my officials have maintained close contact with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and his staff in considering the changes in the Regulations. This work has progressed well and I understand that Minister Roche is now about to send his proposals for changes to the Commission.</P>
    <P>The Commission&rsquo;s agreement will be required for any changes but I am satisfied that they are open to arguments that are scientifically robust. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and I will continue to work together to bring this matter to a conclusion and at the same time create the conditions for the negotiations on a derogation, which is vital to a large number of more intensive farmers, to proceed.</P>

	<P>The general food labelling legislation comes within the remit of the Department of Health &amp; Children. My Department has responsibility for specific labelling regulations such as the labelling of beef. It is governed by comprehensive EU regulations that were introduced in 2000 and is underpinned by a full national cattle identification and traceability system. However, these labelling requirements only apply as far as retail level. Primary legislation to allow for the extension of these regulations to the catering sector was enacted by the Oireachtas in March 2006 by way of an amendment to the Health Act 1947. Following consultation with the FSAI, my Department has submitted the necessary draft Beef Regulations to the Department of Health and Children. It is expected that the Regulations will be in place this summer.</P>
    <P>The amended Heath Act 1947 will also facilitate the extension of country of origin labelling to all meats including poultrymeat. The EU Commission, however, is opposed to Member States introducing legislation on compulsory labelling that is over and above the common EU requirement. There would also be serious challenges in the implementation and enforcement of national legislation in the absence of harmonised EU provisions due to such factors as the amount of processing and repackaging operations that poultry in particular may be subjected to before arrival in <Col N="1771"/>this country. Therefore, the preferable way forward is that the EU Commission would progress the question of origin labelling of poultry. I have raised this issue with Commissioner Kyprianou and am taking every opportunity to press for progress on the matter. I will also raise this matter in the context of the current EU review of food labelling.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that if no action is taken at EU level, I will put forward proposals for the extension of country of origin labelling on all meats at retail and catering levels here and to submit such proposals for EU approval.</P>
    <P>Pending completion of the Regulations, the bodies representing the hotels, restaurants and vintners agreed to recommend to their members to provide country of origin information on a voluntary basis in respect of the beef served in their premises. An assessment of the effect of this voluntary action has not been carried out. In any event, the introduction of the mandatory requirements which will be enforced by FSAI, are now at an advanced stage and are expected to be in place this summer.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 80 together.</P>
    <P>My Department has certain statutory responsibility for the welfare and protection of farmed animals. The legislation governing this is the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes Act 1984 and the European Communities (Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes) Regulations, 2000. In addition there is specific legislation in relation to pigs, calves and laying hens.</P>
    <P>Welfare cases which come to notice are dealt with, generally, by officers based in my Department&rsquo;s District Veterinary Offices. These officers deal with the implementation of animal welfare legislation as well as having responsibilities in a wide number of other areas related to animal health, disease control etc. I am satisfied that the resources available within my Department are <Col N="1772"/>sufficient to deal with such cases and to provide a high standard of animal welfare.</P>
    <P>In 2004 the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council (FAWAC) developed an Early Warning/Intervention System (EWS) for dealing with animal welfare cases involving my Department, Irish Farmers&rsquo; Association and the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty of Animals. The objective of the system is to provide a framework within which farm animal welfare problems can be identified before they become critical or overwhelming. The new system allows for concerned individuals to approach their local IFA representatives, their local SPCA or my Department in the knowledge that the matter will thereafter be dealt with in the most effective, timely and sensitive manner.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing, my Department makes ex-gratia payments annually to organisations, including the ISPCA, involved in the direct delivery of animal care and welfare services to assist in their on-going work. To date we have provided a total of &euro;5.97 million to such bodies, some &euro;1.2m of which was paid to 86 organisations in December last to assist them during 2006. A provision of &euro;1.1m for this purpose is included in my Department&rsquo;s Estimates for 2006 and applications will be invited later this year for payments in respect of 2007. A figure of approximately &euro;543,000 has been paid to date to the ISPCA and affiliated branches.</P>
    <P>The main statutes governing cruelty to animals in this country are the Protection of Animals Acts 1911 and 1965. Responsibility for pursuing complaints under that legislation rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who may, on receipt of a complaint, investigate and bring a prosecution against any person alleged to have committed an act of cruelty against an animal. Officers of my Department are regularly involved in assisting the Garda in such cases.</P>

	<P>The implementation of the Nitrates Directive is a matter for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
    <P>The European Court of Justice delivered a judgment in March 2004 that Ireland was non-compliant with the Nitrates Directive by reason mainly of failing to establish and implement an Action Programme to protect waters against pollution by farming. The establishment of an <Col N="1773"/>Action Programme requires (a) the development of a programme of measures to be taken, and (b) the enactment of appropriate legislation to give statutory effect to the programme. The judgement against Ireland is part of a pattern of judgements made by the Court against a number of Member States on this issue. The Action Programme and Regulations introduced by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, in consultation with my Department, have been designed to address the issues identified in the European Court judgement against Ireland.</P>

	<P>I travelled to the United States on a food business development visit from 28th April to 7th May organised by Enterprise Ireland. I was accompanied from Ireland by the Secretary General of my Department, my Departmental Private Secretary, the Executive Director of Enterprise Ireland and the Manager of the Food and Consumer Division of Enterprise Ireland. In the US I was joined by the Senior Vice President of Food Research and Innovation of Enterprise Ireland (New York) and the First Secretary at the Irish Embassy in Washington D.C. with responsibility for Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the visit was to secure foreign direct investment in the Irish food industry from the US and to establish food innovation &amp; research networks between the U.S. and Ireland. I had a series of meetings with top-level management in a number of major U.S. companies and research institutions including Glanbia, Altech, Abbot Nutrition, Kerry Foods and University of California (Davis). I also met with top management in Brown Foreman and D.D. Williamson, both of which are US-based companies with substantial operations in Ireland.</P>
    <P>While in Washington D.C., I met with the U.S. Deputy Secretary of Agriculture, Charles Conner; the Chair of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, Senator Saxby Chambliss as well as the Chair of the House Agriculture Committee, Congressman Bob Goodlatte. I also met with Congressman Collin Peterson. The issues discussed at these meetings included the situation in the agriculture and food industry in Ireland, the E.U. and the U.S., current policy developments and, in particular, the on-going negotiations on the new W.T.O. round.</P>
    <P>In my discussions, I outlined the effect of the on-going CAP reforms, including decoupling and <Col N="1774"/>the introduction of the Single Farm Payment. The U.S. side, in turn, indicated its assessment of the possibilities for policy change in the next U.S. Farm Bill. There was also a useful exchange of views on the W.T.O. and the issues arising in the Doha Round.</P>
    <P>In discussions with U.S. political figures I also raised other issues, notably the situation of undocumented Irish immigrants and I used the opportunity to outline the position of the Irish Government on the need to find an acceptable and early resolution.</P>

	<P>As a member of the EU and the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Ireland is in a position to avail of opportunities for trade that are essential for the development of our open economy. Membership of these organizations also brings reciprocal trade obligations. All such imports must come from third countries or areas of third countries that have been approved by the EU authorities for export to the EU.</P>
    <P>In the current WTO discussions in the Council, I have always pressed very strongly the non-trade aspect of market access, which I regard as a crucial element in the overall negotiations. I will be doing so again on Monday next when WTO will be discussed in the Council and will be reminding the Commission once again of the importance of equivalence in standards, particularly in relation to all exporting countries, including Brazil.</P>
    <P>I fully support the policy that animal products imported into the EU from Third Countries meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, EU Member States. In this context I contacted the Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, Mr. Markos Kyprianou concerning the sanitary rules applying to the import of livestock products, especially beef, into the European Union.</P>
    <P>The Commissioner pointed out that, with respect to traceability and controls of residues of veterinary medicines, the purpose of EU legislation is not to impose on exporting third countries a system of guarantees that is equal to the EU system, but that the exporting country provides guarantees that are equivalent to the standards applied in the EU.</P>
    <P>The Commissioner indicated his service is committed to protect the health of European Consumers and European Livestock. Adoption of safeguard measures in relation to imports, for <Col N="1775"/>example in the matter of dealing with the risk to the EU of the spread of high pathogenic avian influenza, in the finding of residues of unauthorised substances in poultry meat and in the quick and proportionate protective measures applied to imports of beef as a result of the recent outbreaks of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) demonstrate the Commission&rsquo;s primary objective of maintaining the high sanitary status of the Community and respecting the EU&rsquo;s commitment under the WTO Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS agreement).</P>
    <P>The Commissioner has assured me that the Commission will not hesitate to take the appropriate protection measures if a product, imported from a third country or produced in the domestic market represents a risk for the health of EC consumers, livestock or plants.</P>
    <P>A EU Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) inspection to evaluate animal health and public health control systems, traceability and certification procedures in place in Brazil was carried out in September of last year. The FVO recently published its findings following a period of consultation with the Brazilian competent authorities and the review of action plans that have been submitted by the Brazilian Authorities to the Commission. This report, as well as all previous FVO reports on inspection of third countries&rsquo; controls for export, may be accessed from the EU Commission&rsquo;s website.</P>
    <P>While the report comments on a general improvement in the structure, organisation and tasks of the Brazilian Competent Authorities it has listed a number of recommendations to the authorities to address deficiencies that were recorded in the course of its audit. The Brazilian Authorities have undertaken to submit an Action Plan in response to these recommendations and my Department will continue to monitor the position.</P>
    <P>My Department is seeking assurances from the Commission that the FVO will undertake further missions to Brazil to evaluate the implementation of its action plan. At a recent meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health where the matter was again raised by Ireland, the Commission indicated to Ireland that a FVO mission is being planned to take place some time before the end of the summer.</P>
    <P>In the meantime additional health certification requirements have been introduced for imported beef from Brazil under Commission Decision 2006/259/EC requiring guarantees concerning animal contacts, vaccination programmes and surveillance. These certification provisions took effect from 31 March 2006 and they are checked by the EU approved Border Inspection Posts through which all 3rd country imports must first be submitted.</P>

	<P>The Irish dairy industry continues to contribute very substantially to the national economy, with an annual output value of some &euro;2.3 billion. Last year Irish dairy exports performed exceptionally well totalling &euro;2 billion, despite downward adjustments to EU market supports brought about by the implementation of the Luxembourg Agreement on the reform of the CAP.</P>
    <P>A loss of competitiveness on world markets caused by greater competition and the strengthening of the Euro against the US dollar (now at &euro;1/$1.29) have meant that 2006 is proving to be a more challenging year for the industry. Recent increases in the export refunds for butter and WMP are a very welcome development but the value of these increases has been eroded by market and exchange rate factors. Moreover the EU Commission continues pushing the internal market prices of dairy products downward to the Mid Term Reform levels through the market management measures.</P>
    <P>When the Commission moved aggressively to reduce internal aids and export subsidies to the new intervention price levels last year, which caused a high degree of volatility, I very strongly resisted and pressed the Commissioner at the Council of Ministers to redirect policy and restore market stability. With the support of other Ministers I succeeded in having the market for the remainder of 2005 stabilised and market competitiveness restored. As we move towards the further agreed intervention price reductions next July I will continue to emphasise the need for stability on the market. Indeed I have frequently raised this matter with the Commissioner bilaterally, most recently last week, and she is fully aware of my view that market stability is essential to allow the dairy industry time to adjust to the current market realities and adapt their business strategies accordingly. </P>

	<P>The implementation of the Nitrates Directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. In December, the Minister made Regulations giving legal effect to Ireland&rsquo;s National Action Programme under the Nitrates Directive. These Regulations were finalised following difficult negotiations between the European Commission and officials of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>In January, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government announced a short de facto deferral of Part 3 of the Regulations, which covers nutrient management. This was to allow Teagasc to submit revised advice in relation to phosphorus limits. In March Teagasc provided a detailed submission which dealt with phosphorus and also with other aspects of the Regulations. Officials of the two Departments and representatives from Teagasc met the Commission on 22 March where the Teagasc experts were given the opportunity to present the revised scientific advice and to clarify certain aspects.</P>
    <P>The Commission did not offer any definitive conclusions on the new advice at that meeting, but indicated that it was up to Ireland to make proposals for changes in the Regulations. In this connection, officials of the two Departments and senior Teagasc personnel have since had detailed technical discussions on the main elements of the Teagasc submission. I and my officials have maintained close contact with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and his staff in considering the changes in the Regulations. This work has progressed well and I understand that Minister Roche is now about to send his proposals for changes to the Commission.</P>
    <P>The Commission&rsquo;s agreement will be required for any changes but I am satisfied that they are open to arguments that are scientifically robust. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and I will continue to work together to bring this matter to a conclusion and at the same time create the conditions for the negotiations on a derogation, which is vital to a large number of more intensive farmers to proceed.</P>

	<P>The regional and speciality food sector is worth approximately &euro;475 million in Ireland and is growing at an annual rate of 10%. This expanding sector accounts for over 300 small food enterprises, distributed throughout the country, and producing a diverse range of products including farmhouse dairy, meat, fish, horticulture, confectionery, bakery and prepared foods.</P>
    <P>International research indicates that the speciality food and drink sector will be worth around &euro;97 billion in Europe and the USA by 2009. According to the Boston Consulting Group, the luxury food market is growing at a rate of 15% annually. Recent research conducted by Teagasc, in conjunction with Bord Bia, shows that issues of taste, variety, authenticity, provenance, and indulgence are driving demand in this market.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, the speciality food market is also influenced by a number of socioeconomic factors such as increased affluence, growing ethnic diversity of our population and the proliferation of food and cookery items in the media. Food Tourism is also gaining momentum internationally and providing alternative marketing opportunities for speciality foods.</P>
    <P>I am committed to supporting and further developing this sector in Ireland. I was particularly pleased to open &ldquo;Bord Bia&rsquo;s 3rd International Speciality Food Forum&rdquo; in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham last week. This event aimed to support and enhance speciality food sales by bringing together 85 food producers from Ireland, north and south, with 150 buyers from Ireland, the UK, France and Germany. It is expected to result in additional sales of approximately &euro;3 million in the next 18 months and the establishment of important long term trading links.</P>
    <P>Bord Bia, which operates under the aegis of my Department, is establishing a &rsquo;Centre of Excellence&rsquo; focused on servicing the market development related needs of small, regional and speciality food producers. My Department and Bord Bia are also organising a series of regional food events aimed at facilitating greater interaction between all of the stakeholders in the speciality and regional food sector, particularly producers and support agencies.</P>
    <P>There are now over 100 farmers markets operating throughout the country at present, providing an important route to market for speciality food producers. Bord Bia is working closely with State and local agencies to exploit the growing opportunities presented by these markets for local, regional and speciality food producers. In addition to providing a range of support services for farmers markets including advice and mentoring assistance, Bord Bia has also published a comprehensive information guide on the running and operation of these markets.</P><Col N="1779"/>
    <P>Earlier this year, the Bord Bia/OPW farmer&rsquo;s markets programme for 2006 was launched. This is a new and significant extension of the very successful &rsquo;Food at Farmleigh&rsquo; programme, with five regional Heritage sites selected for one-day Food Market events. The programme will take place in Cork, Wexford, Kildare, Donegal and Laois and result in considerable exposure for speciality food producers.</P>
    <P>As regards the cultivation of GM crops, EU legislation adopted by the European Parliament and the Council and which is binding on all Member States, specifically prohibits the unilateral declaration of a GM free country. However, there is a safeguard clause where if a Member State has detailed grounds, on the basis of scientific evidence that a GMO constitutes a risk to human health or the environment, then that Member State may provisionally restrict or prohibit the growing of that GM crop in its territory or in any region of its territory. The Commission must then be immediately informed and it will decide within sixty days if the ban is scientifically based. There is also the possibility for producers to voluntarily decide not to cultivate GMO&rsquo;s in a region.</P>

	<P>My Department has been aware for some time that, following the death of five cows on a farm in South Wales, tests revealed that two of the cows tested positive for anthrax. I am satisfied that the measures employed by the Welsh authorities in relation to the disposal of the cattle and the fact that no cattle had been sent from the farm in question for the food chain for almost 12 months eliminates any risk of introduction of the disease into Ireland from this particular incident.</P>
    <P>The last incidence of anthrax arose in December 1970 on two adjoining farms in Co. Limerick, resulting in the death of five cattle. These premises were placed under the normal restrictions and the usual precautions were taken including the disposal of the animals on site. There was no further spread of the disease. My Department does not keep statistics in relation to the investigation of suspect cases.</P>
    <P>Anthrax is classified as a Class A Disease under the Diseases of Animals Act 1966. The Act requires that any suspect case is immediately notified to my Department and provides for the compulsory slaughter of any infected animals and their immediate and appropriate disposal. I am satisfied that the measures currently available under the legislation are sufficient to ensure that an outbreak of anthrax would be dealt with appropriately without the need for a dedicated contingency plan given the rarity of the disease in Ireland.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The European model of agriculture, which is enshrined in the Common Agricultural Policy, is based on maintaining competitive, multifunctional and sustainable farming dispersed throughout the Union while one of the core principles of the CAP is to assure the availability of supply. The EU ensures the highest standards of hygiene and traceability throughout the food chain through a range of food safety, consumer protection, veterinary and environmental legislation and other requirements. These policies are, and will continue to be, supported by substantial funding for the CAP and rural development. Funding for the period to 2013 was agreed in the decision on the Financial Perspective 2007-3013 at the European Council in December 2005. I am satisfied that the CAP as it has evolved following successive reforms is reflected in the EU&rsquo;s negotiating mandate, as agreed by the Council of Ministers, for the current WTO negotiations. The EU mandate provides that the terms of a new WTO agreement will not undermine these reforms or require a further reform of the CAP.</P>
    <P>A key component of the most recent CAP reform was the introduction of decoupled support payments to farmers which are no longer linked to production. The new Single Farm Payment means that, for the future, farmers are &rsquo;free to farm&rsquo; subject to the cross-compliance requirements which require that land must be kept in good agricultural condition and environmental and animal welfare conditions must be respected. Farmers&rsquo; production choices will, for the future, be determined by what the market wants rather than by the range of subsidies on offer. In those circumstances, farmers may decide to diversify rather than continue with traditional enterprises. The development of, and investments in, the agriculture and food sectors are government by the terms of the CAP and rural development policy and by strict State Aid rules which apply equally throughout the Union which together are designed to prevent the re-nationalisation of the CAP and distortion of trade or competition.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The overall national strategy for the eradication of TB provides for a comprehensive range of measures, including the mandatory annual testing for all cattle in the national herd, the early removal of reactors, a wildlife programme involving the targeted removal of badgers where they are implicated in a TB outbreak, the use of the gamma Interferon test in problem herds as an adjunct to the tuberculin test and the depopulation of infected herds where the level or duration of infection indicates that this is necessary to clear the herd and/or protect the neighbourhood.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department also provides advice to farmers in relation to bio-security against TB infection such as maintaining satisfactory stock-proof boundary fencing, avoiding contact with other herds, exercising care in buying-cattle and ensuring that only recently tested animals are allowed move onto the farm. The ERAD compensation schemes are designed to encourage good bio-security practices and breaches of the various animal disease, welfare and identification regulations are prosecuted.</P>
    <P>The present eradication programme is scientifically based and is kept under constant review, as evidenced by the changes that have occurred in recent times. Such recent changes include a more focused contiguous herd testing policy and greater use of the ancillary gamma interferon blood test in target herds. On the technology side, new and enhanced computer systems have been developed including an individual bovine animal unique identification and passport system, a computerised movement monitoring system for bovine animals (CMMS) and an animal health computer system (AHCS).</P>
    <P>In addition, in view of the recognition that the incidence of the disease in wildlife is a major impediment to eradication of the disease, the current eradication scheme contains a significant wildlife strategy aimed at removing badgers in adjacent areas where they are implicated in tuberculosis breakdowns and which is implemented under licence from and in co-operation with the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>These measures have improved the effectiveness of the programme as evidenced by a significant reduction in the incidence of the disease from 4.2 reactors per thousand in 1998 to 2.9 in 2005. The 2005 TB eradication programme was completed with 97% of the 123,322 cattle herds tested within the twelve-month period. A total of approximately 6.5 million animals were subject to at least one test within twelve months and approximately 9 million animal tests were carried out.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to monitor and review the effectiveness and efficiency of the programme on an on-going basis with a view to the eventual eradication of the disease. In this <Col N="1784"/>context, in the short-term, notwithstanding the fact that the existing wildlife strategy has contributed to a reduction in the incidence of bovine TB, it is accepted that the development of a vaccine for badgers is a prerequisite if eradication of tuberculosis from the cattle population is to be achieved. My Department plans to commence a large-scale field trial of BCG in badgers in the near future to test the efficacy of a vaccine. However, any vaccine will not be available in the immediate future and the existing strategy will remain in place for some time. In the meantime, the existing programme, updated as appropriate in light of developments, will remain in place.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The minimum value rules referred to by the Deputy, which are implemented in the UK are supplementary to European rules, which govern the trade in horses between Member States and prescribe the health conditions and certification to be applied to such animals. My Department implements EU laws regarding the trade of horses between Member States and I have no plans, at present, of going beyond these.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated previously, Ireland does not specifically certify horses for slaughter as health certificates do not distinguish this as a purpose of export. All export health certificates issued by the Department are in respect of animals for breeding, racing, show jumping etc. It should however be noted that trade in horses for slaughter is covered by relevant EU regulations and is, subject to compliance with animal health and welfare legislation, a legitimate trade.</P>
    <P>Ireland is also party to a tri-lateral agreement with the UK and France under which trade in all horses with the UK and in registered horses to France takes place without health certification, on the basis of equivalent health status in the equine sectors in these countries. Statistics are not normally kept in relation to these movements. Such horses must, however, be individually identified by a passport or a current signed marking sheet.</P>
    <P>Details in relation to exports of horses for which statistics are kept are as follows:</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>On Friday 14th April 2006, a consignment of hobby birds was imported through Rosslare Port to a registered importer. The consignment in question originated in another Member State (the Netherlands) and, accordingly, is subject to intra-community trade rules, which does not include a quarantine requirement.</P>
    <P>Consignments of this nature must comply with the requirements of a General Authorisation issued under the European Communities (Diseases of Animals Acts, 1966 and 1979 Orders) (General Authorisations for Imports) Regulations 1985, the conditions attaching to which require that the hobby birds must: come from a holding which has been registered for export by the competent authority of the country of origin in accordance with Article 4 of Council Directive 92/65/EEC; come from a holding in which Avian Influenza has not been diagnosed in the 30 days preceding the dispatch; come from a holding and an area not subject to restrictions under Council Directive 92/66/EEC introducing Community measures for the control of Newcastle Disease; be accompanied by a declaration to this effect completed and signed by the owner of the hobby birds on the day of movement; in the case of psittacidae, be accompanied by a certificate signed by an official veterinarian of the country of export.</P>
    <P>In addition to these requirements, all but one of which were met, advance notice is required to be given to my Department not less than 24 hours prior to the intended date of importation and for animal disease control measures, an official notification of the consignment (TRACES) is dispatched from the District Veterinary Office of the country of origin to the District Veterinary Office of the country of destination.</P>
    <P>In this particular case, the consignment was not accompanied by the owner declaration and my Department was not given the advance notice of the importation by the importer, though the TRACES (animal movement) message was despatched by the competent authority of the exporting country on 13th April. It is the case that the absence of the owner&rsquo;s declaration and the failure to provide advance notice of the importation represented a breach of the requirements, a <Col N="1789"/>fact since acknowledged by the importer who has undertaken to provide such notice in respect of all future importations.</P>
    <P>Limited anonymous information about the importation was received by my Department on Thursday 13th April and this information was passed to my Department&rsquo;s Office at Rosslare. Similar anonymous information was received by the Customs &amp; Excise Service and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. In all three cases, the information provided was insufficient to identify the consignment on importation and, contrary to subsequent newspaper reports, my Department&rsquo;s officials did not have &rsquo;detailed knowledge&rsquo; of the importation.</P>
    <P>Veterinary officials of my Department met the importer at his premises, on 24 April 2006. All of the documentation provided by the importer associated with this particular consignment was in order. The official documentation, including the Health Certificate (signed by an official veterinarian in the Member State of origin) and the details provided in the official TRACES notification issued by the competent authority in the exporting Member State, received separately by my Department, was consistent with the birds present on the importer&rsquo;s premises who were all in good health with no animal welfare or animal disease issues arising.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence to support suggestions that some birds in the consignment had died in transit or that any bird carcases were subsequently illegally disposed of. The importer has been the subject of previous inspections by my Department, as are other registered importers, and on all previous occasions his importations have been found to be legal and all importation requirements to have been complied with.</P>
    <P>It must be noted that the Department of Agriculture is precluded by EU rules from inspecting all import consignments; rather a spot-check regime is in place based on risk assessment for disease purposes. The official quarantine of birds is only relevant for those birds originating in Third Countries and there is currently an EU ban in place on such imports. The Department does, though, have access to an approved quarantine facility in Co. Mayo, should one be required.</P>
    <P>As these hobby birds were bred in captivity in an EU Member State and were certified as originating from a registered export premises in that country and being free from Newcastle Disease and Avian Influenza, the question of testing for contagious diseases does not arise.</P>
    <P>In the context of avian influenza, my Department has introduced a robust range of precautionary measures and fully implements all EU controls, including those relating to the importation of exotic birds. It should be noted that imports of pet birds from within the EU represent a low risk to Ireland&rsquo;s health status; the avian &rsquo;flu virus being more prevalent in wild birds whose entry cannot be controlled or certified.</P><Col N="1790"/>
    <P>On the basis of the enquiries made by officials of my Department, I do not intend to take any further action in relation to the importation of this particular consignment. Specifically, the issues of recovering and quarantining the birds in question do not arise and, given the involvement of competent authorities in authenticating accompanying documentation, including health certificates and TRACES messages, and the checks in place, I am satisfied that appropriate procedures are in place to substantiate the authenticity of any relevant documentation.</P>

	<P>The general food labelling legislation comes within the remit of the Department of Health &amp; Children. My Department has responsibility for specific labelling regulations such as the labelling of beef. It is governed by comprehensive EU regulations that were introduced in 2000 and is underpinned by a full national cattle identification and traceability system. However, these labelling requirements only apply as far as retail level. Primary legislation to allow for the extension of these regulations to the catering sector was enacted by the Oireachtas in March 2006 by way of an amendment to the Health Act 1947. Following consultation with the FSAI, my Department has submitted the necessary draft Beef Regulations to the Department of Health and Children. It is expected that the Regulations will be in place this summer.</P>
    <P>The amended Heath Act 1947 will also facilitate the extension of country of origin labelling to all meats including poultrymeat. The EU Commission, however, is opposed to Member States introducing legislation on compulsory labelling that is over and above the common EU requirement. There would also be serious challenges in the implementation and enforcement of national legislation in the absence of harmonised EU provisions due to such factors as the amount of processing and repackaging operations that poultry in particular may be subjected to before arrival in this country. Therefore, the preferable way forward is that the EU Commission would progress the question of origin labelling of poultry. I have raised this issue with Commissioner Kyprianou and am taking every opportunity to press for progress on the matter. I will also raise this matter in the context of the current EU review of food labelling.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that if no action is taken at EU level, I will put forward proposals for the extension of country of origin labelling on all meats at retail and catering levels here and to submit such proposals for EU approval.</P>

	<P>I welcome the publication last week of the Annual Report 2005 of the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) which is the State Agency responsible for the promotion and enforcement of workplace health and safety in Ireland. Agriculture and forestry is one of a number of key sectors dealt with in the Report.</P>
    <P>I particularly support the Strategic Alliance referred to in the Report between the HSA and Teagasc which aims to develop initiatives in support of farm safety including the development of the first Code of Practice for enterprises of three or less employees in farming and piloting of the code by means of short training courses and on farm evaluations. I was involved in the launch of this Strategic Alliance and, while the evaluation of the initiative is still ongoing, initial results show that:</P>
 <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p10- ?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>1400 farmers attended the courses in farm safety</P>
 <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p10- ?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>98% of the farmers that attended the course agreed that it was worthwhile and that the course should be made available to all farmers</P>
<P el="5"><?oasys _is0p10- ?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>97% stated that the course would help them implement health and safety on their farms.</P>
    <P el="5" FLI="0">On farm evaluations are now taking place to assess the health and safety measures that farmers have adopted as a result of attending the <Col N="1793"/>course. I look forward to the outcome of these evaluations as a further contribution to farm safety.</P>

     <Quest>her views on whether a premium of &euro;100 per hectare is necessary to encourage farmers to produce oilseed rape following a statement by one farmer that he would require 700 acres to grow enough of the crop to earn a wage that would be equivalent to that of a livestock farmer, who in 2005 was reported to have needed 440 cattle on 300 acres of land to earn an average industrial wage.</Quest>

	<P>The production and utilisation of agricultural products for energy purposes can only be sustained in the longer term if biofuels generate a more favourable return than traditional market outlets. I am confident that the extension in the last Budget of excise relief of &euro;205m which, when fully operational, will support the use and production of 163 million litres of biofuels annually, will help drive additional demand for the production of energy crops. The importance of biofuels and bioenergy is recognised in the AGRI Vision 2015 ACTION Plan and I will continue to work closely with my colleague the Minister for Communications Marine and Natural Resources to ensure that agriculture contributes to the development of biofuels as part of a coherent energy policy.</P>
    <P>Support to farmers for the growing of energy crops may only be granted in accordance with EU regulations. Currently, such support is provided by way of the Energy Crops Scheme which was introduced under the reform of the CAP and which is administered by my Department. Under this scheme, energy crops may qualify for aid of &euro;45 per hectare provided they are intended primarily for use in the production of biofuels and electric and thermal energy produced from biomass. In 2005, a total of 136 farmers participated in the scheme and, apart from a small area of short rotation coppice, the only crop grown was oilseed rape. In addition to this scheme, set aside land can be used for a variety of non-food uses including the growing of crops for energy purpose and will therefore qualify to activate set-aside entitlements under the Single Payment Scheme. The total area sown to oilseed rape in 2005 was 3,800 hectares and this is expected to increase substantially in 2006 due in part to the demand for the crop resulting from the excise duty relief introduced in 2005. I accept that the aid of &euro;45 per hectare currently available under the Energy Crops Scheme has not proven to be sufficiently attractive in itself to stimulate the growing of such crops. For this reason at the February Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting I called for a review of the premium and I <Col N="1794"/>am pleased to say that the EU Commission has undertaken to review the operation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that Teagasc, the State provider of research, advisory and training services to the farming community, is in a position to advise on the economics of cultivating energy crops. To complement the research work being done by Teagasc and others, my Department is now providing direct funding, on a competitive basis, to support priority research projects in relation to biofuels. This funding is channelled through the Department&rsquo;s Research Stimulus Fund Programme. Three of the projects selected under the 2005 call for proposals directly relate to biofuels and energy crops and received total grant assistance of some &euro;0.9m. The funding available under the Programme has now been substantially increased and a further call for projects was issued earlier this year.</P>

	<P>The cost of fuel and energy, driven by rising international prices, is an issue for all parts of the economy including the agricultural sector. The most recent data from the CSO Wholesale Price Index shows that the price of energy products rose by 10.9% in the twelve months to March <Col N="1795"/>2006 with electricity rising by 7.1%, auto diesel by 11.4% and gas oil by 18.9%.</P>
    <P>According to the Output, Input and Income Tables for agriculture, compiled by the CSO, energy and lubricants accounted for 7.8% of intermediate consumption for the sector in 2005. In addition energy costs may affect the price of other inputs such as fertilizer and contractor services. However, while significant, energy price increases are not the dominant factor in determining competitiveness in the sector. Rising energy input costs, and fluctuations in international prices, underline the importance of ensuring that all inputs are used efficiently.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993 are administered by the Health Service Executive. There are currently three rates of subvention payable, i.e. &euro;114.30, &euro;152.40 and &euro;190.50 for the three levels of dependency which are medium, high and maximum. There are no plans to increase the subvention rates at present.</P>
    <P>The HSE has discretion to pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual&rsquo;s level of dependency in a case, for example, where personal funds are exhausted. The application of these provisions in an individual case is a matter for the HSE in the context of <Col N="1796"/>meeting increasing demands for subvention, subject to the provisions of the Health Act, 2004. The average rate of subvention paid by the HSE generally exceeds the current approved basic rates. The supports paid by the HSE vary from person to person and region to region, depending on prices for example.</P>
    <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that additional funding of &euro;20 million was provided for the administration of the Nursing Home Subvention Scheme in 2006, bringing the total available budget to &euro;161 million. The &euro;20 million is to support more basic nursing home subventions and reduce waiting lists for enhanced subventions: it is also to bring more consistency to subventions support throughout the country.</P>
    <P>This Government is committed to developing the various community and home support schemes with a view to enabling older people to remain living in their own homes and communities for as long as possible, in line with their expressed wishes. Additional funding for services for older people amounting to &euro;150 million was allocated in the 2006 Budget. This is the largest ever increase in funding for services for older people and, reflecting the new emphasis on home and day care, almost three quarters of this funding is being committed to community care supports including, among other things, Home Care Packages, the Home Help Service, Sheltered Housing and Day/Respite Care.</P>
    <P>Home care packages have been piloted successfully in several regions in recent years, with over 1,100 provided to people at the end of 2005. In Budget 2006, a further &euro;55m (full year cost) was allocated for this area, &euro;30m for 2006 and &euro;25m for 2007. This will allow for the phased introduction of a further 2,000 packages by the end of this year. Home Care Packages are delivered through the HSE, by a range of providers including the Health Service Executive itself, voluntary groups and the private sector. Home Care packages are multidisciplinary and may include services such as nurses, home care attendants, home helps and the various therapists including physiotherapists and occupational therapists. Home Care Packages will be targeted at those people who have maximised their usage of existing core community services and those who might otherwise require long-term residential care.</P>
    <P>An additional &euro;33 million full year cost was also allocated for the Home Help service, &euro;30 million of which will be for 2006 and will provide 1.75 million additional home help hours.</P>

The application of these provisions in an individual case is a matter for the HSE in the context of meeting increasing demands for subvention, subject to the provisions of the Health Act, 2004. The average rate of subvention paid by the HSE generally exceeds the current approved basic rates. The supports paid by the HSE vary from person to person and region to region, depending on prices for example.</P>
    <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that additional funding of &euro;20 million was provided for the administration of the Nursing Home Subvention Scheme in 2006, bringing the total available budget to &euro;161 million. The &euro;20 million is to support more basic nursing home subventions and reduce waiting lists for enhanced subventions: it is also to bring more consistency to the subvention scheme throughout the country.</P>

     <Quest>the progress she has made to address the demands of a group (details supplied) and the people of Donegal for the retention of breast cancer services in Letterkenny General Hospital, the introduction of BreastCheck, the provision of 70 extra beds at Letterkenny General Hospital, the establishment of a satellite radiotherapy unit in Letterkenny General Hospital and designated funding to assist patients and their families having to travel for treatment.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>My objective and that of the HSE is to ensure quality assured, equitable and sustainable oncology services for patients in the North West. Since 1997, cumulative funding totalling more than &euro;47 million has been allocated to the Health Service Executive North Western Area for the development of appropriate treatment and care services for people with cancer. An 11 bed oncology ward was recently completed at Letterkenny General Hospital (LGH) and this is supported by an oncology daycase area, breast care suite and a clean air pharmaceutical preparation room. I recently approved the HSE Capital Plan for 2006, which includes provision for additional beds for LGH.</P>
    <P>In relation to breast disease services, the Health Service Executive is currently examining as a matter of priority a model of breast care involving LGH and Altnagelvin Hospital to determine if it meets the quality standards required in best breast care. The HSE is scheduled to meet representatives of both hospitals in early June.</P>
    <P>Patients in the North West are currently being referred for radiation oncology treatment to the Radiation Oncology Department at University College Hospital, Galway and also to St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin. A Consultant Radiation Oncologist from St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital Dublin visits LGH three times per month as part of the multi-disciplinary care of cancer patients. The Government considers that in the short term, the best option in terms of improving geographic access for patients in the North West is to facilitate access for those patients to radiation oncology services as part of North/South co-operation on cancer.</P><Col N="1802"/>
    <P>I agreed with the former Minister for Health for Northern Ireland, Mr. Shaun Woodward, MP that the new Belfast Cancer Centre will treat patients from Donegal. Both Departments have now requested CAWT (Cooperation and Working Together) to ensure the timely and effective delivery of the Ministerial agreement. As regards progressing the consideration of a satellite in the North West, the first priority is to deliver access for cancer patients in the North West to Belfast City Hospital as early as possible and thereafter to build on positive working relationships to deliver on this commitment. The issue of a satellite centre in the North West will continue to be progressed as a joint initiative involving bilateral discussions at Departmental and political levels.</P>
    <P>As regards transport, the HSE NorthWest provides a full daily transport service from LGH to the major Dublin Hospitals. In association with the Friends of Letterkenny General Hospital (a local voluntary group), the HSE North West also provides a twice weekly transport service for patients accessing radiation oncology services in Dublin. The HSE also subsidises the cost of flights to Dublin for patients with cancer for whom this method of transport is a viable option. St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital Dublin arranges to transport patients to and from the airport. In all emergency cases and where there is clinical need, an ambulance service is provided. The HSE North West will make every effort to assist patients who require transport and patients who may require transport are encouraged to make direct contact with the Hospital to determine suitable arrangements. The HSE is also committed to supporting the accommodation needs of patients in the North West referred for radiation oncology.</P>
    <P>BreastCheck is preparing for the expansion of its screening programme for women aged 50 to 64 years to the South and West of the country. Capital funding in the region of &euro;21m has been made available to provide static screening units and five mobile units. My Department made additional revenue funding of &euro;2.3m available to BreastCheck this year and approval has been given for an additional 69 posts to facilitate roll-out. BreastCheck recently interviewed for Clinical Directors for both regions and has commenced the recruitment process for other essential staff. BreastCheck is in the process of shortlisting applicants to construct the new clinical units at the South Infirmary/Victoria Hospital, Cork and University College Hospital Galway. BreastCheck is confident that the target date of next year for the commencement of roll out to the Southern and Western regions will be met.</P>
    <P>The developments outlined in relation to radiation oncology services, symptomatic breast disease services and the expansion of the BreastCheck programme will greatly enhance the diagnostic and treatment facilities available to cancer patients in the North West. They are a clear indication of the considerable progress that <Col N="1803"/>has been made in addressing the burden of cancer and reflect the priority given to cancer care in the North West region by this Government.</P>

	<P>Under the Health (Amendment) Act 1991 all persons ordinarily resident in the State are eligible for public hospital services. Medical card holders receive the services free of charge, while non-medical card holders pay a modest charge. A medical card holder using public in-patient services should not be charged unless the person has explicitly opted to be treated as a private patient or is due compensation as a result of a road traffic accident. Any person can opt to be a private patient, and is then liable for the appropriate charge for private or semi-private treatment.</P>
    <P>The particular case raised by the Deputy relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.

	<P>The Office of the Minister for Children was established in accordance with the Government decision of 7th December, 2005 to place the interests of children at the heart of Government and to build on the successes already achieved in the context of the National Children&rsquo;s Strategy. The Office is an integral part of the Department of Health &amp; Children and comprises the following: The Childcare Directorate (transferred from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform), which has responsibility for the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme &mdash; EOCP and the new National Childcare Investment Programme. The Childcare Directorate is currently based at Old Faculty Building, Shelbourne House, Shelbourne Road, Dublin 4. It has an agreed complement of 21.8 Whole Time Equivalent (WTE) civil servants.</P>
    <P>The Child Welfare and Protection Policy Unit, which has responsibility for policy and legislative work on Child Welfare and Protection. This Unit is currently based in the Department of Health and Children at Hawkins House, Hawkins Street, <Col N="1805"/>Dublin 2. It has an agreed complement of 17.1 WTE civil servants.</P>
    <P>The National Children&rsquo;s Strategy Unit, which has responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the National Children&rsquo;s Strategy. This Unit is currently based at St. Martin&rsquo;s House, Waterloo Road, Dublin 4. It has an agreed complement of 16.8 WTE civil servants. This figure includes three staff on secondment from the Departments of Education &amp; Science, Justice, Equality &amp; Law Reform and Social &amp; Family Affairs.</P>
    <P>My private office is currently based at the Department of Health &amp; Children at Hawkins House, Hawkins Street, Dublin 2. They have an agreed complement of 7.8 WTE civil servants. A Private Secretary, based in the Department of Education &amp; Science, has also been assigned to me.</P>
    <P>The new Youth Justice Service of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Early Years Education Policy Unit of the Department of Education and Science will be co-located at the new office. The Youth Justice Service is based at Montague Court, 7-11 Montague St., Dublin 2 at present and currently has 7 civil servants working there. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Finance have still to agree the WTE complement of civil servants which will co-locate to my Office. The Youth Justice Service will continue to be funded through the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform&rsquo;s vote.</P>
    <P>The Early Years Education Policy Unit is based at the Department of Education and Science, Marlborough St., Dublin 1 at present. 1 civil servant has currently been appointed to the Unit. The WTE complement of civil servants which will co-locate to my Office is still under consideration. The Unit will continue to be funded through the Department of Education and Science&rsquo;s vote.</P>
    <P>Co-located staff from the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science will remain staff of their parent Department and will continue to have a reporting relationship through that Department and its senior Minister, in addition to its relationship to me and the Director General of the Office of the Minister for Children.</P>
    <P>With regard to a more permanent location for my Office, agreement has recently been reached with the Office of Public Works regarding permanent accommodation arrangements. The Office will be located in Bishop&rsquo;s Square, Redmond&rsquo;s Hill, Dublin 2, following decentralisation of a division of the Department of Foreign Affairs that is currently located there. This is scheduled to take place by mid-2007 and it is proposed that my Office would move to Bishop&rsquo;s Square very shortly thereafter. Discussions are ongoing with the Office of Public Works with a view to making <Col N="1806"/>more appropriate accommodation arrangements in the intervening period.</P>

    <P FLI="0">It should be noted that there are numerous factors that would have an impact on the price and VAT yield from fuel. Fuel prices are driven by a number of factors including the price of oil <Col N="1808"/>on international markets, exchange rates, production costs and refining costs. The rise in oil prices over recent periods reflected additional factors such as geopolitical uncertainty, supply <Col N="1809"/>disruptions and strong economic growth in countries such as China. Furthermore, the increase in the VAT yield from fuel is more by-product of the unprecedented level of economic activity that has taken place over the lifetime of this Government.</P>
    <P>In relation to the rates of VAT applicable to fuel, the position is that the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. In this regard, it would not be possible to place a cap on the amount of VAT raised from fuel.</P>
    <P>Petrol and auto diesel are subject to the standard VAT rate which in Ireland was 21% up to 31 December 2000. The standard VAT rate was reduced to 20% on 1 January 2001 and increased to 21% on 1 March 2002. It would not be possible to reduce the VAT rate applicable to motor fuel without reducing the rate for all goods and services subject to the standard VAT rate. A decrease of 1 per cent in the standard VAT rate would cost the Exchequer &euro;390 million per annum.</P>
    <P>Ireland applies the reduced VAT rate to all of other items listed in the table, as they are used to create heat or light. Under Article 28 (2)(e) of the Sixth VAT Directive the supply of electricity and gas is subject to the reduced VAT rate. This Article allows Member States, which at 1 January 1991 applied a reduced rate to supplies of goods and services other than those specified in Annex H of the Sixth VAT Directive, to apply a reduced rate provided for in Article 12(3) to such supplies. The reduced VAT rate in Ireland which was 12.5% up to 31 December 2002 was increased to 13.5% with effect from 1 January 2003. Under EU law Member States can continue to apply reduced rates in such cases provided the rate is not below 12%. Such a reduction in the reduced VAT rate, while having a significant Exchequer cost, would be likely to have little or no impact on the retail price of such products.</P>

     <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
     <Quest>if, in the context of a global economy with different stages of production occurring in various countries, it would not be appropriate to reform the Rules of Origin which will apply under the Economic Partnership Agreements in a manner which will facilitate full cumulation of goods from any of the 77 countries entering EPAs with the EU; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Cotonou Agreement forms the framework for the trading relationship between the ACP states and the EU. <Col N="1812"/>Under this Agreement, cumulation relates to the use by producers in an exporting country of inputs from another country, without in effect losing their preferential market access for the final product. Cumulation provisions are, therefore, important in that they can significantly improve the sourcing opportunities for producers. The rules of origin provision of the Cotonou Agreement provides for full cumulation among the ACP countries. However, it is clearly important that this be effective in practice.</P>
    <P>In this regard, article 37.7 of the Cotonou Agreement envisages that Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) to be negotiated under the Cotonou Framework would &ldquo;aim [...] at improving current market access for the ACP countries through, <i>inter alia</i>, a review of the rules of origin. Negotiations shall take account of the level of development and the socioeconomic impact of trade measures on ACP countries and their capacity to adapt and adjust their economies to the liberalisation process.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In furtherance of this objective, and in the context of the ongoing WTO Doha Development Agenda negotiations, the Commission adopted a Green Paper on rules of origin in 2003. This document provided an overall assessment of the current issues relating to problems of Origin in preferential agreements, and an overview of options available for their improvement. In the Green Paper, and in a further Communication of March 2005, the Commission indicated a commitment to simplifying the rules of origin in the context of these Economic Partnership Agreements, as well as an openness to rules of origin that provide more favourable conditions for ACP countries than for the EU (so called asymmetric rules of origin).</P>
    <P>The above principles form a sound basis for the negotiations on the Economic Partnership Agreements. Crucially, they respect the different levels of development of ACP countries. I would hope that the ACP states themselves will, as the negotiations evolve, be able to achieve a coordinated position on the criteria for rules of origin that would enhance cumulation across ACP countries and thus improve their access to EU markets. Ireland will continue to urge the Commission to ensure that the EPA negotiations result in agreements that are supportive of ACP countries&rsquo; development needs and their poverty reduction efforts.</P>

Ireland is also represented by an Honorary Consul in Bangkok who provides consular assistance, when required, to Irish citizens in Thailand. The opening of further resident missions abroad, including in Thailand, is considered by the Government on an ongoing basis. As I believe the Deputy will appreciate, any expansion of our diplomatic network can only be undertaken on the basis of clear priorities.

	<P>The opening of further resident missions abroad, including the reopening of an Embassy in Kenya, is considered by the Government on an ongoing basis. Following a recent Government decision, the approval of the Kenyan authorities has been sought for the accreditation of the resident Irish Ambassador in South Africa to also be Ambassador to Kenya on a non-resident basis. It might also be noted that Ireland is represented by an Honorary Consul in Nairobi.</P>

    <P FLI="0">One of the requirements of sports capital funding is that, for accumulated grants of more than &euro;120,000 a Deed of Covenant and Charge be invoked. This Deed provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for a repayment of the grant in the event of the grant-aided property not continuing to be used for the purpose for which the grant was allocated. The required Deeds are in place in respect of the grants awarded to this club.</P>
    <P>The Genesis Report pointed out that the ultimate target for the Eircom League would be to have a strong, superior product with attractive facilities leading to increased support, higher levels of sponsorship and an improvement in income for the league and its clubs. In terms of facilities specifically, the report highlighted the need for Dublin clubs to consider ground sharing. In that context FAI Ireland is engaged in ongoing discussions with the main Dublin clubs to identify the options and the main issues for the clubs concerned.</P>
    <P>While I support the recommendations of the Genesis Report, ultimately any decision regarding Bohemians FC moving from Dalymount is a matter for the club and its members to decide.</P>

	<P>Recipients of Social Welfare or Health Service Executive payments who have been prescribed a special diet as a result of a specified medical condition, and whose means are insufficient to meet their needs, may qualify for a diet supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. This scheme and related supplements are administered on my behalf by the Community Welfare division of the Health Service Executive (HSE), and neither I nor my Department has any function in relation to individual claim decisions.</P>
    <P>The amount of supplement payable depends on which category of diet has been prescribed by the applicant&rsquo;s medical adviser, as well as the income of the individual and his/her dependants.</P>
    <P>The Dublin/Mid-Leinster Area of the HSE has advised that the person concerned had been prescribed a diabetic diet, and applied to the Executive for a diet supplement in July 2002. In accordance with the regulations governing the scheme at that time, the amount of diet supplement payable in this case was EUR 30.20 per month.</P>
    <P>The amount of diet supplement in individual cases is calculated generally by assessing one third of weekly income against the cost of the relevant diet. Following a review of the scheme, the advice now available is that people with diabetes need a healthy eating diet. The review showed that the cost of a healthy eating diet can be met from one third of a basic social welfare payment.</P>
    <P>As a result of a change in his personal circumstances, which led to a significant increase in his income, the diet supplement of the person concerned was reviewed. Based on his means, the person concerned is not now entitled to a diet supplement.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The back to education allowance or BTEA is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force.</P><Col N="1823"/>
    <P>At present, to qualify for participation in the BTEA scheme an applicant must be, prior to commencing an approved course of study, at least 21 years of age (18 for people with disabilities). Lone parents and unemployed persons may access the scheme at 18 years if they are out of formal education for 2 years or more. An applicant must also be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for at least six months, in the case of people wishing to complete a second level course, or twelve months in the case of people wishing to pursue third level qualifications.</P>
    <P>The twelve month requirement is reduced to nine in the case of people who wish to attend a third level course and who are participating in the National Employment Action Plan.</P>
    <P>The scheme was established to assist people who have been out of the workforce for some time and whose opportunities of obtaining employment would be enhanced by participation in the scheme. The requirement to be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a minimum period has always been a feature of the BTEA scheme and is considered necessary to ensure that limited resources are directed at those most in need. People already in employment are not considered to be in the target group for the scheme.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that, overall, the current arrangements ensure that the scheme continues to support those people who are more distant from the labour market. I have no plans, at present to abolish or modify the existing qualifying criteria to include people who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment.</P>

	<P>Under the Government decentralisation programme announced in Budget 2004, the Department is to relocate 220 posts to Carrick-on-Shannon. The Decentralisation Implementation Group (DIG) report to the Minister for Finance on 19 November 2004 recommended those locations and organisations to be included in the first phase of moves, and those to be regarded as potential early movers. In the case of this Department, Sligo and Drogheda were included in the first phase and Carrick-on-Shannon was recommended as a location to be considered as an early mover.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works commenced the process of identifying suitable accommodation in the town and it was decided to pursue a two phased approach to decentralisation to Carrick-on-Shannon.</P>
    <P>Phase one will involve some 130 posts and a building is scheduled to be ready for occupation in early 2007. The Department expects to be ready to commence the relocation of staff to Carrick-on-Shannon at this time.</P>

	<P>My Department reviews on a continuing basis the organisational arrangements for the delivery of its services, to meet the changing demands of customers, to avail of the benefits of new technology and to accommodate changes such as decentralisation.

    <P>In this context it has recently been decided to realign the regional boundaries which will also involve a reduction in the overall number of regions. My Department has decided to subsume the Midlands region into a number of contiguous regions as the initial phase of a process of re-organising the regional structure.</P><Col N="1825"/>

Arrangements are being put in place currently to ensure that the new management structures are quickly put in place.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>In order to qualify for the maximum rate of the old age (contributory) pension a person must, amongst other qualifying conditions, achieve a yearly average of at least 48 contributions paid or credited on their social insurance record. Reduced pensions are paid to those with yearly averages as low as 10 contributions and arrangements are also in place for the payment of pro-rata pensions to those with mixed rate insurance records or contributions from different countries.</P>
    <P>Reduced rate or pro-rata pensions are paid at a fixed percentage of the full rate payment and, in order to ensure that the differential between the various rates is maintained, budget increases are also applied on a pro-rata basis. Applying the full budgetary increase to those with reduced payments would erode the differentials which exist and which are intended to reflect the level of contribution which a person has made to the social insurance fund. The cost of applying the full budgetary increase to all contributory pensioners aged 66 and over is estimated at &euro;34.5 million in a full year.</P>

	<P>The use of bus lanes is provided for in the Road Traffic (Traffic &amp; Parking) Regulations 1997 and 1998. The primary purpose of bus lanes is to facilitate and promote bus based public transport. Having regard to the role of taxis in providing an on-street immediate hire service, an exemption to the restriction relating to the use of with-flow bus lanes is allowed in respect of taxis when they are being used in the course of business. I have no plans to extend the use of bus lanes to hackneys.</P>

	<P>The award of the car testing contract to National Car Testing Service Limited (NCTS) was made on foot of a public tender competition run in accordance with EU public procurement rules set down in Directive 92/50/EEC. Under the contract, NCTS is required to meet a range of performance standards for the service. My Department monitors the performance of NCTS to ensure that it delivers the service to the required standard. To assist the Department in that function a Supervision Services Contractor (a consortium involving PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Automobile Association with engineering, financial, legal, IT and operational expertise) has been engaged and is working to an agreed programme for the Department. The programme provides,<i> inter alia,</i> for regular reviews of the performance of vehicle testers and the carrying out of spot checks, without any advance warning, on a representative sample of cars that have just undergone the NCT. The programme ensures that the car testing service is comprehensively monitored and supervised. I am satisfied that the Company is meeting the performance standards set for the service in the contract. Subject to continuing satisfactory <Col N="1828"/>performance of the car testing service, the contract with NCTS will continue for the contracted duration, until 31 December 2009.</P>
    <P>The question of the car testing arrangements post-2009 will be a matter for Government to decide in due course. The views of the Competition Authority will be considered carefully in the preparation of proposals for Government on the succession arrangements to apply after December 2009.</P>

	<P>&ldquo;Substantial transformation&rdquo; is a procedure used in normal business operations to allow operators to declare goods as being manufactured in the country where considerable processing has taken place. I am very concerned that this practice might be used to mislead consumers as to the origin of the product. I have raised this issue directly with the Commission on a number of occasions and indeed have been in contact with the EU Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, Mr. Kyprianou again earlier this year about the matter. Subsequently the Commission decided to review EU labelling. In this context the Commission recently published a consultative document on &ldquo;Labelling: Competitiveness, Consumer Information and Better Regulation in the EU&rdquo; and invited Member States for submissions by mid June 2006. My Department is currently preparing a submission in which we will again raise this matter.</P>

	<P>Following receipt of the required EU approval, the revised Farm Waste Management Scheme was launched by my Department on 24 March 2006. Application forms, together with the accompanying terms and conditions, are available from the local Agricultural Environment and Structures (AES) offices of my Department and are also available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
    <P>The principal changes to the Scheme include (a) an increase in the standard grant-rate from 40% to 60%, with 70% being available in the four Zone C counties; (b) an extension of the Scheme for the first time to sectors such as horses, deer, goats, pigs and poultry, and mushroom compost; (c) the removal of any minimum income requirements from farming from the Scheme so that all small farmers can participate in the Scheme; and (d) an increase in the maximum eligible investment from &euro;75,000 to &euro;120,000 per holding.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the new Scheme, a substantial information programme has been implemented by officials of my Department in order to ensure that farmers and agricultural planners are fully aware of the benefits of the new Scheme. As the Scheme closes for applications at the end of 2006, I have also arranged that applications will be accepted by my Department as soon as any required planning permission has been applied for to the relevant local authority. I am glad to be able to confirm that these amendments to the Scheme have resulted in a massive increase in uptake by farmers under the Scheme, with over 2,000 applications already having been received during the first seven weeks of the Scheme compared to just over 3,000 in the whole of the 2005 calendar year.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is already a long history of co-operation between the administrations North and South on animal health issues. The administrations have traditionally shared information at local and national levels on disease control and surveillance issues and have worked together to combat illegal movements of animals and animal products. The foot-and-mouth emergency of 2001 is a testament to the extent of co-operation and consultation that exists at official, Ministerial and political levels. Likewise, both administrations <Col N="1831"/>are co-operating on measures relating to avian influenza.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the North South Ministerial Council offered an opportunity to build on existing co-operation arrangements and provided a framework for the development of an all-island animal health policy. The main objectives of the Council are to foster co-operation and to devise a common, unified animal health strategy for the island as a whole. This involves the convergence of animal health policies and the development of joint strategies for dealing with animal diseases. The ultimate objectives are to establish a common import regime and equivalent internal arrangements with a view to achieving free movement of animals and animal products within the island.</P>
    <P>The programme of work mandated by the NSMC to agree a common animal health and welfare strategy for the island has been taken forward by nine working groups at official level. The remit of these groups includes TB and Brucellosis, TSEs (BSE and Scrapie), veterinary medicines, other Zoonoses and animal diseases, disease surveillance, animal welfare, import and export of live animals and animal products, animal identification, traceability and cross-border aspects of fraud.</P>
    <P>These working groups meet regularly and their work has focused on three main themes: common or equivalent controls at points of entry to the island; convergence of internal animal health policies; and development of joint strategies for the control of animal disease. The main achievements to date are the development of a co-ordinated and complementary approach towards import policies and portal controls at points of entry to the island, the convergence of policies in regard to animal identification and Scrapie and the strengthening of co-ordination and co-operation between both administrations on a variety of issues such as FMD, BSE and cross-border fraud. These groups continue to report progress in exchange of information and in implementation of initiatives aimed at policy convergence and the development of a common unified strategy for the island as a whole.</P>
    <P>It must also be recognised that the achievement of such an all-island animal health strategy involves complex dialogue and negotiation over a range of areas between the Irish, Northern Irish and British authorities. Ultimately, the agreement of the European Union will be required. In addition to the above, there has been a significant deepening and strengthening of co-operation, information exchange and ongoing co-ordination between the two administrations on a variety of issues such as FMD, BSE, Avian Influenza and cross-border fraud while the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council includes representation from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, (DARD). DARD was also represented at a recent meeting of the Avian Influ<Col N="1832"/>enza Advisory Group and will also be represented at future meetings of the Group which indicates the collaborative approach taken by Dublin and Belfast in relation to challenges ahead. On cross-border fraud, the two administrations have worked together successfully in a number of joint enforcement actions and ongoing exchanges of expertise and information are taking place.</P>
    <P>In relation to the EU decision to lift the BSE ban on exports from the United Kingdom from 3 May 2006, arrangements have been agreed and put in place between our two administrations to facilitate the trade of cattle from Northern Ireland for slaughter, breeding and production.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Casual Trading Act 1995 gives local authorities responsibility in matters of market rights. Section 7 of the Act provided for a 10 year time-frame within which market rights could be revived, even if these had not been used for some time. Some have been exercised recently.</P>
    <P>I do believe that farmers markets represent an important route to market and a real growth opportunity for farmers and small-scale food producers. Farmers Markets initiatives provide producers with direct access to consumers, assist the development of local and regional speciality foods, and present consumers with an alternative retail experience. There are also a variety of indirect benefits in terms of community spirit, increased employment and added value for tourism.</P>
    <P>An Bord Bia, which operates under the aegis of my Department, works closely with other State and local agencies to exploit the growing opportunities for markets. In co-operation with Invest Northern Ireland, they have published a comprehensive information guide on the operation of farmers markets. Bord Bia has a dedicated person in the Small Business Department to assist producers and individuals, and performs a vital support function through the provision of advice and mentoring assistance as well as creating awareness of their potential contribution to the local economy.</P>
    <P>Bord Bia established the very successful &ldquo;Food at Farmleigh&rdquo; programme which has tens of thou<Col N="1833"/>sands of visitors each year. This year, the programme will be extended on a one day seasonal basis to five regional Heritage sites in Cork, Wexford, Kildare, Donegal and Laois. This is one example of ways in which food and tourism can be merged at local level. I have been delighted to hear that the first seasonal market at Fota Island Cork, where Bord Bia worked closely with the Office of Public Works and local interests, has stimulated the holding of fortnightly markets in that location.</P>
    <P>There are over 100 such markets operating throughout the country at present, with numbers growing each week. I have been invited to officiate at the opening next Saturday, of a Food and Craft Market in Donegal town, which is run by community groups from both Donegal and Strabane and I wish them every success with this very worthwhile project. The diversity in structure of such markets, whether public, private sector or community based, is a measure of their responsiveness to local circumstances. No one template will suit all areas or all crossroads.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 167 to 169, inclusive, together.</P>
<?oasys _dc14- ?>
    <P>It is not my intention to include a review of Coillte in the present review of forestry legislation. Coillte Teoranta was established as a private company by virtue of the Forestry Act, 1988 and while it is expected to conduct its business in a cost effective and efficient manner, it is also obliged to have due regard to the environmental and amenity consequences of its operations.</P>
    <P>Coillte has a critical role to play in the further development of Irish forestry and I am determined to see it play that role to best advantage. Coillte has achieved a high standard of international certification for its forest-management, in accordance with strict social, environmental and economic criteria. This certification is awarded by the international NGO, the Forest Stewardship Council. I think it is also important to note that Coillte operates an open-forest policy, encouraging and facilitating the use of its forests by locals and visitors alike, providing car-parks, routeways, signage and other facilities.</P>
    <P>The Consultative Group on Forestry legislation has been set up to be as representative as possible of the very broad range of interests and organisations active in the sector. To that end, one representative each was sought from the industry, the local authorities, the forestry NGOs, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, research and development interests, and the IFA. The Group has almost finished its work and it is not proposed at this stage to add new members. However, written submissions were sought by public advertisement, with some 26 received, including a number from environmental NGOs. In addition, my Department <Col N="1835"/>has recently hosted a seminar, under independent chair, for those who had made written submissions to afford each an opportunity to present their case and to participate in wider debate on the changes required to forestry legislation. I believe that a very open and inclusive consultative process has been developed, which will greatly assist with the drafting of the new forestry Bill.</P>
<?oasys _dc0- ?>
    <P>As regards the minutes of the Group, it would not be usual to make such minutes available while discussions are actually continuing, and it was an explicit decision of the Group itself to proceed on that basis. It would be my intention, however, to make these minutes available in due course and in the normal manner. In the meantime, the Group publishes a bulletin after each of its meetings on a dedicated web-page hosted by my Department. These bulletins summarise the discussion, identifying the key points under debate, and the progress of agreement reached. These bulletins provide an accurate record of each meeting and one which is freely available to anybody interested in the legislative review.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is already a long history of co-operation between the administrations North and South on animal health issues. The administrations have traditionally shared information at local and national levels on disease control and surveillance issues and have worked together to <Col N="1842"/>combat illegal movements of animals and animal products. The foot-and-mouth emergency of 2001 is a testament to the extent of co-operation and consultation that exists at official, Ministerial and political levels. Likewise, both administrations are co-operating on measures relating to avian influenza.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the North South Ministerial Council offered an opportunity to build on existing co-operation arrangements and provided a framework for the development of an all-island animal health policy. The main objectives of the Council are to foster co-operation and to devise a common, unified animal health strategy for the island as a whole. This involves the convergence of animal health policies and the development of joint strategies for dealing with animal diseases. The ultimate objectives are to establish a common import regime and equivalent internal arrangements with a view to achieving free movement of animals and animal products within the island.</P>
    <P>The programme of work mandated by the NSMC to agree a common animal health and welfare strategy for the island has been taken forward by nine working groups at official level. The remit of these groups includes TB and Brucellosis, TSEs (BSE and Scrapie), veterinary medicines, other Zoonoses and animal diseases, disease surveillance, animal welfare, import and export of live animals and animal products, animal identification, traceability and cross-border aspects of fraud.</P>
    <P>These working groups meet regularly and their work has focused on three main themes:</P>
   <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p10- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Common or equivalent controls at points of entry to the island;</P>
  <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p10- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Convergence of internal animal health policies; and</P>
     <P el="5"><?oasys _is0p10- ?>&bull;<?oasys _is0p6- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Development of joint strategies for the control of animal disease.</P>
    <P el="5" FLI="0">The main achievements to date are the development of a co-ordinated and complementary approach towards import policies and portal controls at points of entry to the island, the convergence of policies in regard to animal identification and Scrapie and the strengthening of co-ordination and co-operation between both administrations on a variety of issues such as FMD, BSE and cross-border fraud. These groups continue to report progress in exchange of information and in implementation of initiatives aimed at policy convergence and the development of a common unified strategy for the island as a whole.</P>
    <P>It must also be recognised that the achievement of such an all-island animal health strategy involves complex dialogue and negotiation over a range of areas between the Irish, Northern Irish and British authorities. Ultimately, the agreement of the European Union will be required.</P><Col N="1843"/>
    <P>In addition to the above, there has been a significant deepening and strengthening of co-operation, information exchange and ongoing co-ordination between the two administrations on a variety of issues such as FMD, BSE, Avian Influenza and cross-border fraud while the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council includes representation from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, (DARD). DARD was also represented at a recent meeting of the Avian Influenza Advisory Group and will also be represented at future meetings of the Group which indicates the collaborative approach taken by Dublin and Belfast in relation to challenges ahead. On cross-border fraud, the two administrations have worked together successfully in a number of joint enforcement actions and ongoing exchanges of expertise and information are taking place.</P>
    <P>In relation to the EU decision to lift the BSE ban on exports from the United Kingdom from 3 May 2006, arrangements have been agreed and put in place between our two administrations to facilitate the trade of cattle from Northern Ireland for slaughter, breeding and production.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

     <Quest>the steps she is taking to protect dairy farmers' incomes; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[18977/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Dairy farmers' incomes are made up of the market price paid for milk and direct income support and are influenced by the level of scale and efficiency of individual farm enterprises. The price of milk paid to dairy farmers is a commercial matter between milk producers and milk purchasers and I have no direct role in this area. Milk prices are influenced by a number of factors both internal and external. These include the structure of our domestic dairy operations, the prices paid in international markets for dairy products, the type and final destination of product and the overall operation of the EU market support mechanisms.</P>
    <P>The Luxembourg Agreement in 2003 provided that the intervention price for milk products would reduce in the period 2004-2007 and these reductions would be compensated by the introduction of a direct payment. This compensation amounted to 1.2 cent per litre or &euro;60m in 2004, 2.4 cent per litre or &euro;120m in 2005 and 3.6 cent per litre equivalent to &euro;180 million in 2006. This payment, taken together with the market value of milk has resulted in a higher return for dairy farmers up to now.</P>
    <P>At EU level, I have consistently challenged the pace and level of reduction in support level implemented by the Commission. In my view it is crucially and strategically important that the EU <Col N="1844"/>consolidates its international market share while challenging competition on its domestic market. I have urged the Commission to maintain a competitive combination of aids and subsidies to achieve these objectives.</P>
    <P>At national level I strongly believe that if the dairy sector is to maintain a competitive position we must look at increasing the scale of operations, reducing costs where possible, and encouraging a profitable future in the sector based on market returns. The Luxembourg Agreement envisages the retention of milk quotas until March 2015, though a review will take place in 2008. While EU quotas impose an absolute limit on scale at producer level, they will remain in place for the foreseeable future and we need to plan the future within this framework. It is clear to me that progressive dairy farmers recognise that in order to maintain a viable income from their dairy enterprises they will have to increase efficiency and enlarge their holdings.</P>
    <P>Bearing these developments in mind, I recently announced changes to the Milk Quota system for 2007 and beyond. These changes are aimed at better meeting the future needs of the industry. I am currently consulting with the main stakeholders in order to agree a more market based system that will deliver the type of structure that will best contribute to more competitive milk production in Ireland.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
     <Quest>the steps she is taking to protect herds against botulism; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[18978/06]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Botulism is not a notifiable disease under the Diseases of Animals Acts. However, samples from animals may be submitted for testing to my Department&rsquo;s Central Veterinary Laboratory or Regional Veterinary Laboratories at the discretion of a Private Veterinary Practitioner or on request by a herdowner through a Private Veterinary Practitioner.</P>
    <P>Bovine Botulism can be contracted through contact with contaminated decomposing organic material such as poultry litter which contains poultry carcass material when spread on land grazed by cattle.</P>
    <P>The Animal By-Products Regulation (Regulation (EC) No. 1774/2002) allows poultry litter to be applied to land under certain conditions. Under this Regulation, the manager of a poultry unit is obliged to remove carcasses from poultry litter and to send these to an approved plant for rendering.</P>
    <P>In 2005, my Department wrote to dairy processors advising them about this issue and asked them to distribute to their producers an information/advisory note entitled &ldquo;Good Farming Practice with regard to Spreading Poultry Lit<Col N="1845"/>ter on Land&rdquo;. Poultry processors were also circulated with a similar information/advisory note. An &ldquo;Information Note on Botulism for Veterinary Practitioners&rdquo; and &ldquo;Instructions for Practitioners when dealing with Suspected cases of Botulism on Farm&rdquo; were also circulated to Private Veterinary Practitioners. Copies of an information/advisory note entitled &ldquo;Good Farming Practice with regard to Spreading Poultry Litter on Land&rdquo; are available to farmers from District Veterinary Offices. My Department will again issue publicity on this matter in the near future.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above, my Department&rsquo;s veterinary staff has held meetings with the industry to raise awareness on the issue. I believe that the poultry industry is well aware of the issues with regard to their obligations on the safe disposal of litter and carcass material in accordance with EU Regulation 1774/2002. Indeed, sections of the industry have been very proactive in dealing with this issue and have adopted good practice procedures.</P>
    <P>My Department will be undertaking random inspections on poultry producers&rsquo; premises to ensure that the necessary procedures are being followed. Where there is evidence that this is not the case, the Department can require that all poultry litter from those premises be sent for rendering.</P>
    <P>While humans may be affected by botulism, the specific toxins implicated in the conditions in humans are not those normally associated with the condition in cattle. It is also generally accepted that humans are resistant to the types of toxin that affect cattle. Furthermore, these toxin types are poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and the toxins themselves are inactivated by heat treatment. The risk to human health from the consumption of milk or meat from cattle on farms with cases of botulism therefore appears to be remote. However, as a precautionary measure, farmers are advised to wear gloves, to wash their hands thoroughly after handling poultry litter and to avoid unnecessary contact with the material.</P>

While deductions for modulation are required to be made from all Scheme beneficiaries, a refund is due to each farmer in respect of the deductions made from the first &euro;5,000 paid under the Single <Col N="1846"/>Payment Scheme.

	<P>Carcasses for disposal at each of my Department&rsquo;s five regional veterinary laboratories are deemed to be animal by-products and are governed by the provisions of Regulation (EC) 1774/2002. They are classed as Category 1 high risk material and are placed in on-site skips, which are covered at all times. The skips are clearly marked Category 1 for disposal only. The skips are transported to one of the four Department approved Category 1 Rendering Plants in the country and the movement of the carcasses is covered by means of a Commercial Document, which contains all relevant information relating to the contents of the skip, the consignor and consignee. The removal of the skips takes place at least once per week, and more often when the need demands, e.g. twice per week during the summer.</P>

	<P>Participants in the 1994 Scheme of Early Retirement from Farming may dispose of an area of pension land up to one hectare without the requirement that it be replaced.

   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Following receipt of the required EU approval, the revised Farm Waste Management Scheme was launched by my Department on 24 March 2006. Application forms, together with the accompanying terms and conditions, are available from the local Agricultural Environment and Structures (AES) offices of my Department and are also available on my Department&rsquo;s web-site.</P>
    <P>The principal changes to the Scheme include (a) an increase in the standard grant-rate from 40% to 60%, with 70% being available in the four Zone C counties; (b) an extension of the Scheme for the first time to sectors such as horses, deer, goats, pigs and poultry, and mushroom compost; (c) the removal of any minimum income requirements from farming from the Scheme so that all small farmers can participate in the Scheme; and (d) an increase in the maximum eligible investment from &euro;75,000 to &euro;120,000 per holding.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the new Scheme, a substantial information programme has been put in place by officials of my Department in order to ensure that farmers and agricultural planners are fully aware of the benefits of the new Scheme. As the Scheme closes for applications at the end of 2006, I have also arranged that applications will be accepted by my Department as soon as any required planning permission has been applied for to the relevant local authority.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to confirm that these amendments to the Scheme have resulted in a massive increase in uptake by farmers under the Scheme, with over 2,000 applications already having been received during the first seven weeks of the Scheme compared to just over 3,000 in the whole of the 2005 calendar year.</P>

The OPW evaluated a total of 14 proposed sites in Enniscorthy and submitted a shortlist of three to Bord Bia for consideration. Bord Bia has indicated its preference in this regard and I understand that OPW is now putting the necessary arrangements in place.</P>
    <P>24 Bord Bia staff members have indicated a willingness to relocate to Enniscorthy as part of the decentralisation programme. An additional 47 persons from outside Bord Bia have applied for positions in Enniscorthy through the Central Applications Facility.</P>

This application was examined in February 2005 and it was determined that the person in question did not meet the statutory residency requirements as set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended. A letter informing the individual concerned of this determination was issued on 10 February 2005.</P>
    <P><?oasys _ic14- ?>I understand that the person concerned was originally granted residency in the State on 12 August 1999 based on parentage of an Irish-born child and currently has permission to remain in the State until September 2007. However, I also understand that she did not have permission for the month of September 2005. The consequence of this is that she cannot now comply with the statutory requirement of having 1 year&rsquo;s continuous reckonable residence at the time of application until September 2006 at the earliest. Any application submitted in advance of September 2006 would have to be deemed ineligible.<?oasys _ic0- ?></P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware I have brought forward my legislative proposals to deal with anti-social behaviour by way of proposed Committee Stage amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill 2004. The Bill is currently before the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights.</P>
    <P>My proposals will empower a senior officer of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to apply to the District Court by way of civil procedure for an order which would prohibit a person from behaving in an anti-social manner. Similar to civil injunctions, breaches of which are punishable as a criminal contempt, a breach of such an order will be a criminal offence. This type of order is not an entirely new concept. Such an order is simply a mechanism whereby the law seeks to stop a person from behaving in a way which is causing significant distress to a community or to some person in that community. In this respect the principle behind this order is similar to the judicial power to bind over, which is a very old power indeed.</P>
    <P>Insofar as orders for children are concerned my colleague Mr. Brian Lenihan, T.D., Minister of State with special responsibility for Children has brought forward separate provisions in relation to children, also by way of proposed Committee Stage amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill 2004. These provisions have been brought forward as part of a package of measures concerning juvenile justice issues.</P>
    <P>The Deputy enquires as to the regulations that I would envisage for the implementation of these proposals. The proposals, as published, provide for a single regulatory making power (mirrored in both the adult and child provisions) in relation to matters pertaining to legal aid. It is proposed to provide that persons who are the subject of an application for an order in respect of anti-social behaviour may be granted free legal aid. The proposed regulations provide that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may make regulations for bringing the legal aid provisions into effect. The regulations may, in particular, prescribe the form of legal aid certificates to be used in anti-social behaviour cases, the rates or scales of payment, and the manner in which solicitors and counsel are to be assigned under those certificates.</P>
    <P>However, the Deputy may wish to note that I have brought forward an amendment to the commencement provision in the Bill so as to provide that those provisions dealing with anti-social behaviour may only be commenced after the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform <Col N="1859"/>has consulted with the Garda Commissioner. The purpose of this is to ensure that these provisions will only be commenced after the Commissioner has had the opportunity to make the necessary internal arrangements to ensure that the members of the force are familiar with these new procedures.</P>
    <P>In formulating the proposals my Department has, where the need arose, consulted with relevant Departments. In this regard, discussions have taken place with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in relation to housing legislation in so far as anti-social behaviour is concerned. I understand that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is taking account of my proposals in a current review of housing legislation that is intended to strengthen the statutory powers of housing authorities to combat anti-social behaviour.</P>

	<P>I can confirm that my Department received the formal application for transfer of the person concerned from the United Kingdom authorities in September, 2005. Various reports were then sought and received by my Department from bodies in this Jurisdiction. The application was reviewed by the State&rsquo;s legal officers in order to ensure that the requirements of the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons and the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Acts 1995 and 1997 were satisfied. Having received their advices in the matter, my Department requested further supporting documentation from the U.K. Authorities in relation to this application. Following the receipt of this additional documentation and further legal advice on the matter, I now expect to make a decision on the application in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons requires extensive documentation to be exchanged between both jurisdictions in order to allow an application to be fully considered. A three-way consent is also required to enable any transfer to take place i.e. from the authorities of both jurisdictions and from the person concerned. On receipt of those consents (assuming they are forthcoming), an <Col N="1860"/>application must be made to the High Court for a warrant authorising the transfer of the person concerned and his/her continued detention here.</P>
    <P>These procedures are required under the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Acts and must be adhered to in processing each application. I can assure you that every effort will be made to complete this process as quickly as possible.</P>

    <P>While the whole rationale behind the new programme is to ensure that the most disadvantaged schools benefit from all of the available supports, schools that are benefiting from existing schemes will keep the extra resources &mdash; financial and human &mdash; that they are getting under these initiatives for the 2006/07 school year. After that they will continue to get support in line with the level of socio-economic disadvantage among their pupils.</P>
    <P>In relation to how schools were identified to benefit from the new programme, this process was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department&rsquo;s regional offices and the Inspectorate. In the primary sector, the identification process was based on a survey carried out by the ERC in May 2005, from which a response rate of more than 97% was achieved.</P>
    <P>The analysis of the survey returns from primary schools by the ERC identified the socio-economic variables that collectively best predict achievement, and these variables were then used to identify schools for participation in the School Support Programme. The variables involved were: % unemployment; % local authority accommodation; % lone parenthood; % Travellers; % large families (5 or more children); % pupils eligible for free books. A review process has been put in place for primary and second-level schools that did not qualify for participation in the new School Support Programme (SSP) and that regard themselves as having a level of disadvantage which is of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the Programme. The review process will operate under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review. The closing date for receipt of review applications was Friday 31st March, 2006.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that the review process will be completed before the end of the current school year.</P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the child in question commenced in the school referred to above in September 2005 having previously attended a special class for children with speech and language disorder. The school put in place four resource teaching hours per week for this pupil at the beginning of the current school year. The special education needs organiser (SENO) advised the school authorities that based on the professional documentation that was available, this child did not qualify for individual resource teaching hours under my Department&rsquo;s guidelines. Subsequently the SENO agreed, as an exceptional measure, that the school could retain the four resource hours in respect of the child for the current school year only (2005/2006).</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware a general allocation system has been introduced under which all mainstream primary schools have been provided with learning support/resource teacher (LS/RT) support, based on certain enrolment figures, to cater for children with high-incidence special educational needs such as mild general learning disability and those with learning support needs. The school in question has been allocated 15 LS/RT hours per week under the general allocation model. It is open to the school authority to assign resource hours to this pupil from this general allocation.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 223 and 224 together.</P>
    <P>School Planning Section has been appraised of the situation, by the school management authorities of the first school referred to by Deputy Higgins.</P>
    <P>My officials have been informed that the school accepts enrolments from parents in the first three weeks of March each year. The school authority <Col N="1866"/>is currently carrying out a comprehensive survey in its area to determine the actual shortfall in Junior Infant places. When the results of this survey are available the Board of Management will make a decision on how best to cater for the actual shortfall in places.</P>
    <P>The school authority has been advised by officials in School Planning Section that it has the option to apply for an additional classroom, should it be required, to cater for an additional Junior Infant intake for September 2006.</P>
    <P>I understand that parents in the area have been kept informed by the school authorities of these matters.</P>
    <P>The School Planning Section of my Department has not been made aware of any particular accommodation difficulties at the second school referred to by the Deputy. The school concerned has a building project nearing completion which will bring the capacity of the school to 32 classrooms.</P>
    <P>With regard to the area as a whole, I am conscious that Dublin 15 is one of the most rapidly developing areas in the country and, as a result, there has been a marked increase in the demand for primary school places.</P>
    <P>My Department is taking a number of measures to increase the capacity of existing schools in the area concerned along with the development of new schools to meet this growing demand. All building projects arising from these interventions are awarded a band 1 priority rating under my Departments prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects to ensure that they are delivered as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <P Just="Left">In the Littlepace/Castaheaney area a new school building has recently been completed at Mary Mother of Hope National School, with an additional project underway with a target delivery date of September 2007. In addition a new primary school campus is planned for a school site in Ongar which will have a minimum of 32 classrooms. Part of this project will provide a permanent accommodation solution for Castaheaney Educate Together National School and also has a target completion date of September, 2007.</P>
    <P>In addition to this provision and arising from the recent surge in demand for school places in the Littlepace/Ongar area of Dublin 15, I recently announced the provision of significant additional school places with effect from this coming September. Following discussions with both of the school patron bodies that are already providing places in the area Castaheaney Educate Together NS will take an additional class of junior infants this September and I have also agreed to grant recognition to a new primary school for the area with effect from this coming September under the Patronage of the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin. My Department had anticipated that a further new school would have been required for September 2007 and that the recognition of a new school could have been processed this autumn <Col N="1867"/>within the normal school recognition process. The greater than anticipated population changes in the area means that we cannot wait and therefore I took the exceptional measure of recognising a new school outside the standard process.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the extra provision under both the patronage of Educate Together and the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin will greatly ease the pressure on school places in the area.</P>
    <P>In the Diswellstown area, St. Patrick&rsquo;s National School has recently moved into a new 24 classroom school. This will facilitate an annual 3 stream intake. However, as an exceptional matter the Board of Management has agreed to take a fourth stream of Junior infants this year. In addition to this, the Board of Management of St. Mochta&rsquo;s National School, which currently has an intake of 3 junior infant classes, has agreed to enrol a fourth Junior Infant class for September 2006. An extension project to cater for this development will also attract a Band 1 priority rating.</P>
    <P>Other developments in the Dublin 15 area include the planned expansion of St. Brigid&rsquo;s National School in Castleknock and extensions to St. Brigid&rsquo;s Boys and Girls National Schools, Blanchardstown.</P>
    <P>In addition, a new Educate Together school opened in Tyrrelstown in September 2005. My Department has approved the provision of six additional classrooms for September 2006 to cater for new enrolments and Special Education Teachers. It is anticipated that this school will enrol three junior infant classes.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the measures outlined will assist in alleviating the immediate demand for pupil places in the area. However, due to the current level of demand emanating from the Dublin 15 area, the need to provide even further school accommodation is under consideration and my Department is engaging with the key school Patron authorities that are active in the area in this regard.</P>

The minimum period for which a secondment may be granted is one school year.</P>
    <P>In a case of a secondment to a programme approved by my Department for a period specified at the commencement of the programme, a secondment arrangement in excess of one school year may be agreed between the Board of Management and the teacher at the start of the secondment arrangement.</P>

	<P>The Primary Curriculum Support Programme (PCSP) provides on-going in-service and support to teachers in schools covering the revised Primary Curriculum which was introduced in 1999. The in-service provided annually is also available to teachers on secondment. The PCSP, through its Cuiditheoireacht service, provides support to individual teachers, including those returning from absence. The service also customises the content and format of support it provides to teachers and school staff in line with individual needs and requirements including those of teachers returning to school after leave of absence. The service also provides support via phone and email. Details of the call-save line are available on the PCSP website.</P>
    <P>The PCSP website contains all presentations, support materials and high quality resources which have been designed by Trainers and Cuiditheoir&iacute; to support teachers in developing an understanding of the curriculum. Furthermore, all seminars scheduled in the past two years have been filmed and will be available in the coming school year in DVD format (available from the PCSP office) and in streaming video (accessible on the PCSP website).</P>
    <P>Primary teachers may also access training by contacting their local Education Centre which responds to the needs of teachers and schools in their catchment area. Regional teams of Cuiditheoir&iacute; work closely with the Education Centre Network to provide courses which address locally identified needs. &ldquo;Drop-in Clinics&rdquo; have been established throughout the Education Centre Network and this enables teachers to access any specific curriculum support they require.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department funds a comprehensive summer course training programme to support the professional development of Primary teachers. These courses encompass the range of subject areas of the Primary School Curriculum and also include other important areas such as classroom management and discipline in schools. In addition, this programme includes on-line training for teachers working in the special educational needs area.</P>
    <P>The Second Level Support Service (SLSS) provides professional development support for second level teachers on an ongoing basis during the school year. A brochure detailing the schedule of in-service is provided twice yearly to schools and is available on the SLSS website. Teachers absent from school may also avail of this in-service training.</P>
    <P>The SLSS also provides annual induction training for those teachers entering the teaching profession for the first time, serving teachers engag<Col N="1870"/>ing in curricular areas for the first time and teachers returning to the profession from leave of absence. The training is delivered early in the school year. A schedule of this training for the coming school year will be available on the SLSS website before the commencement of the next school year.</P>
    <P>The SLSS website also contains up-to-date information with related materials and available supports for teachers and schools with appropriate contact telephone numbers. The Co-ordinators and the Regional Development Officers of the various support programmes also provide individual support to teachers, including those returning from absences. In addition, the SLSS provides a telephone helpline for teachers and schools &mdash; contact details are available on the SLSS website.</P>
    <P>Second level teachers may also access training by contacting their local Education Centre which works closely with the Subject Associations, National Support Services, Third Level Institutions and other appropriate providers.</P>
    <P>I consider that the options offered through the various systems of supports provide teachers, including those returning to teaching after leave of absence, with ample opportunity to reacquaint them with the curriculum and to continue to develop their skills which they can then apply in the classroom.</P>
