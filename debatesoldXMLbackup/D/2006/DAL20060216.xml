    <Title>Requests to move Adjournment of D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the failure of Government to provide the necessary funding to support the establishment of a cross-Border scouting camp at Castle Sanderson, on the Cavan-Fermanagh border, when IFI, INTERREG and many private donors clearly support this important youth centre cross-Border project. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, stated last week that such North-South projects must figure in the new national development plan. The D&aacute;il must discuss this issue and provide funds accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the findings of a study into depression among post-primary students in the north east region of Cavan, Monaghan, Louth and Meath, which recorded the highest incidence nationally, at 20%, of significant levels of depression among post-primary students; the fact that the most likely to experience depression were young persons from single-parent families, or those with low levels of physical fitness; the fact that males and females with low self-esteem were more than 13 times more likely to have depressive symptoms; and the urgent need for innovative school-based programmes with the emphasis on a preventative approach to student depression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the increasing practice of retailers to label goods in both euro and sterling with the sterling price being the dominant figure on the label. Often there are sig<Col N="1770"/>nificant differences in the prices being charged in euro over sterling. In view of the Know your Rights campaign currently under way there is an obvious need for Government to recognise there is a problem in this regard and to legislate in the interest of the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, when the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children will take action to stop the killing of innocent people by unregulated and unscrupulous alternative practitioners; the actions she intends to take to regulate alternative practitioners as has been promised for years; and to discuss if the working group report she has received on this matter will be of any assistance in this regard in the absence of the statutory regulation of these practitioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the annual report of the National Parasuicide Registry outlining that 11,000 people presented at hospital accident and emergency units in 2004 due to deliberate self-harm, almost half of whom were under 30 years of age, the peak age for women being 15 to 19 years of age and for men between 20 and 24 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the need to implement the new cancer strategy and provide an adequate funding package given that all the chemotherapy facilities in the country now operate at full or over-capacity even though this strategy has been with the T&aacute;naiste for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Having considered the matters raised, they are not in order under Standing Order 31.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to take No. 8<i>a, </i>Finance Bill 2006 &mdash; allocation of time motion for Select Committee; No. 8<i>b,</i> Finance Bill 2006 &mdash; Financial Resolutions; No. 1<i>a,</i> Teaching Council (Amendment) Bill 2006 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second and Subsequent Stages; No. 14, Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) Bill 2005 [<i>Seanad</i>] &mdash; Second Stage (Resumed); and No. 1, Building Control Bill 2005 &mdash; Second Stage (Resumed).</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) Nos. 8<i>a</i> and 8<i>b</i> shall be decided without debate, and in the case of No. 8<i>b,</i> Financial Resolutions, Nos. 1 to 42, shall be moved together and decided by one question which shall be put from the Chair; (2) the proceedings on No. 1<i>a</i> shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after one hour 35 minutes and the following arrangements shall <Col N="1771"/>apply: (i) the proceedings on Second Stage shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 65 minutes; the speeches shall be confined to a Minister or Minister of State and to the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and the Technical Group, who shall be called upon in that order and who may share their time, and shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; and a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a speech in reply which shall not exceed five minutes; (ii) the proceedings on Committee and Remaining Stages shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 30 minutes by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, with regard to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two proposals to put to the House. Are the proposals for dealing with Nos. 8<i>a</i> and 8<i>b</i> without debate agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I object to the fact that the Government proposes to rush through a fairly complex Finance Bill in less than 15 hours debate over three days on Committee Stage. This time includes our one opportunity, according to the Minister, to discuss a 1,000 page report on tax breaks. It is also a Bill that proposes to extend tax breaks significantly, not just to hospitals but to psychiatric institutions and mental care centres. The D&aacute;il cannot do its job unless we are given a full opportunity to tease out the costs and benefits of the Minister&rsquo;s proposal for the health service. I am glad the T&aacute;naiste is present as she has issued a directive to the Health Service Executive that, for example, in the case of a number of hospitals like Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown, land is to be given for private hospital development. If such a development costs &euro;100 million, tax breaks of &euro;42 million will be received courtesy of the taxpayer. This will all be done without any debate on the cost or benefit to the State.</P>
      <P>As the time given for debate is inadequate, will the Government rethink its position on it? It is outrageous that we are supposed to hold the Minister for Finance to account but we have almost no time to do so or debate important issues because of the way the Committee Stage is structured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Deputy Burton in saying that although the procedures used are time-worn &mdash; the procedures in these Houses have probably been the same since Adam was a boy &mdash; they are inadequate for dealing with tax issues. Tax reliefs are effectively the same as public spending. We devote much time in committees and the Houses to debating Estimates and how we spend money. The same amount of money is being devoted in <Col N="1772"/>tax reliefs of one type or another. Recent reports showed that spending in tax reliefs dwarfed that of five Departments, yet there is a cursory examination of them.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Finance for having the review, but having carried it out he has failed to reform the way in which the D&aacute;il scrutinises the decisions underpinning the issue. He is pushing ahead with new tax reliefs without taking the lessons that were clearly set out in the review, that proper evaluation of new or extended reliefs must be made before taxpayers&rsquo; money is committed. While the T&aacute;naiste may indicate that these are the practices which have been used for many years, this does not mean they are adequate. We now have the benefit of three volumes of analysis of tax reliefs. We are not using this new information to put in place proper systems and scrutiny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for more time to be made available on Committee Stage for consideration of the Finance Bill, especially in light of the three volume review on tax reliefs this year. The time is needed, along with Report Stage in the House, to examine a variety of issues, including the evasion of responsibility by the Government of large areas of public expenditure. One of these was reported during the week when Department of Finance correspondents questioned whether the Health Service Executive should be the body responsible for spending the huge health budget.</P>
      <P>On those grounds a set of circumstances have come about which have not existed in previous years. These demand, particularly in light of budget announcements by the Minister for Finance, that the budgetary process be reviewed. This Finance Bill should be subject to the greatest amount of consideration possible and more than we have given it in previous years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I also make a request for additional time for the Committee Stage debate. The reports regarding tax reliefs which have recently been presented and the decision of the Minister on the back of same in his introduction of the Finance Bill before the House indicate a requirement for a searching analysis in terms of the reliefs he intends to drop, those he is perpetuating and others which are being extended. There is much to be addressed on some of those in the latter category, even without any cost benefit analysis or indication of the cost to the Exchequer. There is a unique element in this year&rsquo;s deliberations on the Finance Bill and, accordingly, additional time is required for Members to play their function properly of scrutinising and making the Minister accountable. I urge that additional time be provided, with an option to structure the time on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The time being proposed by the Government includes from 12 noon to 8 p.m. on <Col N="1773"/>Tuesday, 21 February, with two short breaks; 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Wednesday, 22 February, with two short breaks; and 11 a.m. to 1.30 p.m. on Thursday, 23 February. That is a considerable amount of time and we are not in a position to give any more.</P>
      <P>Question, &ldquo;That the proposal for dealing with Nos. 8<i>a </i>and 8<i>b </i>be agreed to&rdquo;, put and declared carried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the proposal for dealing with No. 1<i>a </i>agreed to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Without seeking to delay the progress of the Order of Business, I object in principle to the guillotine applying to the Teaching Council (Amendment) Bill 2006. Whatever time is required will be met by the respective parties and individual Deputies who wish to participate. The 30-minute period to which Report and Final Stages are restricted is inadequate. We should leave the debate open and allow for full participation as Deputies wish to avail of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a small technical Bill which would give the Minister the power to make regulations governing the first election of members of the council.</P>
      <P>Question, &ldquo;That the proposal for dealing with No. 1<i>a</i> be agreed to&rdquo;, put and declared carried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>In response to a question from Deputy Rabbitte yesterday, the Taoiseach stated his intention to bring forward new proposals regarding the rights of MPs elected for Northern Ireland to speak in the Oireachtas. On the previous occasion when the Taoiseach brought forward a proposal in this regard, a serious disagreement occurred between Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats within Government, proving that those parties do not agree on all matters. On the next occasion the Taoiseach puts forward such a proposal, will it be a Government proposal as distinct from an individual party proposal? When will this be?</P>
      <P>The Government yesterday discussed a range of options on caring for the elderly. It was reported today that this was with a view to bringing the matter to social partnership talks. Deputy Bruton, among others, has made the point on many occasions that the only people not consulted about social partnership are the Members in this House, all parties and none. Given that everybody here would have their own views regarding options on care for the elderly and the changing demographics of the country, would the T&aacute;naiste think it appropriate for the Government to bring forward its views here or produce a Green Paper for discussion? Everybody, from all parties and none, could then give their views. This could then be brought to social partnership talks rather than having a scenario where the Government discusses the matter but makes no decision <Col N="1774"/>and we then hear about various aspects of the matter on the news without anybody in the House being consulted. Everybody here clearly has their own views on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to representatives from Northern Ireland having access to committees in Leinster House, the Taoiseach has sought to get consensus among all parties. He has been acting in this capacity as leader of the largest party. It has not yet been possible to reach agreement on the matter.</P>
      <P>Over the past 12 months, as the Deputy is aware, there has been a report by Mercer on the issue of care for the elderly, especially relating to long-term funding of continuing care. There has also been the O&rsquo;Shea report on nursing home subventions. These were published some time ago. There have also been ESRI reports and, over recent months, an interdepartmental committee has examined the issues and produced proposals for the Government. We will make decisions in this area. It is not a matter for others to do so. There was a commitment in Sustaining Progress to examine the issues and the greater the buy-in from the wider society the better.</P>
      <P>I would welcome a debate in this House. There is no question of not wanting one. The discussion the Government had yesterday was of a preliminary nature. As the Deputy has acknowledged, those in the population who are over 65 now represent an age-dependency percentage of 18%, and this will double over the next 20 years so there are major issues with which we must deal. We would welcome the views of everybody in the House on the matter. Perhaps we can find a forum in due course, such as the Joint Committee on Health and Children, where we could debate some of these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The latest issue of <i>The Irish Times</i> reports that an attitude survey prepared by the ESRI was presented to Cabinet. Will the T&aacute;naiste cause that document to be laid before the House or put into the library? I do not recall an ESRI document being prepared for Government and not presented to the House or published independently. Will the T&aacute;naiste clarify that?</P>
      <P>I will ask the T&aacute;naiste about the trolley watch figures in what used to be her and my local hospital in Tallaght. On 3 January there were 18 patients but on Tuesday there were 75, some accommodated in makeshift care outside the hospital proper. Can the T&aacute;naiste say whether any alleviation is in sight for the people oppressed in such conditions, and for the hard-working staff unable to cope with the situation?</P>
      <P>Did the T&aacute;naiste hear the interview with the Government Chief Whip this morning, where he said the Government was unable to appoint a Minister of State last week because of the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s absence?</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1775"/>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>It was the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s fault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>As this is a Government decision, he seemed to signal that the T&aacute;naiste and the Progressive Democrats were the cause of the cruel deception of Deputy Haughey. Many people are upset about it. I call on the T&aacute;naiste to take the opportunity to say whether the Government Chief Whip is correct in allowing it to be inferred that the T&aacute;naiste and Progressive Democrats were responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>On the article in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning, the Government did not have any such report at Cabinet yesterday nor did it discuss public opinion polls on housing. I do not know where the report came from but it certainly was not on the agenda yesterday, nor did any such document form part of any discussion. I know the piece was written by a reputable journalist but it did not reflect reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a Fianna F&aacute;il leak, then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot believe <i>The Irish Times</i> would be inaccurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>On Tallaght Hospital, the head of the National Hospitals Office, Mr. John O&rsquo;Brien, has been in discussions with Tallaght Hospital on issues there as a result of both the process mapping that was done of the hospital and its procedures and policies. The hospital had very high levels of elective admissions this week, as it happens. Over a two-hour period it seems the numbers on the trolleys could be reduced by 45 people. I do not know why that could not have happened earlier and there is no excuse for it. I spoke to Mr. John O&rsquo;Brien yesterday and he is holding a number of meetings with the management of the hospital on that issue.</P>
      <P>I heard the Chief Whip&rsquo;s comments this morning. I was available by telephone although I was not at the Cabinet meeting, being in Canada. The Chief Whip informs me it was a matter of courtesy in a partnership Government. A decision like that was not going to be made in my absence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>He did not say that on the wireless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not happen in New Zealand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P Italics="Y">(Interruptions).</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>As the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children is present, can she let me know, given that my request under Standing Order 31 was not accepted, the date she proposes to publish and implement the cancer strategy in light of the urgency of the matter?</P>
      <P>On the newly published Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Bill, will the <Col N="1776"/>T&aacute;naiste make available the advice of the Attorney General given that hidden away in section 31, referring to environmental impact assessment regulations, it states that &ldquo;any regulation made thereunder in relation to environmental impact assessment shall not apply to anything done under an order made under this Act&rdquo;. Given that the Government has worn a path to the European Court of Justice for all the various transgressions it has made, does she not think it quite out of order that the environmental impact assessment regulations would not apply to this legislation? This legislation will be on a hiding to nothing if it throws out the EU regulations in that manner. Alternatively, having discovered the issue, will the Government withdraw the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>We will not withdraw the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The report on the cancer strategy has just been submitted to the Department of Health and Children. I am reading the report and I will make decisions on it very soon. I will have to go to the Government on the policy issues.</P>
      <P>The critical infrastructure Bill will be published later today and Deputy Sargent should wait to see it before he comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It is here.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Can we have the advice of the Attorney General? The Government is making up its own rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the T&aacute;naiste used her office as Minister for Health and Children to arrange counselling for the Fianna F&aacute;il family? There are troubling signs of dysfunction this morning. Certain members of the family are hoping Dick Cheney might invite the Taoiseach on his next duck hunt. I warn the Members opposite of what might happen if things get out of hand.</P>
      <P>I will ask about the Abbotstown sports campus development authority Bill. Could the T&aacute;naiste be more precise than the Taoiseach usually is?</P>
      <P>I did not get much change from the Taoiseach yesterday when I asked about the 130,000 construction workers being illegally denied pension rights by criminality among construction bosses. Is the T&aacute;naiste concerned about this? Does she intend to bring forward legislation to ensure every construction worker gets their pension entitlement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Abbotstown sports campus development authority Bill will be published in this session.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is considering strengthening <Col N="1777"/>employment legislation and regulations in the area of pension rights.</P>

	<P>The law is in place; it needs to be enforced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>This is after decades of negligence and law breaking by construction employers. The T&aacute;naiste has not expressed outrage that 130,000 workers, according to the Pensions Ombudsman, are being denied rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <P Just="Left">I want to ask about the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2006, which is to be debated next Tuesday afternoon but will not be published until Monday afternoon. Is it the case that the Government is trying to fill the gap and that while the Minister for Social and Family Affairs is away with his press officers and advisers to write his speech, we will not see it until Monday evening? Does the T&aacute;naiste agree with this way of carrying out Government business or is it all a mess over there?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Is that fair to this side? It is to be debated on Tuesday but we have not seen it yet. It will be published Monday, which does not give us much time to examine it. Meanwhile, the Minister and his advisers are writing speeches and press releases.</P>

      <P Just="Left">A third level student support Bill is in the programme for Government and we have been told its publication is expected in 2006. The manner by which student grants are decided discriminates against PAYE earners, yet the latest information provided on the breakdown by socio-economic groups of third level grants dates from 2001. I raised a question on this yesterday but did not receive an answer. It is an important issue but no date has been given for legislation.

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have looked at the Fianna F&aacute;il manifesto, which makes interesting reading at times. Two of the priorities it listed for the party&rsquo;s return to Government was the establishment of a public transport regulatory authority to introduce bus competition and a Dublin transport authority which would bring some relief to beleaguered Dublin commuters. Can we assume these proposals remain in the third section of the legislative programme, with the heads not even sent to <Col N="1779"/>Government, because the Progressive Democrats is seeking to dampen Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s enthusiasm in terms of bringing in bus competition? Maybe it is because there is now no Minister on the northside, which does not have the Luas, and there is nobody with the enthusiasm to deliver a decent bus service. What problem has arisen to cause this legislation to remain on the Government&rsquo;s third division list?</P>

Yesterday, RTE revealed the strong and unequivocal advice from the Department of Finance to the T&aacute;naiste that the HSE should not be given the role of accounting officer because it was incapable of acting in that role, was far too complex and untried, untested and inexperienced. Will the T&aacute;naiste address that issue and has she found the &euro;56 million which went missing and remains unaccounted for? Five different answers have been given with regard to where the money has gone. Can she tell us where the money went or will we have to allocate additional money under a Supplementary Estimate?</P>

	<P>I want to raise the dropped Bill on the advertising of alcohol, an issue I spoke on last December. At the time, the Taoiseach said it was dropped because big business had agreed to co-operate. However, last year, we saw 400 deaths and the numbers killed since the beginning of this year has been equally catastrophic. When will the Bill on the sale of alcohol be brought before the House so we can at least discuss this issue?</P>
      <P>We were promised, 18 months ago, that an enforcement of fines Bill would be introduced but a date has not yet been set. Does the T&aacute;naiste accept it is a complete waste of money to pay people to stay in jail when fines could be lifted by instalment?</P>
      <P Just="Left">When will the health Bill be introduced so we can discuss aspects of the health service which I personally experienced some weeks ago? First-hand experience is somewhat different to observing matters from the stars.</P>
      <P>We were promised the report on Mr. Walsh and Monaghan General Hospital would be completed within eight weeks and published in January. When will that report be available?</P>

Should the Government not also put the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill 2004 before the House, given that we need to process it in advance of such an appointment?</P>
      <P>With regard to the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Bill 2006, is it the Government&rsquo;s intention to bring parallel legislation, the &ldquo;Poolbeg incinerator no decision until after the general election Bill&rdquo;, given the situation in terms of the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>That will be legislation on getting rid of the Minister, Deputy McDowell.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1782"/>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the T&aacute;naiste explain why this Bill is being published, given that it will allow a second domestic waste incinerator to be fast-tracked in Ringaskiddy in my constituency, while the legislation seems to exclude a delay but not a stopping of a similar facility in her colleague&rsquo;s constituency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Comhairle Bill was published and I understand it has been ordered for Second Stage. With regard to the second matter raised, any existing projects are not included in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>In respect of what the T&aacute;naiste said about the care of the elderly and her wish that there be a full debate here, will the Government publish the interdepartmental report on the elderly so that when the debate takes place it will be properly and fully informed?</P>
      <P>A year ago yesterday, the Supreme Court ruled that long-stay nursing home charges were illegal for public beds. On 11 May, the T&aacute;naiste announced that a private sector company would handle the repayment of charges to the 20,000 people involved. Nine months later not a single cent has been repaid. Last week we were informed that the private sector wanted between &euro;30 million and &euro;50 million to manage the repayment system. When will we see the promised legislation and why has it been delayed? Is she still insisting that a private sector firm handles the repayment scheme? I make that last point for a very good reason. When the T&aacute;naiste announced that an <i>ex gratia</i> payment of &euro;2,000 would be made as an interim measure to those concerned, the HSE and the public service paid 11,000 people. If the HSE is capable of paying out &euro;22 million to 11,000 people, why is the T&aacute;naiste insisting that a private sector company &mdash; two of which have submitted tenders for between &euro;30 million and &euro;50 million &mdash; be used to make the remainder of the payments? Is the HSE and the public service incapable, having paid 11,000 people already, of paying the remainder? It should be borne in mind that many of those involved do not have time on their side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation will be to hand in this session, as I have already stated. It has proved to be extraordinarily complex legislation for two reasons. First, there are legal issues around wards of court and second, around the private accounts of those in institutional care and whether the institutions are agents of them. The Comptroller and Auditor General will have things to say about that. That has involved very complex issues that have taken longer to resolve than anyone anticipated.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
      <P>With regard to the charges, up to 70,000 people are involved, 40,000 or 50,000 of whom are dead. The PIAB was established by this House a number of years ago and has outsourced all of its administration to a company based in Cork. Last <Col N="1783"/>year the board made 20,000 payments, for an average of &euro;30 per payment. There is no doubt the health service administration could do the job, but it would completely clog up the system for years. The administration would have to handle a volume of cases as high as 70,000, check the records to determine how long people were in institutions and so forth. That is very different to paying everybody &euro;2,000. If everybody was to be paid the same amount, it would not be such a big issue, but clearly if one has to go through each case, try to establish how much each person is owed and apply interest, it becomes a mammoth task. That is why we sought outside assistance but clearly we are not going to pay large sums for that. If it cannot be done for a reasonable amount, then it will have to be done internally. However, the PIAB model is a good one and has worked extraordinarily well, with 20,000 claims paid in one year, using the outsourcing model with a company in Cork.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the T&aacute;naiste aware, as Minister for Health and Children, that the number of children diagnosed with diabetes in Cork has doubled over a very short period of time and is now 207? There is now no diabetes nurse in Cork University Hospital, when there should be three. There is a part-time endocrinologist, access to a part-time social worker and part-time dietician. Some of the children are as young as 18 months&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Does the Deputy have a question on promised legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I do. The Health Bill refers to the registration system in respect of services for children, older people and people with disabilities. It clearly covers the subject I am raising. Parents in Cork have children as young as 18 months with diabetes. One can only imagine the trauma of having to inject one&rsquo;s child and having no one to telephone to ask for advice when one cannot stabilise the child&rsquo;s condition. That is what is happening, not to mention the fact that there are 37 people on trolleys in two Cork city hospitals. Despite this, we were told by the Taoiseach yesterday, in the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s absence, that we have an excellent health service. Will the T&aacute;naiste do anything about the chronic situation for children with diabetes in Cork city?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>

	<P>Yes, hopefully. There are two pharmacy Bills, one dealing with fitness to practice issues and the other with premises and service issues, both of which will be before the House this year, I hope. With regard to care of the elderly, there are a number of issues involved. Obviously the Repayments Bill will be brought forward fairly soon in this session.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to care of the elderly and what was discussed yesterday, namely the defined revenue funding scheme. Approximately &euro;500,000 was given initially but it was not increased. A sum of &euro;2.5 million is needed to take the 20% of people out of nursing homes who do not need to be there. That could be done very cheaply and I ask the T&aacute;naiste to examine that matter.</P>
      <P>A report, which has already been referred to this morning, has been prepared on ill children who have a psychiatric condition. In Mayo, people have to wait two years to see a child psychiatrist. A second psychiatrist is urgently needed, but there is not a hope in hell of getting one.</P>

      <P>I, like many other Deputies, submitted a parliamentary question to the T&aacute;naiste last week about expenditure in some areas of the Department of Health and Children. I received a reply to the effect that my question had been referred for reply to the Health Service Executive but I did not ask the question of the Health Service Executive.

    <Title>Teaching Council (Amendment) Bill 2006: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am pleased to bring this Bill to the House. This Bill is very short and consists of a number of amendments to the Teaching Council Act 2001. The amendments are of a technical nature which are designed to cover a legislative lacuna in the teaching council. This lacuna became apparent only recently and I wish to resolve this situation as soon as possible. It concerns a technical issue relating to the first elections to the council, which were held in 2004.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Under the Teaching Council Act, 16 of the teaching council&rsquo;s overall membership of 37 were elected directly by teachers, either employed in or qualified to teach in primary or post-primary schools recognised by the Department. Of the remaining 21 members, 16 were nominated by the education sector partners &mdash; trade unions, school management bodies, parents&rsquo; organisations and third level institutions. There are five direct appointments by the Minister. As is the normal practice, all members of the council ultimately hold their appointments from the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
      <P>The Teaching Council Act 2001 provides that the elections had to be held under regulations made by the Minister for Education and Science. In accordance with the provisions of the legislation, the regulations, which are known as the Teaching Council (First Election of Members) Regulations 2004, SI 916 of 2004, were signed into law on 10 September 2004 by the then Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey. While the elections were held under the required regulations and these regulations were, in turn, made in accordance with the Teaching Council Act, it recently became apparent that the relevant provisions of the Act were not commenced when the regulations were made, thus raising a potential question about the legal basis for the elections.</P>
      <P>The amendments covered by this Bill retrospectively validate the power to make these regulations, thus ensuring there can be no question about whether the elections were held in accordance with the Teaching Council Act. Given the overall membership of the council is closely linked with the elections, these amendments will <Col N="1794"/>also ensure there can be no issues in relation to the nominations and appointments to the council.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the legal lacuna addressed by the terms of this Bill does not have any impact upon the work of the teaching council. The council was launched almost a year ago in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham on 28 February 2005 so that its members can undertake the necessary preparatory work in advance of its formal establishment. The Teaching Council Act provides that the council cannot have any legal standing until its formal establishment day, after which it formally and legally commences its operations.</P>
      <P>This lack of legal status until establishment day also means the members of the council will have to be reconfirmed in their appointments once the council has been formally established. This process is normal for statutory bodies of this nature, such as the National Council for Special Education, where memberships are appointed in advance of formal operations commencing at a later date.</P>
      <P>At the launch of the council, I indicated my wish that its establishment day should occur in March of this year. It is intended, following consultation with the council, to confirm the precise date over the coming weeks and at this stage I am pleased the deadline will be met.</P>
      <P>Although the council does not have a legal status at present, since its launch in February 2005 it has undertaken a great deal of preparatory work so it can fully meet its obligations after establishment day when it will commence operations on a phased basis.</P>
      <P>Under the able leadership of its chairperson, Ms Joan Ward, the council has recruited staff and it has secured an office premises. The three statutory committees and standing committees of the council have been established on an informal basis and the members of each have been working very hard over the last six months on their respective areas of responsibility so that their preparatory work will be well-advanced prior to the council&rsquo;s legal establishment. I would like to thank all members of the council and its staff for their efforts in this regard.</P>
      <P>For example, the registration committee has also completed its procedures for the registration of teachers and the recognition of teaching qualifications so that the council can begin work on this immediately after its establishment day, as set out in the Teaching Council Act. Similarly, a great deal of work has been done by the education committee on codes of professional conduct and practice for teachers, which are currently at draft stage and will be subject to a widespread consultation process later this year. The investigating and disciplinary committees have also undertaken a large body of work into what will undoubtedly be difficult but important areas for the maintenance of standards for the teaching profession.</P><Col N="1795"/>
      <P>Deputies may be aware that the Teaching Council Act sets out three wide-ranging and ambitious objectives for the council. In essence, the teaching council is concerned with teaching rather than the narrower focus upon teachers. Its objectives cover the regulation of the teaching profession and the professional conduct of teachers, in addition to initial teacher education and training, as well as the continuing education, training and professional development of teachers. The council will have a strong developmental role in regard to the education and development of teachers to ensure we will maintain the current very good standards of teachers and schools. The council will not merely be concentrating upon the professional conduct or competence of individual teachers, although it is recognised that, for a minority of teachers, these may well be issues which have to be addressed. It is important when dealing with such matters that they are approached with integrity, fairness and balance and I am confident that the council will do this.</P>
      <P>While I am pleased with the level of preparatory work undertaken in readiness for the full commencement of the council&rsquo;s functions after establishment day, the council will face a number of challenges as it creates for itself a position of genuine respect and credibility on the education landscape. As the regulatory body for the profession of teaching, the council has real potential to secure and enhance the status of this vital profession in the eyes of people throughout the country. By successfully meeting the challenge of acting as a focus for all that is best in the profession of teaching in Ireland, the council will do much to diminish any concerns around the concept of self-regulation. We have been well served by teachers throughout the generations and it is right and proper that we entrust them now with a much greater say in the regulation of their own profession. I have no doubt the Council will rise to that challenge and, in doing so, ensure the high standards achieved to date in regard to both teachers and teaching continue into the future.</P>
      <P>I look forward to providing further information over the coming months on the work of the teaching council and I also look forward to its establishment day next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this Bill and look forward to the formal establishment of the council next month. This is important legislation that is long overdue. It will lead to the maintenance and improvement of the education and training of teachers as well as promoting teaching as a profession. I hope the teaching council will also examine issues such as the shortage of male teachers and will have a role in trying to make the profession more appealing.</P>
      <P>I was bemused by the Minister&rsquo;s use of the phrase &ldquo;legislative lacuna&rdquo;. Perhaps she con<Col N="1796"/>sulted a thesaurus to find the most polite way to describe what I can only describe as an error. I am also amused that she specifically noted that the regulations were signed into law by her predecessor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not his fault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>In that case, where does the fault for this important error lie? Ultimately, Ministers are responsible for legislation produced by their respective Departments and errors therein.</P>
      <P>The original Act provides that the Minister shall take all necessary steps to secure the appointment of members of the teaching council. The failure to appoint the council due to an error indicates the legislation was sloppily enacted. I highlight this point because a large number of departmental staff are available to ensure events such as the launch of the legislation, which was held on 28 February last at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, run smoothly. Ensuring that adequate attention is given to the legislation is more important than photo calls. It is vital that legislation passed in the House is good.</P>
      <P>The areas for which the teaching council has responsibility include the training of teachers, professional standards and competence and the quality of teaching. This brings me to a point raised this morning on the Order of Business regarding the register of persons considered unsafe to work with children. The teaching council will deal with fitness to teach and the original Act contains strong guidelines on how this will be done, including provisions for the holding of disciplinary hearings and a right of appeal for teachers subject to such hearings. In addressing suitability, the issue of vetting teachers or considering whether a person is unsafe to work with children will arise in some shape or form. However, as vetting is not governed by legislation, the teaching council will have a problem in making decisions in this area because it will be required to operate under guidelines dealing with professional ability as distinct from personal suitability. I ask the Minister of State to consult her colleagues, the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, to ensure legislation on vetting is introduced. While it may not be the function of the teaching council to deal with vetting, consideration must be given to introducing a mechanism which would enable it to examine this issue. I ask the Minister to respond.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party does not oppose the Bill on the grounds that we, too, want the teaching council to begin its important work without further delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Government incompetence is the reason the Bill is before the House. Given that the work required to ensure appointments to the teaching council conformed to legislation was <Col N="1797"/>not done, &ldquo;lacuna&rdquo; in this context is a fancy word for incompetence. With competence part of the remit of the teaching council, it is ironic that the Department has set such an early example of incompetence to representatives of teachers and other bodies on the council. I accept, however, that the error must be put right and the Labour Party does not propose to obstruct the Minister in doing so.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I ask for clarity on several matters. The Minister indicated that the establishment date for the teaching council has not yet been set and difficulties are unlikely to arise with regard to the appointments or the preliminary work carried out by the council. She also indicated the council has already done extensive and good work. Will she assure the House that problems will not arise with regard to the appointees or their preliminary work?</P>
      <P>I have a document featuring a lovely photograph taken on 28 February 2005 at the event to which Deputy Enright referred and featuring some familiar and not so familiar faces of those appointed to the teaching council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is perfectly gender balanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>It appears to be gender balanced and I see some strong minded people from parents&rsquo; organisations, schools bodies, teaching unions and so forth. I wish members of the teaching council well and hope they will be successful. Its membership suggests it has the potential to be a strong body.</P>
      <P>The teaching council has general responsibilities with regard to standards, procedures and criteria for recognition of new entrants, drawing up codes of practice etc. The most difficult aspect of its work will be to investigate and, where appropriate, apply sanctions in relation to professional misconduct or fitness to practice of any member. Other professional bodies, including the Medical Council and Law Society, have a similar responsibility. In the latter case, it is argued that more outsiders should be involved in assessing how the legal profession operates.</P>
      <P>Certain procedures are already in place for dealing with teachers who are not doing their job as well as they should. Having discussed this issue with various bodies at the Joint Committee on Education and Science, it is clear these procedures are difficult to implement. For example, it is extremely difficult to remove teachers who are not performing. I am aware, however, that everyone&rsquo;s rights must be protected in such circumstances. Despite the slow and cumbersome nature of the procedures and the fact that few teachers have been removed from their positions, nevertheless they are available. I understand different procedures apply in different educational sectors, for example, as between the VEC, private secondary school and primary school sectors. How will the current procedures <Col N="1798"/>interact with the teaching council&rsquo;s role in this area? Clarity is required in these matters to ensure conflicts do not arise between the role of the teaching council and provisions contained in other legislation. The teaching council will need to have access to good legal advice which I assume will be provided in respect of this aspect of its work. Will the Minister clarify these points?</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business this morning, Deputy Stanton and I asked when a Bill would be introduced on a register of persons considered unsafe to work with children, a matter Deputy Enright has also raised many times. Deputy Enright also raised the issue of vetting. Yesterday, I received a reply to a parliamentary question indicating that vetting procedures are still not in place for occupational groups, including teachers, other than special needs assistants, drivers, assistants for transport for children with special needs and so forth. Everyone involved in education, including the Minister, wants rapid progress to be made in this area. I am aware a vetting unit has been established in County Tipperary but what progress has been made in extending the register to other groups? This issue links in to the Bill.</P>
      <P>One could raise a number of general issues in this debate, including questions on teaching, the changing role of teachers and the difficulties they face in carrying out additional responsibilities, such as tackling bullying and dealing with social interaction. On the issue of support for teachers, many in the profession believe insufficient time is allocated to in-service training. A variety of other support mechanisms are also needed for teachers and, in particular, school principals who have a significantly larger workload in areas such as special needs as a result of recent legislation.</P>
      <P>While we could bring many wider issues into today&rsquo;s debate, I appreciate that we have limited time. The Labour Party will not oppose the Bill and we would like to see the teaching council operational as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. With the Chair&rsquo;s indulgence, I thank the Minister, her staff, the school principal and members of NEPS who weighed in recently in the Firhouse area. While we spoke earlier about mistakes that have been made, in a tragedy such as this one, all the resources came together, which shows we have the ability. The same was true in the case of the school bus tragedy in Meath when all the help came together for those affected. On behalf of local people, I thank all the professionals who rallied around the community and are helping people through this awful tragedy.</P>
      <P>I welcomed the introduction of the Teaching Council Act. I do not understand this lacuna &mdash; is it le c&uacute;namh D&eacute;? An error has been noticed and needs to be addressed. It is surprising how long it has taken to get the council operational. We are discussing the Teaching Council Act 2001 and it is only in 2006 that we are establishing the <Col N="1799"/>council. The delay is frustrating for us all, including, no doubt, the Minister. I understand the original Bill was supported by all sides of the House, as everyone understood the importance of the teaching council.</P>
      <P>The council holds great potential to ensure that, possibly for the first time, educational issues such as teacher training are placed in the competent hands of professionals. With the teaching council teachers are being given a level of self-governance akin to what lawyers and architects already have. Teachers&rsquo; unions such as the INTO have for years called for the establishment of such a council. I understand Scotland has had a teaching council since 1966. While it has been a long time coming, it is welcome. It is the first independent body to regulate key aspects of the teaching profession. Some 22 of the 37 council members are teachers, 16 of whom were nominated by teachers. It is a positive development.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the first gender-balanced election in the history of the State. However, it would be wrong not to have gender balance, particularly on the teaching council, because of the imbalance in favour of women in the profession. The teaching profession as a whole needs to be promoted and the council may help in this regard. Not only will it establish and maintain codes of conduct for teachers, but it will help represent the teaching profession on issues relating to education.</P>
      <P>The Act will provide a significant level of self-governance of the teaching profession, which is positive and should help to empower teachers. I noted what Deputy Enright said about vetting procedures etc., which the Minister will need to prioritise. There is considerable concern over the length of time it has taken to introduce the guidelines on the suitability for teachers. While I understand that difficulties exist, the lengthy delay is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>Ultimately, giving more power to teachers who have invaluable day-to-day teaching experience in the classroom and therefore know what needs to be improved and changed is a progressive step. I support the council, which is overdue. It is inconceivable that it should take so long to get it operational and in her reply I ask the Minister to explain it to me, as someone who is not familiar with these long delays. While the Minister referred to a formal &ldquo;establishment day&rdquo;, we seem to have waited an incredibly long time from the passing of the Act by the House to having the council operational. I understand the need to get resources and I accept the explanation from the Minister, which indicated that considerable work was carried out by the council in preparing for its official establishment. It has been dragged out for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. Before addressing the details <Col N="1800"/>of the legislation, it is important to thank and commend the dedicated and magnificent work done by teachers. I praise the vast majority of INTO, TUI and ASTI members who provide a great service every day in our schools. It is also important to support and value our teachers. It is time to challenge the cynics and teacher-bashers both in this House and outside. The vast majority of these smug individuals would not even last an hour in a classroom, never mind five to six hours every day. It is time for a reality check and it is the responsibility of all Members of the Oireachtas to nurture, support and back our teachers 100%.</P>
      <P>Any society that ignores its teachers is doomed to failure. Education is a key element in any state, as it represents a major avenue out of poverty for the weaker sections of society. If we want to end poverty and make it history, education represents the way out and the way forward, which is why we need to invest more in early and pre-school education. This investment should be a priority for any government with a social conscience. We need a Chavez approach to disadvantage. We need to take the money and resources and spend them on the poorest sections of society. The money needs to be spent on housing, education, jobs and investment. A three-pronged attack on poverty is the only way to address this matter once and for all.</P>
      <P>I get angry when I hear people talking about the wealth in our economy but forgetting about the sections of society that have been left behind by the Celtic tiger. I am talking about the many areas in this city and particularly on the north side where on some streets 52% of the children are not even ready for primary school. The gap between the average middle-class child and the children in these streets is so big that they are way behind. Some 26% of those children are living in homes with major issues of dampness and serious disadvantage. In some parts of the country 31% of children are showing major dysfunctional behaviour problems before starting school or once they get into the system. These issues also concern the teaching council. I link the debate on the teaching council to respect for teachers, the value of education and the importance of investment in the broader society.</P>
      <P>I strongly welcome the Teaching Council (Amendment) Bill, which is progressive. The formation of the teaching council was a positive move, particularly in terms of the equality issue. The purpose of the Bill is to correct a legislative difficulty concerning the teaching council. The issue relates to the Minister&rsquo;s power to make regulations governing the first election of members to the teaching council in circumstances where the relevant applicable provisions of the Teaching Council Act 2001 had not been commenced. The Bill will declare that the requirement in the 2001 Act to commence the relevant sections will not serve to invalidate the regu<Col N="1801"/>lations made by the Minister on 10 September 2004 in respect of the first election of members to the teaching council or anything done under those regulations. It is important we get that right and that it is done properly.</P>
      <P>Section 2 provides that a number of sections of the Teaching Council Act 2001 are deemed to have come into operation on the date they were made, that is, 10 September 2004. The sections relate to the 2001 Act&rsquo;s Short Title and commencement, interpretation, the making of regulation and orders under that Act, the legal status and objects of the council, its membership, and the election and appointment of members.</P>
      <P>In dealing with issues concerning the teaching council, it is important that we examine the question of professionalism in teaching. There have been attacks on teachers and education in other countries, and we have seen the dumbing down and the devastation of many schools in other societies. I am concerned that we are going down that road. We must ensure that we attract quality people who are interested in teaching into the profession and then maintain the highest standards in terms of suitability.</P>
      <P>It is important to nail on the head the fact that being a good teacher is not just related to the points issue. Some people take the view that if a person gets so many hundred points, that is sufficient to be a good teacher but that is not the reality in the teaching world. I welcome the fact that men and women in their 30s and 40s have gone back to college because they discovered an interest in education. Those people will bring a new insight to education and to working with and understanding children.</P>
      <P>The old system &mdash; we are often critical of some of the systems that operated in the past &mdash; was a progressive one. It was not just a question of getting so many honours; there was also a very sticky interview to be undergone. I recall doing the interview for St. Patrick&rsquo;s College after getting the so-called call to training, which in those days was a major honour. If somebody in a town or village got a call to training, it was like winning the All-Ireland. When someone got the call to training, they went to Dublin and were interviewed by psychologists, teachers and educationalists who decided whether the person was suitable to work in the primary education service. That was a good system because it gave another dimension to ensuring the right people went into teaching. There has been a debate about vetting but that was an important stage in determining people&rsquo;s suitability to work in education. The old system was an important one. I accept people must have basic academic standards but we also need people who value the job and the children with whom they work. The must enjoy the job. The main complaint of those who worked in the job but dropped out of the system was that they did not enjoy the job.</P><Col N="1802"/>
      <P>At the same time, tens of thousands of people in the system currently enjoy the job but there are the cynics and the whingers on the ditch who give out about them and talk about long holidays, short working days and so on, which is a load of rubbish when one considers the amount of work done in the school day to provide education. A good teacher is like an actor. They are on stage for five or six hours every day. One can see the exhaustion on the face of an actor who has performed a play for two hours. It is important that we understand the same applies to teachers.</P>
      <P>The idea of a teaching council is to be welcomed. We must also welcome the professionalism needed in the job and develop that. I welcome also the Minister&rsquo;s recent proposal to get more males involved in education because there is an imbalance in that regard. We must ensure we achieve the appropriate balance in education. We all have a responsibility to highlight that teaching is an enjoyable profession and reasonably well paid now. It is a job that many men should consider. That is important. I welcome the Teaching Council Bill. There has been great support for it from the various teachers&rsquo; unions and for dealing with the issue of the quality and professionalism of teachers. We all want to develop the system.</P>
      <P>I am aware the Minister is prioritising disadvantage and children with special needs as part of her focus over her term as Minister for Education and Science, and I welcome that, but she cannot fudge the class size issue. She must tackle that problem head on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>We are tackling it this year and next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I am putting that down as a marker.</P>
      <P>In focusing funds on disadvantage and children with disabilities, it is important the Minister also prioritises early education if we are serious about tacking problems at pre-school and junior infant level. That is where resources and money should be targeted and that is where the Minister will make a difference. It is important that we focus the resources, services and back-up teams in those areas.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s recent announcement that she proposed to add a number of schools to the disadvantaged schools list, which I understand is now 750, that will get additional resources and money. Since that announcement, however, a number of schools not included in the list contacted me and I urge the Minister to examine the position of those schools. It is not acceptable that schools with 80% and 90% of children from disadvantaged homes are not getting the same resources and support as other schools. I emphasise that important aspect.</P>
      <P>I welcome and support the legislation. It reflects the view of most people with an interest <Col N="1803"/>in the education service, be they politicians, teachers or parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank my colleagues for their support in taking the Bill and their support for the teaching profession generally, which was my former profession. When Deputy McGrath talked about the need for more males in the classroom I am sure he is not wishing himself back in the classroom after the next election, nor would we wish that upon him. This is a good opportunity for us to talk about the work of schools and teachers, particularly in the context of a teaching council, the result of which will be to enhance the status of teachers and teaching throughout the country in an already well-respected profession.</P>
      <P>Specific issues that have been raised regarding the teaching council include the question of vetting, which is an important issue for the education service generally. Many discussions and negotiations have taken place between my Department and the Garda vetting unit to determine how we can progress this area and decide on the first group of people to be vetted in an expanded service. We will come forward with proposals on that shortly. The improved capacity of the vetting service in Thurles means it will now be able to cater for far more people, and we are working closely with the people involved in that regard.</P>
      <P>On the fitness to teach question raised by Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan, specific requirements are laid out in the legislation as to how that should be addressed. It is dealt with under &ldquo;fitness to teach&rdquo; in Part 5 of the Act. The interaction between the Department of Education and Science and the teaching council means that all local mechanisms and procedures must have been exhausted before it gets to the level of the teaching council. Following that, the definition of &ldquo;professional misconduct&rdquo;, for example, is specifically set out. It is defined as conduct contrary to the code of professional conduct as established by the teaching council, engaging in any improper conduct in his or her professional capacity or otherwise by reason of which he or she is unfit to teach. The current procedures under the Education Act must be exhausted first, and the process then works its way through the teaching council.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>It is for those reasons and the type of legislation in place, and the requirements that are upon them in the teaching council, which are of a serious nature, that it has taken so long to reach its establishment date because from the day it is established, it is operational. It is responsible and has to be able to do what is set out under the legislation. By setting it up last year, a full year in advance, the teaching council was allowed do the preparatory work I outlined so that as soon as the establishment date arrives, hopefully at the end of next month or so, it will be in a position to <Col N="1804"/>deal with it. That time allowed us to recruit an excellent director in &Aacute;ine Lalor who is giving tremendous direction and leadership to the council. The council is a hugely important initiative for the teaching profession. There are many professions that seek self regulation. It is a great challenge for people to ensure they are balancing the rights of the teachers in schools to fair procedures and processes against the rights of a child or student to an education, that they are ensuring the status and enhancement of the profession and all the other regulations laid out for them.</P>
      <P>We all recognise the role of the teacher in the community. Deputy Crowe is correct. I spoke with the two school principals in Firhouse yesterday and heard from them the work they are now dealing with on the ground in the face of such a terrible tragedy in that community. The way they are able to respond in such a professional yet sympathetic way to the needs of the community and the children in their schools has to be commended. They too, like Deputy Crowe, commended the inspectorate, NEPS and the whole support structure that comes into play. I will certainly pass on his kind comments because it is in such circumstances that everybody needs to rally round. It proves yet again that the school is a focal point in the community. I saw it happen in Navan and in individual cases where pupils, parents, and past pupils rallied to the school as the centre of their support structure. It is hugely important that those teachers and those schools should continue to be supported.</P>
      <P>The teaching council is another element in that support and in providing the regulation and so on. I look forward to addressing the lacuna. The prize for the best bilingual joke I have ever heard goes to Deputy Crowe. I look forward to the Bill being passed today, le c&uacute;namh D&eacute;.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no disrespect for the Minister for Education and Science and her ability to respond but it may be better to wait until the Minister appears.</P>
      <P>I had just started on the last occasion the Bill was before the House. I have a built-in sensitivity in regard to the words &ldquo;control&rdquo;, &ldquo;navigation&rdquo; and so on because we live in a world where control seems to grow and grow. There are a number of issues I would like to see dealt with. The interests of those who use airlines on a daily basis should be kept to the fore, as opposed to the interests of bureaucrats, administrators and dis<Col N="1805"/>tributors of information who do so on a need to know basis, that is, their determination of what one needs to know. In such a situation it should be the customer&rsquo;s determination of what he or she needs to know and it should not be at the behest of bureaucrats or administrators.</P>
      <P>One area I hope the Bill deals with is a matter raised in a recent TV programme. I saw in a recent TV expos&eacute; of a particular airline where people were expected to sit on the tarmac for two hours and wait. I hate to say this but it did not require an expos&eacute; to bring that issue to the fore. That has happened to many people in respect of all airlines from time to time, not just one airline, Ryanair. It has happened at Dublin Airport on countless occasions where people have had to wait for a slot through Air Traffic Control from the UK and go through considerable inconvenience. I was amazed that in the recent TV expos&eacute; it was deemed extraordinary that passengers were exposed to unusual hardship as a result of this, as it happens all the time. It does not happen with the Government jet but it happens to other aircraft. Let us be clear that particular issue was aired and broadcast for a particular effect. The people who produced that programme could go back again and examine all aspects of air traffic control and air traffic management or the situation whereby people have had to wait on the tarmac for up to two and three hours. I hope that issue will be dealt with in a way that ensures passengers are not treated in that fashion.</P>
      <P>Another matter that needs to be brought to public attention is the ever-growing concern about safety. We all realise that air traffic control and management is a huge issue. We recognise there should be some means of regular monitoring of the swings and balances in place to protect human life and those who use the system as opposed to the protection of a system. We need to keep in mind that aircraft are getting bigger and are able to carry more passengers. The most recent construction from the aircraft industry will carry more people than ever before. We are talking about a huge liability in terms of safety so far as passengers using the aircraft are concerned. The time to do things is not after the event. All the necessary procedures should be put in place before the event to ensure the optimum safety requirements are met. All the training in respect of crews should be met in such a way as to ensure we cover ourselves in the event of a tragic event arising.</P>
      <P>We have all had examples of Irish passengers being stranded abroad, particularly at holiday time. Here I refer to chartered aircraft where it is not unusual for passengers to be stranded abroad for a day and a night and sometimes two or three days and nights for one reason or another. In some cases it is due to a dispute, overbooking or quick turn-around and inability to do the turn-around in the shortest possible time. Without mentioning any airline I revert to the <Col N="1806"/>recent TV programme that attempted to reflect poorly on what is essentially a busy low-fares Irish airline.</P>
      <P>Most of the critical issues raised in the programme have affected every airline in the world at one time or another, and some to a greater extent than the airline that was the subject of the programme.</P>
      <P>The question of overbooking applies not just to one airline but to many, and contempt for passengers by the industry in cases of overbooking is well known. I have not experienced this while flying with our national airline, but suffice it to say that all the issues brought to the fore in the programme are not unusual. Regard should be had for the need to uphold the highest possible safety standards.</P>
      <P>Landing fees and route charges contribute to the cost of flying and greatly inhibit the development of a proper air transport system in and between countries. I do not wish to elaborate on the various problems in this regard, but we know and have spoken about them. Landing charges and other route charges that affect the cost to the consumer inhibit the ability of airlines to deliver a quality product to consumers. All such issues need to be borne in mind and dealt with, but not at the expense of safety. If this could be done, it would make a great difference.</P>
      <P>On the question of landing slots and flight plans, I do not know how much better circumstances will be after the passage of this legislation, in spite of its being important to co-ordinating the methodology for dealing with air traffic. Let us hope that when it is implemented, any problems that arise or are seen to arise will be dealt with effectively and on the basis of experience.</P>
      <P>I am sure we have all been on flights during which there have been worrying incidents. I remember having one such experience quite a long time ago. When I was younger and had more time on my hands, for my sins I learned to fly an aeroplane and therefore had a little knowledge of what was happening during the crisis. Nobody ever informed the passengers about what had happened. The incident was ignored and nobody said there had been a close call or acknowledged that the passengers got a shock. The pilot did not request over the tannoy that passengers relax or state there had been a minor transmission problem, or whatever it was. Incidents occur occasionally that are not necessarily in accord with what should happen.</P>
      <P>On the legislation affecting air traffic control, we should learn from experience, not only where incidents are reported but also where incidents that are obvious to somebody somewhere are not recorded. All incidents are supposed to be recorded in a specific way. I do not want to point the finger at those who were responsible for the incident I experienced and will therefore elaborate no further. Suffice it to say that no one airline has a monopoly on safety. They all try to do a <Col N="1807"/>reasonably good job and should be commended on doing so.</P>
      <P>As an island nation, we need to focus on our means of transport and recognise that air travel is one of the quickest and most efficient ways of getting on and off an island. Therefore, the development of our airports is especially important. We can do much more in this regard, including at Donegal and Derry airports and all the other airports in that part of the country which will be particularly well known to the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher. A great burden in terms of travelling time and stress could be alleviated if a properly integrated transport system were introduced. Use should be made of downtime, during which airports such as Dublin Airport are less crowded than they are normally.</P>
      <P>The Weston Aerodrome has been a contentious issue in my constituency. It is an airport of long standing but has been subject to problems recently because of an alleged failure to recognise certain codes and standards. In the Weston Aerodrome, as with every other airport, all standard procedures and practices should be adhered to. The air navigation authorities need to recognise that if a query is raised, they should address it on the basis of the need to respond to what could potentially become a safety issue. I devoted considerable time and energy to getting information on the Weston Aerodrome, but it does not always come that easily. The rules and regulations that normally apply should apply at all times. There were local protests at the Weston Aerodrome and people were flying kites to discourage aircraft from landing. I do not condone this as it gives rise to a safety issue. No protestor should potentially threaten the lives of others, regardless of their purposes.</P>
      <P>There is a need to free up access to check-in facilities at airports. This could be done in a variety of ways. We spend a great deal of time queuing in traffic <i>en route</i> to Dublin Airport, and probably spend more time doing so than flying to destinations on the Continent. It must be possible to find a means of checking in at a location outside the airport. For instance, the check-in facility at some of the continental airports may be five miles from the terminal, and one travels from the facility to the terminal by electric car, coach or other means. One does not have to be beside the aircraft when checking in for a flight. One could check in elsewhere and meet all security requirements as long as there is no interference with the transport system used to take one to the terminal. I believe Frankfurt Airport has a very sophisticated rapid transport system operating from the check-in area to the terminal, which may be ten miles away.</P>
      <P>Sometimes when an aircraft lands and reaches the hangar, an elevated staircase is used to allow passengers to disembark. Sometimes, however, coaches drive onto the tarmac to collect them, <Col N="1808"/>thus allowing them to leave quickly and go about their business. This does not always happen, however. Sometimes one has to wait out on the tarmac because there is a shortage of coaches. When one is brought back in, one has to wait at the baggage reception area. I wonder whether sufficient time has been spent evaluating the degree to which baggage reclaim and handling systems at airports could be improved. I note that one airline is giving priority to bags carried by hand and stowed in overhead compartments. That is a good thing.</P>
      <P>I am always worried when preparing to check in that a group of 25 or more people, each with approximately 400 pieces of baggage to be checked in individually, will arrive at the desk just before me. I can never understand why people are allowed to bring such heavy baggage on the airplane. We all know we have to ensure that our baggage complies with the maximum weight regulations. It is not unusual to see people of certain nationalities &mdash; perhaps I should not say that &mdash; with a multiplicity of bags. The only conclusion I can reach is that there must be nothing is the bags because if there was any kind of weight in them, the airplane would not get off the ground. I suggest that business people who use airlines should bring the minimum amount of baggage. It is not necessary to drag tonnes of gear on such trips. Perhaps one would need a great deal of baggage if one was making a film, but there is no need to bring the whole house when one is going on an ordinary business trip.</P>
      <P>On the effectiveness of this Bill, I hope Eurocontrol will be of benefit to this country. If one is leaving this nation one has to go by air or sea, whereas people in almost every other country in Europe can travel to other countries by road or rail. In light of our experiences with tunnels, I am loath to suggest that we should develop an international tunnel system. I have sympathy for the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, who has inherited responsibility for the Dublin Port tunnel from his predecessor. The first thing he will have to do is buy an umbrella. He might also need the waders he used in his last job because our experience of tunnels is not very reassuring. I do not doubt that the Minister of State will rise to the occasion by using his ability to tackle problems of this nature. I remind him to keep well above the water as it pours down in litres through the damaged tunnel membrane. I am helping and encouraging the Minister of State by tipping him off about a couple of issues which are likely to cause problems for him.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill before the House. I hope it will benefit this country&rsquo;s air traffic management and control systems. I hope it will help to meet the needs of those of us who are citizens of an island nation. Most other European people do not have such needs. I emphasise that aspect of the legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) Bill 2005, which will improve and modernise the European air traffic control management system. I observed significant changes when I worked in air traffic control at Dublin Airport between 1971 and 1979. There have been further changes in the 1990s and in this decade. I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, who is promoting this legislation. It is clear from his comments that he has a good grasp of this issue. Anyone who visits the air traffic control facilities at Dublin, Shannon or Cork airports will see that, unlike in the 1970s, the Government now recognises the need to invest on a regular basis in air traffic control procedures and work practices. When I think of the early 1970s, I remember the poor equipment that was used by air traffic control personnel. Those who are currently in charge of the control services at Dublin, Shannon, Cork and Knock airports are people with whom I started working in 1971. It is a tribute to the training programmes in the Irish system that people in their 40s or early 50s are now in charge of the services in question. I refer to people like Mr. Eamonn O&rsquo;Malley, who is in charge of the service at Knock Airport; Mr. John McGrath, who works at Shannon Airport; Mr. P. J. Walsh and Mr. Donie Mooney, who have senior positions in the air traffic service; Mr. Tom Quinn, who works at Dublin Airport; Mr. Norman Lynch; Mr. Tom Mageedy and Mr. Terry Traynor. They were trained in the 1970s by Irish people who had seen service during the Second World War and who brought their expertise to the Irish air traffic control system and passed it on to the present incumbents.</P>
      <P>We often take for granted the huge strides which have been made in air traffic control services in this State. It is worth remembering that a few years ago, air traffic separation at Dublin Airport relied totally on primary radar. The air traffic controller in possession relied on the signal being picked up on the field and transmitted to the radar screen. Quite often, the signal was not brought back to the site in poor weather conditions or if other difficulties intervened. Members will understand that substantial problems developed in such circumstances. It should be recognised that Government investment has ensured that air navigation aids such as radar equipment have improved at Dublin Airport and throughout the entire air traffic control service. Nobody foresaw the huge increase in air traffic. Just 1 million passengers passed through Dublin Airport in 1979, but approximately 10 million passengers are expected to do so this year. It is clear that there has been a huge increase in air traffic. I estimate that the number of landings and take-offs has increased by five times since 1979. Air traffic control personnel have been properly trained during that time to meet the substantially increased demand. Such personnel are not inclined to speak about their jobs, but I feel <Col N="1810"/>obliged to remind the House of the need to give them every support. We should continue to monitor the significant increases in the air traffic management workload and be prepared for further increases and the problems which might arise as a result.</P>
      <P>I was invited to Dublin Airport by my former colleagues last April for the official opening of the new control tower and centre. I was delighted to hear at first hand that there is no shortage of Government investment in the Irish air traffic control services. I do not say that as a Government backbencher who is trying to pl&aacute;m&aacute;s his senior colleagues. If anyone who was familiar with the services in the 1970s visits the air traffic control centres now in place, he or she will realise that improvements have quite properly taken place. All of our airfields now benefit from the most modern air navigation aids, as well as the most up-to-date computerised secondary surveillance radar and supports. I am delighted to maintain regular contact with my former colleagues and to see many improvements being made. I am particularly pleased that the air traffic control service has recruited some women. It is good that workers can now be promoted to positions of responsibility after two or three years of service. One would have had to wait for eight or nine years in the 1970s. The decision to move air traffic control out of the Civil Service and into the semi-State sector in 1994 was wise. Many of the senior air traffic controllers working today in Eurocontrol in Brussels and Luxembourg were people whom I joined in 1971.</P>
      <P>This Bill will help prevent delays throughout the air traffic control network in Europe. An estimated 350,000 flight hours a year are wasted due to inefficient air traffic management. The thinking behind the Bill is to ensure safety, efficiency and more importantly, a regular gauge on the service and its personnel. References have been made to time-slot delays and I remember, from my days working in Dublin Airport in the 1970s, the difficulties arising when aircraft were given time-slots to take off. There may have been a number of reasons that the aircraft could not make its take-off slot and it would often have to remain on the tarmac for an hour or more. In the heat of the summer, that would cause much frustration. The purpose of the Bill is to reduce these inefficiencies and delays and to make better use of limited airspace and limited time. While the standard separation criteria of five miles lateral or 1,000 feet vertical is all very well, we must remember that with the growing number of aircraft, there is always a temptation to reduce these separation limits. It is something we should always monitor.</P>
      <P>The Bill is also about improved safety and modernising Eurocontrol. Over the last few years, we have witnessed major agreements and treaties between EU and non-EU countries. For example, improvements in police policy have <Col N="1811"/>occurred as Interpol is a recognition of the need to bring together the thinking within different states. As a natural follow-on, we should also deal with the organisation that deals with control of the growing number of aircraft. Eurocontrol is the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation. Its primary objective is to develop a seamless air traffic control management system for air traffic across Europe. I welcome the Bill. It is timely that we deal with the ever increasing numbers using air traffic control.</P>
      <P>From my days at training school, I recall a sign hanging on the wall, put there by the instructor at the school at the time, the late Tom Donovan, which read &ldquo;eternal vigilance is the price of safety&rdquo;. It surely was in the 1970s and it certainly is now. We support the Eurocontrol convention and its provisions, but this is not about losing control of our airspace. The objectives of this Bill do not prejudice the principle that every state has complete sovereignty over its airspace, nor the capacity of each state to exercise its prerogatives with regard to securing and defending its natural airspace. The accession of the EU to Eurocontrol has brought about co-operation between the two organisations and must be welcomed for a number of reasons, such as the implementation of the single European sky directive, for research and development and for data collection and analysis in the areas of air traffic statistics, satellite navigation and international co-operation in the fields of aviation. The proposed single European sky is something we should all welcome.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provisions of the Bill, congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, who has taken this initiative, and congratulate the Government on its continued levels of investment in air traffic control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>As a member of the Joint Committee on Transport and as a Deputy whose constituency borders Dublin Airport, I welcome this Bill and I congratulate the Minister of State for bringing it before us. I congratulate the management of Aer Lingus and its new CEO, Dermot Mannion, on the purchase of two new Airbus aircraft for long-haul flights. That is a very welcome development in the constituency I represent. Naturally, it will lead to the creation of additional jobs.</P>
      <P>From my reading, the Bill is of a technical nature but, nonetheless, it is important and should come into force without delay. Any Bill dealing with safety is obviously of paramount importance and should be dealt with by the House with the utmost seriousness.</P>
      <P>The Bill will allow Ireland to ratify certain changes to the international convention which effectively established the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation in 1960. It is not surprising the convention would need to be updated because significant changes have <Col N="1812"/>occurred in the air transport and navigation sector in that period, particularly in terms of the growth of the industry, the greater number of aircraft in Europe, the increased number of flights and the increased number of passengers travelling. This growth in aviation is due to the significant growth of the economies of Europe, which makes us all better off, while globalisation has been a further significant factor.</P>
      <P>Eurocontrol has a long history and has served Europe well in co-ordinating air traffic for over 40 years. It has 35 member states. Its primary objective is the development of European air traffic management. Eurocontrol develops, co-ordinates and plans the implementation of short, medium and long-term pan-European air traffic management strategies and associated action plans. It partakes in a collective effort that involves national authorities, air navigation service providers, civil and military airspace users, airports, industry, professional organisations and the relevant European institutions.</P>
      <P>I hope the increased powers that the revised convention will give to Eurocontrol to assist it in its key role as the co-ordinator of European air traffic control will help to address Europe&rsquo;s worsening air traffic problems. Deputies are familiar with the delays which are often encountered at this country&rsquo;s airports. We have not been helped by our delay in making a decision on the construction of a second terminal at Dublin Airport. Air traffic delays are a tiresome burden for passengers, frustrate the expansion and efficient operation of airlines, lead to additional costs for airlines and create losses for the national economy. I welcome legislation which helps to address such problems by facilitating better and more effective pan-European co-operation in air traffic management.</P>
      <P>The unprecedented expansion in the business of low-cost carriers in recent years seems to have made air traffic problems worse. The EU Commission has argued that some air traffic delays can be attributed to the manner in which airspace is organised in Europe. The Commission has argued that the problem is linked to European fragmentation along the lines of national boundaries. Such divisions make air traffic delays and air traffic congestion much worse than they need to be, thereby highlighting the need for better coordination and forward planning, services which Eurocontrol is best placed to provide.</P>
      <P>The EU&rsquo;s open skies deal with the US has been the subject of much discussion in recent months. I urge the Minister to make progress on the deal for the renegotiation of the bilateral agreement of the US, which offers tremendous opportunities for Ireland. I do not believe we should lose out to other European states in that regard, although I recognise that Shannon Airport is a particularly sensitive issue that has been discussed for some time. I agree with the Commission statement that Europe cannot retain frontiers in the sky, given <Col N="1813"/>that it has abolished them on the ground for free movement and free trade.</P>
      <P>One of the most significant changes to the convention that is being made in the revised convention before the House is provided for in the article that allows for the expansion of Eurocontrol&rsquo;s authority to include airport taxiways and runways as well as the areas which are <i>en route.</i> The article also provides for increased research and improved co-ordination of elements of air traffic management. The revised convention before the House will permit greater co-operation between Eurocontrol and other European institutions. It will introduce European air traffic management performance review and target-setting systems. It also strives to create a more efficient decision-making process within the Eurocontrol commission, based on majority voting and the reinforcement of co-operation between civil and military authorities.</P>
      <P>Eurocontrol has made important changes to its administrative and deliberative structures by allowing for the establishment of a provisional council, which will be the organisation&rsquo;s central deliberative body. The council will be instrumental in implementing the expanded activities permitted under the revised convention.</P>
      <P>While this growth is welcome, it brings certain difficulties for those organisations charged with the responsibility for ensuring that air navigation is carried out safely. The Government clearly indicated the wastage that takes place at present and the inability to get the best from the available airspace and air slots. However, if we ensure the Bill is put in place, we can move to a point where we can get the most from our skies. Despite what is thought about the size and scope of our skies, the number of flight paths is limited. It is important that proper management systems that cross individual state boundaries are utilised in an effective and efficient manner to ensure we continue to grow this sector in line with the growth of economies across Europe and the world, and in particular to allow the continued globalisation to which we all refer.</P>
      <P>It is agreed that safety is of paramount importance. Despite the large increase in aircraft movements and passengers travelling, air transport is the safest method of transport. This is highlighted by the carnage on our roads. If the numbers travelling on land are compared with those travelling by air, despite the complexities associated with aviation, air travel is safer than road travel. It is important that the highest standards are maintained to ensure that air travel remains at the top in safety standards.</P>
      <P>As an island nation, the dependence on air connectivity is of vital economic importance to Ireland. Therefore, safety standards are essential. Real challenges are potentially emerging as more airlines compete for business. We know of the changes in the market, especially in the past ten years but more specifically in the past three to <Col N="1814"/>five years, due to the emergence of the low cost carriers. However, low cost cannot and should not mean low safety standards. We must be clear on this point. The Government has a particular role to ensure through national legislation that safety standards are maintained despite the necessity to force down prices, costs and charges. This is being achieved through the aviation authority, Eurocontrol.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and thank the Minister for bringing it to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Gallagher, on his appointment. It is an important mission for him given that he is a west of Ireland man. He will definitely take into account the needs of the people of the west in approaching his portfolio. I wish him every success.</P>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to speak on the Bill. As most speakers have noted, the Bill concerns the safety of passengers travelling by air, which is now of paramount importance as the business of aviation has changed in recent years. The arrival of low cost airlines has changed the aviation scene in that people travel more, to areas to which they never travelled before and at a younger age. It has been said about one of the low cost carriers in Ireland that people will go anywhere if the price is right. This is what has happened. We all remember the high prices of the past but they have been reduced owing to the arrival of low cost carriers and competition in the airline business, which has changed much since 11 September 2001.</P>
      <P>While I do not watch much television, I recently watched some interesting National Geographic programmes on airline safety which showed what happens in the cockpit of an aeroplane and the few seconds that can make a difference to a flight. The programmes detailed several incidents over the years where safety was jeopardised owing to causes such as pilot error, control tower error and mechanical failure. Two to three years ago, when Deputy Brennan was Minister for Transport and the Irish Aviation Authority opened its new headquarters at Shannon Airport, I had an opportunity to tour the control centre and see how aeroplanes are tracked across the Atlantic Sea by the air traffic controllers. I commend these staff, who do a skilful job to ensure aeroplanes, not only Irish aeroplanes but all aeroplanes travelling across the Atlantic to Europe, arrive at their destination in safety and that all is in order as they cross the country. I was impressed by the modern equipment and the data display at Shannon Airport.</P>
      <P>We have come a long way in regard to aircraft safety since airlines were first established in the 1930s and 1940s. As a Deputy representing Clare, I recently read a book on the area which showed that Shannon was an important area for aircraft crossing the Atlantic as most had to land there. <Col N="1815"/>A number of accidents occurred over the years because the aeroplanes were not as technically advanced as those of today. One such incident involved air traffic control. An aeroplane landed in the mud at Rineanna, as the airport was then known, but nobody knew it had crashed until the following morning although many people died. Much has changed since then. Fortunately, modern aircraft, whether Boeing or Airbus, are no longer involved in many accidents and are very safe.</P>
      <P>The Bill gives effect to the 1960 international convention relating to co-operation for the safety of air navigation, the subsequent 1997 protocol and the agreed accession protocol in 2002. With my party, I support the Bill and hope it has a speedy passage through the Houses. However, the Minster might be aware that Fine Gael will table amendments which, while not affecting the purpose or character of the Bill, will tackle the issue of Eurocontrol fees, to which other speakers referred, so that the operator of an aircraft rather than the owner is liable for such fees. The situation which pertains in the Bill has been compared to a car rental owner being liable for speeding fines or parking fees incurred by the operator of such a car. In this regard, I draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to the amendment tabled by my party colleague in the Seanad, Senator Paddy Burke, whose proposed subsection relating to this issue reads:</P>
      <P LI="1">Nothing in this section shall create a liability on the owner of an aircraft unless that owner was also the operator of the aircraft at the time the charge was incurred, except where the owner is unable to establish that some other person was the operator at that time. The Minister should agree this is a sensible amendment and look at it carefully on Committee Stage. If it is adopted, it will make life easier for some leasing companies.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The issue of aviation is close to my heart. As a person living close to Shannon Airport I am used to aircraft flying over my house and over the years I have had an interest in aviation. Shannon has a significant history in aviation. The GPA group was succeeded by the AerFi group, part of the AerCap group, which is one of the world&rsquo;s largest aircraft leasing groups and is based in Shannon. This demonstrates how Shannon is steeped in aviation history.</P>
      <P>This amendment and the concerns it raises are part of the broader issue of the powers this Bill confers on Eurocontrol, the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation. Eurocontrol plays a vital role in the regulation of air traffic and in the smooth operation of such traffic under a single European sky. It is a mark of its professionalism that the operation of air traffic within Europe is largely taken for granted by the general public. However, such a deregulation of <Col N="1816"/>markets is an issue which may come again to the fore if the new open skies aviation agreement between the EU and the US, which the Minister hopes will come into effect by November, comes into effect. I doubt it will come to pass by November. I read recently that in the US there is considerable resistance to the new agreement. The deal is contingent on the US Administration easing limits on foreign investment in US airlines so foreign investors can have majority control. There are fears of job losses and aircraft fleet closures throughout the US, fears that have found an echo in Shannon. We know many US fleets are in deep financial trouble and we have already lost great pioneers like Pan Am, TWA and others. Many US airlines are currently in Chapter 11, in deep financial trouble and dependent on the US Government bailing them out, particularly since 11 September 2001.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to request once again that in the light of these fears in the US the Minister should reconsider his decision on the open skies policy. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, to convey to the Minister the importance of an economic impact study in preparation for open skies for the Shannon region. It would not cost too much to carry out this study. While we are ready for the challenge, it is important to carry out an impact study to identify the challenges and how we can prepare for them.</P>
      <P>We in the mid-west find ourselves in an embarrassing situation where the fears being expressed in the US are not just for jobs and airlines, but also extend to the effect open skies would have on the west of Ireland. There is a likelihood that a Bill could be introduced into the US Congress requiring that the US Secretary of State review the effects the introduction of open skies would have on the west of Ireland, thanks to the interest of Congressman Chris Smith who has taken up this issue in Washington. He is active in this regard and is getting great support from across Republican and party lines on the matter of the new EU open skies agreement and the bilateral arrangement. Unless we are prepared, the new agreement will have a detrimental effect on tourism in the west of Ireland if it comes in as planned. This is the reason an impact study is so important.</P>
      <P>Experience in Europe has shown that where open skies have come into place, capital cities are the preferred choice for airlines, which do not want to land at other smaller airports. I urge the Government to reconsider the open skies arrangement, particularly with regard to US carriers. Shannon will have plenty of business during the summer. However, much industry in the area depends on direct services from the US as a back up for cargo and spare parts etc. Dell and many other American companies along the western shoreline depend on the direct service to Shannon. I urge the Minister to reconsider an impact study on what will happen under an open <Col N="1817"/>skies policy. The people in the mid-west and the west are not afraid of it, but they must be prepared for it. The impact study would cost little in comparison to the wastage of taxpayers&rsquo; funds on electronic voting and PPARS. The cost would be insignificant.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the conclusions of a study carried out by Alan Dukes and Frederik Sorensen. This study deals with the issue of public service obligations, PSOs, as related to open skies. The report suggests that certain routes between Shannon and the United States should have PSOs and we should consider this in the light of an open skies situation. The current situation with regard to PSOs only applies to domestic routes.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, Shannon does not have a PSO subsidy because it is an international airport, unlike airports in Donegal and Knock. The current situation in the mid-west is that we do not have a daily direct return service to Dublin. Such a service would be a huge factor in attracting business to the area. We do not have an early morning flight to connect with early morning continental flights and are dependent totally on US flights coming in to pick up passengers in Shannon. Then, after 1 p.m or 2 p.m. it is impossible to get a flight from Dublin to Shannon. I urge the Minister of State to look at this issue in the interest of the region.</P>
      <P>The report by Dukes and Sorensen was commissioned by Ireland&rsquo;s air transport users council and its conclusions are significant. The credentials of the investigators are second to none. The Government should not ignore the report.</P>
      <P>The issue of public service obligation levies brings us to the second outstanding issue for Shannon Airport. Previous speakers referred to the debt of the Dublin Airport Authority, Shannon and Cork. Deputy Dennehy referred to the issue last week and Deputy Martin Brady referred to it earlier. I was happy to hear of his sympathy for Shannon and Cork Airports. What worries me in this regard are comments made in the Seanad last week by my Clare colleague, Deputy Killeen, who took the Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Transport, and answered a question put by Senator Minihan on the debts of Cork Airport.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Shannon Airport has significant concerns in this regard. We know the State Airports Bill 2004 set out the parameters for the break up of Aer Rianta. At the time the Minister stated that from day one both Shannon and Cork airports would be debt free. This commitment was given again by the Minister of the time, Deputy Brennan, in 2003 when he announced the Shannon Airport Authority. He said Shannon would be free from day one and the debt of &euro;70 million would be removed. In reply to several parliamentary questions since then, the same response has been stated, namely that Shannon and Cork Airport Authorities would both commence free of the <Col N="1818"/>legacy of any debt, a significant advantage for them. Sadly matters in this regard have turned sour.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I have deep concerns with regard to the reply given by Deputy Killeen in the Seanad last week. He stated there was a problem with company law, it was a complex matter and that Dublin Airport would make transfers only when it had sufficient reserves available to match the value of the assets being transferred. Dublin Airport has much money and we all realise it is a very important, if overcrowded, airport. Much work needs to be carried out on its terminal buildings and runways. That puts a new spin on the issue.</P>
      <P>The PCW report carried out some time ago, but which was never published, stated that Shannon Airport would have to spend much money on capital infrastructure, be it land-side or air-side facilities. I believe the sum is approximately &euro;35 million. If the &euro;17 million in debt is added to the &euro;35 million that must be spent between now and 2008, it will be a significant burden. I am concerned about this. I would like the Minister of State to go back to his Minister and tell him that the two airports have to start as debt-free concerns.</P>
      <P>A former Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, once stated he had a hunch that a matter would work out. Does the Government have a hunch that this matter will work out as well? What is happening with the two airports is very wrong. There are significant challenges, particularly in the case of Shannon Airport and the open skies agreement, and yet we still meet the debt obstacle. It is worrying.</P>
      <P>We were promised that Aer Rianta International would be left with Shannon Airport as an asset. Assets are very important for the airport, but we do not know if this will happen. Aer Rianta International is a very successful company, making profits in the region of &euro;13 million a year. The same can be said of the decision last week of the Government to sell the Great Southern Hotels chain. The Great Southern in Shannon was one of the most successful hotels in the chain and had a close relationship with the airport. If the hotel is sold, what will a new owner do with these ties to the airport? These are issues I worry about regarding the future of Shannon Airport. We must consider them seriously. We do not want Shannon Airport to be burdened with a large debt. Cork Airport has the same right.</P>
      <P>These are the pertinent issues. I am concerned about them and I hope the Minister of State, in representing the west of the country, will consider these matters. I hope he will take into account the future of Shannon Airport. The Bill will be supported by various other parties. I could discuss other matters, and others will consider military traffic through the airport. On that issue, we should wait to see what the European Parliament and the Council of Europe decide. We must <Col N="1819"/>accept for the moment the assurances of the US Secretary of State, Ms Rice, and the American ambassador, who spoke recently in Trinity College. I will not dwell on that topic.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister of State will take my views on board. Fine Gael welcomes the Bill, particularly with regard to safety, which has been much discussed recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the debate on the Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) Bill 2005. Before I go into the details of the legislation I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, on his new appointment, and wish him well on his new transport portfolio. I ask him to keep an eye on a major infrastructure project in my area, the Dublin Port tunnel, and particularly the needs of residents and public safety issues in the tunnel. He should not take it personally when I raise these issues inside or outside the D&aacute;il, and he should not be as sensitive as previous holders of his office. The tunnel now exists. We wish to ensure that people are compensated for damage to their homes, and we also want to deal with the cracks and flooding issue.</P>
      <P>This debate is important, as there are major changes every day in our society, especially in air traffic, air traffic control and flights generally. It is now a major issue in Irish society and for the development of the country as a nation and an economic unit. Air navigation, flights and aeroplanes and all matters to do with the industry are very important. There is also a strong international dimension.</P>
      <P>Taking into account the valuable work of those involved in air traffic control and the responsibility they hold, it is clear we should take the matter seriously. We must support these people, as it is a difficult but responsible job, especially when one considers the volume of traffic involved compared to 20 years ago. Along with air traffic control and the aviation industry, we should remind ourselves of health and safety matters. I will return to this point later in the debate. In debating air safety, or narrowing the focus to cheap air flights, there can be no shortcuts, even if it costs extra to ensure maximum public safety. That is where the buck stops. I hope we will focus on such issues. There appears to be a debate on whether shortcuts can be used to reduce cost while leaving everything okay. That is not a reality, and people should be conscious of this.</P>
      <P>In discussing the aviation industry, it is important to respect and listen to the people directly involved, specifically unions in airports, air navigation and the broader aviation industry. Up to this point there has been a bad record of the treatment by senior management in some of these industries. Ministers also appear to have an attitude problem with regard to unions. People in the private business community also need to come into the real world. In 2006, everybody in <Col N="1820"/>these industries should work together and respect each other&rsquo;s position. This is particularly relevant for staff who have a deep knowledge of the issue.</P>
      <P>I wish to discuss Dublin Airport, a very important hub on the northside of Dublin, which we should consider in a realistic fashion. We should consider the airport in its entirety and deal with overcrowding. We should wake up to the reality that radical changes are needed. We should respect the needs of people living close to the airport, particularly on the northside, relating to issues such as noise pollution. Parts of my constituency are directly affected by Dublin Airport. We should respect the environment and the community, and we should have a common sense approach to the economic development of the State and Dublin city.</P>
      <P>In discussing an air navigation Bill such as this, it is important not to leave out Aer Lingus. It is important to acknowledge the significant contribution to Irish society made by Aer Lingus over many years. I commend those who have been involved in the company over the years. Many of us have family members who have worked there and we could see at first hand the job security and family stability provided by the company, particularly in times such as the 1980s when the Celtic tiger did not exist and the economy was on a downturn.</P>
      <P>Thousands of people in Aer Lingus made a significant contribution to Irish society. It is important to recognise the valuable contribution from staff and others involved with the company for many years. In dealing with changes, staff should be brought along and issues must be dealt with for the positive development of the air industry in general.</P>
      <P>It is important to discuss Shannon Airport in the context of this Bill. It is an international airport that needs to be supported and developed, as do the surrounding regions. There is a serious question on whether we will allow Shannon Airport to be used for the war in Iraq and there is an issue regarding prisoners coming through the airport. The Government has questions to answer on this issue. It should search those aeroplanes to find out what is going on.</P>

	<P>Ireland is recognised internationally and so is the Government&rsquo;s role in this issue.</P>
      <P>Whenever there is a discussion about the aviation industry the subject of terrorism arises. One issue which many in this country have heard of is that of the Miami Five where five Cubans who were trying to stop Miami-based terrorist <Col N="1821"/>groups from carrying out violent actions against the people of Cuba were found guilty of charges ranging from murder to espionage by a court in Miami which relied on the evidence of convicted terrorists. All are innocent of the charges brought against them and extensive intimidation of jurors by the same terrorists was a feature of the trial. They are appealing their convictions. I have asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs to intervene in this issue as well. I raise the issue because a number of aeroplanes have been bombed by US-based terrorists as part of their war against the Cuban people. I dedicate this campaign to the memory of the 3,478 Cubans killed and the 2,099 maimed at the hands of US-based terrorist groups since 1959. The Miami Five case is a classic case wherein civilians were bombed and the world turned a blind eye. That is not acceptable and I would like to challenge the US on these issues.</P>
      <P>The details of the legislation indicate that the Bill is an Act to give effect to the international convention relating to co-operation for the safety of air navigation, signed at Brussels on 13 December 1960 and consolidated by the protocol signed at Brussels on 27 June 1997, and to amend the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993 for that purpose, and to provide for related matters. That is the basis of the Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) Bill 2005.</P>
      <P>I referred to the importance of airports, including regional ones. We are aware of the very successful story in Knock but that needs continued support. I recently had direct experience of Sligo Airport and the valuable contribution it makes to the development of the area.</P>
      <P>As an island nation we need a proper air service in and out of the country because there are only two ways of getting in and out &mdash; by air and by sea. We need it for our economic and social development and air cargo is an important feature of that. I emphasise that safety must always be at the top of the agenda. Heavy air traffic and overcrowded skies must not cause us to take our eye off the ball and allow safety to lapse. I welcome the debate but I urge caution and more investment in public safety relating to air navigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy McGrath for sharing time. It is a pity that we missed Deputy Brady&rsquo;s contribution. I welcome the former Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and now Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Gallagher, and wish him the best of luck in his new Ministry. Unfortunately for him, he is probably going out of the frying pan and into the fire, because in my experience of ten or 12 years of transport campaigns and debates, this is not an easy area in which to effect positive change. We are starting to pay the price for many years&rsquo; wrong decisions. As an Opposition spokesperson I hope I can work with him in a positive and con<Col N="1822"/>structive manner. Where I have differences with him, I hope I will still be able to be critical in a civil and progressive manner.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to support the introduction of this Bill and agree with its general intent of bringing into our legislation the agreed approach at European level to the proper control and navigation of our skies. That is something all Deputies, regardless of their views on other matters, will welcome. The Bill provides an opportunity, however, to raise a number of issues which will need political attention in future.</P>
      <P>The first issue pertains to the connection between civil and military flights and our control of same. This extends into the wider area of foreign affairs policy. There is genuine and justified concern about the current involvement of this country in supporting a war in Iraq that is not justified, is damaging for all concerned and should end. It behoves us to examine any way, even if small or indirect, in which we support that war. The greatest query should concern the facilitation of overflights, particularly where no charge is made to countries availing of them, and the use of Shannon Airport as a major staging base for the preparation for military affairs in the war between the USA and the Iraqi people.</P>
      <P>I read with interest on pages 21 and 22 of the Bill that there are provisions under the new Eurocontrol centre for navigation for a new civil-military interface standing committee. On page 22 it states that such a committee may delegate the powers to raise matters at any time as part of the general supervision of such overflights. Our party believes, as will have been evident from a series of questions by Deputy Gormley, that powers already exist under other international conventions for us to stop and examine airplanes, be they landing at Shannon or elsewhere, not to disregard the wishes of other nations but to stand by our foreign policy and what the Irish people would like to see. I regret that we have not taken that line and asserted our neutrality and independence. Were we to do so, it would be supported by the Irish people and I do not believe any nation would view that as an inappropriate or hostile act. If it did, it would speak more about its world view than ours. We should not be frightened of doing the right thing just because of the consequences that might flow from it.</P>
      <P>I always avail of the opportunity when speaking on anything to do with aviation to point out the need to be honest about the implications for international transport of the two most serious looming threats to our economic well-being and development as well as to our environmental well-being. One is climate change and the real concern that we are emitting pollutants on a global level which threaten not only to tip the planet into an overheated state but also the very future of mankind. In that, the most significant factor is emissions from transport and the most significant element of those are emissions from aviation in <Col N="1823"/>that they contribute most to the greenhouse effect.</P>
      <P>We cannot ignore that scientific reality. James Lovelock, a very eminent scientist who changed our perception of the planet more than anyone since possibly Charles Darwin, issued a remarkably stark picture of the immediate threat and the need for urgent action to reduce our emissions and pollution. We cannot talk about aviation, about the fact that air traffic is set to double in coming years and that Dublin Airport will go from 16 million passengers now to a projected 30 million in the near future, and not recognise the scientific analysis that acts as an ever more frequent and alarming warning bell. We will have to do something to regulate and decrease the amount of air travel we undertake. That is the scientific reality that needs to be stated, but it is not necessarily a negative reality.</P>
      <P>Many friends and colleagues, who are the type of people IDA Ireland would wish to attract as they work in Europe but are based here, literally have high-flying careers. They fly out from Dublin Airport to Europe at 6 a.m. and return the same day. After doing that for some time, they start to question whether it is a clever way of doing business. Can we not use information technologies to reduce time spent flying, which after a while becomes a burden rather than a luxury? New and positive thinking is needed on reducing the numbers of flights in order to address the long-term issues of climate change and the fact that the kerosene which keeps aircraft in the air will become scarcer than it has been for the past 50 years.</P>
      <P>Further to Deputy McGrath&rsquo;s comments on safety, if we should be concerned to ensure that the system is safe, we will need a co-ordinated air navigation system. The manner by which our common aviation system is kept in the air on a safe basis is a remarkable example of what may be achieved through international co-operation. I have greater concerns with regard to events on the ground. While the development of low cost carriers may be welcome in terms of providing cheap flights, there are increasing concerns that the pressure to keep prices as low as possible may lead to compromises in safety. We should be wary of cutting down on turn around times, staff rosters or control measures in order to shave half a cent of the price of a ticket. It would be a serious mistake in the long term if lives were lost due to poor safety standards. While low cost carriers have been rightly lauded from a consumer viewpoint, we have to be careful to ensure safety comes first in the rush to provide services as cheaply as possible.</P>
      <P>It is remarkable that airline tickets from Cork to Dublin may be bought for one cent, which means, in effect, that only the tax must be paid, whereas a train ticket costs &euro;60. A friend of mine explored the options of either flying or taking a <Col N="1824"/>train to Vienna and found a flight ticket for &euro;150, whereas the train cost in the region of &euro;550. In terms of the emissions and pollution being created by the aviation industry, we will have to start recognising the need for change as a reality. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, rather than lobbying the European Council of Environment Ministers on behalf of Ryanair, will have to be honest for the first time by saying that use, as well as safety and navigation, will have to be controlled. If we can use technology and, in a sense, time to order our lives in a way that protects the quality of our lives and environment, that need not lead to a negative result and that is what I stand for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Naughten, who may speak for up to 20 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>The Acting Chairman spoke as if he was trying to ensure I would reach that target. I will not need 20 minutes to make my points.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on his new appointment and wish him every success. It is great to see someone from our neck of the woods in his Department, although the previous Minister, Deputy Brennan, hailed from Galway. I hope progress will be seen along the western seaboard during the Minister of State&rsquo;s term in office, which, however, will probably be relatively short because he will not have the opportunity to return there after the next election. In the meantime, he has the support of his colleagues from the west in trying to provide investment for that region.</P>
      <P>I want to raise a number of issues, some of which concern the west and others of a more international nature. I hope the Minister of State will take ownership of them in his discussions at European level.</P>
      <P>The variety of authorities which deal with air traffic control within the European Union and Eurocontrol has given rise to a crazy situation. Lives are put at risk on a daily basis because every Eurocontrol member state has its own separate air traffic controls. This problem was typified by an incident on 2 July 2002, when 71 people, many of whom were children, lost their lives in southern Germany in a collision between a Russian passenger jet and a DHL cargo plane. In the few minutes before the accident, three separate air traffic control authorities dealt with the two planes. That is a damning indictment of the current system.</P>
      <P>Currently there are 65 radar centres and 31 systems using 22 different computer networks within the Eurocontrol area. North America has two separate air traffic control providers, whereas the Eurocontrol area has 57. Had a centralised air traffic control system been in place before July 2002, the aforementioned accident would probably not have occurred.</P><Col N="1825"/>
      <P>The European Union&rsquo;s air traffic control maps resemble a jigsaw, which is not the case in the United States. I am glad those maps are not available on aeroplanes because, if they were, people would be much more concerned. Each time flights crossing Europe are transferred between air traffic control sections, mistakes are risked. Such a mistake occurred on 2 July 2002.</P>
      <P>Not only can significant safety benefits be gained in operational techniques, advances in safety equipment and proper planning of routes but the potential exists to open up additional airspace. From a consumer point of view, that would be a positive development because it would solve the serious problems experienced in Europe at present in terms of capacity, especially during summer months. We are aware how chaotic airports often are during the summer, when delays in one part of the EU can cause major delays throughout Europe. A centralised air traffic control system within the European Union could allocate the additional air space capacity currently unavailable due to the jigsaw arrangement in place and would have a significant impact on the cost of transport in Europe because overall travelling times would be reduced and extra slots opened.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State to take ownership of this issue and push it at European level. We have more to gain from this, being on the periphery of Europe, than anyone else because of Shannon Airport, which is one of the key linchpins of air traffic control in the European Union. Shannon Airport covers a large percentage of the air space within the European Union, albeit most of it over water. The air traffic control equipment at Shannon Airport is the most modern and up-to-date in the entire EU. We have the staff and expertise in place and together with one or two other control centres in the EU, we could provide the type of effective service that is needed to benefit the consumer and dramatically improve safety. We should take a lead on this issue.</P>
      <P>I suggested that the former Minister, Deputy Brennan, try to put this on the agenda when he was President of the Council of Transport Ministers but, sadly, my suggestion fell on deaf ears at that time. I now ask the Minister of State, who has just been appointed to the Department and has a new agenda, to set the agenda and examine this issue. It would be of major benefit to Shannon Airport. The Government is trying to downsize Shannon Airport and remove many of the services and facilities available there, but this is something positive that can be done for the airport. I urge the Minister of State to take ownership of the issue. I do not mind if he takes the idea because I would like to see this happen. Major benefits would accrue to everyone.</P>
      <P>Security is an important element of air traffic control. We are all more conscious of security since 11 September 2001, the Madrid bombings and other scares, including the hijacking of aero<Col N="1826"/>planes and so forth. It is vital that we do all we can to reduce security risks within our jurisdiction. Again, I raised with the former Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, the issue of airport police. This is a small issue that is very easily resolved and perhaps it is something the Minister of State will take up because it would have a positive impact on all regional airports.</P>
      <P>At the moment, based on current legislation, the airports at Dublin, Cork and Shannon are the only ones that have airport police. Ireland West Airport and the regional airports do not have an airport police service. However, under section 47 of the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act 1998, the Minister has the power to appoint airport police at all airports in this jurisdiction. That has not happened to date, despite the fact that some of the regional airports have made representations to the Department. I do not know why it has not happened yet.</P>
      <P>The airports in question have security staff and they undoubtedly do an exceptional job. However, unlike the airport police in the State airports, the security staff cannot detain an individual until a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na arrives. That is a major flaw because if a person is acting suspiciously at a regional airport or at Ireland West Airport, the security staff cannot detain that individual. They can telephone the Garda and hope members of the force turn up promptly. If they do not, the individual escapes. That is a major security loophole and its closure is only a matter of exercising the provision made in section 47 of the aforementioned Act. It is a matter of the Minister of State seizing upon it and appointing airport police. Naturally, such airport police would not operate on a full-time basis.</P>
      <P>The success of the regional airports has been based on the flexibility of the staff and their willingness to multi-task in various roles. We need to become more security conscious. The regional airports have sought departmental approval for the appointment of airport police in the past. They should be treated not as second class but in they same way as the State airports.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise the anomaly that exists within the charging structures at regional airports and at Ireland West Airport, specifically landing and take-off fees. The charging structure at the aforementioned airports is different from that which operates in the State airports. Airlines are charged for air traffic control services but that money is not passed back to the local air traffic control units at the regional airports and at Ireland West Airport. None of these airports gets the return. A substantial amount of money is made every year in air traffic control in Ireland, so much so that we can allow many flights to fly over our jurisdiction free of charge, mainly from the United States on the way to the Gulf. Therefore, I do not see why the regional airports, which operate on a shoestring, cannot be provided with funds to which they are entitled. If they provide <Col N="1827"/>a service, they should receive the return from it but that is not happening at present.</P>
      <P>Many of those from both sides of the House who have spoken on this Bill have raised the matter of the privatisation of Aer Lingus. I do not think we can talk about air traffic control without referring to Aer Lingus. However, I wish to confine my comments in this regard to the contents of the Bill and to what I believe is a critical national asset, namely, the slots at Heathrow Airport. Aer Lingus management has argued that those slots are not as important today as they were in the past because it flies directly into many other European airports now. However, the slots are critical because Heathrow is a key airport for providing connectivity to the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>It is important from a business point of view that we have ready access to a key airport like Heathrow. If we privatise Aer Lingus, which the Government is considering, it is critically important that the Heathrow slots are ring-fenced. My understanding is that if we privatise the company in its entirety, such ring-fencing will not be possible. In fairness to the former Minister, Deputy Brennan, he acknowledged this point and accepted a Fine Gael amendment to the Aer Lingus Act which ensures that the Government must clarify its position on the ownership of the strategic national asset that is the slots at Heathrow Airport before it can proceed with the sale of the company.</P>
      <P>I wish to record that point again because everyone accepts now that we made a serious mistake during the disposal of Telecom &Eacute;ireann in letting the copper wire go. That should have remained in State ownership. It was sold off for short-term gain &mdash; a very short-term one for many people &mdash; without the benefit of a strategic gain for the country as a whole, which was disappointing.</P>
      <P>I wish to give the Minister of State some advice, if I can be permitted to, regarding the western rail corridor, which is of critical importance to the development of Ireland West Airport, especially in terms of access. It is great to have such an airport at Knock. The services, amenities and connectivity available there have improved dramatically over recent years, but the access infrastructure is appalling. The road and rail infrastructure needs to be dramatically improved and one key element of that is the western rail corridor, which could provide access from the north west, the mid-west and the midlands to the airport or close by where a shuttle service from Charlestown could be established. Will the Minister of State consider this? It is the only international airport in the State that is treated as a regional airport. There should be a change in the Government&rsquo;s view of Ireland West Airport. It should be treated as an international airport and categorised in the same way as the other airports. It meets international standards and business is increasing dramatically each year. It should not <Col N="1828"/>be grouped with regional airports when it comes to fighting for limited funding. It should be developed. The region surrounding it is critically important to the spatial strategy and it must be prioritised.</P>
      <P>There is controversy over the open skies policy at European level and it will have an impact on Shannon Airport. Ireland West Airport sees the potential that exists and has been developing charter business into the United States in recent years. We cannot rule out bringing people directly to the west of Ireland, a quicker route to Donegal than through Shannon or Dublin. The Minister of State should bear that in mind in the negotiations.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister of State every success in his new brief. He represented the north-western counties in the European Parliament in an exemplary fashion and I hope he will do the same in his new position. I will support anything he does to bring investment to the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate. I carefully noted the issues raised and will try to respond to as many as possible in my reply.</P>
      <P>Deputy Olivia Mitchell and Deputy Boyle raised the issue of the delay in arranging for ratification of the revised convention, which was signed in 1997. Ratification by EU member states was delayed at the request of the Commission pending the formal accession of the EU to Eurocontrol, which took place on 8 October 2002. As Deputies Shortall and Dennehy correctly pointed out, the revised convention will only come fully into force when all 35 member states ratify it. To date, 26 of the 35 Eurocontrol member states have ratified the revised convention. A number of EU member states have yet to ratify the convention and the target for ratification by all member states and entry into force is the end of this year.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Deputy Boyle also referred to the Air Navigation and Transport (Indemnities) Act 2005, which was enacted in July 2005. In common with the other member states, Ireland provided indemnities to the aviation sector when essential insurance cover was withdrawn in 2001. We enacted legislation to provide for this and, in view of the large liabilities involved, we provided a sunset clause which resulted in the legislation expiring at the end of 2002. Unlike in Ireland, a number of the other member states already had suitable legislative arrangements. To be in a position to provide similar cover if essential insurance is again withdrawn from the aviation sector, the Oireachtas enacted legislation in July 2005 which will enable Ireland to issue indemnities for the aviation industry in Ireland. This was necessary because of the expiry of the 2001 legislation and it puts Ireland in a similar situation to the other member states.</P><Col N="1829"/>
      <P>Aviation insurers have withdrawn war and terrorism cover for &ldquo;dirty bomb&rdquo; risks for aircraft hulls. However, airlines have been willing to continue without this cover because it is not compulsory to have it. Third party and passenger liability cover, which is compulsory under EU law, is expected to be withdrawn at some stage this year, although precisely when is not certain. In view of the enactment of the 2005 indemnities Act, Ireland will be ready to respond quickly to that withdrawal.</P>
      <P>Deputy Olivia Mitchell and Deputy Shortall raised the issue of detention and sale of aircraft for unpaid debts and the concerns expressed by some aircraft leasing companies in that regard. Section 4 of the Bill, referred to by Deputy Mitchell, is merely a technical amendment. It in no way changes the existing powers of detention and sale contained in the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993 and the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1998.</P>
      <P>Articles 5 to 9 of annexe IV to the revised convention refer to the issues of attaching the <i>en route </i>charge as a lien on the aircraft, making the operator and owner jointly and severally liable and detention and sale of aircraft to enforce recovery. These provisions are not included in the published Bill. Under the convention, Ireland is under no compulsion to legislate for creation of liens or joint and several liability. Rather, it is at the discretion of each contracting party to introduce domestic law to implement this element of the convention. Passage of this Bill in its current form will not increase our current powers relating to detention and sale of aircraft for unpaid charges. These provisions have been in place since 1988.</P>
      <P>The leasing companies have also voiced concerns about the powers contained in earlier Acts dating from 1988 and they have asked that they be modified in the Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) Bill 2005. As a result, the Minister consulted the Attorney General&rsquo;s office and the Irish Aviation Authority, the Dublin Airport Authority and Eurocontrol. All argued against the removal or dilution of the existing powers of detention and sale. Following consideration of all the views expressed on both sides it has been decided not to make any changes to the existing powers at this point. The reasons for this are as follows.</P>
      <P>First, there is a safeguard for an owner in the selling of the aircraft for the purposes of meeting a debt to Eurocontrol in respect of a liability of an operator. To sell an aircraft an application must be made to the High Court and the registered owner would have to be on notice about this proposed sale.</P>
      <P>Second, it is not a procedure that has been resorted to lightly in the past. There has been no instance where an aircraft has been detained and subsequently sold due to non-payment of a debt to Eurocontrol. The existence of these powers, <Col N="1830"/>however, is regarded as having a significant deterrent effect.</P>
      <P>Third, the aircraft leasing companies can afford financial protection by building provisions into their lease agreements with the aircraft operators. This facility is not available to the air traffic control provider when doing business with airlines. Services are provided to all aircraft in airspace in which the air navigation services are provided. For safety reasons, there is no option to decline to provide air navigation services to aircraft. In practice, therefore, an aircraft lessor is usually in a better position than an airport authority or air traffic control provider to monitor the financial status of the operator as it can specify any necessary requirements under the aircraft lease.</P>
      <P>Fourth, any amendment to the legislation which would give rise to different legal treatment of leased versus owned aircraft would be inappropriate. Fifth, the provisions apply equally to debts incurred by airline companies for Eurocontrol charges or for airport charges. Any change in the legislative provisions relating to Eurocontrol charges would give rise to different treatment of air navigation and airport charges, which would amount to arbitrary discrimination between service providers to airlines and would not be appropriate.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the detention and sale provisions in Irish law are similar to those under UK law, another common law system. Greece also has a detention procedure, while Cyprus has legislation that will become effective on the entry into force of the revised convention which provides for detention of aircraft until judicial measures are taken against the operator and-or owner. Eurocontrol member states which have civil law systems have similar powers to seize aircraft for non-payment of debts. All these procedures, whether under common or civil law, have the same effect of freezing the asset in question and making it available as a security for the payment of a debt.</P>
      <P>I am also advised by Eurocontrol that the recovery rate for <i>en route </i>charges in 2004 was 99.4%, of which detention played a minor part. With such an effective rate, it is unfair to state that Eurocontrol recovery procedures are inefficient or lax. The case referred to by Deputy Olivia Mitchell is exceptional and the size of the debt in the case reflects its particular circumstances. The Eurocontrol recovery rate of more than 99% in recent years has benefited all member states, including Ireland. The Irish Aviation Authority recouped more than &euro;90 million in <i>en route</i> charges in 2005.</P>
      <P>Deputy Catherine Murphy referred to issues concerning Weston Aerodrome, a privately owned aerodrome which has been operating since 1938. It is licensed by the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, in accordance with the Irish Aviation Authority (Aerodrome and Visual Ground Aids Order) Regulations, SI 334 of 2000, and in issuing <Col N="1831"/>the licence the authority&rsquo;s remit extends to aviation safety standards. The IAA licenses Weston having regard to the standards laid down by the International Civil Aviation Organisation in annex 14 to the Chicago Convention. The IAA applies international standards to the regulation of aviation safety, including matters such as airspace design and rules of the air.</P>
      <P>The local authorities are responsible for land use planning at and in the vicinity of Weston Aerodrome in accordance with the Planning and Development Act 2000. In addition, the Irish Aviation Authority is a notice party under the Planning and Development Regulations, SI 600 of 2001, so that any development with the potential to endanger or interfere with the safety or safe and efficient navigation of aircraft is sent to the authority. I understand the IAA is satisfied with safety levels at Weston Aerodrome.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dennehy and Deputy Boyle referred to the position of Cork Airport and its establishment as a fully independent and autonomous authority in accordance with the State Airports Act. Deputy Pat Breen also referred to the position of Shannon Airport. The Act provides a framework to allow for an orderly approach to the distribution of the assets of Shannon and Cork airports in conformity with the capital maintenance and other provisions of the Companies Acts.</P>
      <P>New boards were appointed at all three airports in 2004. The boards of Cork and Shannon airports are now charged with making preparations to assume responsibility for the ownership and development of the airports. They are also empowered to undertake certain management and operational functions on an agreed basis with Dublin Airport Authority during the interim period.</P>
      <P>Under the Act, before any assets can transfer to either the Shannon or Cork airport authorities, the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Finance will have to be satisfied as to the financial and operational readiness of the airport authorities. Accordingly, each airport authority is required to prepare a comprehensive business plan and obtain the approval of the Ministers for these plans before any assets can be transferred.</P>
      <P>The three State airport authorities continue to work on the preparation of their business plans with the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, co-ordinating the process. In this context, a range of issues arise, including the unsustainable cost base at Shannon Airport, the recent airport charges determination for Dublin Airport by the Commission for Aviation Regulation and the optimum mechanisms for the financing of the new terminal at Cork Airport. These are complex issues which the airport authorities must consider carefully and, as the Minister has indicated previously, he has not imposed any artificial deadlines for the completion of the business planning <Col N="1832"/>process. A major new terminal development project is being completed at Cork Airport. This will deliver an annual passenger capacity of 3 million people with the facility to expand capacity to 5 million passengers when required.</P>
      <P>At an early stage in the airport restructuring process, it was indicated that the intention was that both the independent Cork and Shannon airports would commence on a debt-free basis. However, the intention throughout was that this would be subject to determining the optimum mechanisms for allocating airport assets among the three airports in compliance with the capital maintenance rules and other provisions of the Companies Acts. The position with regard to the transfer of assets to Cork Airport Authority was set out in the course of the passing of the State Airports Act 2004. Owing to the tightness of Dublin Airport Authority&rsquo;s distributable reserves, a phased approach to restructuring was outlined at the time. The option of negotiating a finance lease covering a portion of Cork Airport&rsquo;s assets to facilitate the earlier establishment of Cork Airport as a fully independent airport was mentioned. I assure Deputy Dennehy and Deputy Boyle that Cork Airport&rsquo;s ability to operate on a commercial basis will be fully assessed as part of the business planning process and will be factored into the decisions made.</P>
      <P>Deputies Olivia Mitchell, Eamon Ryan, Finian McGrath, Dennehy, Boyle and Naughten raised the question of safety standards in Irish aviation, specifically recently reported incidents. The Irish Aviation Authority exercises safety oversight of the Irish aviation industry according to established international standards and procedures and fully implements international requirements in the monitoring of its operators. The authority regulates the industry to the highest international standards, as borne out by a number of independent audits, including one carried out on behalf of the Minister of Transport to evaluate the performance of the authority and to satisfy himself as to its adequacy and effectiveness. There is no compromise on safety.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Deputy Crowe raised the question of the requirements of military users of European airspace and the flexible use of airspace. Eurocontrol is developing a framework to increase the exchange of information between civil and military air navigation service providers. This is achieved through a much closer working relationship than in the past between civil and military air traffic controllers and through building up air traffic management system interoperability.</P>
      <P>The airspace over Europe is a finite resource for use by all airspace users both civil and military. However, as a finite resource some measure of agreement is needed concerning its use and that use needs to be economic and effective. This need became particularly relevant following the massive increase recorded in commer<Col N="1833"/>cial air traffic in the 1980s and 1990s. There is a clear need for safe coexistence between civil and military operations in a common airspace. Both Eurocontrol and the European Union are agreed that the safe and efficient use of airspace can only be achieved through close co-operation between civil and military users of airspace, mainly based on the concept of flexible use of airspace and effective civil military co-ordination as established by the international civil aviation organisation.</P>
      <P>Deputies also raised the issue of military aircraft landing at Shannon. The Minister for Transport is responsible for civilian aircraft carrying weapons or munitions of war into or over Ireland. The Minister for Foreign Affairs is responsible for regulating the activities of military aircraft landing in or flying over Ireland. The carriage of weapons or munitions on civilian aircraft, either landing or flying over, is prohibited under Irish law unless an exemption is given by the Minister for Transport. Before the Minister issues an exemption, the Department of Transport consults the Department of Foreign Affairs regarding foreign policy, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform regarding security and the Irish Aviation Authority regarding aviation safety, and also informs the Department of Defence. The decision to facilitate the US in the transport of troops through Irish airports is a matter for Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy. The Minister for Transport deals with requests for exemptions for aircraft carrying weapons or munitions on civilian aircraft in that context.</P>
      <P>Deputy Crowe referred to Galileo and how it was to be funded. Galileo is Europe&rsquo;s satellite radio navigation programme. It was launched at the initiative of the European Commission and developed jointly with the European Space Agency. As it provides for accurate location pinpointing, it opens potential for the development of a new generation of universal services in areas such as transport, telecommunications, agriculture and fisheries. The total estimated Galileo project cost is &euro;3.6 billion. The development phase will account for &euro;1.5 billion of this and the financing will be split more or less equally between the European Community and the European Space Agency. The cost of the deployment phase is estimated at &euro;2.1 billion, of which one third is expected to come from the EU budget and the rest from the private sector.</P>
      <P>I refer to issues raised by Deputy Durkan regarding delays arising from air traffic control. In the past decade, air traffic has grown by more than 50% and this growth is set to continue. Europe&rsquo;s airspace is one of the busiest in the world with more than 9.2 million flights in 2005 carrying some 700 million passengers. In excess of 30,000 flights take place on busiest days with more than 3,000 flights in the air at the same time. Eurocontrol expects this traffic to reach 16 million per year by 2020. Current systems with <Col N="1834"/>ongoing improvements should be able to handle this increased load until the middle of the next decade and after that, more radical measures will be called for to avoid serious congestion.</P>
      <P>Eurocontrol has as its primary objective the development of a seamless pan-European air traffic management system. The achievement of this objective is a key element to the present and future challenges facing the aviation community which must cope with the forecasted growth in air traffic while at the same time maintaining a high level of safety, reducing cost and respecting the environment. It is confidently expected that the single European sky initiative will lay the foundations of a unified system which will be able to cater for the anticipated growth. This single European sky initiative, launched by the Commission, aims to restructure European airspace as a function of traffic flows, rather than according to national borders to create additional capacity and to increase overall efficiency of the air traffic management system.</P>
      <P>Eurocontrol has considerable expertise and experience in these fields, which will be applied to help make the single European sky become a reality. The single European sky initiative marks the beginning of a new, dramatic and exciting chapter in European air traffic control. The development of the single European sky proposal represents a challenge and an opportunity for the air navigation service providers to demonstrate in a practical way the greater efficiencies that can be obtained through the integration and development of services on a European scale while ensuring uniformly high safety standards throughout Europe. The revised convention seeks to provide for a more effective air management institutional policy and decision-making structure for Europe with the overall objective of increasing airspace capacity and reducing air traffic control delays.</P>
      <P>Pressure for change came from a number of sources, particularly airlines dissatisfied with the failure to unify and centralise air traffic management in Europe. The convention when implemented will provide for the necessary institutional reforms required to achieve a uniform European air traffic management system for the control of general air traffic in European airspace and in our airports.</P>
      <P>Deputy Durkan asked about the long delays in getting compensation. Under the European Communities (Compensation and Assistance to Air Passengers)(Denied Boarding, Cancellation or Long Delay of Flights) Regulations, SI 274 of 2005, the Commission for Aviation Regulation was appointed as the designated body for the purpose of implementing Regulation EC 261/2004, establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of being denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights and repealing Regulation EEC 295/1991. This legislation deals with concerns <Col N="1835"/>raised by the Deputy regarding passengers who are left stranded.</P>
      <P>Deputy Pat Breen asked about the implications for Shannon Airport of the proposed agreement between the European Union and the United States on air transport &mdash; the so-called open skies agreement. The Deputy will be aware that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, has negotiated a transition arrangement with the US for Shannon Airport. The Minister indicated at the time of announcing the transition arrangement that he would undertake the development of an economic and tourism development plan for Shannon, work on which is under way in the Department of Transport in consultation with the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and Arts, Sport and Tourism.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Eamon Ryan that maintaining an optimal balance between economic progress, social development and environmental responsibility is essential. The aviation industry has reduced its environmental impact in recent decades through the development of new technology and the adoption of specific operating methods. Achieving further improvements in environmental performance is a key research and development objective for the aviation industry.</P>
      <P>I refer to the contribution of Deputy Naughten. I dealt with the issues raised by the Deputy in regard to tackling the problems arising from the fragmentation of the air traffic control system in Europe. That is one of the reasons the revised Eurocontrol Convention was brought forward and the parallel single sky initiative taken by the European Commission.</P>
      <P>I noted Deputy Naughten&rsquo;s comments on security at non-State airports and the importance of the slots at Heathrow. I am very familiar with a number of the non-State airports, particularly the one in my county. While we may not have airport police at the airport, the security level is high. Those employed at the airports to provide the security have been trained specifically for that task. I note also the Deputy&rsquo;s comments about the western rail corridor, an issue with which I am very familiar.</P>

    <Title>Building Control Bill 2005: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy"><NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
	<P>Like previous speakers, I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Building Control Bill 2005. It is important legislation that adds to our control mechanisms in the building industry and related matters. Considering the size of that industry, the Bill is timely and welcome.</P>
      <P>In general, speakers welcomed the Bill. A number of contributors are professionals in the field, including a number of architects, and they appeared to generally welcome the Bill, although we will have some questions about it on later Stages.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the Bill will not cover a number of issues involving the building business about which we have concerns, including unfinished estates and so on, but I presume further legislation will be brought forward to deal with those matters and the planning and development area generally.</P>
      <P>I agree with the comment of the Minister, Deputy Roche, at the outset of the debate that this is a good day for the consumer because consumers are most at risk when anything goes wrong. Whether it is poor design work at the outset, the involvement of bad builders or poor insulation, invariably the consumer must pick up the tab and is in difficulty. The Bill will cover a number of those issues.</P>
      <P>The issue that has received the greatest attention and on which we have been lobbied the most by way of correspondence and directly is the need for the registration and recognition of the titles &ldquo;architect&rdquo;, &ldquo;building surveyor&rdquo; and &ldquo;quantity surveyor&rdquo;. Some people will argue that some of these professional groups could set up a monopoly. That question has been examined by the appropriate authority and it can be dealt with in time if necessary. The argument that persons employing such professionals are entitled to be assured they are appropriately qualified takes precedence over that point.</P>
      <P>This House recently passed similar legislation regarding health professionals, and the same objective applies in both cases, that is, there is a State guarantee in place whereby if a person in a certain profession advertises for business, the user of that service is assured it will be of a professional standard. It is imperative that the back-up is in place for that. The point about the health professionals, including psychologists and so on, applies equally to that.</P><Col N="1837"/>
      <P>I watched some of an RTE expos&eacute; recently that concerned a person who described himself as an architect in action. In many instances the outcome for the clients involved was a nightmare. The primary problem, as pointed out in the programme and after it, was that the so-called architect appeared not to have broken any law at the time because there was no measure in place such as those we are about to enact. We must learn from those cases and be proactive in that regard.</P>
      <P>As I said, there has been a fair degree of lobbying by architects and those in other professions to bring forward this Bill. I compliment the Minister on his work on that to date and wish him well in getting the Bill passed by the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Two areas strike me as needing attention, at least one of which has been catered for in the Bill and was referred to by other speakers. It is where a person practising has gained alternative experience or training to that covered under the syllabus of the two professional groups mentioned in the Bill for monitoring it. The same issue could arise with people coming here from other countries who have had similar training. There must be some degree of flexibility in that regard. Legislation can be fairly rigid and when an anomaly or other problem arises, there is no flexibility in the Act.</P>
      <P>I had a recent example of that when I was approached by a constituent who highlighted the restrictive nature of legislation. That case involved the need for a landlord to register private tenancies under the private tenancies registration requirements. That landlord, through no fault of his own, had previously forwarded a form to register for an earlier tenancy but because of a delay in getting a PPS, he was late in forwarding the required form. He was penalised by approximately &euro;160 but this citizen is involved in many charities and it was more of a blow to him that he was breaking the law than paying the funding. When he made his case, which was a reasonable one, the response he got was that there is no facility in the legislation enacted to allow for a deferral, an allowance or leniency.</P>
      <P>We must be aware of those types of cases. Politicians can call the shots on a case as they wish in terms of legislation but there must always be some element of discretion. I have appealed for that in the past on other issues. A similar happening could arise in this legislation. That is why I would like that aspect teased out further on Committee Stage to ensure we do not have such a bureaucratic type response to anybody who has a legitimate claim to be registered, and genuine cases will come forward. I heard references earlier in the debate to what I understand is a facility to cater for people in those circumstances and I would like to hear more on that. The grandfather rule was mentioned but I am not sure in what context.</P><Col N="1838"/>
      <P>The second question I want to raise under that section of the Bill relates to Brendan Behan&rsquo;s belief that any decent new Irish organisation would have, as its first item on the agenda, a proposal for a split.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The first item.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy"><NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
	<P>I notice when perusing the Bill there are just two prescribed associations or bodies identified as the ones to administer the system, that is, the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland and the Society of Chartered Surveyors. I am not sure if there are other professional bodies to which one can belong and still be fully recognised or if they are named purely to administer the system or if one has to be a member of those associations. In fairness it is more out of curiosity than concern that I raise this but, bearing in mind what I said previously that we should build in flexibility, there are at least three accountancy bodies practising. Is there a facility for any other representative body to be recognised, if established, under the legislation? There could well be a group which may wish to have an organisation called the architects society and which may not be happy with the word &ldquo;royal&rdquo; included in the description of their association. If we are prescriptive and too strict we may find ourselves in trouble later and going to Europe to contest a case because we passed bad legislation. It may well be that I am concerned about nothing, that these two groups will administer the scheme and that there can be a variety of other associations.</P>
      <P>In opening the debate the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, said one of the most important sections of the Bill deals with fire safety. That area is in need of urgent attention. There are huge gaps in the fire requirements in general. There have been many unfortunate happenings, including the Stardust disaster, to which the Minister and other speakers referred. I have said previously at local level and in the House that fire is no respecter of age, gender, race or any other aspect of human life. We should all be aware that if we make mistakes or get careless about its prevention fire will take its toll, which is a fact of life. The severity of that toll can depend on many different factors. Part of our job as legislators must be to put in place rules and regulations that will control as many of these factors as possible. More importantly, we must ensure there is a requirement that they be enforced, whether it is control of the design of buildings, the use of appropriate building materials at the outset or a check on overcrowding when buildings are in use. All possible precautions against fire must be enforced.</P>
      <P>I accept that investigation afterwards and recommendations about change practices and so on can help in future prevention but as the Mini<Col N="1839"/>ster said we must take every precaution possible before the event happens to avoid tragedies such as the Stardust disaster. We are lackadaisical in many ways about fire hazards, an issue to which I will return.</P>
      <P>I avail of this opportunity to pay tribute to the work of the fire fighters throughout the country, both the professionals and the volunteers who often have to put their lives at risk to deal with outbreaks of fire. They see it and we recognise it as part of their job. It is not acceptable that their job should be made more hazardous by reason of bad building practices or carelessness in regard to storage of materials, lack of egress or access and that other avoidable issues continue to be allowed.</P>
      <P>I have had the experience of calling the fire service to a serious fire where the hydrant had tarmac laid over it and it could not be found. That was a personal experience. The fire fighters with whom I am most familiar because of my years in Cork Corporation are the Cork city fire service members. They have an excellent record and play a huge role in fire prevention. They do that by virtue of the role they play in visiting schools, giving lectures, working with companies and in other areas of public activity. They give professional advice that should be listened to, adhered to and enforced. It is important that the fire fighters, the fire chiefs, have legal back-up to enforce their professional judgment where necessary. Whether it is overcrowding of bars or other gathering points, the provision of the escape mechanisms or any other issue on which they are called to advise, they should have the overriding powers. There can be a clash between that knowledge and the knowledge of planners. The fire chief or the highest ranking fire officer in an area has the expertise and must have the final say in matters relating to fire and fire precaution. It is imperative that we arm the powers that be in all walks of life with the necessary back-up but they must be able to enforce their professional judgment on such matters. In the new era of high-rise buildings we need the professional fire person to be the final arbiter in matters relating to fire, fire escape and so on.</P>
      <P>One of the most dangerous aspects of fire is that none of us believes it can happen us. We may put a fire alarm in place. I became aware of that type of thinking in action through my own family. A brother of mine had refurbished our old family home which was a four-storey building. He slabbed off the top storey which would be used for attic-type storage space. In slabbing off that building he used soft building materials which were probably suitable for various jobs but not for that one. When he had it inspected by the local authority fire officer, the inspector refused to pass it on the grounds that the slabs had to be fireproof plaster board slabs. I confess I and the rest of us thought he was being extreme, partic<Col N="1840"/>ularly given the huge amount of money that had been spent on the refurbishment.</P>
      <P>Approximately six months later at 2 a.m. a taxi driver, driving near Shandon which is the highest area in Cork, saw, half a mile away, flames coming through the roof of the building. He drove to what had been my family home, hammered on the door because everybody was asleep, and eventually the six occupants inside came out. When they awoke in the third storey, the bedrooms, the ceiling was a red mass. Were it not for the inspector&rsquo;s report and the insistence on slabbing there would have been six fatalities. That was a good lesson for us. Since then I have been on the side of enforcement whereas previously I might have made excuses that people did not have the money to put in place certain facilities, particularly in households. I no longer tolerate any arguments against fire safety. It was a personal experience but the inspection by that inspector saved their lives. I am sure there are many other instances where the same has happened.</P>
      <P>Much of the building boom consists of high-rise developments. No doubt we have all seen &ldquo;Towering Inferno&rdquo; and said it was a great film, very exciting and so on but it is only a film. Arising out of that, there are many serious questions. I ask whether, in regard to the county hall in Cork, the trade union building, Liberty Hall and many other buildings, we have the ability to fight a fire in them. We certainly do not have the fleet of helicopters that were available to the fire chief in the film. We have Snorkels, which I believe extend only four or five storeys, perhaps a few more, and I certainly do not believe we have any apparatus for fighting fires in the upper sections of the new high-rise developments.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned that commercial arguments and the push for development will take precedence over fire safety requirements. We should not wait for EU directives to address such matters. In this regard, consider the Seveso directive which addresses the danger of explosions and fires in industries using hazardous materials. No authority in the country had an idea of what was involved in this matter until the Seveso directive came into being. This prohibits the construction of buildings in which people gather if they are proposed to be located within a certain distance of industries using hazardous materials. In some cases, this distance is a kilometre. There was uproar over this. We were not aware of the directive and wanted to proceed with development. Too often we wait for directives from the European Union before we take action. I am concerned that this will lead to a serious incident.</P>
      <P>Most Irish towns and cities came into being as rural communities grew and everybody knew what was required when something went wrong. Circumstances have changed and we must try to ensure through legislation such as the Building <Col N="1841"/>Control Bill that we do not make matters worse. More exacting standards for non-domestic developments in particular and greater penalties for breaches of the law will help prevent the construction of cowboy developments whose backers have much to gain, even if they have to pay the maximum fine.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, will share my concerns over high-density and high-rise developments. When considering high-rise apartment blocks, we should learn from the mistakes we made in places such as Ballymun in Dublin and various parts of Cork city, including Mayfield. The Deanrock estate in Togher is a case in point. Such projects were developed in times of panic when the accommodation list became very lengthy. People opted for high-rise developments that appeared to be good at the time, but these developments did not last too long as we are now demolishing them and trying to return to more normal types of development. The projects were ill-fated and gave local authority housing a bad name in several instances. In the case of Ballymun, the apartment blocks made people fear high-rise development. We paid for poor planning and a lack of vision in that the developments have now been demolished. In the case of the Deanrock estate in Togher, demolition in pending. Problems associated with high-rise development, such as traffic congestion, the colonising of surrounding residential areas to meet parking needs and, perhaps most important, the damage caused to neighbourhood identity, are all negative issues and need to be considered and addressed.</P>
      <P>The driving force behind proposals for high-rise developments is the stated need for more accommodation. We are sympathetic to this as there is increased need for accommodation in urban areas in particular. Some suggest the only way is up but, while high-rise development is a means of achieving higher density, it is not the only way. It is possible to maximise density without reaching for the skies. In this regard, we require balance and a bit of common sense. We have suffered because of high-rise development, particularly in the case of Ballymun. New developments should enhance rather than detract from the environments in which they are located. Fire control authorities rather than architects and housing officers should be the ones asked for their professional judgment in this regard.</P>
      <P>The third important element in this Bill concerns energy efficiency. In this regard we are only now complying with a relevant European directive, which proves the point I made on the Seveso directive. We could have been much more proactive. After the fuel scare some years ago, we became very enthusiastic about power and heat generation projects. In one case, the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is together partly funded a hospital-wide project for Cork University Hospital. The project was unique in that the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is, which <Col N="1842"/>might be seen as rivals, were brought together. However, the need was acknowledged and dealt with.</P>
      <P>Our enthusiasm seems to vary according to the price and availability of oil or gas. There is much more we could do in securing energy efficiency. For the past two years, those involved in providing double and treble glazing have been working on new seal systems but they have been doing so on their own initiative and not on the basis of a legal requirement. We should have been pushing this some years ago.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and believe it should be implemented as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to say a few words on this very important legislation. The quality of construction affects everyone&rsquo;s lives, not only Members but the people we represent. In particular, it affects the new generation buying houses and, in doing so, making the biggest investment of their lives. The building control legislation should protect them. The quality of construction also affects those who use public buildings.</P>
      <P>I too want to refer to the Stardust disaster. We should all remember those who lost their lives in the tragedy and also their families who are still asking questions that deserve answers.</P>
      <P>I will address the main point of the Bill. The explanatory memorandum states:</P>
      <P LI="1">On foot of recommendations made by the Building Regulations Advisory Body (BRAB), the Bill introduces revised procedures for issue of Fire Safety Certificate (FSC), by local Building Control Authorities, confirming compliance with Part B (Fire Safety) of the Building Regulations of designs of new Non-Domestic Buildings (offices, factories, shops, hotels, etc.) and new Apartment Blocks.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The Building Control Bill, which has been sought for some considerable time, has important implications in this area. It is important that all the regulations be enforced. It is a waste of time making regulations, printing them and sending them to local authorities and inspectors if they are not adhered to. Quality should not vary from county to county or region to region. When ensuring fire safety, it is imperative that the standards laid out be upheld without exception. Otherwise there will be no sense in having the legislation.</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum also states: &ldquo;The Bill introduces a Disability Access Certificate (DAC) confirming that the designs of new Non-Domestic Buildings and Apartment Blocks comply with Part M (Access for People with Disabilities) of the Building Regulations.&rdquo; We must all agree with this. How many times have we heard examples of inaccessible buildings to which a great number of people need to gain access for one reason or another? Unless there is access for all and unless we meet the require<Col N="1843"/>ments, we are wasting our time. I welcome disability access certification.</P>
      <P>The Bill widens the right of building control authorities to seek injunctions from the High Court. Under this legislation, such authorities will be able to seek injunctions to stop the construction or use of new buildings, the design of which has not been granted a disability access certificate. That is fine, but it is too late to take action if the construction of the building has already been finished. A system of inspection needs to be in place to ensure that buildings are being developed in the correct manner. I accept that the Bill will allow court action to be taken to ensure that construction does not continue if developers do not adhere strictly to the rules. We must accept and support that.</P>
      <P>The Bill will give building control authorities the option of bringing summary prosecutions for all building code offences in the District Court rather than in the Circuit Court by means of prosecution on indictment by the Director of Public Prosecutions. That measure will simplify the prosecution process only if local authorities take action on time. We are aware that on many occasions local authorities spent ten or 15 years complaining and writing about problems which were staring them in the face before they brought such matters to the courts. In such circumstances, judges usually ask the representatives of local authorities why action was not taken sooner. Judges do not look after local authorities if 20 years have elapsed, which means that liability is assumed by the relevant supervising local authority. I hope the legislation under discussion will avoid a repeat of the mistakes which were made in the past.</P>
      <P>This Bill does not provide for the completion of estates and compliance with planning conditions in the manner we would have wanted. We need to deal with two or three matters in this regard. Local authorities have always been able to control the manner in which development takes place. They employ development control officers to alert them to deviations from the accepted code of practice or from the conditions set out in the planning permission. If local authorities do not take action when such deviations take place, there is no point in them pointing out five or ten years later that there was no compliance in a certain instance.</P>
      <P>Similarly, there is no point in someone coming in after 15 years and highlighting the lack of compliance in some cases. Such problems should be dealt with as they occur. How often have we heard about developers moving on to build a new housing estate without having completed the previous one? It is often found that work has stopped on three or four estates without planning conditions having been complied with. If the work standards of a developer are so slipshod and haphazard that he does not bother to complete a <Col N="1844"/>housing estate in accordance with the conditions of a planning permission, can we be certain that all other aspects of the construction of the development are in accordance with best practice? I ask that question as a matter of seriousness.</P>
      <P>While I welcome most modern building practices, I am not sure about some of them. The marriage of steel and glass, for example, is much in evidence, but I am not sure it is the right thing to do. It is imperative that all the tolerances should be tested fully in the course of the construction of a building.</P>
      <P>When I was in Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris some years ago &mdash; I am not sure whether the Ceann Comhairle was with me on that occasion &mdash; I examined the configuration of the roof of a building that had recently been constructed. As an amateur with no qualifications in this area, I said to someone that I was not sure that type of construction &mdash; a high concentration of light steel or aluminium &mdash; would stand the passage of time. When I asked whether it would last, I was told that it would because the people who designed it were sure to have known what they were doing. As we are aware, however, the roof in question did not wait much longer before it fell in and there was no snow on it when it did.</P>
      <P>We could learn some lessons from incidents of this nature. The roof I referred to fell in, whereas the roof of the National Aquatic Centre fell out. I advise those who are experts in the building industry, of whose activities I am seeing increasing evidence, to look carefully at issues such as tolerance, load transfer and load bearing before they scoff at innocent people who raise questions about their designs.</P>
      <P>Previous speakers have discussed the Bill&rsquo;s provisions for the registration of various professionals in this area. Similar measures have been taken in respect of a number of other professions. The EU has decided to group various professions together to be administered in the usual way. I hope the proposed system will work in the way it is supposed to work. Many discerning professionals are anxious that the highest possible standards should prevail, the new regime should be all-embracing and bad practices should be avoided.</P>
      <P>Like other Deputies, I received an e-mail that raised some questions about certain aspects of the proposed system of registration. It suggested that some competent and capable people who are fully qualified in every aspect of the construction industry could be squeezed out of the inner circle as a result of these provisions. I hope that will not be the case. On Committee Stage, we should give due consideration to the various professionals in this field. Nobody should be squeezed out because they are not part of an inner or upper circle. Decisions on registration should be made on the basis of one&rsquo;s competence and ability to do one&rsquo;s job. I compliment those who have set a <Col N="1845"/>high standard in the industry over the years. Like everyone else, I agree that there is a need for such standards to be maintained.</P>
      <P>As the relevant Fine Gael spokesman, I especially welcome the section of the Bill that provides for the transposition of the relevant provisions of the EU energy performance of buildings directive. It will ensure that buildings, just like vehicles and electrical appliances, are the subject of energy rating and labelling, which is very important. Up to 30% of heating costs can be saved by the construction industry through proper conservation, labelling and the elimination of the escape of heat. That applies to public buildings and private buildings. I do not suggest that we should revisit the issue of the installation of the ventilation system in Leinster House 2000. Those of us who work in that building day-to-day know that the system leaves some room for improvement.</P>
      <P>When one considers that the new regulations must come into force on 1 January 2007, it is impossible to understand why strict instructions were not issued by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government over the past six or seven months in respect of the pouring of foundations in affordable and local authority housing. I do not understand why builders were specifically requested not to provide for the new insulation and labelling standards. It would not cost much more to meet the terms of the new provisions now. It will cost quite an amount to do so in the not too distant future. I have already spoken about the energy conservation requirements for larger buildings. The legislation also provides for the registration of architects, which I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>As someone who is interested in the simple and practical aspects of DIY, I have received representations from plumbing and electrical contractors who believe there should be an ongoing upgrade and evaluation of the standards which apply to encourage best practice and discourage practices like taking short cuts &mdash; no pun intended. The contractors in question have specifically requested that such measures be taken. When contractors take responsibility for a contract, they need to be sure that the standard of their own work is as high as possible. They readily say they can perform huge improvements in areas like heat conservation and the delivery of heating through proper wiring and properly constructed plumbing systems. That is what they tell me and I have no reason to disbelieve them. That is not to suggest that half the industry is slipshod, but it is an indication that someone out there has an idea or two that, if put into practice, would be very useful.</P>
      <P>When construction was being undertaken on the Naas Hospital a few years ago, a gentleman approached me and indicated that he could reduce the overall cost of management of the sites, the plans and the layouts by a considerable <Col N="1846"/>amount without cutting corners simply by adopting new practices. They have since been adopted. Instead of getting a Kango hammer and charging a channel along the side of three of four walls, the channel should be provided for before precasting or in the construction of the wall. In that way, a builder does not have to go back over it. The same simple practice can be applied to floors. Great savings can be made on the construction of buildings, public or private, in this way.</P>
      <P>Years ago, great emphasis was placed on cube tests on concrete. When the previous Building Control Bill came before this House &mdash; it was not today or yesterday &mdash; I remember raising that question. There is considerable scope for raising that question again. There is a tendency to rely on the minimum tolerances. It is like the maximum speed limit. One does not have to drive at the maximum speed limit; one can drive below it. Likewise, one should not necessarily rely on minimum tolerances becoming the standard. I presume that all the standards laid down for this Bill will have regard to that so that recognition is given to an extra requirement and that the minimum should not always apply.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I want to speak about the terrible blight on development nowadays. Up to ten or 15 years ago, the quality of development in this country was exceptionally high with the exception of some of the places mentioned. Most three-bedroomed houses for first-time buyers were of a high standard and had adequate space and a small garden in which children could play. That is not the case any more. Now we have what is known as the duplex system. This is essentially the construction of one house on top of the other with an external stairway leading into the upper house. There are shared playground areas and so on. I do not know who thought this was a great system. It saves space and it makes more money for the developers who get involved in them, but it does nothing for the people who live in it. In the middle of winter, an elderly person or a small child walking up or down those stairs will be blown right off by ice on the steps.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I do not understand why the wise guy who invented this system thought it was a great idea. I heard someone speaking to an estate agent indicating that the duplex system was great. They should be banned now. Consideration in the first instance should be given to two things, namely, the quality, durability and efficiency of the building as well as the quality of life for those who live in a duplex. It is no good saying that a new large block of flats built right beside a railway station looks good and caters for thousands. It will be tomorrow&rsquo;s slums if we go on like that. It is an appalling blight and it is a new phenomenon that has come about as a result of high property prices, not high land prices. In ten years&rsquo; time, whoever is in this House will reap the whirlwind of it. It will be as bad as, if not worse than, Ballymun.</P><Col N="1847"/>
      <P>In a country of our size, we still have space to provide adequate accommodation and space for families, both young and old. It is not necessary to run scared and to pretend that Ireland will be like Holland soon. If Ireland had the same density of population as that which exists in Holland, there would be about 48 million people in the country. We are a long way from that. I do not accept the notion coming from some quarters that we must build upwards indefinitely. While we must do so to some extent and, if it is good quality, it can look nice, we need to have regard for tomorrow&rsquo;s families, generation and population when we decide to condemn them to one kind of development or another.</P>
      <P>The previous generation may not have had much money, but we did have a place for the kids to play in the garden. We did not have to get involved in altercations, walk up duplex stairs, get blown down off them or break our necks on the ice on them. We did not have mothers trying to bring prams up the same duplex stairs. We have come a long way in many ways, but we have lost sight in many other ways. I hope this particular Bill regains some of what we have lost.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am delighted to see the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, taking this important consumer Bill. The Building Control Bill 2005 represents high standards and common sense. The people will adjust to and welcome this Bill. Let us get it right first time and take pride in our buildings and work. Safety must be a priority because life is precious. We should strive to have the highest standards. Nothing but the best should be good enough for the people and there should be no excuses. We now have the most educated and highly qualified people in the world. It is as easy to do a job the right way as the wrong way. In all fields, professional and qualified people are the experts. We should employ people who are qualified, have served their time and know what they are doing. Everyone is an expert in their own professions. Consumers should demand the best when they are paying for a service. They can help to improve standards.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>In County Longford, we are fortunate we have a high calibre of architects. Longford-based architects, as well as Longford architects based in Dublin and New York, have reputations second to none. They are highly qualified and respected in their profession. In Longford County Council, a high standard has been achieved and the county can be proud of the staff in the council&rsquo;s planning section. Qualified building surveyors and quantity surveyors give a good service. We are fortunate that in County Longford our builders have a worldwide reputation for excellence. One can see the great work the builders have done. There are many examples of fine residential homes and commercial, industrial, retail and public build<Col N="1848"/>ings. The customer in County Longford is well catered for, with a wide choice of quality builders to choose from.</P>
      <P>The rural tax has resulted in major improvement and development. We are lucky to have so many good builders and developers to develop our towns and villages &mdash; someone must lead the way. Builders are people of action rather than words. Longford builders have taken the lead at home in County Longford, in Dublin and all over Ireland, as well as in England, Scotland, Wales, and, more recently, in Europe.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Bill in the main states that architects and other building professionals will be registered. The public will welcome, as I do, that these professionals will be properly qualified. It is only right and proper that properly qualified professionals are involved in the building profession. There is too much at stake and the people have too much to lose if qualified professionals are not employed.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact new homes and businesses will be more energy efficient. I also welcome the budget announcement by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, of grant aid to help people use alternative energies in their homes and businesses.</P>
      <P Just="Left">There will be better provision for people with disabilities, which is a necessity. It is okay for people who have their health to take things for granted, but we owe it to people with disabilities to help to make all buildings accessible to them. Of all the people with disabilities, I think of the many who are, unfortunately, confined to wheelchairs in County Longford. They are cheerful, happy people with a great outlook. They are entitled to live their lives with the least inconvenience possible. It is time to ensure that all buildings are wheelchair accessible.</P>
      <P>The Bill will ensure stricter controls on fire protection. The tragedy of many major fires with loss of life has been well documented. There can be no excuse for this. We must take all necessary precautions to prevent fires. A new fire station will shortly open at Ballymahon, County Longford, the new fire station being constructed at present at Granard is well under way and a site has been acquired for a new fire station at Lanesborough. I hope the Minister of State will look favourably upon the extension of Longford town fire station and a site is being pursued at present for a fire station at Mostrum, County Longford. It is too important to life&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The enforcement of the building code will be tightened. All in all, consumers will welcome the Bill. Professionals who currently operate to high standards have nothing to fear. Qualified professionals will welcome the Bill. Only the best is good enough.</P>
      <P>Most, if not all, builders in County Longford have excellent controls on their sites. The majority of builders I know are doing what the Bill would recommend regardless of the Bill. They did not need the Bill to bring them under control. However, unfortunately, some people do not conform to what is in the best interests of the public. The consumer can be happy with the Bill. No matter what laws, rules or regulations are in place, they can always be improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, for bringing this important Bill before the House. As Deputy Kelly said, it marks a good day for the consumer. It will be seen in years to come as progressive consumer law. It is also appropriate that the Bill is before the House soon after the anniversary of the Stardust tragedy. Many of the victims of the tragedy hail from my constituency. We must make sure that a similar tragedy never happens again. The Bill goes a long way towards ensuring that.</P>
      <P>The enforcement of the legislation will be the key measure of its success or failure. From my overview of the proposed legislation, I believe it will result in much progress on a number of levels. It will assure the public that those calling themselves architects, building surveyors and quantity surveyors are properly qualified. It strengthens the enforcement of building control law to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s high building control standards are fully adhered to and provides for the energy rating of houses and commercial buildings. Together with the new building regulations, these measures will bring long-term cost savings to householders and business and help meet Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emission obligations under the Kyoto Protocol.</P>
      <P>The Bill also marks a further move in implementing the Government&rsquo;s commitment to disability by requiring commercial buildings and apartment blocks to be certified as being compliant with disability access requirements. The feedback I get from my constituents indicates that there is a demand for this kind of legislation. With building activity running at all-time record levels in Ireland, it makes sense to strengthen our <Col N="1850"/>building control system and to seek to improve the energy performance of our existing and new building stock. We need to build better buildings, instil public confidence in those who design our buildings and recognise the qualifications of the people involved.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The time is long overdue for legislation to protect consumers from unqualified people passing themselves off as qualified building professionals. Accordingly, I welcome the registration of the titles of architect, building surveyor and quantity surveyor because it will give a greater degree of protection to the general public. This will mean that only qualified people on a statutory register will in future be entitled to use these titles. The registration system for architects is to be administered by the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland and for building surveyors and quantity surveyors by the Society of Chartered Surveyors. I welcome that the Minister, Deputy Roche, will ensure that the eligibility criteria for registration will not be decided by the relevant registration bodies, and the Bill lays down a rigorous system to ensure that the highest standards are met.</P>
      <P>It is absurd that in 2006 one need only put up a sign stating &ldquo;architect&rdquo; outside one&rsquo;s door to classify oneself as such. Most people will remember a &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme from last year which claimed that a property consultant made 132 applications to a local authority in Dublin since 2001 but the council could find no record of planning officials ever having met him. It emerged that the council had refused 67% of the architect&rsquo;s valid applications, which the director of planning for Fingal County Council described as a very high rate of refusal by any standard. When one arranges to meet a doctor or consultant, it is reasonable to expect he or she has followed a recognised training course and achieved a professional qualification. One has reason to assume that is the case. However, we should also seek to find a means of recognising those who have demonstrated their ability, not through formal qualifications but through their work.</P>
      <P>Registration has been in place in the United States, for example, since 1990 and in the United Kingdom since 1930, but to which model should we aspire? Research leads me to believe that the best model in place is that in the United States. The Association of Building Engineers has made a submission on the Bill supporting it. It is a sign of a good Bill when those about to be regulated welcome the legislation. As Deputy Kelly said, legitimate architects, surveyors and builders have nothing to fear from this Bill, rather they will benefit considerably from it. It is only the cowboys who will have to worry about it. The majority of builders in my constituency are good builders who will not have any problem with it.</P>
      <P>Some years ago the Competition Authority stated that the case for regulating those who describe themselves as architects had not been adequately made. In a consultation paper on the <Col N="1851"/>profession the authority suggested that a regulatory impact analysis should be undertaken before the proposal to regulate it was progressed. I have heard criticism with regard to the length of time it takes to qualify as an architect, approximately five years with two further years postgraduation. We now have universal application of academic standards throughout Europe and a common understanding of what constitutes a qualified person. This is a welcome development.</P>
      <P>I am pleased the Bill enhances fire safety controls and provides for better compliance with disability access requirements under the building regulations. This gives teeth to the enforcement of the building control legislation. The introduction of a disability access certificate will ensure that the disability compliance requirements of the building code are fully respected. The requirements will advance the rights of people with disabilities to enter and use buildings, a precondition for equal access to services and employment.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I welcome that in parallel with the publication of the Bill the Minister will embark on a public consultation exercise to review the current building control standards as they relate to disability, the Part M requirements. I hope all interested parties take full advantage of that process. With regard to making public buildings accessible for people with disability, we should not wait for this to happen. The timeframe of ten years which will take us to 2015 seems a bit too long. How could those responsible take ten years to make a building accessible? This period is too lengthy and I do not understand the need for such a long timeframe. I ask the Minister to review this on Committee Stage and do all he can to speed up the process.</P>
      <P>We want to reach a stage where people with disabilities can leave their homes and access footpaths and public buildings and go about their business. The issue of accessibility of footpaths has been brought to our attention on numerous occasions. We must ensure that when a person leaves his or her home in a wheelchair, he or she can reach his or her destination. They should be able to travel along footpaths with dish kerbs in place that enable access for wheelchairs, not the current situation.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Although I welcome the introduction of a disability access certificate confirming the designs of new non-domestic buildings and apartment blocks will comply with Part M of the building regulations, I have severe reservations about the process of seeking High Court injunctions to stop the construction of new buildings if their designs have not been granted disability access or fire safety certificates or if an enforcement notice served by the local authority has not been complied with. There must be a simpler way of dealing with such problems.</P>
      <P>I am aware that with regard to energy performance the heating and cooling of buildings account <Col N="1852"/>for an estimated 45% of energy consumption and of related CO<?oasys _of8- ?>2 emissions. The conservation of energy in buildings must be a key part of any energy policy at national or EU level and is a cornerstone of the national climate change strategy. The Bill, together with new building regulations, will put Ireland to the forefront of the EU in driving energy efficiency in our homes, offices, factories and other commercial buildings. This will be a win win situation for energy savings and the environment.</P>
      <P>The Minister was right in saying that good builders are being penalised because of rogue builders who are allowed to do as they like in a race to the bottom. There is pressure on good builders who want to construct safe apartment blocks that comply with standards but who cannot compete with rogue builders who take short cuts, do not use proper materials and fail to put fire prevention measures in place etc. The Minister must review the matter and if necessary introduce new legislation that will give teeth to local authorities to enable them to force builders to operate properly and finish estates.</P>
      <P>Currently local authorities are not in a position to deal with the obligations placed on them in this regard. We impose new duties on our local authorities from time to time, even though they do not always have the relevant personnel to carry out such duties. We must, therefore, be realistic when passing this legislation and ensure the necessary personnel are in place to implement its provisions. An example of the current farcical situation is the ongoing controversy relating to the failure of local authorities to take charge of unfinished housing estates. In numerous areas in my constituency it took ten or 12 years before such estates were taken in charge. This is a significant problem in Dublin as I am sure Deputy Finian McGrath could confirm. I have heard him raise the issue at council level.</P>
      <P>This is a progressive Bill. I thank the Minister for introducing it and commend it to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Building Control Bill. This is an issue we all deal with on a daily basis. The area is a mess and cowboy builders give a bad name to everybody involved in the business. We regularly have to deal with situations where developers commence estates but never finish the job. The enforcement sections of the local authorities of which I have experience are inadequate to deal with the challenges they face with regard to developers who try to get around the regulations to avoid doing the required work.</P>
      <P>There seems to be a total lack of communication between roads, planning and enforcement departments of local authorities. For example, bonds are deposited in planning departments and set aside in case the developer does not complete an estate. I know of a particular case where the bond deposited would not even complete the <Col N="1853"/>fencing around the estate. The estate was built on the banks of a river and needed specific fencing so that children could not access the river, but the bond left behind after the developer up and left would not even cover the cost of the fencing. There is something seriously wrong when planning authorities do not insist on a decent bond to ensure that if the developer does a runner we can get the works done. This is a regular problem. Although local authorities have become more conscious of developers not completing estates, the bonds appear to be wholly inadequate in ensuring that work is completed. As a result, the developer knows that if the council forecloses on the bond, it may cost him less than finishing the work.</P>
      <P>While under the Planning and Development Act 2000 a local authority can refuse to consider any future applications from a particular developer, the local authority would have to go to court to implement it. That is unacceptable. Such a matter should be dealt with in the daily planning process. If a developer cannot finish one estate, an authority should not have to go to court to refuse planning permission to commence works on another estate.</P>
      <P>There has been some progress on &ldquo;taking in charge&rdquo; under the Planning and Development Act 2000, but the efforts are inadequate. For example, I know of a number of estates where the local authority has argued that if it is forced to take charge of the estates, it will not do any work on them because of a lack of resources. We are back to square one again. If the local authority at any stage took any type of enforcement proceedings against a developer, they seem to get away scot free. The whole thing is a mess, leading to huge frustration among people living in what can only be described as war-torn estates. In one estate I know of, manhole covers were not provided, and footpaths were not put down. Clause 804 material was put down to serve as a footpath and driveway into the estate. It was left in such a state by the developer. It took years to get the local authority to step in and carry out the works there. This is the type of mess being dealt with around the country at the moment. The Government needs to consider this area again. I am glad we are strengthening enforcement, but it is pointless unless the enforcement offices of the local authority are properly resourced, which is not the case at the moment.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State to consider bringing together the legal expertise in various local authorities. Some local authorities have their own legal expertise while others employ a private solicitor. The issue of planning and development and enforcement of the regulations is complex, and we should look at shared legal services as this would be most effective. I find that even when files go to the county solicitor to be processed legally, it can take years to move them along, track people down or deal with the nuances in <Col N="1854"/>the legislation and so on. We consider this option in every other area and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, discusses it <i>ad nauseum</i> with regard to health services. A group of experts in a shared services facility controlled by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government would be a positive development.</P>
      <P>Before turning to the issue of housing densities I refer to the matter of disability access certificates in the context of this Bill. There are a number of houses, owned by local authorities, which would not meet the requirements of a disability access certificate. Many were constructed before relevant legislation came into force. However, in conjunction with grant aided work carried out on local authority houses, we should consider making buildings as accessible as possible. It may not be feasible with some buildings. This would save returning to the property on foot of a disabled person&rsquo;s grant and going through the process again. Accessibility works should be done when a property is being worked on anyway. I ask the Department to consider this.</P>
      <P Just="Left">My main reason for speaking on this Bill is housing densities, which are now unbelievable. In the county of Roscommon, which is very rural, the main growth is in the south. The fastest-growing area in the county is in the environs of Athlone. The residential density guidelines refer to greenfield sites in the vicinity of towns, stating that only eight to ten houses should be built per hectare. The document also indicates that when evaluations are being done on housing densities, a number of criteria should be taken into account, with the proximity to a town or city centre or available facilities being examples.</P>
      <P>In my parish in the Bealnamulla and Monksland area, there is no public transport but massive apartment blocks are being built. These are turning into ghettos. Public amenities and public facilities are not being provided. There is not enough room in the estates to park all the vehicles of residents. The local authorities are nonetheless encouraging developers to put in more housing. It has gone out of control. There are incentives to build because of the development charges, the housing density guidelines and so on. I do not know how applicable these guidelines are today. They discuss open space and general landscaping. There is no public open space in this community, and the only portion of public open space is on the county boundary between Roscommon and Westmeath. The only amenities are a soccer and GAA pitch, which must cater for an ever-increasing community.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Another element which should be taken into consideration is the provision of footpaths and pedestrian access. There is not even a footpath from the County Roscommon side to the boundary with County Westmeath. With regard to traffic safety, roundabouts are not being put in. Crossroad junctions are being created with major <Col N="1855"/>housing estates on both sides of the road, there are no traffic lights, and people are taking their lives in their hands getting into and out of estates.</P>
      <P>The guidelines also discuss the creation of area action plans. In County Roscommon, we are coming into the fifth year of our county development plan, and the first local area action plan is only now going on public display. The local authority does not have the engineering and technical staff available to ensure that these plans are developed, or that development is occurring in a structured and sensible manner.</P>
      <P>Placing massive apartment blocks on greenfield sites away from town centres, without any public amenities or public transport put in place will create ghettos for tomorrow. One suggestion by Fine Gael for combating anti-social behaviour was that consultation should take place with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in planning major housing estates. I have come across a couple of developments where planning permission has been granted for alleged green areas which no houses overlook and which are completely closed off to the public. I brought it to the attention of planners and they laughed at me. They do not regard the issue as relating to anti-social behaviour.</P>

	<P>In the event of a decision to cease sugar production in Ireland, a restructuring fund of up to &euro;145 million becomes available for the economic, social and environmental costs of restructuring the Irish sugar industry. The fund is subject to the submission of a detailed restructuring plan for the industry involving factory closure and the renunciation of sugar quota.</P>
        <P>Since the necessary EU legislation has not yet been adopted, it is not possible to make a definitive statement about entitlements under the fund or the procedures for renouncing quota. The political agreement on reform of the EU sugar regime provides that at least 10% of the restructuring fund shall be reserved for sugar beet growers and machinery contractors to compensate notably for losses arising from investment in specialised machinery. That proportion may be <Col N="1856"/>increased by member states after consultation with interested parties provided an economically sound balance between the elements of the restructuring plan is ensured.</P>
        <P>The final legal texts giving effect to the reform agreement could not be considered and approved by the Council of Ministers until the opinion of the European Parliament had been received. That opinion was delivered on 19 January and it is anticipated that the legal texts will be ready for approval by the Council of Agriculture Ministers next week. Meanwhile, the European Commission is working on the preparation of detailed implementation rules which can only be finalised once the Council texts have been adopted. This will be a complex measure to implement and until all the various legal texts have been adopted, it will not be possible to provide details of the definitive implementation arrangements.</P>

	<P>Deputy Upton will be on my side in that case. The spokesperson for the Minister was quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> last week as saying that specific percentages were left out of the &euro;145 million for each of the stakeholders, including workers and Greencore. Can the Minister clarify that?</P>
        <P>Greencore is quoted last week as stating it has a clear legal entitlement to compensation under the &euro;145 million fund. Can she clarify that?</P>
        <P>Who owns the quota? The Minister has told the House in the past that it is a production system that nobody owns. Why then is the EU buying back quota from member states? In that context what rights and entitlements have farmers who purchased quota in the past number of years?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>What is attributable to a spokesperson is not necessarily what is printed. Under the package put forward there will be a single farm payment, which will be made available to the farmers. There will be a special fund of &euro;44 million for farmers for diversification. At least 10% of the &euro;145 million will be available to the contractors and farmers. There is nothing specific about workers.</P>
        <P>Greencore has a legal entitlement. The determination of that entitlement cannot be decided until the legal text has been passed and other methodologies put in place.</P>
        <P>The Deputy himself answered the question on who owns the quota, because it is a system. The European Union is quenching quota, not buying it back, and those sugar companies which wish to remain in production will pay a levy to do so.</P><Col N="1857"/>
        <P>A proposal has been put to me by the IFA concerning losses attributable to the changes that have taken place. It has set its stall out on what it considers the losses to be and the purchase of quota will be taken into consideration in determining that figure.</P>

	<P>The Commissioner is quoted on a number of occasions as saying the Commission will buy back quota. Can the Minister clarify that? If it is buying back quota the question of ownership arises.</P>
        <P>Has she clarified Greencore&rsquo;s entitlement to compensation? Will the levy the Minister mentioned have to be paid in the current year, should sugar production continue in 2006?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I did not say farmers who purchased quota were a special case. I said farmers put forward a case for &euro;106 million and have employed a specialist to do that on their behalf. The proposal will be evaluated in due course. Equally, Greencore has put together an evaluation of its view of its entitlements, which will also be determined in due course.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The entitlement will be determined in a fair, balanced and transparent way under certain procedures and with permission from the Commission. The Commission is not buying back quota but asking sugar manufacturers to renounce quota, so taking the quota out of the system altogether.</P>
        <P>There is over-production of sugar and there are pricing problems and, as the Deputy knows, a WTO panel decision went against the European Union. Those are the reasons why we had to reform the sugar industry in the first place.</P>
        <P>I travelled to Brussels last Thursday morning to meet with the Commissioner to seek clarification on a number of issues. It is, after all, a package worth &euro;310 million. I received clarification on a number of issues. The requirement to deliver beet in the year preceding the year of quota renunciation has been removed, which was very important. I worked with farmers to determine the reference years for entitlement to single farm payments and I believe we have made the right decision. I also received clarification that sugar produced in the first year of the reform will be liable for the restructuring levy but, in the event <Col N="1858"/>of the quota being renounced for the second year, the levy will not be payable in that or subsequent years.</P>
        <P>There are often misquotes so I will clarify further. The levy, &euro;25 million this year, depends on whether sugar is produced this year, which will determine whether we grow sugar.</P>

	<P>As a member of the EU and the World Trade Organisation Ireland is in a position to avail of opportunities for trade that are essential for the development of our open economy. Membership of these organisations also brings reciprocal trade obligations. The principle is that imported animal products meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, member states. All such imports must come from third countries or areas of third countries that have been approved by the EU authorities for export to the EU.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Irish farmers are required to ensure their production systems and farm practices fully comply with a wide range of EU directives on important matters including traceability, animal health and welfare and consumer protection. I fully support, therefore, the policy that animal products imported into the EU from third countries meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, EU member states. Indeed the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, has been in contact with the European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, Mr. Markos Kyprianou, on this point and on the related point of labelling.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Commissioner has made it clear that the Commission will not hesitate to take the appropriate protection measures if a product imported from a third country or produced in the domestic market represents a risk for the health of EU consumers, livestock or plants. He pointed out that the Commission&rsquo;s adoption of restrictive measures with regard to the finding of residues of unauthorised substances in poultry meat and the <Col N="1859"/>quick and proportionate protective measures applied to imports of beef as a result of the recent outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in Brazil demonstrate the Commission&rsquo;s primary objective of maintaining the high sanitary status of the Community and respecting the EU&rsquo;s commitment under the WTO agreement on sanitary and phytosanitary measures. All measures adopted by the Community on import restrictions for human or animal health reasons are discussed and agreed at meetings of the standing committee on animal health and the food chain.  Senior veterinarians from all member states attend these meetings. In terms of the foot and mouth outbreak in Argentina, for example, the standing committee yesterday adopted a Commission proposal to ban imports of meat from the Corrientes region of Argentina.</P>

I am trying to clarify the correlation in terms of levels of inspection between exporting South American countries and the expectations of EU countries.</P>
        <P>When the Minister of State stated &ldquo;that it is a requirement that animal products imported in third countries meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in and trade between member states&rdquo;, he rehearsed a reply given to two questions I asked in December. However, the Minister seemed to contradict that in December when she noted: &ldquo;with respect to traceability and controls of residues of veterinary medicines, the purpose of EU legislation is not to impose on exporting third countries a system of guarantees that is equal to the EU system.&rdquo; I am confused as to the difference between these two <Col N="1860"/>answers and the implications thereof but perhaps the Minister of State will clarify the matter.</P>

        <P>With regard to the operation of EU controls on exports from Brazil, an FVO inspection to evaluate animal health and public health control systems and the traceability and certification procedures in place in that country has recently been carried out. Arising from this the Commission presented a proposal to the standing committee on the food chain and animal health yesterday to address some of the shortcomings in the Brazilian animal traceability system identified by the FVO. These additional certification requirements are designed to demonstrate that no contact has occurred between animals of different or lower health status, vaccinated animals and meat from areas where there is no vaccination programme is also identified and meat for export to the EU is derived only from deboned and matured meat from areas free of the foot and mouth virus. That standing committee, which continues to meet, is also considering other issues.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, who recently introduced regulations to give legal effect to Ireland&rsquo;s national action programme under the directive.</P>
        <P>In the context of the nitrates directive, it is not possible to talk in terms of the disposal of surplus manure. An underlying principle of the directive is nutrient balance, which means that nutrients may be spread on land only to the extent that they will be taken up by crops. I am aware this has implications for pig and poultry producers in particular, as they generally will not have enough land of their own to utilise the manures that their activities generate. Considerable efforts have already been made to alleviate the impact of the nitrates regulations on the pig and poultry industries and to help farmers in meeting their obligations.</P>
        <P>A significant concession was secured in December, just before the regulations were finalised, when the European Commission recognised that 80% of the country&rsquo;s pigs are produced in units licensed by the EPA under the integrated pollution control directive. As a result, the regulations provide that the EPA must review all licences by October 2007 but that, in the meantime, these producers will not be bound by the provisions of the nitrates regulations on nutrient management. This means that, until a producer&rsquo;s licence has been reviewed by the EPA, he or she can continue to operate under the terms of the existing licence. It also means the farmers taking producers&rsquo; slurry will be able to operate under their existing nutrient management plans. This provides a vital window for the larger pig producers to adapt to the new regulations, for example, by finding additional spread lands, modifying their feeding regimes or acquiring new machinery for separating solids and liquids.</P>
        <P>My officials are in negotiations with the European Commission on a revised farm waste management scheme and I met the Commissioner last week to emphasise the importance of the matter. The revision of the scheme will make it available for the first time to pig and poultry producers. Among the proposed improvements is an increase in the grant rate for both animal housing and slurry storage from the current rate of 40% to 60%, with 70% being available in some counties. Other elements of the scheme will include significantly higher investment ceilings and the removal of any minimum income requirement from the scheme.</P>
        <P>Given that pig and poultry manure is high in phosphorus, there will be a limit to the amount of land on which it can be spread. The most suitable outlet for this kind of manure is tillage land.</P><Col N="1862"/>
        <?oasys _fc ?>
        <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
        <P>There is more than enough tillage land in the country to utilise all the pig and poultry manure but I am conscious that not all producers have tillage land available nearby. The high liquid content of pig manure makes it expensive to transport. Pig producers should, therefore, start looking seriously at technology for separating solids and liquids. Subject to Commission approval of the new farm waste management scheme, I plan to offer grant aid for that kind of technology. I also urge other farmers to show solidarity with pig and poultry producers by taking their manure instead of using chemical fertiliser. I have asked Teagasc to undertake a promotion campaign to demonstrate the nutrient value of slurry and the savings that farmers can achieve by substituting it for chemical fertiliser. I am also urging REPS planners to encourage their clients to use pig manure on their farms.</P>
        <P>Most of the controversy in recent days has centred on the nutrient management provisions of the regulations. These were finalised following difficult negotiations with the Commission&rsquo;s scientific experts, with both Departments making use of the advice provided by Teagasc. It was the Commission, however, which determined the final content of the regulations. Teagasc has recently indicated that it may be possible to review part of the advice it had given on the application of phosphorus in a way that could improve the effectiveness of the regulations. The Government and the European Commission saw merit in allowing Teagasc time to elaborate this new advice and, accordingly, the Minister, Deputy Roche, announced a brief <i>de facto</i> deferral of the implementation of part 3 of the regulations. Teagasc has been requested to provide, as a matter of urgency, the necessary scientific case to support any revision of the phosphorus tables in the regulations. The two Departments will carefully consider any submission received from Teagasc, while also bearing in mind that any proposals for revision of the phosphorus tables will have to respect the environmental requirements associated with the nitrates directive and meet with the agreement of the European Commission.</P>
        <P>Teagasc has not been specifically requested to review its advice on nitrogen issues. However, if its revised submission on crop nutrient requirements suggests further beneficial adjustments to the regulatory regime, these will of course be considered. The possibility of such further adjustments will also depend on their respecting the environmental requirements involved and on their acceptance by the European Commission. The disposal of residual materials from public sewerage works is not a matter for my Department.</P>

	<P>I too congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace. We will soon have plenty of agricultural expertise outside north Dublin. I regret that I did not hear the remainder of the Minister&rsquo;s reply because I hoped it would deal in more depth with the issues of chicken litter and mushroom compost. I am sure that she is aware of the disagreements between the IFA and Teagasc and that the former has withdrawn from partnership talks as a direct result of its unhappiness with the nitrates decision. Yesterday, the secretary to the IFA, Mr. Jim Devlin, told a European committee meeting that there would be detrimental consequences for the intensive farming industry.</P>
        <P>I refer specifically to the pig, poultry, mushroom and grain producers where, because of the interdependency that exists in those sectors, knock-on effects are created when difficulties arise. Issues also arise for tillage farmers, who said they will not be able to store the nutrients they are expected to spread on their land. All the groups concerned will experience significant difficulties in the future. What assurances for the future can the Minister give to pig producers? With poultry and mushroom producers, they represent the lifeblood of my Cavan-Monaghan constituency. She raised the issue of finding land on which to spread the manure but the land is not available and farmers must depend on the good-will of third parties. However, no farmer will be able to take slurry or chicken litter.</P>
        <P>With regard to short-term derogations, it took Denmark and the Netherlands two years to receive their derogations. Currently, Austria is also seeking a derogation. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments on these matters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has raised a number of issues. I appreciate the problems in the Cavan-Monaghan area, although that is not to detract from the other parts of the world that have issues with the pig and poultry sector. The Minister of State and I have met the Monaghan people on a number of occasions. There are a number of problems, the first of which is a lack of information. This is a major problem which is why I placed an advertisement in the newspapers and I hope, now that Part 3 has been set aside until further information is available, that we can bring this matter to finality as quickly as possible. We need to meet the farmers, talk to them and support them.</P>
        <P>In recognition of the pig and poultry sector, I have provided funding this year specifically for new technologies to support both industries, including centrifuge systems to reduce liquid waste, new technologies for chicken litter and a number of other proposals. We have invited proposals from people and are anxious to work with them to ensure that these new schemes will progress. Under the farm waste management scheme, I will provide some funding to the pig <Col N="1864"/>industry which will allow it to be recognised for the first time and be supported to the best of our ability.</P>
        <P>It is important that farming fraternities work together and that people support each other. Most pig producers have customers and their concern is based on a fear of the customer, that the implications of the directive will be such that they would lose their single farm payment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The revised farm waste management scheme will be introduced by my Department as soon as the required EU state aid approval has been received. A formal application seeking Commission approval for the revised scheme was submitted on 30 September last. The application has been the subject of ongoing negotiations between the Commission and my Department in the intervening period. A number of outstanding issues remain, in particular the reluctance of the Commission to accept that a period longer than one year is required for completion of all necessary works by Irish farmers. This is the key issue for us given the large volume of work to be undertaken and the particular need to ensure consistency with timescales and deadlines already agreed in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s action programme on implementation of the directive.</P>
        <P>Last week I met Commissioner Fischer Boel and explained to her the importance of this issue for Irish farmers and the urgent need for the early introduction of the revised scheme. The Commissioner was positive in her response and I am confident that the outstanding issues can be resolved quickly.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the new scheme, when introduced, will provide a very satisfactory financial package for Irish farmers who are required to undertake works to comply with the additional requirements of the directive. I have provided a sum of &euro;43 million in this year alone for the scheme and I envisage a total expenditure of close to &euro;250 million to complete the programme. Subject to receipt of the said EU approval, the proposed changes will include the introduction of a standard grant rate of 60%, with 70% being available in the four zone C counties, for both animal housing and slurry storage. The current standard grant rate for such work is 40%. The scheme will be extended to include horses, deer, goats, pigs and poultry, and mushroom compost. The extension of the scheme to the pig and poultry sectors is particularly significant.</P>
        <P>The revised scheme will also see an increase in the maximum eligible investment from &euro;75,000 to &euro;120,000 per holding and the removal of any minimum requirement from farming from the scheme so that all small farmers can participate. The scheme also incudes the introduction of a new 40% grant rate for specialised equipment with specific environmental advantages subject to a maximum eligible investment of &euro;80,000 in the case of decanter centrifuge systems and dry feeding systems for pigs and &euro;40,000 in the case of specialised slurry spreading tankers and related <Col N="1866"/>equipment. Eligibility for aid under the scheme of earth-lined stores will be included as soon as the technical specifications for such are finalised.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s response but many farmers are anxious to get ahead with the necessary provision of animal housing. The announcement of the scheme was made on 29 July last. The scheme was not sent to Brussels for approval until 29 September. The Minister has advised that farmers should apply for planning permission but it is difficult to do so without knowing to what types of developments the grant aid will apply. There are no specifications as such for earthen banking, for example, or other types of development.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister have any idea when the scheme will be up and running and when farmers will have a simple form to fill out? Will we have a situation similar to that which pertained in the past where there is a 60 page form that will take an enormous amount of time and effort by farmers, or highly paid advisers, to fill out? The Minister said that the scheme will be open to small farmers, those with fewer than 20 livestock units. Has that been finalised? If so, such farmers should not have to pay enormous sums of money to specialist advisers.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am often more political than Deputy Naughten. Farmers with fewer than 20 livestock units will be included in the scheme. I have seen the forms and the supplementary information, which have been simplified to the best of our ability. I agree with Deputy Crawford that people should not have to pay an exorbitant sum of money to have small jobs done. The documents are ready for the printers, with a view to going very quickly. I hope to have the earthen bank specifications ready in the next few days.</P>
        <P>The only impasse we have had on the state aid rule has been a lack of trust on the part of the Commission that the reason we were introducing <Col N="1867"/>this scheme over a three-year rather than one-year period was to undermine the directive. I assured the Commissioner that was not the case and that the real reason was that farmers would find it difficult to get people to do the necessary work. I do not want a situation whereby farmers are forced to pay high prices because of tight deadlines when that should not be the case. She has taken on board our genuine concerns. I wrote to her on Friday, following my meeting with her on Thursday, which was very positive and I expect to receive sanction soon. Then we will disseminate the information to everybody as quickly as possible. I have also freed up staff to ensure there will be no delays with inspections and support for farmers.</P>

        <Quest>the value of the potato seed industry here, including separately domestic sales and export sales; if her Department has carried out a study to assess the impact of the proposed genetically modified potato trial on consumer confidence in view of the fact that cross-contamination with genetically modified pollen would not be detected until after an affected non-genetically modified potato crop has been put on the market; and her views on the BASF plan to test genetically modified potatoes in County Meath.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The value of the seed potato industry in 2005 is estimated at &euro;5.8 million and the value of sales of certified seed potatoes on the domestic market in 2005 is estimated at &euro;2.8 million, with exports valued at &euro;170,000.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The notification by BASF to trial genetically modified potatoes was made to the Environmental Protection Agency in accordance with Part B of EU Directive 2001/18/EC on the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment, as transposed into Irish legislation by the Genetically Modified Organisms (Deliberate Release) Regulations 2003.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While the Department is responsible for developing coexistence arrangements between authorised GM and non-GM crops, it has no role with regard to experimental trials such as the one applied for in County Meath. This is a matter solely for the EPA. Since procedures under legislation are in play it would be inappropriate to comment on this particular application.</P>
        <?oasys _dc14- ?>
        <P Just="Left">There is consumer concern about GMOs. It was for that reason that a series of legislative measures has been adopted by the EU over the past few years to ensure the highest possible standards of food safety are in place and that the environment is fully protected. These legislative measures have been adopted by the co-decision procedure involving the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers. Furthermore, the European Food Safety <Col N="1868"/>Authority, which was established in 2002, provides independent scientific risk assessment on all GMO applications which should help further to allay consumer concerns.</P>
        <?oasys _dc0- ?>
        <P>The legislative measures which the Department is responsible for relate to the placing on the market of authorised feed and the cultivation of GM crops. With regard to the latter, I am in the process of drawing up coexistence measures between GM and non-GM crops in Ireland. I have a report produced by an interdepartmental working group which sets out a strategy and best practices for coexistence arrangements here. I have sought submissions from the public on the report to assist me in drawing up statutory based coexistence controls here in due course.</P>
        <P el="10">
          <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
        </P>
        <P>In the evaluation of potential GM crops in Ireland, the report identifies the potato as a crop that presents a low risk of gene flow that cannot outcross with any other Irish crop or wild relatives here in Ireland. The report states that the potential for the adventitious presence of non-GM potatoes could only arise if significant numbers of tubers remained in the ground post-harvest which, if not properly managed, could lead to their presence in subsequent crops.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, on her appointment. Given that her constituency is in County Meath, she will start with this hot potato and will not be allowed to drop it, judging by the reaction to the issue I have seen.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, acknowledge that the trials of GM potato will not have any economic benefit for Irish farmers or consumers? These trials are wholly for the benefit of the company which wants to advertise worldwide that it grew a crop in a country prone to blight. Will the Minister of State acknowledge that the unpopularity of GM products in third countries, which we rely on for markets, particularly in Irish seed potatoes, will be jeopardised by these trials and Scottish seed potatoes will benefit from Ireland&rsquo;s loss, just as Ireland will benefit from Denmark&rsquo;s loss as a result of the cartoon controversy?</P>
        <P>What measures will the Department take to compensate for the damage these trials, which are entirely in BASF&rsquo;s interest but are of no benefit to Irish farmers or consumers, will cause in terms of the marketability of Irish seed potatoes? Almost 80% of our potato market is based on roosters, Kerr&rsquo;s pinks and Rush queens. Irish people buy varieties of potatoes and they certainly do not want to buy GM potatoes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Sargent is trying to pre-empt the processing of the application by the Environmental Protection Agency. We have a strong working relationship with the Department <Col N="1869"/>of Agriculture and Rural Affairs in Scotland. I spent part of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day 2005 discussing this issue with the Scottish Minister. We have a good relationship and we both want to ensure we protect our plant health status as a high grade seed area. The Environmental Protection Agency will assess this application based on the stringent procedures already in place that transpose the directive under the statutory instrument of 2003.</P>
        <P>We have a national policy on GM technology. Policy statements were issued in October 1999 and October 2000. All of this comes from the co-decision making process of the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers, where legislative measures binding on all member states were put in place with the relevant safeguards. That EU-wide regulatory framework applies to genetically modified organisms and we have the most stringent safeguards in the world on GMOs. These are aimed at achieving a high degree of human health and environmental protection while safeguarding consumer choice and ensuring WTO compatibility.</P>
        <P>The subsidiarity principle is exercised in matters of coexistence and, as I stated in my reply, the Minister has established an interdepartmental working group and a report has been published. We are seeking submissions from interested groups and individuals and the closing date for submissions has been extended from January to March of this year. Members of this House have already made a submission. The Minister will then set in place the coexistence regulations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State said that stringent measures are already in place but he also said that we still have a draft proceeding so nothing has been finalised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The European Union regulations have not been finalised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The coexistence draft regulation has not been finalised and taking Spain as an example, coexistence has resulted in contamination. We have much windier conditions that Spain so we must do more thinking on this before we sign off on those coexistence plans. They are not foolproof.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State do anything to safeguard the marketability of Irish seed potatoes in the likely event of contamination? The contamination will not be detected until after a crop has been harvested because of the time it takes to manifest itself in the next generation of seed potatoes. The Minister of State cannot offer safeguards unless he takes steps to prevent Ireland going down the GM road, particularly given that it will also jeopardise other farmers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
        <Quest>the discussions she has had with the EU Commission and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government regarding a derogation under the nitrates directive; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[5640/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The Minister has recently made regulations giving legal effect to Ireland&rsquo;s national action programme under the directive.</P>
        <P>The fact the Minister made the regulations enabled Ireland to begin the formal process of seeking approval for a derogation designed to allow certain farmers to operate, under appropriate conditions and controls, up to a level of 250 kilograms of organic nitrogen per hectare per annum. The Department of Agriculture and Food is taking the lead in this matter and, with the support of Teagasc, will continue to work with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government towards achieving a successful outcome.</P>
        <P>The process commenced formally at a meeting of the EU nitrates committee in December, when an outline of Ireland&rsquo;s proposal was presented. Detailed discussions between officials of the Departments of Agriculture and Food and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the European Commission took place subsequently. Following these discussions, a detailed scientific argument in support of the proposal was finalised and has been submitted to the Commission.</P>
        <P>The proposal will be discussed again at future meetings of the nitrates committee before approval can be obtained. Securing this derogation is vital for the most productive dairy farmers in particular, and it is important the position on the regulations is clarified at an early date so the negotiations on the derogation can proceed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the European Commission&rsquo;s consideration of the derogation been suspended and, if so, on what grounds? Is the Commission satisfied with the scientific evidence Ireland has provided, given that the evidence we provided during discussion of the nitrates <Col N="1871"/>directive was, it seems, wholly inadequate? As the Minister will be aware, Teagasc has indicated it is prepared to review nitrogen levels. Has the Minister asked the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to request Teagasc to review the nitrogen tables in the directive with a view to facilitating discussions taking place on the derogation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>On the derogation, a meeting of the nitrates committee will be held in March. It is unlikely, however, that discussions on a derogation for Ireland will take place on the basis that current discussions on the suspended Part 3 have not concluded. On the scientific evidence provided, Teagasc provides this evidence to my Department and, in particular, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The scientific evidence was submitted on the basis that discussions and negotiations were taking place with the Commission. Some of this evidence was accepted by the Commission and some was not.</P>
        <P>I wrote to the chairman of Teagasc several weeks ago requesting that his organisation make available the additional scientific evidence on phosphates which had been brought to my attention. This has appeared in draft form and will be discussed by the Teagasc board on 20 February. I am led to believe the evidence will also cover other issues and these will also be considered, albeit in the context of my specific request for information on phosphates.</P>
        <P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government commented on Tuesday on what the position would be should robust scientific evidence become available. Deputy Naughten may not wish to hear this but he will eventually remember that the nitrates directive is not my responsibility but that of another Minister. The Minister stated in the House on Tuesday that if robust scientific evidence is made available to him, he will be more than happy to work with me in persuading the Commission to address the issues of concern. I assume the board of Teagasc will notify these to me on Monday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I am completely lost, having heard so many twists and turns on this issue from the Minister and her colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Has either Minister asked Teagasc to examine the nitrogen tables?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>If the science stands up and the Commission agrees, the tables will be changed. If the Commission does not agree to changes, we will be powerless to proceed. The scientific evidence will be made available on Monday, whereupon it will be evaluated by the two Departments which will, with Teagasc, negotiate with the Commission on that basis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The role of Teagasc is to provide integrated research, advisory and training services for the agriculture and food industry. It is a matter for Teagasc to determine the most effective means of providing advice on the requirements of the nitrates regulations as they apply to individual holdings. I expect, however, that such advice would be delivered primarily via this existing network. Advisers and consultants in the private sector will provide similar advisory services. The fact the nitrates regulations will specify maximum fertiliser limits means farmers will require advice, in particular about making the maximum use of the nutrients in livestock manure. This is an area in which Teagasc can play a critical role.</P><Col N="1873"/>
        <P>Teagasc will also make important contributions in other areas. My Department is in discussions with it about arrangements for the delivery of information for farmers on the practical implications of the regulations. I have also asked Teagasc to undertake a promotion campaign to demonstrate the nutrient value of slurry and savings farmers can achieve by substituting it for chemical fertiliser. It is particularly important for REPS planners, both in Teagasc and the private sector, to encourage their clients to utilise pig manure on their farms. Teagasc will have an important role in ongoing research and undertaking, participating in or contributing to the specific research commitments contained in the nitrates action plan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I offer my congratulations to the new Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Mary Wallace. It is interesting that the only mention of women in the run-up to the latest appointments of Ministers of State was in the context of demotion rather than promotion. This is indicative of the fact that journalists are sometimes badly wrong.</P>
        <P>While I am not an expert on agriculture, in meetings with farmers I have been impressed by their compelling argument on the issue of nitrates. Teagasc must act in accordance with scientific evidence and the specified limits. Will the nitrates limits give rise to difficulties regarding the use of animal waste and waste from local authority treatment plants? Several years ago, problems arose regarding the means of disposing of rendered meat and bonemeal. Will similar problems occur as a result of the advice Teagasc issues to farmers on the use of animal waste and waste from local authority treatment plants?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Stocking density and nutrient management are matters of concern. Concerns about the disposal of organic fertiliser have arisen in particular sectors, notably the extensive dairy, pig and poultry sectors. The Deputy is correct that farmers will need to work with Teagasc and private advisers to address these concerns and deal with nutrient management. On local authority waste, the use of sludges has been raised in discussions although, as Deputy Naughten should note, the matter is outside my remit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I am a little hard of hearing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Catherine Murphy is correct that concerns have arisen in her constituency, which includes substantial areas of tillage. I seek to provide support for those who have these concerns, including by attempting to ensure they are properly informed, which is unfortunately not the case. We will work with farmers to address their concerns. This is the reason we introduced the farm waste management scheme and a new technology package.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1874"/>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister referred to the dairy sector. Will the derogation be available to pig and poultry farmers? Has Teagasc investigated the possibility of using biomass plants to deal with the problem of waste from poultry, mushroom growing and so forth? We have plenty of land that could take pig manure. Is a genuine effort being made to minimise the red tape of transferring farmyard manure, which is a fertiliser, from pig farmers to grass or tillage farmers? This is the source of greatest anxiety. Those who want to and could accept the manure feel there is too much red tape and it would cause too many difficulties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>For the past three months, I have been saying precisely what the Deputy has been saying, which is that adequate spread lands are available. The concerns of customers of the pig and poultry sector need to be alleviated, which can be done only in the context of a working relationship, which unfortunately does not exist. However, we try to provide the greatest amount of information possible to farmers through CMMS and iMap in order to reduce paperwork and bureaucracy about which people have concerns. Ultimately, regardless of the argument, we must work with the people and support them to the best of our ability.</P>
        <P>We have done considerable work on biomass and, during the week, I allocated an additional &euro;2.5 million specifically for these issues to give an overall package of &euro;4.5 million. We are looking at stocking rate effects on grazing, season lengths, nitrates leeching on vulnerable soil types, which is important in the Deputy&rsquo;s constituency, assessment of solid-liquid separation systems for pig manure and the influence of pig diet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Those actions should have been taken five years ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is based on ongoing research between Teagasc and UCD. We are also considering reliable nutrient management and animal manures. We are considering emissions from land spreading of cattle slurry, cattle wintering facilities and greenhouse gas emissions from beef production systems. All these matters are very important, into which ongoing research is being carried out. The Deputy is right in saying that in some incidences new technologies will represent the answer.</P>
        <P>The derogation focuses on the spreading of livestock manure and slurry and seeks to change the level from 170 kg to 250 kg.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister knows, pig and poultry farmers do not have the land themselves.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree they do not have the spread lands, which is one of the issues that people were prepared&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The customer will be the beneficiary. Most pig farmers are not involved in tillage, which is why we need to consider practical steps such as diet. Much work has been done by the dietary experts. Much work has been done on centrifuges and separation. If people are prepared to work with me it may be possible to find other solutions for particular areas in order to transport slurry from one place to the other.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government if he will publish in full the Teagasc advice on nitrates and phosphates so that Teagasc clients can see the differences between the existing REPS and what is recommended in the directive?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>We will need to wait to see what the board agrees on Monday regarding the proposal that has been made. Teagasc made the results of the last scientific research available to the public. I assume that once it has been agreed and dealt with, there is no reason it cannot be made available. However, I would need to wait and could not give the Deputy a definitive answer. My assumption is that, as with any scientific evidence, these results would be made available to the public once the deliberations have been completed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, on her appointment.</P>
        <P>While we are very good Europeans, we sometimes jump in as we did in the case of the habitats directive when we designated too many areas. Given that this directive would criminalise farmers and would do considerable damage, would the Minister agree in retrospect that the Teagasc advice, which was meant as a guideline and not as gospel, was taken as such by Government and that it jumped too soon? If the decision were to be taken now, would the Government think differently about the issue?</P>

This is where we are and this is the problem. While we can blame whomever we want, ultimately that is the issue. Contrary to what has been said, the advice from Teagasc is the scientific advice to be made available to the State. It is either accepted or not accepted by the Commission. In some cases the Commission would not agree with the scientific advice made available. The directive should have little implication in the <Col N="1876"/>Deputy&rsquo;s constituency.

	<P>The EC biofuels directive sets indicative targets for member states of 2% market penetration for biofuels by end 2005. The targets in the directive are indicative and not mandatory. Ireland is starting from a very low current production base and the 2% target therefore represents a considerable challenge. The objective of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, who has primary responsibility for the development of renewable energy, including biofuels, is to ensure that Ireland meets the 2% target by 2008 mainly through targeted fiscal measures designed to stimulate market development.</P><Col N="1877"/>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>I am very conscious of the central role that agriculture can play in supplying the necessary raw materials for the production of biofuels. These raw materials can include oilseed rape, wheat and sugar beet for the manufacture of liquid transport biofuels, and forestry by-products and other farming and food by-products such as meat and bonemeal and tallow for energy and heat generation. Tallow can also be used in biodiesel production. Factors such as the increasing cost of oil, the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and the opportunity for farmers to explore alternative land uses following CAP reform, mean that the potential of this area must be fully explored.</P>
        <P>For the purposes of contributing to the development of policy on biofuels, the Department of Agriculture and Food in conjunction with COFORD and Teagasc has examined the potential of energy crops, wood biomass and farming and food by-products. In general, the production of energy crops for biofuels will need to be demand-led and production by farmers will only occur if the economic returns are greater than those offered by traditional crop enterprises. The production of liquid biofuels from energy crops, in the absence of fiscal incentives, is not economic at current oil price levels. The budget announcement of a major extension of the mineral oil tax relief scheme to cover, when the relief is fully operational, some 163 million litres of biofuels per year, should further stimulate the production of crops for the manufacture of liquid biofuels. This initiative will benefit the environment in terms of a reduction in CO<?oasys _of8- ?>2 emissions, enhance security of supply of fuels, and create jobs and outlets for agricultural production.</P>
        <P>As announced in the budget, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources also intends to launch several innovative grant schemes relating to biofuels, combined heat and power, biomass commercial heaters and domestic renewable heat grants. Within my area of responsibility, a range of developments are already under way or in the pipeline that will encourage the production and use of biofuels. These include grants to promote and develop sustainable forestry, including alternative timber use to reduce dependence on fossil fuels; promoting the use of wood biomass, for example by the installation of a wood heating system at the Department&rsquo;s offices at Johnstown Castle; funding of forest-to-energy pilot projects; willow planting promotion; supporting biofuels research under the research stimulus programme; grant aiding the application of new technologies such as anaerobic and aerobic digestion and fluidised bed combustion, with a renewable energy dimension; and the use of by-products for incineration and co-incineration in place of fossil fuels.</P>
        <P>There are also a number of important developments on the horizon at EU level. The Com<Col N="1878"/>mission has recently produced a biomass action plan and a strategy for biofuels. These are on the agenda for next week&rsquo;s meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council. In this context I will be seeking a review of the operation of the energy crops scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for the detailed reply. It was disappointing to hear Greencore&rsquo;s chairman say it would not be seeking to develop the biofuel business. This is a golden opportunity to do that and one that is being neglected. What type of information is being given to farmers to encourage them at least to examine the options in biofuels? Is an information and marketing programme being made available to them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a considerable amount of information and the new Minister of State will move on that agenda item fairly soon once she gets her feet on the ground, so to speak. A good deal of work has been done already on this initiative in the Department, with a specific proposal to drive it forward quickly. One of the issues is that farmers will regard &euro;45 per hectare as a nonsense. That is the reason I am raising the issue at Council on Monday because if we are to encourage people to grow energy crops, we will have to pay them. That will be a better incentive. We are doing a number of pilot projects as well. There is a good deal of interest in that and we hope to develop it over time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the Minister on the issue of the &euro;45 per hectare. It is wholly inadequate and if we are serious about this issue, we should put serious money into it because we are facing a significant bill in respect of carbon credits.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister comment on the plans, if any, she has to stimulate the use of sugar beet for the extraction of bioethanol? It is critically important we get some direction from her in that regard. When has the Minister met specifically with the Minister with responsibility for energy on the co-ordination of a biofuel industry in this country? The Minister is right. There is not much point in encouraging the use of biofuels if there is not the demand for it. To date, the Government has done nothing to encourage demand. There is little point in talking about production of 163 million litres of biofuel unless it will be utilised. The issue of demand is critically important. We have seen what happened in other countries. Are we prepared to do anything here?</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State has a good working relationship with the Minister with responsibility for energy, will she take the lead on this matter and ensure there is some type of co-ordination? Will she not agree that the frustration exists because there does not appear to be any co-ordi<Col N="1879"/>nation among Departments in terms of getting their act together on this issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is another factually incorrect statement from the Deputy. We have a very good working relationship. The Minister of State, Deputy Browne, met the energy people last week and there has been continued work&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>When did the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, meet the Minister of State?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State had a designated role in this issue. I work in consultation with my Ministers, whom I trust and who are more than capable of delivering the service. I worked to support them in this initiative. At the time, the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, was anxious to progress it quickly. We have done so. The demand was a difficulty but the excise duty issue has been dealt with by the Minister for Finance who is very supportive of alternative energies for many reasons. We also had the issue of hybrid cars, which was dealt with in the budget. Furthermore, we have had a large number of initiatives which were mentioned in the budget by the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey. They will be available very soon. They link in with the work I am doing with willows and thinnings. All these issues are being dealt with but the issue of the &euro;45 per acre will be the key that will unlock this issue.</P>
        <P>With regard to sugar beet, as Deputy Upton said, diversification is an option. A number of young farmers in north Cork spoke to me about that. Sugar beet is not included under the EU energy crop scheme but there is nothing to say we cannot pursue such a possibility given that many sugar beet farmers would like to continue to grow sugar beet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Does the Minister accept there is a need to bring about a significant cultural awareness of biofuel? Following the precedent she mentioned of woodchip installation in Johnstown, perhaps she would suggest at the Cabinet table that the ministerial cars be converted to biofuel or biodiesel or whatever might be feasible at the time. Does she accept that would be the strongest possible message to send out in the same way as we advocated using recycled products in Oireachtas stationery? It would also be a practical step to take.</P>
        <P>Has the Minister met or does she intend to meet an entrepreneur or anybody else interested in taking up the opportunity for bioethanol production, particularly with the demise of the sugar beet industry in Carlow? Would she be open to such a meeting given that there are people who need the reassurance of a long-term commitment when it comes to such a capital investment as would be taken to instigate a bioethanol indus<Col N="1880"/>try? Has she taken any steps to meet people in that regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>On the last question, those specific issues are a matter for the Minister with responsibility for energy, Deputy Noel Dempsey. However, we have a good working relationship and I have indicated on a number of occasions that any support we can give, in whatever way, will be forthcoming. The farming organisations have expressed an interest in alternative energies. One of the candidates was very forthright on that issue and continues to be. I assume that working relationship will continue. It is a question of all of us working together. On the State cars issue, I will express that view to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

        <Quest>if, in the aftermath of the Common Agricultural Policy and World Trade Organisation reforms, she is satisfied about the security and traceability of food and food products available in the Irish and European markets with specific reference to animal health and hygiene from husbandry to processing; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[5991/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>Detailed EU legislation lays down the conditions that member states must apply to the production of and trade in food products of animal origin, including the traceability aspects, as well as to imports of these products from third countries. It is a requirement that animal products imported from third countries meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, member states. All such imports must come from third countries or areas of third countries approved for export to the EU.</P>
        <P>While there is free movement for trade within the EU, all consignments from third countries must first be landed at a border inspection post, BIP, that has been approved by the Food and Veterinary Office and undergo documentary, identity and physical checks. These latter checks are carried out at frequencies laid down in EU law. The FVO carries out monitoring and inspection of each member state&rsquo;s BIPs to ensure the conditions for import of animal products into Europe provided under the harmonised legislation are being correctly applied.</P>
        <P>I fully support the policy that animal products imported into the EU from third countries meet <Col N="1881"/>standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, EU member states. In this context the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, has raised the issue with the Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, Mr. Markos Kyprianou, concerning the sanitary rules applying to the import of livestock products, especially beef, into the European Union. In particular, I have drawn the Commissioner&rsquo;s attention to the need for real equivalence on the specific and important issues of animal traceability, controls on veterinary medicines, prohibited substances and residue monitoring programmes in these countries and, in particular, with regard to Brazilian beef in light of its increasing presence on the European market.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Irish farmers are required to ensure that their production systems and farm practices fully comply with a wide range of EU directives on important matters, including traceability, animal health and welfare and consumer protection. These all have significant in-built cost factors and, bearing in mind that our farmers are in competition on European and international markets with low cost third country producers, I will continue to seek real equivalence in these areas, both in discussions within the EU and in the context of the WTO talks on market access.</P>
        <P>With regard to meat labelling, I am fully committed to ensuring that country of origin is clearly stated on the label. In this regard an enabling provision to allow for the extension of our comprehensive beef labelling regulations to include a requirement for information on the country of origin of beef to be provided to the consumer at the point of choice by establishments in the retail, restaurant and catering sectors, including food business operators, is before the Oireachtas by way of a proposed amendment to section 54 of the Health Act 1947 through the Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.</P>
        <P>While the proposed enabling legislation before the House will facilitate the extension of country of origin labelling to all meats, because of different traceability systems and some import-export complexities, it is not as straightforward for other meats as it is for beef. As with beef, EU approval would also be required. Notwithstanding these issues, I intend to pursue the matter of country of origin labelling at EU and national level with a view to full implementation at all points of choice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">On the issue of traceability, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland produced a report in 2004. We have been speaking about new legislation but in regard to existing legislation is the Minister of State concerned that one fifth of retail outlets in the trade do not meet the beef labelling regulations and, if so, what is the Department doing about it? Is the Minister of State concerned that the Food Safety Authority <Col N="1882"/>of Ireland found that 15% of beef labelled as Irish came from South America and was passed off as Irish food product? When did the Minister of State become aware of the Food Safety Authority report as I understand its contents were made available to the various supervisory agencies?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand Deputy Naughten raised that issue on the Adjournment recently with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children. The beef labelling requirement issues are centralised under the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. With regard to the issue of transformation, which has been raised constantly by Deputies Naughten and Upton, the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, has consistently raised it at EU level at the Council of Ministers and it will be raised shortly once again. The Bill going through the Oireachtas completed Report and Final Stages last evening and has to go back to the Seanad in respect of amendments made in this House. It will then be a matter of signing off on regulations to be presented to the EU for approval.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>The report to which Deputy Naughten referred is of considerable concern to all of us with an interest in protecting the Irish food industry and the Irish consumer. While the Food Safety Authority is not under the banner of the Minister of State in terms of funding, is it acceptable that there are only five auditors to deal with 43,000 food businesses and that when a small sample of 90 was taken, a high percentage of those fell outside the legal requirement? Surely there is a need to increase the level of auditing capacity and the level of enforcement to restore confidence in the industry and on behalf of the consumer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The point raised by the Deputy is one for the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and the Department of Health and Children. Of course, there is a strong working relationship between the Department of Agriculture and Food and agencies that have a relationship with the food and agriculture industry. I think the report to which Deputies Upton and Naughten referred is some years old. So far as I recall, there has been a more recent export&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Just to clarify for the information of the House, it is a 2004 report and no report has been completed since. In that report, which is the most recent since 2004, 42% of premises visited did not meet the existing labelling legislative requirements. In light of the fact that the Food Safety Authority of Ireland made that information available to the official agency with responsibility for supervising the various premises, some of which comes under the control of the Department of Agriculture and Food, what action has been taken to date? Is the Minister of State concerned about the contents of that report and, if so, what will be done to ensure this abuse is eradicated once and for all?</P>

	<P>I thank the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important matter which concerns the provision of dialysis facilities in the south-eastern region.</P>
        <P>The need for someone to receive renal dialysis places a difficult imposition and burden on their lives. It involves people attending a renal dialysis unit between two and three times a week and spending between three and four hours hooked up to a renal dialysis machine in order to stay alive. I understand the average age of people requiring renal dialysis is 69 and that more and more people are presenting each year requiring dialysis, primarily due to changes in lifestyle and habits.</P>
        <P>Few of us in the House would relish the prospect of spending three hours up to three times a week immobile and linked to a dialysis machine for the purpose of giving us essential and urgent medical treatment. However, there is a crisis in the provision of dialysis facilities in the south east, where many people, particularly in the Kilkenny and Carlow areas, are being forced to travel for dialysis services to Dublin. Some of these dialysis patients have advised that this can involve a round trip of up to ten hours, three <Col N="1885"/>times a week. This is an incredible and unjust imposition on people and their families. I have heard that a large number of patients are being treated at the renal dialysis unit at Waterford Regional Hospital and that because of pressure on the hospital facilities there, the dialysis services have had to be provided through the night.</P>
        <P>It is bad enough that any person should have to undertake dialysis two to three times a week, but it is even worse that he or she should be forced to travel long distances, or have the dialysis carried out during gravely anti-social hours. We are not just talking about the disruption on the person involved, we are also talking about the difficulties that are presented for their families and friends.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>The reason I raise this issue is that I understand from local patients that a privately funded renal dialysis unit has been commissioned and is open in Kilkenny. It has the capacity to treat all necessary patients from Carlow and Kilkenny who are travelling long distances or undergoing anti-social treatment. I have visited the renal dialysis centre in Kilkenny, which operates as a Wellstone clinic, which is an impressive and commendable initiative. I understand it has also been visited by many HSE representatives, the consultant nephrologist and representatives of the Irish Kidney Association. However, there is the farcical situation where patients in need of dialysis must pass by the door of the clinic in Kilkenny, either on their way to dialysis facilities in Dublin or in the middle of the night on their way to dialysis in Waterford. According to local patients, while the clinic can take patients for dialysis facilities, the HSE is not prepared to pay for the treatment and claims that there is some outstanding procurement process under way.</P>
        <P>I am not an expert in procurement law, but it strikes me that where there is a will there is a way. As a matter of policy, surely it must be open to the HSE and the Department of Health and Children to facilitate treatment of patients in circumstances where there is an urgent need in a manner that is most humane and accommodating to them, without raising unnecessary barriers.</P>
        <P>I am convinced by many of the local representations I have received that giving people access to the Wellstone clinic would make a considerable improvement in the quality of their life. It would enable people to spend more time with their families rather than on unnecessary and uncomfortable travel to Dublin for treatment that is not optional. As a matter of policy, I urge the Department to ensure that the HSE, while fully adhering to appropriate procurement processes, does not apply those processes in a way that unnecessarily hinders people with urgent medical needs who can be accommodated locally.</P>
        <P>I know the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children has put patients at the heart of her <Col N="1886"/>reforms to the health service and that she is anxious for the private sector to play a complementary role to the public health service. In Kilkenny we have a prime example of a privately developed and funded initiative that can make a substantial difference to the lives of patients throughout Carlow, Kilkenny and other parts of the south east. It must be a salutary lesson to any private sector investor contemplating involvement in the health sector to see that the Health Service Executive seems unwilling to be innovative and patient-focused in the application of public procurement rules in circumstances where, according to the Irish Kidney Association, such rules would not prevent the conclusion of an interim contract between the HSE and the operations of the clinic pending any formal procurement process.</P>
        <P>I suspect the events we have witnessed in Kilkenny will be replicated in other areas throughout the State. As a matter of policy, the Department of Health and Children should encourage the commissioning of private sector companies to ensure, in conjunction with the public sector, that patients have the facilities they require as near as possible to their places of residence. I would be grateful to know when the Department will be able to ensure that the HSE sanction and commission the renal dialysis unit at the Wellstone Clinic in Kilkenny to allow the patients of Carlow and Kilkenny avail of this important service locally.</P>

	<P>I am addressing this matter on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the management and delivery of health and personal social services are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive. This includes responsibility for the provision of haemodialysis services for people who live in County Kilkenny. As the Deputy pointed out, the clinic to which he referred is a private clinic offering a private haemodialysis service.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive is undertaking a national review of haemodialysis. It is expected that the review will be completed later this year. The executive has informed the Department that, pending the completion of the national review, it is recognised that there is a need to source additional haemodialysis capacity for patients.</P>
        <P>Given that Deputy Hogan belongs to a party that has made a strong case for value for money, I am sure he is a strong proponent of proper procurement procedures. Under procurement law, the executive must enter into a tendering process for haemodialysis services from the private sector. I understand the executive has begun a national procurement exercise to source additional haemodialysis services throughout the country. The executive has informed the Depart<Col N="1887"/>ment that the procurement exercise should be completed within two months.</P>
        <P>It is open to any private clinic providing haemodialysis to express an interest to the executive under this procurement process. The executive will seek to source additional haemodialysis services in locations that best meet the needs of patients with a view to minimising the requirement for patients to travel excessively to avail of haemodialysis treatments.</P>
        <P>It is envisaged that the executive will form a list of suitable providers who will be invited to tender to provide haemodialysis services when and where an identified need exists. Quality of care, value for money, location and the timeframe for service delivery will be key considerations and detailed award criteria will be set out in the tender documentation.</P>

      <sTitle>Rail Network.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Transport who is to reply to my query on the western rail link. With the increase in congestion on our roads, trucks clogging up traffic on single-lane carriageways and the ongoing problems the Government is experiencing regarding the port tunnel, the Government&rsquo;s blind spot in terms of rail freight and the general issue of subsidising rail travel is becoming all the more obvious.</P>
        <P>The recent Transport 21 plan, announced with much fanfare, was shockingly short on detail considering its ambitions. Its costings could have been put together on the back of an envelope such was the scarcity of detail revealed in the figures. One figure, that of &euro;34 billion, was pulled out of the hat by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, who likes dealing in millions and billions. However, few took the figure at face value and it quickly became obvious that &euro;10 billion of the &euro;34 billion had already been accounted for under the National Roads Authority&rsquo;s road building programme, that 90% of the roads mentioned in Transport 21 had already been announced, and that the new inter-urban roads were already agreed under the NRA&rsquo;s 2004 road building project and the national development plan.</P>
        <P>If one were not a sceptic, and especially if one were a railway enthusiast, one might have disregarded this creative accounting and looked to the proposed investment in rail services, particularly to the much anticipated re-opening of the western rail corridor. However, the failure to attach an investment figure to this project immediately set alarm bells ringing. How much is being proposed? The Minister says he will not release what he calls commercially sensitive information until the public procurement process for the re-opening of the Ennis-Claremorris line is <Col N="1888"/>complete. Road builders appear to be taking advantage of this. They tender and the final costs of their projects eventually come in up to 100% over budget.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s renewed commitment to have the Ennis-Athenry link completed by 2008, although I am concerned that he calls this an indicative timescale. Does this represent a climbdown from the original commitment that the link would be open within three years of the date of the announcement and the Taoiseach&rsquo;s commitment that the ten-year transport plan would be completed on time and on budget?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The other fear with the western rail corridor is that the price mooted of between &euro;300 million and &euro;400 million, representing approximately 1% of the &euro;34 billion swag, will be soaked up in capital outlays and that the operations of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann between Ennis and Galway and on subsequent routes on the western rail corridor will not be subsidised in the same way as other routes on the rail network. This is why I raise this matter on the Adjournment. Will the rail line be subsidised similarly to other routes and will there be added incentives initially to encourage commuters to use the line? When will the commuter service from Athenry to Galway be operational? When can the people of Clare look forward to taking the train to Galway, which is a mere 40 miles from them? Likewise, when can the people of Galway go to Clare by rail?</P>
        <P>The Minister should note the outstanding success of the Ennis-Limerick commuter line which was long fought for and once disregarded as being unworkable and commercially unviable. I use the service from time to time when travelling on to Dublin. It allows one to escape the madness, chaos and unpredictability of travelling by road to Dublin. The service has been expanded since it was first announced, with the result that there is considerable pressure to expand the parking facilities at Ennis railway station.</P>
        <P>The Ennis-Athenry-Galway line will also be an outstanding success and I hope the work thereon will be completed in the timescale proposed by the Minister. It would link up two very important cities, Galway and Limerick, and would allow for an option to travel to Dublin. I urge the Minister to do as I propose, remove some of the traffic from our roads as soon as possible and, if necessary, make available the subsidies from which every other rail passenger benefits.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Pat Breen for raising this important issue. Transport 21 provides for the reopening of the western rail corridor between Ennis and Claremorris on a phased basis and the preservation of an alignment as far as Collooney. It also provides for the upgrade of the Athenry-Galway line in respect of commuter services.</P><Col N="1889"/>
        <P>The western rail corridor, when completed, will provide a rail link between the cities of Limerick and Galway and an onward connection to Claremorris. The new line will also facilitate the provision of intra-regional services within the Border, midland and west region. The line between Ennis and Athenry will be the first section to be developed and I await specific proposals from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in this regard. Subject to progress in planning, the indicative date for the completion of this first section is 2008. The indicative date for the completion of the Athenry-Tuam section is 2011 and that for the Tuam-Claremorris section is 2014. I understand the necessary steps to preserve the section of line between Claremorris and Collooney will be taken this year.</P>
        <P>The phased approach to reopening the western rail corridor, in addition to being consistent with the McCann recommendations, addresses the management of the construction programme in the context of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s overall resource requirements under Transport 21. It is important to bear in mind that the rail corridor in question has the potential to attract significant new development along the route. The greater the critical mass of population and economic activity, the stronger the case for this investment. I have already made it clear to the relevant local authorities that it is a matter for them to develop and implement land use strategies that support the case for rail investment.</P>

        <P>I understand the contract for the carrying out of the vehicle testing function will expire in 2009 and will be advertised for tender prior to that date. A mid-term review was scheduled for January 2006. Will the Minister of State clarify the position and advise when the details of that review will be made known and whether they will be placed in the public arena? Will the Minister of State outline the changes he intends to make to the existing terms of reference and guidelines, if any exist, by which future providers of the NCT service will have to abide? Can changes be introduced now on foot of the mid-term review? What is the view of the Minister of State and the Department of Transport on the service that has been offered by the current holders of the contract? Is the Minister of State aware that the existing operators of the NCT centres have imposed a target fail rate of 50% or more of the cars which are presented for the test? The target is even higher for older cars. Does the Minister of State consider that the operators&rsquo; approach to their business is fair and <Col N="1890"/>acceptable? Should each vehicle that is presented for the test not be considered equally and fairly? Should a decision on whether to present an NCT certificate not be based on a car&rsquo;s overall roadworthiness? Is it not the case that car testers are under pressure to meet the target fail rates which are set by the company that employs them? Is it not likely that some cars which might otherwise pass the test are failed so that the imposed targets are met?</P>
        <P>The Department of Transport indicated to a Sunday newspaper in July 2005 that it intended to investigate the case of a car that had been passed by an NCT centre before being failed by another centre. An independent test on the car in question, which was carried out by a Dublin dealership garage, found that the car was &ldquo;in a highly dangerous condition.&rdquo; What does the Minister of State know about that high profile case? Is the Minister of State aware of the highly questionable dismissal by National Car Testing Service Limited of three people who were employed at a testing centre in Monaghan? Is he aware that a tester in Monaghan had deemed the car I have mentioned to be unroadworthy? Is he aware that the three people in question are viewed by everyone in their community as scrupulously honest? I understand that the fail percentage of the employee who failed the car in question was in the low 40s.</P>
        <P>Is the Minister of State aware that the three men, two of whom have worked with the company for more than four years, were dismissed on the basis of a spurious claim of gross misconduct? It is alleged that one employee was signed off early one evening by another of the three men, who was the team leader. The employee who left early, who had a legitimate reason for doing so, performed a specific task on behalf of the company on the evening in question &mdash; he took a bank lodgment to the bank. Does the Minister of State share my concerns about these matters? Is he prepared to make appropriate inquiries? Will he undertake to return to me on these matters when he is in a position to do so?</P>
        <P>I appreciate that the Minister of State&rsquo;s prepared response may not reflect on many of the points I have raised this evening, but I appeal to him to recognise the seriousness of these matters and to investigate the relevant issues accordingly. I thank him for his attention and look forward to receiving a fuller reply from him when he has had an opportunity to examine these matters in the coming weeks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in for raising this matter. It is not correct that the contract for the operation of the national car testing service will expire soon. The ten-year contract that was awarded to National Car Testing Service Limited will run for a further four years until the end of 2009, as the Deputy said. I will deal with the mid-term review that was also mentioned by <Col N="1891"/>the Deputy. He may mistakenly assume that the recently completed review of the operation of the car-testing contract is the forerunner to the making of totally new arrangements for the car testing function. The contract with NCTS provides for a mid-term review by the Minister after the mid-point of the contract. Contrary to some public expectations, the question of whether to renew or extend the contract until the end of 2009 did not arise as an issue in the mid-term review.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The purpose of the review was to examine in detail the performance of NCTS and to assess a range of strategic issues such as the quality of the service provided for car owners, the content of the test, the location and number of test centres and the responses to a public consultation process on the review. The review, which began in April 2005, was carried out by the Department of Transport in conjunction with the supervision services contractor for the car testing contract.</P>
        <P>The supervision services contractor, which is a consortium consisting of PricewaterhouseCoopers and AA Ireland, provides supervisory support to the Department in monitoring and supervising NCTS to ensure it meets its contractual obligations on an ongoing basis. The contract requires NCTS to meet a range of performance standards for the service, which the company has consistently met over the duration of the contract to date.</P>
        <P>The report on the mid-term review, which was received by the Department from PricewaterhouseCoopers at the end of October 2005, contains a wide range of recommendations covering areas such as test content, test integrity, technical standards, customer service and data management. Any changes in the national car test or the way it is carried out or administered have to be agreed with NCTS in accordance with the change control procedures which govern any changes to the contract between the Minister and the company. I understand that agreement in principle has recently been achieved in the negotiations between the Department and NCTS on the implementation of the recommendations contained in the mid-term report. I expect to be in a position to make an early announcement about the implementation of the changes to the national car test and to publish the full report of the review at the same time.</P>
        <P>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in chose to raise, in the context of this more general Adjournment debate, the specific case of a number of people in Monaghan who have been dismissed from their employment. I will make inquiries about the matter and communicate my findings directly to the Deputy</P>

      <sTitle>Office of Director of Public Prosecutions.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, and congratulate him on his appointment to a new position. I am seeking a review of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1974, <Col N="1892"/>which established the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and set out its functions. There is a need for matters of general public concern arising from the performance of the DPP&rsquo;s functions to be clarified in the public domain. I am raising this matter on foot of the public controversy and confusion that followed the trial that arose from the tragic death of Robert Holohan. The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions did not issue any response at that time &mdash; all we got was silence. It seems that some issues need to be clarified in this respect.</P>
        <P>Over 30 years have passed since the establishment of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. I am satisfied that there is a need for the office because it is important that matters of criminal prosecution should be determined by an independent prosecutor&rsquo;s office. The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is, first and foremost, an independent forum. Such matters used to be decided on by the Office of the Attorney General, but they are now the responsibility of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
        <P>I remind the House that the predecessor of the current Director of Public Prosecutions established a precedent when he decided he would not make any public statements on his procedures. He did not comment on the manner in which he acted when bringing prosecutions, such as why he decided to introduce certain information but not other information. Nothing in the 1974 Act prevents the Director of Public Prosecutions from putting a statement into the public domain to clarify any matter or explain why he acted in a certain fashion.</P>
        <P>The current Director of Public Prosecutions has issued public statements of explanation in the cases of Nora Wall, the former nun who was convicted of rape in strange circumstances, only for the conviction to be overthrown subsequently, and Brian Rossiter, who died while in Garda custody. While the Director of Public Prosecutions is under no obligation to make a statement, he is allowed to issue a statement if he wishes. The problem is that the current arrangements for making a statement are unclear. The Director of Public Prosecutions in the United Kingdom is also the Attorney General there. He is a Minister in the UK Cabinet and is subject to questioning by parliamentarians. There is a direct avenue to determining cause for prosecution in Britain and in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>That is not the situation here. The Director of Public Prosecution jealously guards his independence, but there should be no conflict between independence and accountability. It is important because every prosecution is taken on behalf of the State and of every citizen through the channel of the DPP. Unless citizens are involved and unless they are considered in a caring fashion, the criminal justice system will not function. It is <Col N="1893"/>important to ensure that there is a level of accountability.</P>
        <P>Given the length of time the Act has been in operation, does the Minister consider that it is in need of a fresh examination? There is a need for some mechanism to ensure that matters that cause public controversy and confusion can be clarified. There is provision in the Act whereby the DPP shall consult the Attorney General. To my knowledge, this has never happened and it is the Attorney General that consults the DPP. It would be valuable if that took place.</P>
        <P>We have an Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention who makes an annual report to the Minister. In the new legislation for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, there will be a new Garda inspector who will make an annual report to the Minister. Could we have an inspectorate for the aspect of the criminal justice system where prosecutions on behalf of the citizen are led by the State? An alternative possibility would be a review oversight committee that made an annual report and would keep an eye on the manner in which prosecutions are processed.</P>
        <P>I am not saying that the DPP must give us a running commentary on every case before him, but there is a need for a happy medium. Citizens who are involved in the traumatic circumstances of serious criminal cases should not be left high and dry when major questions on how certain prosecutions took place remain unanswered. There should be some mechanism of clarification in the interests of democracy and accountability.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. I am deputising for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who is out of the country.</P>
        <P>The Minister does not have responsibility for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. That office was established under the Prosecution of Offences Act 1974. The principle which underpins the Act is that prosecutorial decisions should be and should be seen to be free of undue or inappropriate pressures being brought to bear in particular cases. It is this principle, which is a very important part of the legal system, which requires that the Director of Public Prosecutions be independent in the performance of his functions, in accordance with section 2(5) of the Act. That independence would not be maintained under a system where the DPP&rsquo;s decisions were subject to review or justification. While the director is independent in the performance of his functions, he is not independent from the rule of law. Like every other person and authority in the State, the DPP is subject to the Constitution and the law and is obliged to act in accordance with it.</P>
        <P>Section 2(6) of the Prosecutions of Offences Act 1974 provides that the Attorney General and the director shall consult each other from time to time on matters pertaining to the functions of the director. Arising from this provision I understand <Col N="1894"/>that the Director of Public Prosecutions has from time to time consulted the Attorney General. Such consultation has related to general issues which had arisen rather than specific cases. The consultation provided for by section 2(6) of the Prosecutions of Offences Act 1974 works in a way which does not compromise the independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions and does not leave the Government open to accusations of attempting to interfere in prosecutorial decisions. In addition to the provisions contained in the Prosecution of Offences Act 1974, the Accounting Officer for the office must appear before the Committee of Public Accounts to answer questions on the expenditure, general administration and effectiveness of the office.</P>
        <P>The Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunity of Witnesses) Act 1997 also provides for the appearance of the DPP before the Committee of Public Accounts on matters of general administration and certain other matters. That committee can also seek evidence or documents from the director or his officers concerning statistics relevant to a matter referred to in a report of and published by the director regarding the general activities of the office.</P>
        <P>The director&rsquo;s practice is not to disclose the existence of material after a trial has taken place which was not put before the court of trial because it was inadmissible or not probative of the case. If the director were to do this, it could involve disclosing prejudicial material and leaving persons affected by the disclosure with no effective means to combat any damage to their reputation.</P>
        <P>The policy of not giving reasons in public for decisions not to prosecute predates the Prosecution of Offences Act 1974 and the establishment of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. A number of principles underpin this policy. The first is that if reasons were given in some cases, it would be difficult not to give them in all. Otherwise, wrong conclusions would inevitably be drawn in those cases where the reasons were refused. On the other hand, if reasons were given in all cases and those reasons were more than bland generalities, unjust consequences would be difficult or impossible to avoid. Disclosure of reasons could prejudice a future re-trial following a successful appeal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While acknowledging the long-established principle of not giving reasons in public, I am aware that the Director of Public Prosecutions is examining whether there may be scope for giving more information about prosecutorial decisions to victims of crime. An obvious difficulty is that where reasons are given privately to victims, they may subsequently be disclosed in public. It is the practice of the director&rsquo;s office to give the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na a full account of the reasons for prosecutorial decisions. Furthermore, the DPP has published on his website a statement of general <Col N="1895"/>guidelines for prosecutors which sets out in general terms the principles which guide the initiation and conduct of prosecutions in Ireland. These guidelines are intended to give general guidance to prosecutors so that a fair, reasoned and consistent policy underlines the prosecution <Col N="1896"/>process. These guidelines are at present the subject of review in the DPP&rsquo;s office. An updated version of the guidelines should be available soon.</P>

	<P>The notification made by BASF to trial genetically modified potatoes at Summerhill, County Meath was made to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA. This application is in accordance with Part B of EU Directive 2001/18/EC on the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment but not for entry to the food chain.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for making a decision on the application is a matter for the Environmental Protection Agency. Under the Genetically Modified Organisms (Deliberate Release) Regulations, S.I. No. 500 of 2003, which transposes Directive 2001/18/EC, stringent requirements on both the notifier and the agency are laid down. These include a formal notification to the agency, an advertisement by the notifier and determination by the agency of the notification within 90 days of its receipt.</P>
        <P>In reaching its determination the EPA will have regard to compliance with the regulations, any observations or representations received and a scientific evaluation of the risks for human health and/or the environment which are posed by the proposed deliberate release. In this regard, the agency may grant consent, either with or without conditions, or refuse consent. Following trial of the crop, in the event that the notifier wishes to get the GMO authorised, there is a lengthy procedure involving the Commission and all member states before it could be authorised for commercial use.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While my Department is responsible for developing coexistence arrangements between authorised GM and non-GM crops, it has no role with regard to experimental trials such as the one applied for in County Meath. This is a matter solely for the EPA.</P>
        <P>With regard to coexistence, all member states, including Ireland, have been engaged in a process of drawing up strategies and best practices to provide for effective arrangements. In August 2003 an interdepartmental group, comprising rep<Col N="1898"/>resentatives of the Department of Agriculture and Food, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Teagasc and the EPA, was established to examine issues relating to coexistence and to develop proposals for a national strategy and best practices for coexistence arrangements here.</P>
        <P>I received the report and recommendations from the working group in November and in early December I arranged for the placing of the report on my Department&rsquo;s website and invited further observations from all interested parties. I have now extended the closing date for observations until the end of March. In finalising the coexistence measures for adoption here I will take into consideration all observations received on the issue.</P>
        <P>To sum up, the EPA is the responsible body for ensuring that there is no cross contamination where a genetically modified organism is released into the environment under the experimental release section of the directive, as is proposed in the County Meath trial. In the event an application is made to grow an authorised GM potato variety here in Ireland, my Department is the responsible authority and any such application will be considered within the context of coexistence measures which are being finalised.</P>

	<P>As part of the arrangements to enable farmers meet the additional requirements of the nitrates directive, I have sought EU state aid approval for a revised farm waste management scheme which shall include the removal of any minimum income requirements from farming from the scheme so that all small farmers can participate in the scheme. Under the current scheme, farmers must have a minimum of 30 income units, of which 20 income units must come from farming, to be able to participate in the scheme. I expect that the revised scheme will be introduced at an early date.</P>
        <P>Under the revised scheme, such farmers will be able to avail of a standard grant rate of 60%, with 70% being available in the four zone C counties, for both animal housing and slurry storage. The maximum eligible investment will be increased from &euro;75,000 to &euro;120,000 per holding. I am also proposing to extend the scheme to new sectors, such as the pig and poultry sectors, for the first time. The technical specifications operated by my Department for the purposes of the scheme require the installation of adequate arrangements for the separation of clean and dirty water as part of the conditions of any new investment.</P>

        <Quest>the position regarding the incidence of Johne&rsquo;s disease here; if her attention has been drawn to a new test using genome sequencing to get results from dung or milk which yields results in 72 hours rather than the current six to 18 weeks; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>Johne&rsquo;s disease is widespread in the cattle population in most of the EU member states and, indeed, worldwide. Until 1992, strict import conditions ensured that Johne&rsquo;s disease was relatively rare in Ireland. However, since 1993, the increase in the number of cattle imported in the aftermath of the single market contributed to a significant increase in the numbers of reported cases of the disease. A national randomised survey, utilising blood samples taken as part of the brucellosis eradication campaign, is being analysed to establish the current incidence and distribution. Results from this survey should be available before the end of 2006.</P>
        <P>Various techniques and gene-probes are and have been marketed over a number of years by commercial companies following the successful genome sequencing of the organism causing Johne&rsquo;s disease. Some of these tests show promise, particularly in speeding up the availability of test results. Staff in the laboratory are familiar with the techniques involved in such tests, can perform them and keep in touch with the technological advances. However, there is a need for further assurances as to accuracy of the various techniques. There is also a danger of an over-emphasis being given to tests which are costly and which are unlikely to improve the situation in regard to the incidence of Johne&rsquo;s disease in the absence of on-farm management controls to prevent infection of the next generation of breeding animals.</P>
        <P>In an effort to raise consciousness of the disease and to promote higher standards of purchasing policy, hygiene management practices and calf rearing, my Department published and distributed booklets on Johne&rsquo;s disease. One of these is aimed at the farmer and the other at the private veterinary practitioner. Articles have also been published in the veterinary and farming press. Advice on Johne&rsquo;s disease is available at all district veterinary offices and on the Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently engaged in an exercise to marshal the resources of all the key interested parties so as to give a new direction and momentum to efforts to tackle diseases such as Johne&rsquo;s in the national herd and to enhance the prospects of making real progress in this area in the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The designation of land under the EU birds and habitats directives is a function of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The question of compensation for farmers in the Shannon Callows area is a matter, in the first instance, for that Department, and I understand that discussions on the matter with the farming bodies have been going on for some time and are still continuing.</P>
        <P>As far as REPS is concerned, arrangements are already in place designed specifically to address the situation of farmers in the Shannon Callows. Farmers in this area who wish to join REPS but believe that the REPS payments do not fully offset any income loss arising from the restrictions placed on their farming activities because of designation under the birds and habitats directives, may now also apply to the national parks and wildlife service of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for additional compensation. Before this arrangement was introduced in September 2004, such farmers had to choose between REPS and the compensation arrangements operated by NPWS but could not benefit from both.</P>
        <P>This further concession was additional to the inclusion of a new supplementary measure in REPS when REPS 3 was introduced in June 2004. Designated areas are already eligible for payments under REPS Measure A of &euro;242 per hectare for the first 40 hectares and lesser amounts for areas over 40 hectares, and the new supplementary measure provides for an additional payment of &euro;100 per hectare on particular sites in the Callows which are important corncrake habitats. Those sites are monitored by BirdWatch Ireland and REPS farmers can qualify for the additional payment by subscribing to BirdWatch Ireland management prescriptions for them.</P>
        <P>I believe that the arrangements I have outlined should address the situation in the Shannon Callows adequately as far as my Department is concerned. Nevertheless I have asked my officials to examine the issue again in the context of the current consultation process on REPS, out of which proposals will be sent to the Commission for a revised scheme.</P>

	<P>The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Following difficult and intense negotiations with the European Commission, the Minister, Deputy Roche, made regulations on 11 December 2005 giving legal effect to Ireland&rsquo;s national action programme under the nitrates directive.</P>
        <P>The need for the action programme and the regulations arises from the directive itself, which imposes specific obligations on all member states of the European Union to protect waters against pollution from agricultural sources. In 2004, a judgment of the European Court of Justice held Ireland to be in breach of the directive by failing to implement a nitrates action programme. Failure by Ireland to address the situation would have resulted in an application from the Commission to the court to have very substantial daily fines imposed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>A comprehensive range of incentives and supports is available from my Department to encourage the planting of forestry. Grants are available under the forestry grant and premium scheme which cover 100% of planting costs, so it costs landowners nothing to invest in forestry. In addition, under the current scheme farmers are entitled to a 20 year premium &mdash; 15 years for non-farmers &mdash; of up to &euro;500 per hectare, depending on the species planted. As a further incentive, income earned from commercial woodlands is exempt from tax. In the case of individuals, the timber asset is also exempt from capital gains tax.</P>
        <P>Under the single farm payment scheme, I was able to negotiate concessions, which enable farm-<Col N="1902"/>foresters to plant up to 50% of their eligible claimed areas with forestry, while still being in receipt of their full single farm payment. Supports are also available for the growing forest in the form of grants for the shaping of broadleafs and pruning of conifers, with expenditure in 2005 on these schemes of &euro;10.5 million. Grants are also available for the construction of forest roads to facilitate access for management and harvesting operations. Expenditure on forest roads in 2005 came to &euro;3.3 million.</P>
        <P>In addition to these direct supports, funding is provided for research, advisory services and promotion. In conjunction with the Irish Forest Industry Chain, IFIC, the forest service of my Department is about to embark on an 18 month promotional campaign to further encourage take-up in the above mentioned grant and premium scheme along with any future afforestation scheme administered by my Department. IFIC aims to engage a full-time project manager dedicated to these promotional initiatives in the next few weeks.</P>
        <P>The new rural development programme for 2007-13 will continue to provide generous supports for forestry in terms of both afforestation and improving the competitiveness of existing forests. In the current year, I have provided for a budget of &euro;137 million for forestry. I urge landowners to strongly consider forestry as a sustainable investment for the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am satisfied that the EU is not excessively dependent on imports of food and that there is no reason for concern regarding security of supply either at the present time or for the foreseeable future. The EU is a major trading bloc and, as such, is both a major exporter and importer of food. It is self sufficient in many commodities and is a significant exporter of surplus production to third countries. The EU imports products which it does not produce, such as tropical products. Established patterns of trade take place also for historical reasons and the Community&rsquo;s willingness to enter into preferential agreements with developing countries rather than from a necessity to address deficiencies in domestic supplies.</P>
        <P>In so far as food safety is concerned, detailed EU legislation lays down the conditions that member states must apply to the production of and trade in food products of animal origin as well as to imports of these products from third countries. It is a requirement that animal products imported from third countries meet stan<Col N="1903"/>dards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, member states. All such imports must come from third countries or areas of third countries approved for export to the EU.</P>
        <P>I fully support the policy that all products of animal origin imported into the EU from third countries meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, EU member states. Irish farmers are required to ensure that their production systems and farm practices fully comply with a wide range of EU directives on important matters including traceability, animal health and welfare and consumer protection. These all have significant in-built cost factors and bearing in mind that our beef farmers are in competition on European and international markets from some low cost producing third countries, I will continue to seek real equivalence in these areas, both in discussions within the EU and in the context of the WTO talks on market access.</P>

	<P>Teagasc has an ongoing programme of research that investigates the potential risks and benefits associated with the growing of GM crops in Ireland including, <i>inter alia</i>, the economic implications. Preliminary research completed by it to date does indicate that the cultivation of certain crops with certain modifications may provide a financial incentive to the Irish farmer.</P>
        <P>To establish greater clarity in the matter I requested Teagasc to carry out an evaluation of the possible national economic implications for the agri-food industry from the use of GMOs in crop and livestock production. Teagasc has recently completed its study which it based on two scenarios: the economic implications of only allowing the importation into Ireland of certified GM-free soybean and maize livestock feed ingredients; the economic implications of GM-free crop cultivation in Ireland.</P>
        <P>In the first scenario the study showed that substantial additional costs would be placed on the livestock sector, particularly on specialist dairy and beef farmers, if they were to use certified GM free soya and maize only in feeding stuffs. In the second scenario the study examined five hypothetical GM crops which could be grown here &mdash; herbicide tolerant sugar beet, septoria resistant winter wheat, fusarium resistant winter wheat, rhyncosporium resistant spring barley and blight resistant potatoes. This study showed that increased profits could be generated for growers <Col N="1904"/>of these crops compared to their conventional equivalent. However, the study showed that there is a significant cost in identity preservation for conventional growers in a coexistence arrangement.</P>

	<P>The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The Minister, Deputy Roche, has recently made regulations giving legal effect to Ireland&rsquo;s national action programme under the directive.</P>
        <P>There has been much comment and speculation in recent days and weeks about the effect of the nitrates regulations on farming. I am aware that the implementation of the regulations will be challenging for some farmers. I am also aware that there is a serious information deficit on some aspects of the matter. Clearly, this is not in the interests of farmers themselves and I am anxious to bring clarity to the situation as soon as possible. As a first step, my Department has placed advertisements in the farming press explaining the main provisions of the regulations in clear and straightforward terms. A handbook is being finalised and will be sent to every farmer as soon as possible. Officials of my Department have already had discussions with Teagasc about arrangements for the delivery of information which will further help farmers to understand the practical aspects of the new regulations.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to giving the farming community all the practical help it can. Following from commitments made in the Sustaining Progress agreement, which related explicitly to the nitrates directive, payment rates in REPS increased by 28% on average in 2004. The number of farmers in REPS reached record levels last year. My Department&rsquo;s Estimate for 2006 includes a provision of &euro;323 million for REPS, the highest ever.</P>
        <P>We also introduced improvements to the farm waste management scheme and the dairy hygiene scheme in 2004, and I have tabled proposals to the Commission for further major improvements to the farm waste management scheme which will provide a far more attractive package to farmers than that which was previously available. Only last week in Brussels I met Commissioner Fischer Boel and impressed on her the need for early Commission approval of the scheme as submitted. I have secured an Estimates provision of &euro;43 million in 2006 for the revised scheme.</P><Col N="1905"/>
        <P>Most of the controversy in recent days has centred on the nutrient management provisions of the regulations. These were finalised following difficult negotiations with the Commission&rsquo;s scientific experts, with both Departments making use of the advice provided by Teagasc. It was the Commission, however, that determined the final content of the regulations. Teagasc has recently indicated that it may be possible to review part of the advice it had given on the application of phosphorus, in a way that could improve the effectiveness of the regulations. The Government and the European Commission saw merit in allowing Teagasc time to elaborate this new advice and, accordingly, the Minister, Deputy Roche, announced a brief <i>de facto</i> deferral of the implementation of Part 3 of the regulations.</P>
        <P>Teagasc has been requested to provide, as a matter of urgency, the necessary scientific case to support any revision of the phosphorus tables in the regulations. The two Departments will carefully consider any submission received from Teagasc while also bearing in mind that any proposals for revision of the phosphorus tables will have to respect the environmental requirements associated with the nitrates directive and meet with the agreement of the European Commission.</P>
        <P>Teagasc has not been specifically requested to review its advice on nitrogen issues. However, to the extent that its revised submission on crop nutrient requirements suggests any further beneficial adjustments to the regulatory regime, these will, of course, be considered. The possibility of such further adjustments will also depend on their respecting the environmental requirements involved and on their acceptance by the European Commission.</P>
        <P>A central issue arising from the nitrates directive is the need to secure a derogation which will allow certain farmers to operate, under appropriate conditions and controls, up to a level of 250kg of organic nitrogen per hectare. The proposal was given an initial presentation to the EU nitrates committee in December, and further scientific data have been supplied to the Commission following bilateral discussions. The proposal will need to be discussed again at future meetings of the nitrates committee before approval can be obtained. Securing this derogation is vital for the most productive dairy farmers, in particular, and it is important that the position on the regulations is clarified at an early date so that the negotiations on the derogation can proceed.</P>

	<P>One of my main objectives since <Col N="1906"/>assuming office as Minister for Agriculture and Food was to ensure the implementation of the decoupled single payment scheme &mdash; the most significant change to agricultural support since our accession to the European Community. This huge task was successfully implemented when over &euro;1 billion in single payments issued to 118,500 farmers last December meeting the target we had set ourselves of making the payments on the first possible date. This was a major undertaking and the outcome, after painstaking preparatory work in establishing individual entitlements, was, by any standards, a major achievement.</P>
        <P>Under the 2005 single payment scheme, 143,000 applications were received. In addition to those applicants seeking to both activate their entitlements and also receive payment, applications were received from farmers seeking only to activate their entitlements. It will be recalled that farmers who did not seek to activate their entitlements in 2005 would, under the EU rules, forfeit these entitlements to the national reserve.</P>
        <P>In common with the coupled schemes, which the single payment scheme replaced, delays in processing can be caused by many factors, including incomplete application forms, errors on applications and discrepancies highlighted following computer validation, which must be resolved via correspondence with the applicant. In many cases, payment could not be made because applicants did not submit an application to transfer the single payment entitlements, with lands, by way of inheritance, gift, lease or purchase. Many of these applications were only received after my Department made direct contact with the farmers in question, during recent weeks, and some have yet to be submitted.</P>
        <P>At present, total payments amount to &euro;1,126 million with 97% of farmers, who hold entitlements and applied for the single payment scheme, paid. A number of payment runs continue to be made weekly as the more complicated files are cleared. My ongoing objective is to make payments to all of those farmers who have yet to receive their payment or are entitled to a supplementary payment as soon as their cases are clear for payment. Every effort is being made by my Department to clear the outstanding cases but many of these are extremely complex and, in other cases, my Department is still awaiting documentation and applications for the transfer of entitlements before payment can be made.</P>
        <P>The changeover to the single payment was undertaken while work continued on winding up the coupled schemes. The successful introduction of the single payment scheme in Ireland in 2005 is testimony to the efforts of all concerned. It is my intention that this success will be built on into the future, to the benefit of all concerned.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 26 and 60 together.</P>
        <P>The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, recently made regulations giving legal effect to Ireland&rsquo;s national action programme under the directive.</P>
        <P>Officials from my Department and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government worked closely with Teagasc throughout the entire process of developing the action programme, the regulations and the derogation application. A series of meetings, involving Teagasc and both Departments, took place during 2005 to examine a number of issues and to facilitate submission of the draft regulations to the Commission. In the negotiations which followed, and which were frequently difficult, both Departments made use of the advice provided by Teagasc. Documents provided by Teagasc, including a note on aspects of the proposed nitrogen fertilisation rates for grassland in Ireland, were provided to the Commission.</P>
        <P>It was the Commission which determined the final content of the regulations. Teagasc has recently indicated that it may be possible to review part of the advice it had given on the application of phosphorus, in a way that could improve the effectiveness of the regulations. The Government and the European Commission saw merit in allowing Teagasc time to elaborate this new advice and, accordingly, the Minister, Deputy Roche, announced a brief <i>de facto</i> deferral of the implementation of Part 3 of the regulations.</P>
        <P>Teagasc has been requested to provide, as a matter of urgency, the necessary scientific case to support any revision of the phosphorus tables in the regulations. The two Departments will carefully consider any submission received from Teagasc while also bearing in mind that any proposals for revision of the phosphorus tables will have to respect the environmental requirements associated with the nitrates directive and meet with the agreement of the European Commission.</P>
        <P>Teagasc has not been specifically requested to review its advice on nitrogen issues. However, to the extent that its revised submission on crop nutrient requirements suggests any further beneficial adjustments to the regulatory regime, <Col N="1909"/>these will, of course, be considered. The possibility of such further adjustments will also depend on their respecting the environmental requirements involved and on their acceptance by the European Commission.</P>

	<P>Veterinary practices are primarily commercial entities and their locations are driven by commercial realities. However, in so far as State involvement is concerned, I can point to a number of recent measures which will alleviate difficulties which may arise in certain parts of the country.</P>
        <P>First, under the new Veterinary Practice Act which came into effect on 1 January 2006, provision is made to enable the Veterinary Council for the first time to recognise qualifications from applicants in third countries generally. This, taken with the recent enlargement of the EU, will make for improved availability of practitioners to meet shortfalls that may arise on the supply side. Second, the Animal Remedies Regulations 2005, which I signed into law on the 17 November 2005, contain a number of measures which will enable veterinary practitioners and their farmer clients to avoid difficulties in this area. These include changes to the prescribing rules in terms of the need to clinically examine an animal and extended validity of prescriptions, the details of which I have already outlined in the House.</P>
        <P>The regulations also include a provision which, in a genuine emergency situation and subject to appropriate safeguards, will enable a pharmacist to supply a prescription medicine in advance of receiving a written prescription. Finally, I understand that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta provides funding to subsidise veterinary practices in some remote areas in consultation with the local farming community.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The EU sugar reform package agreed in November provides for compensation to beet growers of up to 64% of the reduction in the minimum price for beet. This compensation, which will be paid as part of the single farm payment, will be worth approximately &euro;123 million <Col N="1910"/>to Irish beet growers over the next seven years. I announced recently that, subject to adoption of the regulations on the reform, I intended to fix the reference period for the single payment compensation for beet growers as the three year average of the individual farmer&rsquo;s contracted tonnage of beet in the years 2001, 2002 and 2004. These years are considered to be the most advantageous for sugar beet growers.</P>
        <P>Diversification funds of almost &euro;44 million will also become available to growers in the event that sugar beet production completely ceases in Ireland. In that event also an aid package of up to &euro;145 million becomes available for the economic, social and environmental costs of restructuring of the Irish sugar industry, including factory closure and renunciation of quota. A decision on beet growing in 2006 and future years is a matter for beet growers and Irish Sugar Ltd. having regard to the reformed EU sugar regime, which will apply from 1 July.</P>
        <P>The EU legal texts giving effect to the reform agreement could not be considered and approved by the Council of Ministers until the opinion of the European Parliament had been received. That opinion was delivered on 19 January and it is now anticipated that the legal texts will be ready for approval by the Council of Ministers next week. Meanwhile, the EU Commission is working on preparation of detailed implementation rules which can only be finalised once the Council texts have been adopted.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 33 and 49 together.</P>
        <P>The position is that there are four main categories under which farmers have applied for entitlements from the 2005 national reserve. Category A applies to farmers who inherited or otherwise obtained a holding free of charge or for a nominal sum from a farmer who retired or died before 16 May 2005 where the holding was leased out to a third party during the reference period. Category B(i), B(ii), B(iii) and B(iv) apply to <Col N="1911"/>farmers who made an investment between 1 January 2000 and 19 October 2003, which resulted in an increase in production capacity. Investments can include purchase or long-term lease of land, purchase of suckler and/or ewe quota or other investments.</P>
        <P>Category C applies to farmers who sold their milk quota into a restructuring scheme between 1 January 2000 and 19 October 2003 and who converted to a farming sector for which a direct payment under the livestock and/or arable aid schemes would have been payable in respect of the years 2000 to 2002. Category D applies to new entrants to farming since 31 December 2002 and farmers who commenced farming in 2002 but who received no direct payments in that year. The applicant&rsquo;s total income may not exceed &euro;40,000 and any off-farm income may not exceed &euro;20,000. Farming qualifications are also required for this category and priority may be given to farmers under 35 years of age.</P>
        <P>In addition, the cost of funding successful applicants under the following measures will have to be met from the pool of money in the national reserve: active dairy farmers who, because of <i>force majeure</i>, were unable to supply milk during the 2004/05 milk quota year and were therefore allowed to temporarily lease out all or part of their quota &mdash; the cost of awarding the equivalent of the decoupled dairy premium to these farmers must be met from the national reserve; sheep farmers with commonage land who, while farming very extensively, were prevented from expanding production during the period 1999-2002 pending the publication of commonage framework plans.</P>
        <P>There are mandatory and non-mandatory categories in the reserve. In Ireland&rsquo;s case the mandatory categories are categories A, B(i) B(ii) B(iii) B(iv) and C. The non-mandatory categories are category D, new entrants, and certain hill sheep farmers who were prevented from increasing production during the reference period pending the publication of commonage framework plans. Separate application arrangements were in place for this latter group.</P>
        <P>In allocating entitlements to successful applicants in the mandatory categories, the member state must apply objective criteria and ensure equal treatment between farmers. In the case of categories A and B(i), qualifying farmers will have declared hectares of land in 2005 that were free of entitlements and the intention to make an allocation in respect of those hectares based on objective criteria. It is envisaged that qualifying applicants under categories B(ii) B(iii) B(iv) and C will have their existing entitlements topped-up by a sum of money again determined on the basis of objective criteria.</P>
        <P>In allocating entitlements to successful applicants in the non-mandatory categories, the member state must ensure that the allocation <Col N="1912"/>does not have the effect of increasing the value of any existing entitlements above the regional average value of entitlements. Similarly, the value of any new entitlements allocated to non-mandatory categories must not exceed the regional average. The member state is allowed to determine what will constitute the regional average.</P>
        <P>I established a single payment advisory committee comprising representatives of the farming organisations, Teagasc and officials from my Department to consider various aspects of the national reserve arrangements. These included the objective criteria that should be used in making allocations from the reserve to the mandatory categories and also the most appropriate way to determine what will constitute the regional average value of entitlements in the case of the non-mandatory categories. I will make a formal announcement in this regard shortly. It is intended that allocations will be made to successful applicants during March.</P>

	<P>The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The Minister, Deputy Roche, has recently made regulations giving legal effect to Ireland&rsquo;s national action programme under the directive.</P>
        <P>There has been much comment and speculation in recent days and weeks about the effect of the nitrates regulations on farming. I am aware that the implementation of the regulations will be challenging for some farmers. I am also aware that there is a serious information deficit on some aspects of the matter. Clearly, this is not in the interests of farmers themselves and I am anxious to bring clarity to the situation as soon as possible. As a first step, my Department has placed advertisements in the farming press explaining the main provisions of the regulations in clear and straightforward terms. A handbook is being finalised and will be sent to every farmer as soon as possible. Officials of my Department have already had discussions with Teagasc about arrangements for the delivery of information which will further help farmers to understand the practical aspects of the new regulations.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to giving the farming community all the practical help it can. Following from commitments made in the Sustaining Progress agreement, which related explicitly to the nitrates directive, payment rates in REPS increased by 28% on average in 2004. <Col N="1913"/>The number of farmers in REPS reached record levels last year. My Department&rsquo;s Estimates for 2006 includes a provision of &euro;323 million for REPS, the highest ever.</P>
        <P>We also introduced improvements to the farm waste management scheme and the dairy hygiene scheme in 2004, and I have tabled proposals to the Commission for further major improvements to the farm waste management scheme which will provide a far more attractive package to farmers than that which was previously available. Only last week in Brussels I met Commissioner Fischer Boel and impressed on her the need for early Commission approval of the scheme as submitted. I have secured an Estimates provision of &euro;43 million in 2006 for the revised scheme.</P>
        <P>Most of the controversy in recent days has centred on the nutrient management provisions of the regulations. These were finalised following difficult negotiations with the Commission&rsquo;s scientific experts, with both Departments making use of the advice provided by Teagasc. It was the Commission, however, that determined the final content of the regulations.</P>
        <P>Teagasc has recently indicated that it may be possible to review part of the advice it had given on the application of phosphorus, in a way that could improve the effectiveness of the regulations. The Government and the European Commission saw merit in allowing Teagasc time to elaborate this new advice and, accordingly, the Minister, Deputy Roche, announced a brief <i>de facto</i> deferral of the implementation of Part 3 of the regulations. Teagasc has been requested to provide, as a matter of urgency, the necessary scientific case to support any revision of the phosphorus tables in the regulations. The two Departments will carefully consider any submission received from Teagasc while also bearing in mind that any proposals for revision of the phosphorus tables will have to respect the environmental requirements associated with the nitrates directive and meet with the agreement of the European Commission.</P>
        <P>Teagasc has not been specifically requested to review its advice on nitrogen issues. However, to the extent that its revised submission on crop nutrient requirements suggests any further beneficial adjustments to the regulatory regime, these will, of course, be considered. The possibility of such further adjustments will also depend on their respecting the environmental requirements involved and on their acceptance by the European Commission.</P>
        <P>A central issue arising from the nitrates directive is the need to secure a derogation which will allow certain farmers to operate, under appropriate conditions and controls, up to a level of 250kgs of organic nitrogen per hectare. The proposal was given an initial presentation to the EU nitrates committee in December, and further scientific data have been supplied to the Commission following bilateral discussions. The pro<Col N="1914"/>posal will need to be discussed again at future meetings of the nitrates committee before approval can be obtained. Securing this derogation is vital for the most productive dairy farmers, in particular, and it is important that the position on the regulations is clarified at an early date so that the negotiations on the derogation can proceed.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 40 together.</P>
        <P>My Department has been and is continuing to review and modify its contingency arrangements to, in the first instance, minimise the risk of an outbreak of avian flu in Ireland and, thereafter, to control and eradicate any disease outbreak should that occur. In this regard, my Department is informed by the most up-to-date expert scientific and veterinary advice available. In particular, regard is being had to the spread of the virus and the developments of the past week, including the confirmation of outbreaks in swans in a number of member states.</P>
        <P>This is a matter of obvious concern and the further spread of the virus has increased the risk of the introduction of the virus into Ireland. In view of this increased risk, I have set up an expert group to provide ongoing advice on avian control measures. This group will be chaired by Professor Michael Monaghan of the faculty of veterinary medicine at UCD and will include members with veterinary, scientific and ornithological expertise from within and outside this Department. Given the role of migratory wild birds in spreading the virus there are obvious limitations on what can be done in terms of preventing the virus&rsquo;s introduction to the country. Therefore, much of my Department&rsquo;s precautionary focus is on equipping ourselves to identify any outbreak quickly and to move to ensure its speedy eradication if it arrives here.</P>
        <P>To date, a range of EU and national measures has been put in place and others are under active <Col N="1915"/>consideration, including a requirement for the compulsory housing of domestic poultry, as has been done in some other European countries closer to the recent outbreaks. The latter is provided for in EU legislation in certain defined circumstances and I will have no hesitation in introducing such a requirement here as soon as I believe it is appropriate. I am asking the expert group for advice on this.</P>
        <P>We have also introduced a register of poultry flockowners and owners of other birds and it is now a statutory requirement that all poultry flockowners register with my Department. While we have received a very encouraging response to the register, there are certainly some who have yet to register and they should do so as a matter of urgency. The register will be of vital importance to us in identifying the precise locations of neighbouring flocks to any disease outbreak and will be of enormous assistance in ensuring that the necessary control procedures are fully in place. Poultry flockowners who fail to register are not alone compromising the well-being of their own flocks but also their neighbours&rsquo; flocks and will do nothing to assist my Department in its efforts to ensure the speedy eradication of any disease outbreak.</P>
        <P>My Department has been maintaining a vigilant approach to the threat posed by avian flu and has introduced a series of incremental measures commensurate with the risk. Additional measures are under active consideration and I will not hesitate to introduce any such additional measures as are appropriate in the face of an increased threat. At this stage, I am satisfied that the measures in place are appropriate to the current level of risk but the situation is clearly evolving and is being kept under constant review with a view to introducing such additional precautionary measures as are warranted.</P>

	<P>An enabling provision to allow for the extension of our comprehensive beef labelling regulations to include a requirement for information on the country of origin of beef to be provided to the consumer at the point of choice, by establishments in the retail, restaurant and catering sectors, including food business operators, is at present before the Oireachtas by way of a proposed amendment to section 54 of the 1947 Health Act through the Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.</P>
        <P>My Department is well advanced in drafting the consequential beef regulations which will be required and is currently in consultation with the Department of Health and Children and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland on the details, including enforcement. While the regulations will then have to be submitted for EU approval, it is hoped that this process will not delay the making of the final regulations. In the meantime, the representative bodies for hotels, restaurants and pubs have agreed to recommend to their members to provide the information on a voluntary basis.</P>
        <P>I have also written to the European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection requesting that consideration be given to extending the rules in regard to country of origin labelling for poultry meat at EU level. I had previously raised the subject in the Agriculture Council some time ago and will continue to seek progress on the matter.</P>
        <P>While the proposed enabling legislation currently before the House will facilitate the extension of country of origin labelling to all meats, because of different traceability systems and some import/export complexities, it is not as straightforward as it is for beef. As with beef, EU approval would also be required. Notwithstanding these issues, I intend to pursue the matter of country of origin labelling at EU and national level.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31, 36, 39, 44, 53 and 62 together.</P>
        <P>A decision on sugar beet growing in 2006 and future years is a matter for beet growers and Irish Sugar Ltd., having regard to the reformed EU sugar regime which will apply from 1 July. The production of ethanol is a possible alternative use for sugar beet. A major extension of the excise duty relief for biofuels was announced in the last budget which should act as an incentive to encourage the production of biofuels, including bioethanol. However, the question of producing bioethanol at the sugar beet processing facility in Mallow from the 2006 beet crop or a future beet crop is a matter for commercial decision by Irish Sugar Ltd.</P>
        <P>The sugar reform package agreed in November provides for compensation to beet growers of up to 64% of the reduction in the minimum price for beet. This compensation, which will be paid as part of the single farm payment, will be worth approximately &euro;123 million to Irish beet growers over the next seven years. I announced recently that, subject to adoption of the regulations on the reform, I intended to fix the reference period for the single payment compensation for beet growers as the three year average of the individual farmer&rsquo;s contracted tonnage of beet in the years 2001, 2002 and 2004. This reference period applies irrespective of the factory to which the beet was delivered.</P>
        <P>Diversification funds of almost &euro;44 million will also become available to growers in the event that <Col N="1919"/>sugar beet production completely ceases in Ireland. In that event, also, an aid package of up to &euro;145 million becomes available for the economic, social and environmental costs of restructuring of the Irish sugar industry, including factory closure and renunciation of quota. At least 10% of the restructuring aid shall be reserved for sugar beet growers and machinery contractors to compensate notably for losses arising from investment in specialised machinery.</P>
        <P>The final legal texts giving effect to the reform agreement could not be considered and approved by the Council of Ministers until the opinion of the European Parliament had been received. That opinion was delivered on 19 January and it is now anticipated that the legal texts will be ready for approval by the Council of Ministers next week. An issue which arose in recent texts was the inclusion of a requirement to deliver beet in the year preceding the year of quota renunciation in order to qualify for restructuring aid. At Ireland&rsquo;s request this requirement was dropped. Full details of the reform agreement will not be available until these regulations are adopted in Council.</P>

	<P>The Food Agency Co-operation Council has met on 20 occasions since its inception in 2000. During 2004 and 2005 priority was given instead to meetings of the food development agencies directly concerned with the food programme components of the National Development Plan 2000-2006. Two such meetings took place in 2004 and one in 2005 to assess progress on the plan in preparation for meetings of the NDP monitoring committees.</P>
        <P>My Department has been examining the role and format of the Food Agency Co-Operation Council and the manner in which the various food agencies can most effectively co-operate to develop the agri-food industry, in the light of the more market orientated CAP framework, the 2015 Agri-Vision report and the enterprise strategy report. A number of initiatives are planned at regional level which will see the various agencies engage and co-operate with my Department to develop the food industry. The first of these initiatives, the North West Food Forum &mdash; Market Focus for Small Food Enterprises, took place in Killybegs on 4 November. At the forum, significant time was allocated for the agencies to network with the industry&rsquo;s stakeholders and to showcase the <Col N="1920"/>services available to assist food company development in the region.</P>
        <P>Similar events focused in other regions as well as other initiatives involving inter-agency co-operation to promote the development of the food industry at all levels will be rolled out during 2006.</P>

	<P>The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter, in the first instance, for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who signed regulations giving legal effect to Ireland&rsquo;s national action programme on nitrates on 11 December 2005. Ireland is proceeding with its request for a derogation designed to allow certain farmers to operate, under appropriate conditions and controls, up to a level of 250kg of organic nitrogen per hectare per annum. My Department is taking the lead in this matter and, with the support of Teagasc, will continue to work with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government towards achieving a successful outcome.</P>
        <P>The proposal was given an initial presentation to the EU nitrates committee in December and further scientific data have been supplied to the Commission following bilateral discussions. The proposal will need to be discussed again at future meetings of the nitrates committee before approval can be obtained. Securing this derogation is vital for the most productive dairy farmers, in particular, and it is important that the position on the regulations is clarified at an early date so that the negotiations on the derogation can proceed.</P>

	<P>A range of actions have already been undertaken by my Department in implementing the recommendations of the food labelling group which examined in detail the complex area of food labelling. One of the more important recom<Col N="1921"/>mendations which has been implemented is the centralisation of overall responsibility for the enforcement of food labelling legislation in the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. Food business operators who mislead consumers into believing that food which is not of Irish origin is Irish may be committing an offence under existing food labelling legislation and any such instances should be brought to the attention of the FSAI.</P>
        <P>The issue of substantial transformation, whereby products following import into the EU may be described after processing as a product of a particular member state, is of particular concern to me. I have raised this issue directly with the Commission on a number of occasions and, indeed, was in contact with the EU Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, Mr. Kyprianou, again last month about the matter. I understand that the Commission intends to publish a consultation paper in March addressing consumer concerns on food labelling. In the context of this review my Department will continue to pursue this matter.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 73 together.</P>
        <P>The Irish dairy industry continues to contribute very substantially to the national economy, with an annual output value of some &euro;2.3 billion. Last year Irish dairy exports performed exceptionally well totalling &euro;1.82 billion, despite downward adjustments to market management supports brought about by the implementation of the Luxembourg agreement on the reform of the CAP.</P>
        <P>World prices for both butter and skimmed milk powder in 2005 averaged 8% above 2004 levels and this solid market performance meant that usage of intervention was particularly low for both products. The casein market also performed very well with an average price increase of 25% over the previous year.</P>
        <P>When the Commission moved aggressively to reduce internal aids and export subsidies to the new intervention price levels last year, which caused a high degree of volatility, I very strongly resisted and pressed the Commissioner at the Council of Ministers to redirect policy and restore <Col N="1922"/>market stability. With the support of other Ministers I succeeded in having the market for the remainder of 2005 stabilised and market competitiveness restored.</P>
        <P>As we move towards the further agreed intervention price reductions next July I will continue to emphasise the need for stability in the market. I have frequently discussed this matter with the Commissioner bilaterally and she is fully aware of my view that market stability is essential to allow the dairy industry time to adjust to the current market realities and adapt its business strategies accordingly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has overall responsibility for energy policy and is primarily responsible for the promotion and development of renewable energy, including biofuels. Nonetheless, the development of the biofuels sector is a matter that impinges on several other policy areas, including agriculture, transport and taxation, and involves various Departments and agencies. My Department has been represented on a number of interdepartmental groups considering the matter and there is also ongoing contact between my Department and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, for example, in regard to the EU Commission&rsquo;s biomass action plan and strategy for biofuels, which will be discussed at next week&rsquo;s Council of Agriculture Ministers&rsquo; meeting.</P>
        <P>I am very conscious of the central role that agriculture can play in supplying the necessary raw materials for the production of biofuels. Oilseed rape, wheat and sugar beet can be used for the manufacture of liquid transport biofuels, while forestry by-products and other farming and food by-products, such as meat and bonemeal and tallow, can be used for energy-heat generation. Tallow can also be used in biodiesel production. Factors such as the increasing cost of oil, the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and the opportunity for farmers to explore alternative land uses following CAP reform, mean that the potential of this area must be fully explored.</P>
        <P>For the purposes of contributing to the development of policy on biofuels, my Department, in conjunction with COFORD and Teagasc, has examined the potential of energy crops, wood biomass and farming and food by-products. In general, the production of energy crops for biofuels will have to be demand led and production by farmers will only occur if the econ<Col N="1923"/>omic returns are greater than those offered by traditional crop enterprises. In the absence of fiscal incentives, the production of liquid biofuels from energy crops is not economic at current oil price levels. The budget announcement by the Minister for Finance of a major extension of the mineral oil tax relief scheme to cover, when the relief is fully operational, some 163 million litres of biofuels per year should further stimulate the production of crops for the manufacture of liquid biofuels. This initiative will benefit the environment in terms of a reduction in CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions and it will enhance security of supply of fuels and create jobs and outlets for agricultural production.</P>
        <P>Within my own area of responsibility, a range of developments are already under way or in the pipeline that will encourage the production and use of biofuels. These include: grants to promote and develop sustainable forestry, including alternative timber use to reduce dependence on fossil fuels; promoting the use of wood biomass, for example, by the installation of a wood heating system at my Department&rsquo;s offices at Johnstown Castle; funding of forest-to-energy pilot projects; willow planting promotion; supporting biofuels research under the research stimulus programme; grant aiding the application of new technologies such as anaerobic-aerobic digestion and fluidised bed combustion, with a renewable energy dimension; and the use of by-products for incineration and co-incineration in place of fossil fuels.</P>
        <P>A number of important developments are also on the horizon at EU level. The Commission has recently produced a biomass action plan and a strategy for biofuels. These are on the agenda for next week&rsquo;s meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers. In this context I will be seeking a review of the operation of the energy crops scheme.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 199 together.</P>
        <P>The political agreement on reform of the sugar regime reached last November provides that in the event of a decision to cease sugar production in Ireland, a restructuring fund of up to &euro;145 million would become available for the economic, social and environmental costs of restructuring the Irish sugar industry. The fund is subject to the submission of a detailed restructuring plan for the industry involving factory closure and the renunciation of sugar quota. The political agreement on reform of the EU sugar regime provides that at least 10% of the restructuring fund shall be reserved for sugar beet growers and machinery contractors to compensate notably for losses arising from investment in specialised machinery. That proportion may be increased by member states after consultation with interested parties, provided that an economically sound balance between the elements of the restructuring plan is ensured.</P>
        <P>The agreement provides that the restructuring scheme will be funded by a restructuring levy payable by sugar processors in each of three marketing years, starting in 2006-07. The levy amounts, per tonne of quota allocated, shall be set at: &euro;126.40 per tonne of quota for the marketing year 2006-07, &euro;173.80 per tonne of quota for the marketing year 2007-08, &euro;113.30 per tonne of quota for the marketing year 2008-09.</P>
        <P>The Commissioner clarified recently that sugar produced in the first year of the reform will be liable for the restructuring levy but in the event of the quota being renounced for the second year the levy will not be payable in that or subsequent years. The levy will have no impact on the minimum price for sugar beet for 2006 set out in the agreement.</P>
        <P>The EU legal texts giving effect to the reform agreement could not be considered and approved by the Council of Ministers until the opinion of the European Parliament had been received. That opinion was delivered on 19 January and it is now anticipated that the legal texts will be ready for approval by the Council of Ministers next week. Meanwhile, the EU Commission is working on preparation of detailed implementation rules which can only be finalised once the Council texts have been adopted. This will be a complex measure to implement and until all the <Col N="1925"/>various legal texts have been adopted it will not be possible to provide details of the definitive implementation arrangements.</P>

        <P>I have outlined in detail to the House on a number of occasions the circumstances surrounding this unusual case. I wish to restate the key aspects. First, the actions by my Department at the time were designed to protect public health by ensuring that animals treated with a prohibited substance did not enter the food chain. Second, my Department obviously wanted to see the animals disposed of in a humane manner and offered to permit the animals to be brought to a slaughter plant. However, the person in charge of the animals chose the manner by which the animals were to be slaughtered and my Department endeavoured to ensure that he did this in a way that the welfare of the animals was not compromised. In view of the fact that the matter is <i>sub judice</i>, I do not propose to comment any further on the case at this stage.</P>

In addition, it is very desirable that the importance of the agrifood sector is reflected in national agreements as it has been over the last 19 years. My Department will, therefore, remain fully involved in the talks with the remaining farmer organisation, and will stand ready to engage with others should they choose to rejoin the process.</P>

	<P>The Animal Remedies Regulations 2005, S.I. No. 734/2005, were signed into law on 17 November 2005. I emphasised at that time that the provisions in EU Directive 28/2004 which required all veterinary medicines for food producing animals to become prescription only would not come into effect until the EU had adopted criteria for the exemption of certain products from this requirement.</P>
        <P>In view of this, I decided to avail of another provision in the directive to retain existing national prescription arrangements until I January 2007, which means that, in effect, the regulations do not require any current off-prescription medicines to be made subject to prescription until 1 January 2007. Accordingly, these regulations confine the writing of prescriptions to veterinarians. However, I have given a commitment to review the regulations in light of the EU decision on the exemptions criteria, particularly to consider whether persons other than vets should be permitted to prescribe veterinary medicines.</P>
        <P>With regard to the exemption criteria, the EU Commission began a public consultation process on the exemption criteria on 9 February by publishing draft criteria on its website. Consultation on this document, which is not yet a formal Commission proposal, will last until 17 March next. While my Department is currently examining the document, a preliminary analysis indicates that, as currently drafted, the criteria would place severe restrictions on the range of medicines which could remain off-prescription.</P>
        <P>My Department had already made a submission to the Commission on this issue and will make a further submission with a view to having the draft criteria adapted to better reflect the risk and-or benefit profile of categories of products and to facilitate decisions in this regard being taken on a scientific basis. It is, of course, open to other stakeholders to engage with the Commission under the public consultation process and I would encourage them to do so.</P>
        <P>As I have already stated publicly, I will, in consultation with stakeholders, review the national distribution arrangements in light of the outcome of the exemption criteria. A decision as to whether persons other than veterinarians may be permitted to prescribe veterinary medicines will be made when the exemption issue has been resolved with a view to ensuring competition in the marketplace while at the same time protecting public and animal health.</P>

	<P>Farmers&rsquo; markets represent a real growth opportunity for farmers and small-scale food producers, as demonstrated by over 100 farmers&rsquo; markets now in operation throughout Ireland.</P>
        <P>I am committed to supporting activities to promote farmers&rsquo; markets in general and was particularly pleased to launch the Origin farmers&rsquo; markets initiative a few months ago in Manorhamilton, County Leitrim, on behalf of the Irish Country Markets Association. Bord Bia, which operates under the aegis of my Department, works closely with other State and local agencies to exploit the growing opportunities for markets. In co-operation with Invest Northern Ireland, it has published a comprehensive information guide on the operation of farmers&rsquo; markets. Bord Bia has a dedicated person in the small business department to assist producers and individuals, and performs a vital support function through the provision of advice and mentoring assistance.</P>
        <P>In 2005, at the suggestion of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, Bord Bia and the Office of Public Works examined the feasibility of using selected national heritage sites as possible future venues for farmers markets. On completion of that work the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, and the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, recently launched the Bord Bia-OPW farmers&rsquo; markets programme for 2006. This is a new and significant extension of the successful food at Farmleigh programme, with five regional heritage sites selected for one-day food market events. The programme commences on 26 February in Fota House and Gardens, County Cork, and other events are planned for counties Wexford, Kildare, Donegal and Laois.</P>
        <P>Bord Bia is also liaising with Dublin City Council as part of the Smithfield regeneration programme and the proposed development of the fruit, vegetable and fish markets. Interested parties were invited to make submissions on the proposed regeneration to the Dublin City Council planner and a consultative forum, including Bord Bia, was established. This initiative will provide small food producers with direct access to the lucrative Dublin market.</P>
        <P>Such initiatives provide producers with direct access to consumers, assist the development of local and regional speciality foods and present consumers with an alternative retail experience. There are also a variety of indirect benefits in terms of improved community spirit, increased employment and added value for tourism. In light of evolving consumer preferences and the growing demand for locally produced foods, I believe there is yet more potential for increased growth <Col N="1929"/>in the quantity and variety of produce channelled in this way.</P>

	<P>The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The Minister, Deputy Roche, has recently made regulations giving legal effect to Ireland&rsquo;s national action programme under the directive.</P>
        <P>The regulations were finalised following difficult negotiations with the European Commission&rsquo;s scientific experts, with both Departments making use of the advice provided by Teagasc. It was the Commission, however, which determined the final content of the regulations. Teagasc has recently indicated that it may be possible to review part of the advice it had given on the application of phosphorus, in a way that could improve the effectiveness of the regulations. The Government and the European Commission saw merit in allowing Teagasc time to elaborate this new advice and, accordingly, the Minister, Deputy Roche, announced a brief <i>de facto </i>deferral of the implementation of Part 3 of the regulations.</P>
        <P>Teagasc has been requested to provide, as a matter of urgency, the necessary scientific case to support any revision of the phosphorus tables in the regulations. The two Departments will carefully consider any submission received from Teagasc while also bearing in mind that any proposals for revision of the phosphorus tables will have to respect the environmental requirements associated with the nitrates directive and meet with the agreement of the European Commission.</P>
        <P>Teagasc has not been specifically requested to review its advice on nitrogen issues. However, to the extent that its revised submission on crop nutrient requirements suggests any further beneficial adjustments to the regulatory regime, these will, of course, be considered. The possibility of such further adjustments will also depend on them respecting the environmental requirements involved, and on their acceptance by the European Commission.</P>

	<P>The agreement on the mid-term review of Agenda 2000 reached at the Council of Agriculture Ministers on 26 June 2003 provided a financial envelope to each member state. This envelope represented the average value of livestock and arable aid premia paid in the member state during the three-year reference period 2000-02 calculated at 2002 rates of payment.</P>
        <P>The outcome of the agreement, which reshapes the Common Agriculture Policy and secures its future in making it more relevant to modern society and more defensible in a WTO context, was a balanced one which addressed Ireland&rsquo;s principal objectives. Among these objectives was the preservation of the financial benefits achieved under the Agenda 2000 agreement and the establishment of a policy framework that would allow farmers and the agrisector the flexibility to adapt to evolving consumer and market demands and international circumstances.</P>
        <P>Index linking of the single payment scheme was not an element of the Commission&rsquo;s proposals. There was, however, a proposal to provide for a reduction of up to 13% in the single payment, known as degression, to meet future financing needs. I believe one of the major achievements in the negotiations was the removal of this proposal. The removal of this particular provision meant a saving of some &euro;420 million for Ireland over the lifetime of the agreement. The compromise agreed was to allow the Council to review, from 2007 onwards, the financial situation annually if budget deficits arise.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 67 together.</P>
        <P>EU state aid approval has been sought for a revised farm waste management scheme in order to assist farmers meet the additional requirements of the nitrates directive. Subject to receipt of the required EU approval, the proposed changes include: the introduction of a standard grant rate of 60%, with 70% being available in the four zone C counties, for both animal housing and slurry storage &mdash; the current standard grant rate for such work is 40%; the extension of the maximum income unit ceiling for farmers from 450 to 650 income units, with no upper limit being applied in the case of pig and poultry farmers; an increase in the maximum eligible investment ceiling from &euro;75,000 to &euro;120,000 per holding; the removal of any minimum income requirement from farming from the scheme so that all small farmers can participate in the scheme; the extension of the scheme to include horses, deer, goats, pigs and poultry, and mushroom compost; the introduction of a new 40% grant rate for specialised equipment with specific environmental advantages subject to a maximum eligible investment of &euro;80,000 in the case of decanter centrifuge systems and feeding systems for pigs and &euro;40,000 in the case of specialised slurry spreading tankers and related equipment; an increase in the maximum eligible investment for standard mobile equipment from &euro;11,000 to &euro;15,000.</P>
        <P>Revised standard costings will be introduced when the scheme is launched to take account of factors such as the increase in steel prices.</P>
        <P>Last July, I announced details of the proposed revised scheme. As the approval of the European Commission was required for such, from a state aid perspective, a formal application seeking approval for the revised scheme was submitted to the Commission on 30 September last. The application has been the subject of ongoing negotiations between the Commission and my Department in the intervening period. I recently had a meeting with Commissioner Fischer Boel at which I stressed the importance of this issue to Ireland. I expect that the outstanding issues will <Col N="1932"/>be resolved in the near future so that the revised scheme can be introduced at an early date.</P>

	<P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 55 and 65 together.</P>
        <P>Ireland has a greater percentage of younger farmers under 35 years of age, 11%, compared to the EU average of 8%. However, the Government recognises the importance of attracting young farmers into agriculture and has therefore put in place a number of incentives, as outlined below.</P>
        <P>Under the installation aid scheme operated by my Department, a grant of &euro;9,523 is available to young farmers who are between the ages of 18 and 35 on the date of set-up and who meet the education and income requirements of the scheme. Expenditure to date under the scheme, since its introduction in 2001, has amounted to &euro;24.3 million.</P>
        <P>The milk quota restructuring scheme is the principal means by which dairy farmers can acquire additional milk quota and for many years the scheme has included special provision for qualified young farmers. In the 2005 scheme almost 1,500 young farmers benefited from the provision, which grants young trained milk producers with quotas of less than 350,000 litres an additional allocation from the scheme. The young farmer allocations amounted to almost 25% of the restructuring pool in some areas where there was sufficient demand from qualified applicants.</P>
        <P>Since 2003, young trained farmers have been able to acquire quota from the restructuring scheme to set up their own enterprise on the existing family holding provided they formed a registered milk production partnership with their parents. To date, almost 350 new entrant-parent milk production partnerships have been established. The details of the 2006 milk quota restructuring scheme will be announced before the end of March.</P>
        <P>A broad range of taxation incentives is in place to facilitate the transfer of farms to young farmers, especially those with agricultural qualifications. Eligible farmers can avail of: 100% stock relief for young trained farmers for up to four years after set-up; 90% agricultural relief on capital acquisitions tax; 100% stamp duty relief on <Col N="1933"/>transfers of agricultural land and buildings to young trained farmers; full relief from capital gains tax is available for farmers over 55 years of age who transfer the farm to a child or nephew or niece; capital gains tax retirement relief for farmers over 55 years of age who have owned and farmed the land for the previous ten years. This exempts the transfer of farming assets up to the value of &euro;500,000 from capital gains tax.</P>
        <P>There is also a rental income tax exemption for farmers over 40 years of age to lease out land on a long-term basis. Annual relief of &euro;12,000 for leases of five to seven years and &euro;15,000 for leases of more than seven years is available. This encourages land mobility to allow more productive farmers to increase production.</P>
        <P>In regard to advisory services, Teagasc offers all farmers access to a wide range of independent professional advisory services. Advisory staff are located in a nationwide network of advisory offices and local training centres. All front-line advisory staff are supported by specialists, researchers and laboratory staff from the Teagasc research and development centres. The services are focused on meeting the needs of a diverse farming community and rural society.</P>
        <P>Teagasc provides the full suite of training for young entrants, farmers, rural entrepreneurs and executives-operatives in the food industry. The organisation has a resource of over 200 teachers and trainers operating from nine colleges, local training centres and research centres. More than 10,000 people attend Teagasc training courses each year. All education and training programmes are benchmarked to the best international standards.</P>
        <P>Teagasc has recently completed a major review of its provision of agricultural education and training. One of the major planks of the review was to increase the attractiveness of Teagasc training programmes particularly for part-time farmers. The vocational certificate in agriculture is being restructured so as to facilitate the requirements of part-time farmers. The nine months placement has been reduced to three months on-farm placement and nine months placement on the home farm. The home farm placement can be done in conjunction with off-farm working.</P>
        <P>In addition to the changes arising from the review, a greater degree of flexibility has been introduced into all Teagasc programmes in recent years. There is now flexibility to transfer from vocational programmes to higher level programmes and students can progress right up to honours degree level if they so wish.</P>

	<P>The significant task of implementing the single farm payment scheme was successfully achieved when over &euro;1 billion in single payments issued to 118,500 farmers last December, meeting the target we had set ourselves of making the payments on the first possible date. This was a major undertaking and the outcome, after painstaking preparatory work in establishing individual entitlements, was, by any standards, a major achievement.</P>
        <P>Under the 2005 single payment scheme, 143,000 applications were received. In addition to those applicants seeking to both activate their entitlements and also receive payment, applications were also received from farmers seeking only to activate their entitlements. It will be recalled that farmers who did not seek to activate their entitlements in 2005 would, under the EU rules, forfeit these entitlements to the national reserve.</P>
        <P>Currently, total payments amount to &euro;1,126 million with 97% of farmers, who hold entitlements and applied for the single payment scheme, paid. In common with the coupled schemes, which the single payment scheme replaced, delays in processing can be caused by many factors, including incomplete application forms, errors on applications and discrepancies highlighted following computer validation, which must be resolved via correspondence with the applicant. In many cases, payment could not be made because applicants did not submit an application to transfer the single payment entitlements, with lands, by way of inheritance, gift, lease or purchase. Many of these applications were only received after my Department made direct contact with the farmers in question, during recent weeks, and some have yet to be submitted.</P>
        <P>The ongoing objective of my Department is to make payments to all of those farmers who have yet to receive their payment or are entitled to a supplementary payment as soon as their cases are cleared for payment. Every effort is being made by my Department to resolve the outstanding cases but many of these are extremely complex and, in other cases, my Department is still awaiting documentation and applications for the transfer of entitlements before payment can be made. A number of payment runs continue to be made weekly as the more complicated files are cleared.</P>

Bord Bia, as part of its statutory role in promoting the development of Ireland&rsquo;s food and drink industry, works in close co-operation with its counterpart in Northern Ireland, Invest Northern Ireland, INI.

        <P>The development of an all-island animal health policy is, however, a necessary prerequisite to the establishment of an all-island food label. The development of the animal health policy is being actively pursued in the context of North-South co-operation. In addition, an all-island food label would require negotiation between the relevant authorities regarding its status and conditions for use and general acceptance from consumers and buy-in by producers and processors island-wide.</P>

	<P>The agreement on the mid-term review of Agenda 2000 was a balanced one which addressed Ireland&rsquo;s principal objectives. Among these objectives was the preservation of the financial benefits achieved under the Agenda 2000 agreement and the establishment of a policy framework that will allow farmers and the agri-sector the flexibility to adapt to evolving consumer and market demands. In particular, farmers are now free to concentrate more on market requirements and need no longer concern themselves about retention periods, quotas, stocking densities, census dates and other requirements associated with the old coupled regime.</P>
        <P>Under the single payment scheme, the financial envelope provided for each member state represented the average value of livestock and arable aid premia paid during the three year reference period calculated at 2002 rates of payment. I am particularly pleased that the 2002 rate of payment was used to calculate the single payment as this was the highest rate payable under the Agenda 2000 arrangements.</P>
        <P>The introduction of the single payment scheme in 2005 was a major undertaking for my Department and also involved a considerable learning curve for farmers. Payments under the scheme commenced on 1 December, the earliest date allowed in the EU regulations. Some 110,000 <Col N="1936"/>farmers were paid &euro;970 million on that date. By the end of 2005, over 118,000 farmers had received &euro;1,058 million under the scheme. The achievement in terms of delivery in the first year of a major scheme shift has been recognised all round. Ireland&rsquo;s performance in this regard places us in the lead group of member states.</P>

	<P>My Department received a total of 55 communications by 1 February 2006 in response to my request of 7 December 2005 for observations on the coexistence measures set out in the working group report referred to by the Deputy. These measures are aimed at creating conditions during the cultivation, harvest, transport and storage of crops that make it possible for conventional and organic growers to keep the adventitious presence of genetically modified organisms, GMOs, in their crops below the labelling thresholds established in Community law while ensuring that farmers who want to grow authorised genetically modified, GM, crops can do so. Following the receipt of a number of requests, I am extending the closing date for receipt of observations on the report to 31 March 2006.</P>
        <P>While the vast majority of the submissions received to date went well beyond the boundary of the request and, <i>inter alia</i>, called on me to establish a GM-free island or reject GM technology as being untried and unsafe, I will take into consideration all observations made in respect of the recommendations relating to co-existence when I am finalising measures for the cultivation of GM crops alongside non-GM crops.</P>

	<P>The Rural Ireland 2025: Foresight report was compiled by a working group drawn from the National University of Ireland, Maynooth; University College Dublin; and Teagasc and gives its perspective on rural Ireland in the year 2025. In the &ldquo;synthesis&rdquo; section of the <Col N="1937"/>report, it states that it is unlikely that by 2025, Ireland will have appreciably more that 10,000 full-time commercial farmers and 30,000 part-time farmers. The foresight report does not contain a detailed analysis giving the rationale behind these figures.</P>
        <P>A detailed analysis of farm numbers was undertaken for the independent agri-vision 2015 report, chaired by Alan Dukes. The report cites the figure of 105,000 farmers by 2015, a reduction of approximately 2% per annum. The Rural Ireland 2025: Foresight report appears to accept the analysis set out in the agri-vision 2015 report and omits any detailed explanation on the predicted drop in number by 2025.</P>
        <P>The agri-vision 2015 report gives a detailed breakdown explaining the numbers and the rationale for the projected drop in farm numbers to 105,000 in 2015. Some of the contributing factors include incomes levels on farms, the rise in the popularity of part-time farming, the stabilising effects of the single farm payment and the availability of off-farm employment. These factors will underpin the continuing importance of farming and in particular part-time farming. On the issue of farm numbers themselves, it is clear that Ireland is not alone. Farm numbers are dropping in all developed countries. In fact, the rate of decrease in this country is lower than in several other European countries.</P>
        <P>This Government is focused on ensuring that farming families have the best possible options available for them to stay on the land. That may mean as full-time farmers, if their farm size and resources are sufficient and if they choose that option. Alternatively, it may be through the combination of on-farm and off-farm income, which many smaller farmers are finding is the best route to a viable life on the land. The commitment of this Government is to support and encourage our farm families in whichever option they choose.</P>

        <Quest>the reason guidelines are not being made available to the farmers affected in view of the fact that the nitrates directive is now law; if an explanation will be given to farmers as to their position in law; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The Minister recently made regulations giving legal effect to Ireland&rsquo;s national action programme under the directive. It is now important for farmers to be given as much accurate information as possible about where <Col N="1938"/>they stand legally and about the practical implications of the regulations.</P>
        <P>A good deal of recent comment and speculation has been selective, and indeed misleading, and has only led to greater confusion among farmers. As a first step towards clearing up that confusion, my Department has placed advertisements in the farming press explaining the main provisions of the regulations in clear and straightforward terms. A handbook is being finalised and will be sent to every farmer as soon as possible. Officials of my Department have already had discussions with Teagasc about arrangements for the delivery of information which will further help farmers to understand the practical aspects of the new regulations.</P>
        <P>The position of farmers with regard to the nitrates regulations is that the regulations came into law on 1 February. The organic nitrogen limit of 170 kg organic nitrogen per hectare per year applies from that date, although my Department is in negotiations with the Commission on derogation arrangements for more intensive farmers. The rules about record keeping, about soil and weather conditions for spreading fertiliser and manure and the rules about buffer zones also came into force from 1 February 2006. Prohibited application periods for the spreading of organic and chemical fertilisers come into force on 15 September 2006 for chemical fertiliser and 15 October for organic fertiliser. The manure storage requirements also came into force on 1 February, though in practice farmers have up to 31 December 2008 to comply fully with these. The only exception relates to holdings with more than 100 pigs, which must have 26 weeks&rsquo; storage in place on 31 December 2006.</P>
        <P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has, however, announced a brief <i>de facto</i> deferral of the implementation of part 3 of the regulations, which deals with nutrient management. These provisions were finalised following difficult negotiations with the Commission&rsquo;s scientific experts, with both Departments making use of the advice provided by Teagasc &mdash; though it was the Commission which determined the final content of the regulations. Teagasc has recently indicated that it may be possible to review part of the advice it had given on the application of phosphorus in a way that could improve the effectiveness of the regulations. The Government and the European Commission saw merit in allowing Teagasc time to elaborate this new advice and it is for this reason that the implementation of this part of the regulations has been briefly deferred.</P>
        <P>Teagasc has been requested to provide, as a matter of urgency, the necessary scientific case to support any revision of the phosphorus tables in the regulations. The two Departments will carefully consider any submission received from Teagasc while also bearing in mind that any proposals for revision of the phosphorus tables will <Col N="1939"/>have to respect the environmental requirements associated with the nitrates directive and meet with the agreement of the European Commission.</P>
        <P>Teagasc has not been specifically requested to review its advice on nitrogen issues. However, to the extent that its revised submission on crop nutrient requirements suggests any further beneficial adjustments to the regulatory regime, these will, of course, be considered. The possibility of such further adjustments will also depend on their respecting the environmental requirements involved and on their acceptance by the European Commission.</P>

	<P>As a member of the EU and the World Trade Organisation, WTO, Ireland is in a position to avail of opportunities for trade that are essential for the development of our open economy. Membership of these organisations also brings reciprocal trade obligations. The principle is that imported animal products meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, member states. All such imports must come from third countries or areas of third countries that have been approved by the EU authorities for export to the EU. Irish farmers are required to ensure that their production systems and farm practices fully comply with a wide range of EU directives on important matters, including traceability, animal health and welfare and consumer protection.</P>
        <P>I fully support, therefore, the policy that animal products imported into the EU from third countries meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, EU member states. In this context, I wrote to the Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, Mr. Markos Kyprianou, concerning the sanitary rules applying to the import of livestock products, especially beef, into the EU. In his reply, the Commissioner outlined that, with respect to traceability and controls of residues of veterinary medicines, the purpose of EU legislation is not to impose on exporting third countries a system of guarantees that is equal to the EU system but that the exporting country provides guarantees that are equivalent to the standards applied in the EU.</P>
        <P>The Commissioner indicated his service is committed to protect the health of European consumers and European livestock. It has regularly carried out inspections in Brazil also with respect to the points of concern raised in my letter and has taken appropriate measures whenever necessary. The Commission&rsquo;s adoption of restrictive <Col N="1940"/>measures in respect of the finding of residues of unauthorised substances in poultry meat and the quick and proportionate protective measures applied to imports of beef as a result of the recent outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in Brazil demonstrate the Commission&rsquo;s primary objective of maintaining the high sanitary status of the Community and respecting the EU&rsquo;s commitment under the WTO agreement on sanitary and phytosanitary measures.</P>
        <P>In respect of the operation of EU controls on exports from Brazil the Commissioner indicated that an EU food and veterinary office, FVO, inspection to evaluate animal health and public health control systems, traceability and certification procedures in place in that country has recently been carried out. Following consultation with the Brazilian competent authorities on its findings, which is not yet complete, the FVO will issue a report. The Commissioner has assured me that the Commission will not hesitate to take the appropriate protection measures if a product imported from a third country or produced in the domestic market represents a risk for the health of EC consumers, livestock or plants.</P>

	<P>There is already a long history of co-operation between the administrations in the North and the South on animal health issues. The administrations have traditionally shared information at local and national levels on disease control and surveillance issues and have worked together to combat illegal movements of animals and animal products. The foot and mouth emergency of 2001 is a testament to the extent of co-operation and consultation that exists at official, ministerial and political levels. Likewise, both administrations are co-operating on measures relating to avian influenza.</P>
        <P>The establishment of the North-South Ministerial Council offered an opportunity to build on existing co-operation arrangements and provided a framework for the development of an all-island animal health policy. The main objectives of the council are to foster co-operation and to devise a common, unified animal health strategy for the island as a whole. This involves the convergence of animal health policies and the development of joint strategies for dealing with animal diseases. The ultimate objectives are to establish a common import regime and equivalent internal arrangements with a view to achieving free movement of animals and animal products within the island.</P>
        <P>A total of nine policy working groups have been established at official level under North-South arrangements to take forward various initiatives. The remit of these groups includes TB and brucellosis; TSEs, BSE and scrapie; veterinary medicines; other zoonoses and animal diseases; disease surveillance; animal welfare; import and export of live animals and animal products; animal identification; traceability; and cross-Border aspects of fraud. These groups continue to report progress in exchange of information and in implementation of initiatives aimed at policy convergence and the development of a common unified strategy for the island as a whole.</P>
        <P>The main achievements to date are the development of a co-ordinated and complementary approach towards import policies and portal controls at points of entry to the island, the development of similar approaches to combat the introduction of animal diseases, the convergence <Col N="1942"/>of policies in regard to animal identification and strengthening of co-ordination and co-operation on issues such as contingency planning.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above, there has been a significant deepening and strengthening of co-operation, information exchange and ongoing co-ordination between the two administrations on a variety of issues such as foot and mouth disease, BSE, avian influenza and cross-Border fraud while the farm animal welfare advisory council includes representation from DARD. On cross-Border fraud, the two administrations have worked together successfully in a number of joint enforcement actions and ongoing exchanges of expertise and information are taking place.</P>

	<P>The negotiations on the new World Trade Organisation, WTO, agreement are ongoing. The ministerial conference, which took place in Hong Kong in December 2005, represented further progress towards the final agreement. In terms of the agriculture negotiations, the most significant development in Hong Kong related to agreement on an end date of 2013 for the elimination of all forms of export subsidy. This elimination date is conditional on the parallel elimination of all forms of export subsidy, namely export refunds, export credits, the trade-distorting practices of state trading enterprises and certain food aid practices. It was agreed that the end date will only be confirmed on completion of all modalities for the new round.</P>
        <P>The Hong Kong ministerial conference has also set a deadline of the end of April 2006 for agreement to be reached on the full modalities of the new round. Intensive negotiations are taking place in Geneva at present with a view to making further progress and to meeting the end of April deadline. My overall objective is to ensure that the terms of a new agreement will not necessitate further reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and that the final deal is properly balanced between agriculture and non-agriculture and also within agriculture.</P>
        <P>More specifically, my priorities in the ongoing negotiations are as follows: on domestic supports to ensure that the EU system of decoupled direct payments continues to qualify as non-trade-distorting payments under the so-called green box and so remain exempt from reductions under the new round; on export subsidies to ensure that full parallel elimination of all forms of export subsidies is delivered and that the most flexible phasing-out arrangements are achieved; and on market access to retain the maximum possible level of protection against increased imports through <Col N="1943"/>minimising tariff cuts, establishing sensitive product status where necessary, minimising tariff rate quota expansion and ensuring that an effective safeguard clause is in place. In respect of access, the whole area of non-trade barriers and standards is extremely important.</P>

	<P>I am aware that the Argentine competent authorities notified the World Organisation on Animal Health on 8 February 2006 of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease on a large farm in the Corrientes province in the northern region of the county. This notification indicates control measures including quarantine, movement control, vaccination and bio-safety have been introduced and that additional measures, including stamping out, screening and zoning within the affected region, will be undertaken.</P>
        <P>In respect of trade in agricultural products, the EU generally applies the regionalisation principle, which allows trade to continue from non-affected regions. In practice, this means that where there is a disease outbreak, restrictions on trade are applied to products from this affected region while trade can continue from other unaffected parts of the country or region. It will be recalled that this principle was applied to trade here during the foot and mouth disease outbreak in 2001.</P>
        <P>Argentina has been regionalised for the purpose of exporting animal products. The Commission is bringing forward proposals to the standing committee on the food chain and animal health, which is meeting today, to introduce a ban on the import of meat from the Corrientes province.

	<P>The recent notification made by BASF to trial genetically modified, GM, potatoes at Summerhill, County Meath, was made to the Environmental Protection Agency. This notifi<Col N="1944"/>cation is in accordance with part B of EU Directive 2001/18/EC on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms, GMOs, into the environment but not for entry to the food chain. Responsibility for making a decision on the application is a matter for the Environmental Protection Agency as the competent authority designated by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Since procedures under legislation are in play, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on this particular application.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s role in GMOs relates to placing on the market of authorised GM feed and the cultivation of authorised GM crops. These roles are governed by binding EU legislation which was adopted over the past number of years by the Council and European Parliament. Government policy on GMOs was set out in the 2000 report of the interdepartmental group on modern biotechnology. This report recommended &ldquo;a positive acceptance of the potential benefits of biotechnology tempered by a precautionary approach to the potential risks&mdash; and to ensure that, so far as possible, the benefits of biotechnology are maximized and the risks minimized without compromising on safety for people or environment&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Any application to grow authorised GM potatoes in Ireland would therefore be considered by my Department within the context of a legislative framework governing coexistence. As the Deputy is aware, I have received the report of the interdepartmental group on coexistence. I am currently seeking observations on the recommendations in the report which I will draw on in finalising our national coexistence measures.</P>

	<P>The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter, in the first instance, for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who signed regulations giving legal effect to Ireland&rsquo;s national action programme on nitrates on 11 December 2005. Ireland is proceeding with its request for a derogation designed to allow certain farmers to operate, under appropriate conditions and controls, up to a level of 250 kg of organic nitrogen per hectare per annum. My Department is taking the lead in <Col N="1945"/>this matter and, with the support of Teagasc, will continue to work with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government toward achieving a successful outcome.</P>
        <P>The proposal was given an initial presentation to the EU nitrates committee in December and further scientific data have been supplied to the Commission following bilateral discussions. The proposal will need to be discussed again at future meetings of the nitrates committee before approval can be obtained. Securing this derogation is vital for the most productive dairy farmers in particular and it is important that the position on the regulations is clarified at an early date so that the negotiations on the derogation can proceed.</P>

	<P>Consumers are entitled to and should be provided with full information on foodstuffs. In this context, my Department continues to give considerable attention to food labelling. Given the complexities involved, with account having to be taken of EU legislation and the Single Market, a food labelling group was established in 2002 to examine the matter in detail. Since then, my Department has pursued assiduously the implementation of the recommendations of the food labelling group. A total of 19 of the 21 recommendations, many of which were beyond the remit of my Department and some which were to be activated only after others had been completed, have been addressed. The remaining two recommendations, which relate to aspects of origin labelling, are also being addressed.</P>
        <P>Arising from the implementation of the group&rsquo;s recommendations, the enforcement of all food labelling regulations has been centralised in the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI. This not only streamlines the enforcement measures but it <Col N="1946"/>also provides a one-stop shop for any complaints on mislabelling of food. In addition, the responsibility for food labelling policy, with the exception of fish, has been assigned to the Department of Health and Children and my Department in accordance with another recommendation of the food labelling group. Accordingly, the Department of Health and Children is responsible for general labelling regulations which require information on food labels to be given clearly, accurately and in a language understood by the consumer. My Department is responsible for more detailed legislation on the labelling of specific food products, including beef and poultry meat.</P>
        <P>An enabling provision to allow for the extension of existing comprehensive beef labelling regulations to include a requirement for information on the country of origin of beef to be provided to the consumer at the point of choice by establishments in the retail, restaurant and catering sectors, including food business operators, is at present before the D&aacute;il by way of amendment to section 54 of the Health Act 1947 through the Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2005. The Report Stage of the Bill was debated yesterday, Wednesday, 15 February. It will now proceed to the Seanad for Report and Final Stages.</P>
        <P>My Department is well advanced in drafting the consequential beef regulations and is currently in consultation with the Department of Health and Children and the FSAI on the details, including enforcement. While the regulations will then have to be submitted for EU approval, it is hoped that this process will not delay the making of the final regulations. In the meantime, the representative bodies for hotels, restaurants and pubs have agreed to recommend to their members to provide the information on a voluntary basis.</P>
        <P>I have also written to the European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection requesting that consideration be given to extending the rules in regard to country of origin labelling at EU level. I had raised the matter in the Agriculture Council some months ago.</P>
        <P>While the proposed enabling legislation currently before the House will facilitate the extension of country of origin labelling to all meats, because of different traceability systems and some import-export complexities, it is not as straightforward as it is for beef. As with beef, EU approval would also be required. Notwithstanding these issues, I intend to pursue the matter of country of origin labelling at EU level and national level.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe that the interests of agriculture and consumers are best protected by the Common Agricultural Policy, as it has evolved following recent reforms, which is consumer-focused and guarantees food supply to the highest standards of food safety, animal welfare and environmental sustainability. A cornerstone of this reformed Common Agricultural Policy is the recently introduced single farm payment scheme, which secures direct payments to farmers until 2013 and by means of cross-compliance, delivers environmental protection, animal health and welfare and food safety.</P>
        <P>The current situation is threatened by the ongoing negotiations on a new WTO agreement which are aimed at liberalising trade and in reducing substantially the levels of protection and support for agriculture. My objective in the negotiations is to ensure that any new agreement will not necessitate further reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
        <P>At national level, the agri-vision report, which was commissioned by my predecessor, identified the rapidly changing nature of Irish agriculture and the issues facing the agriculture and food industries, including the need for market-driven production and greater levels of productivity. The report set out a framework for the future and the actions and changes that are required. The report placed great emphasis on meeting consumer requirements and the role of competitiveness in the context of an increasingly global market. I will be producing a plan of action in the near future that will set out a clear programme of work for my Department and other interests in the agri-food sector to enhance competitiveness and to fulfil the productive potential to meet consumer demands into the future.</P>

	<P>Following consideration of a technical report on possible additional costs that could arise following restocking, I sought and received approval from the EU Commission, under state aid rules, to make additional payments to flock owners who had flocks depopulated during the period December 2001 to 15 April 2003.</P>
        <P>As the additional costs in each case are related <i>inter alia</i> to the number of breeding ewes in the flocks in the years following restocking, my Department issued documentation along with declaration forms to the relevant flock owners in <Col N="1948"/>late November last in respect of these payments for year four. Flock owners who wish to be considered for these payments were requested to return the completed stocking declaration form together with their flock register. A number of flock owners have already submitted their applications, inspections have been carried out and payments issued.</P>
        <P>Following further consideration of the matter, I have decided to amend the arrangements already announced relating to these additional payments. Flock owners who have not already submitted declarations and registers are being advised accordingly and are being invited to do so now. Those who have already received payments will be entitled to the amended arrangements.</P>

	<P>The National University of Ireland&rsquo;s report Rural Living: An Analysis of 1,249 Households in the Republic of Ireland is welcome, and provides an interesting perspective on the issue of rural diversification. Although the report itself speaks of a relative degree of reluctance by farm respondents to consider new activities or diversification, it should be noted that there is already a large degree of diversification within the farming sector. The significant numbers of farmers engaged in off-farm employment shows a clear interest by those farmers in maximising their income stream through their choice of other employment options. For many farmers and their spouses, off-farm employment is their favoured option.</P>
        <P>The role of Government is to ensure that farmers and farm families have choices and to support them in whatever choices they make about their own futures. This Government has been very successful is providing an economic environment which enables farmers to avail of both on- and off-farm opportunities to secure their future. The advent of the single farm payment has, of course, increased the flexibility open to them and therefore will allow new options to be explored by farmers.</P>

	<P>The main statutes governing cruelty to animals in this country are the Protection of Animals Acts 1911 and 1965. Responsibility for pursuing complaints under that legislation rests with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which may, on receipt of a complaint, investigate and bring a prosecution against any person alleged to have committed an act of cruelty against an animal. Officers of my Department are regularly involved in assisting the Garda in such cases.</P>
        <P>My Department has certain statutory responsibility for the welfare and protection of farmed animals. The legislation governing this is the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes Act 1984 and the European Community (Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes) Regulations 2000. In addition there is specific legislation relating to pigs, calves and laying hens.</P>
        <P>Information on animal welfare cases dealt with in any particular year under the foregoing headings is not compiled centrally in my Department. Cases which come to notice are dealt with, generally, by officers based in my Department&rsquo;s district veterinary offices. These officers deal with the implementation of animal welfare legislation as well as having responsibilities in a wide number of other areas related to animal health, disease control and so forth. It is not possible to estimate with any accuracy the time allocated by individual officers to the different activities.</P>
        <P>The principal expenditure on animal welfare relates to the salaries and other costs of the personnel engaged in dealing with animal welfare cases. Funding is also available to deal with emergency care, feeding, transport and so forth of welfare compromised farm animals but amounts expended in any year on these aspects are relatively modest.</P>
        <P>In 2004 the farm animal welfare council, FAWAC, introduced an early warning-intervention system, EWS, for animal welfare cases involving the Department of Agriculture and <Col N="1950"/>Food, Irish Farmers Association and the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty of Animals. The objective of the system is to provide a framework within which farm animal welfare problems can be spotted before they become critical or overwhelming. The new system will allow for concerned individuals to approach their local IFA representatives, their local SPCA or my Department in the knowledge that the matter will thereafter be dealt with in the most effective, timely and sensitive manner.</P>
        <P>In addition to the foregoing, my Department makes <i>ex gratia</i> payments annually to organisations involved in the direct delivery of animal care and welfare services to assist in their ongoing work. In this regard, some &euro;1.2 million was paid to 86 organisations in December last to assist them during 2006 and a provision of &euro;1.1 million for this purpose is included in my Department&rsquo;s Estimates for 2006.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84, 89, 90 and 96 together.</P>
        <P>The annual organ donor awareness campaign, which is organised by the Irish Donor Network and administered by the Irish Kidney Association, highlights the necessity for organ donation generally. The campaign, which is supported by <Col N="1951"/>my Department, highlights the need for organ donors by promoting the carrying of a organ donor card. My Department has been providing financial support to the donor awareness campaign for a number of years. The grant in 2005 amounted to &euro;500,000.</P>
        <P>There are two systems that can be used to ascertain an individual&rsquo;s wishes on organ donation: the opt-in system and the opt-out system. The former system, which operates in this country, requires that the specific consent to donation of each person, or their relatives, be obtained before organs or tissues are removed. The opt-out system presumes that all citizens consent to donation unless they have specifically expressed a wish to the contrary.</P>
        <P>The practice in this country is that, even when a person has indicated his or her willingness to donate organs by way of carrying an organ donor card, or a driving licence marked accordingly, the consent of the next-of-kin is always sought. Even where opt-out systems are in operation, the relatives of the deceased are approached as part of the donor screening process to seek a medical history of any high-risk behaviour. Thus, the relatives will always be aware that a donation is being considered and can register an objection to the donation.</P>
        <P>The European Commission is currently considering the question of a directive in respect of organ transplantation, including the issue of consent, and proposes to conduct a thorough scientific evaluation of the situation. It will present a report on its analysis to the Council of the European Union and it is expected that this report will inform decisions regarding the development of a legislative framework in this area.</P>
        <P>In the context of increasing the number of donor organs available for transplant, the Health Service Executive has been asked by the Department to undertake a review and analysis of the factors that impact on organ procurement and retrieval rates in hospitals around the country.</P>

	<P>The Government has agreed the key elements of a scheme for the repayment of long stay charges for publicly funded residential <Col N="1956"/>care. All those fully eligible persons who were wrongly charged and are alive and the estates of all those who were wrongly charged and died since 9 December 1998 will have the charges repaid in full. The repayments will include both the actual charge paid and an amount to take account of inflation using the consumer price index since the time the person involved was charged.</P>
        <P>Draft heads of a Bill for a repayment scheme were submitted to Government in December and were approved. The draft heads have been submitted to Parliamentary Counsel for drafting and it is my intention to have the Bill published in the current parliamentary session and to have repayments commencing shortly after the Bill is approved and signed into law.</P>
        <P>The scheme will be designed and managed with the aim of ensuring that those who are eligible for repayments receive them as soon as possible and with the minimum possible imposition in terms of bureaucracy. Priority will be given to those who are still alive. Many of those eligible for repayments have already been identified as a result of initial payments made following my announcement in December 2004. The scheme will include a transparent and thorough appeals process.</P>

The Health Service Executive will be asked to allocate this funding on an equitable basis, having regard to the needs of people with disabilities.

        <P>The remit of the alcohol marketing communications monitoring body is to oversee the implementation of, and adherence to, the voluntary code of practice on alcohol advertising. I understand that it has met once since its establishment in January and will continue to meet over the course of the year. The decision to await the annual report of the monitoring body before deciding on further action was taken to allow the <Col N="1958"/>body a sufficient period in which to review compliance with and adherence to the code of practice.</P>
        <P>The voluntary code of practice complements existing restrictions such as those of the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland and the Broadcasting Complaints Commission and in no way impinges on the complaints procedures associated with these or other bodies. I am happy to await the outcome of the first annual report of the monitoring body and, as the T&aacute;naiste has stated previously, legislation will be progressed if the body finds that the codes are not being adhered to.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 and 107 together.</P>
        <P>The strategic task force on alcohol was established in January 2002 and was given a remit to recommend specific evidence based measures to Government to prevent and reduce alcohol related harm. It published an interim report in May 2002 and a second report in September 2004. The reports provide approximately 100 recommendations across a range of sectors including research, legislative, community training, advertising and sponsorship, awareness raising measures and so forth.</P>
        <P>Significant progress has been made across Departments in implementing the task force recommendations. I have arranged to have a summary document forwarded to the Deputy outlining details of the progress made. As the Deputy will be aware, the executive functions of this Department have transferred to the Health Service Executive, HSE. I am confident that the HSE will continue to progress the implementation of the task force recommendations.</P>
        <P>A number of the recommendations contained in the interim report concern a reduction in the exposure of children and adolescents to alcohol advertising, marketing and sponsorship. In response to these, the Department entered into negotiations with the broadcasting, media and drinks industries while at the same time pursuing the development of legislation to restrict alcohol advertising, sponsorship and sales promotions and marketing practices. It was agreed that the industry would respond on an incremental basis.</P><Col N="1959"/>
        <P>This has resulted in the establishment of Central Copy Clearance Ireland which addresses the issue of the content of advertisements, the development of a voluntary code of practice on advertising which addresses the issue of placement and the establishment of the alcohol marketing and communications monitoring body to oversee the implementation of the voluntary code. As the T&aacute;naiste has previously indicated, she will await the annual report of the monitoring body before deciding on future actions relating to legislation on this issue. Negotiations with the industry stakeholders are ongoing and will include the issue of sponsorship.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no plans to introduce an income disregard for income tax purposes as proposed by the Deputy. The &euro;100 disregard referred to by the Deputy does not relate to taxation. It is a general principle in the tax code that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subject to taxation. In line with this principle, the majority of social welfare payments, including contributory and non-contributory old age pensions, are reckonable as income for tax purposes.</P>
        <P>In budget 2006, I increased the contributory pension for those aged 66 or over to &euro;193.30 per week for a single person and &euro;342.60 per week for a person with a qualified adult who is aged 66 or over. Income generated through the take-up or continuance of work will be reckonable for taxation in addition to the income received through the contributory pension. However, I should point out that those aged 65 or over, including those in receipt of a contributory social welfare pension, are already treated more favourably under the tax code than the generality of taxpayers. This is the case irrespective of whether they are taxed under the normal system of tax credits and bands or the age exemption limits.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my answer to Parliamentary Question No. 367 of 14 February 2006.</P>
        <P>There are a number of tax reliefs currently available for the construction of certain health facilities, which include capital allowances for private hospitals, convalescent homes, private nursing homes and residential units attached to nursing homes. Various conditions have to be met for these reliefs to apply. In general there are no reliefs available for health centres but a health <Col N="1968"/>centre which is located in a special tax incentive area, such as a rural renewal or urban renewal area, and is located in a commercial premises may qualify for relief provided all the necessary conditions are met.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>A relief from mineral oil tax was introduced in the Finance Act 2004 for biofuels produced or used in certain pilot projects. The pilot projects could be for the production of biofuel or for testing the technical viability of biofuel as a motor fuel. The relief was confined to pilot projects approved by the Minister for Finance. Following an invitation to tender from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, relief was granted to eight pilot projects for a period of two years. The cost of the relief is estimated at &euro;3 million in each year, covering, over the two-year period, a total of 12 million litres of pure plant oil, 2 million litres of biodiesel and 2 million litres of bioethanol.</P>
        <P>I am making provision in this year&rsquo;s Finance Bill for a significantly expanded five year scheme of mineral oil tax relief to commence in 2006 and end in 2010. The scope of the relief will be extended to projects which are not of a &ldquo;pilot&rdquo; nature. Based on the biofuel market penetration targets of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, the measure is estimated to cost &euro;20 million in 2006, &euro;35 million in 2007 and &euro;50 million in each of the following three years. This relief scheme, when fully operational, is expected to support the use and production in Ireland of some 163 million litres of biofuels per year.</P>
        <P>I also announced in the budget that provision is being made in this year&rsquo;s Finance Bill for a VRT relief of 50% for flexible fuel vehicles. The scheme is intended to encourage the purchase of series production flexible fuel vehicles able to use bioethanol &mdash; a blend of a minimum of 85% ethanol and petrol. This scheme will operate for a two year period from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2007. The cost of the scheme is estimated at &euro;1 million in 2006.</P>
        <P>It is clear that it would not be possible for any scheme providing excise duty exemption for biofuels to make such exemption conditional upon the biofuel concerned being produced only in Ireland. This would be in contravention of Ireland&rsquo;s duty under EC competition law not to distort competition in the common market. <Col N="1969"/>Inclusion of any such condition in the new scheme would lead to refusal of our application for EU state aid approval for the exemption scheme. As for vegetable oil from non-EU countries, World Trade Organisation rules apply to its importation. The WTO principle of national treatment prohibits discrimination between national and foreign products but internationally agreed tariffs may apply to particular products.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding this, one of the aims of the new biofuels scheme is to create, in so far as is possible, the development of biomass or feedstock production in Ireland to support the development of a sustainable domestic biofuels industry and we must try to reflect this in the new scheme.</P>

        <Quest>when a decision will be made on the application from Sligo County Council submitted on 3 November 2004 for funding under the coastal protection programme 2003-06; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Responsibility for coast protection rests with the property owner, whether it be a local authority or a private individual. In November 2004, Sligo County Council submitted a proposal for funding for three coastal protection projects in the county. Its number one priority was for major repairs and reconstruction to Ardnaglass river outfall structure at Dunmoran Strand, at an estimated cost of &euro;450,000. There was no funding available under the coastal protection programme for this project in 2005.</P>
        <P>The question of providing funding for this project in 2006 will have to be considered in the context of the amount of Exchequer funding available for coast protection works and overall national priorities. I should point out that &euro;3 million is available for coast protection for the entire <Col N="1970"/>country in 2006. The allocation of this funding is under consideration at present.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>of the 191 members of the United Nations, the number which are not diplomatically accredited to Ireland; the countries which are; if there is a reason such accreditation does not exist in each instance; and if efforts are being made to secure such accreditation.</Quest>
        <QRef>[6074/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Of the 191 member states of the United Nations, 76 are currently not accredited to Ireland. The following tables outline the status of accreditation of each member state to Ireland and of Ireland to those member states not accredited here. The accreditation of diplomatic missions is a matter for each Government to consider and determine. While I cannot offer reasons as to why certain countries have not yet chosen to accredit to Ireland, clearly issues such as resources, perceived national interests and location would have a bearing on the matter. The question of accreditation is routinely discussed in our diplomatic contacts with other countries and the Government generally seeks to facilitate those states which express interest in accrediting to Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may wish to note that of the 76 member states not currently accredited to Ireland, Irish heads of mission are accredited to 13 of these states, while diplomatic relations with a further 25 are maintained, on a reciprocal basis, through the permanent missions to the United Nations in New York.</P>
        <P>I should finally wish to mention the specific case of Burma. Burma is not accredited to Ireland, although its authorities have sought accreditation. In light of the human rights situation in that country, the Government has decided not to accept the accreditation of an ambassador of Burma at this time, nor to accredit an Irish ambassador there. </P><Col N="1969"/>

In this regard the Deputy may be aware that, in <Col N="1978"/>2004, the Cliffs of Moher visitor centre project was awarded a grant of almost &euro;10 million under F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s ERDF co-financed tourism product development scheme. In the same year, my Department, pursuant to the provisions of section 106 of the Local Government Act 2001, and in consultation with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, authorised Clare County Council to borrow a sum not exceeding &euro;15 million for the sole purpose of developing this project at the Cliffs of Moher. It remains the responsibility of the promoters to ensure that the project is completed within the parameters specified by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, which includes financial viability.</P>

	<P>My Department is supporting and providing funding for this year&rsquo;s Beckett centenary festival, honouring Samuel Beckett on the centenary of his birth. Proposals were publicly invited from individuals or bodies planning events that might be incorporated into this one-off centenary programme. Funding may be allocated to assist qualifying applicants with their events but as the assessment process is currently in train I cannot provide names or figures at this time. The event locations are mainly around Dublin city and county but a number of initiatives have a wider geographical spread.</P>
        <P>An organisation called &ldquo;Shawfest 2006&rdquo; has contacted my Department seeking support in marking the 150th anniversary of the birth of George Bernard Shaw in July of this year but has not, as yet, sought any specific sum and is not tied to any location. Officials from my Department will meet with the organisers to assess this application.</P>
        <P>As a once-off, exceptional measure and in a cultural tourism context, I made an allocation of &euro;250,000 to the Anna Livia festival in 2005 from funds that became available from within my Department&rsquo;s provision. Future support for this event will be a matter for either the Arts Council or F&aacute;ilte Ireland.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels throughout the country is devolved to the Arts Council, a State body funded by my Department.

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>As a general rule, a redundancy situation exists where an employer requires fewer employees to do work of a particular kind or where a company goes into liquidation, receivership, decides to rationalise or reorganise or closes down. Other examples could include: partial closing down of a company; a decrease in an employer&rsquo;s requirements for workers with particular skills or qualifications; or an employer who requires fewer employees due to an economic recession.</P>
        <P>If a redundancy situation existed when the person concerned was absent on sick leave, he could apply to his employer for a statutory redundancy lump sum payment. It should be borne in mind that the employer decides in the first instance whether a redundancy situation exists in the employment and who should be made redundant. From the information available to me, it appears that the person concerned has been on sick leave since 2004. While his entitlement to holiday pay is in respect of hours actually worked, he would have been entitled to payment for any public holidays occurring during the first 26 weeks of ordinary illness.</P>

	<P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the Government decision to decentralise Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s headquarters to Shannon. Progressing the decentralisation decision is a matter for Enterprise Ireland. I am informed that, in respect of numbers, the most recent figures released show that 19 existing employees in Enterprise Ireland have indicated their willingness to transfer to Shannon. The number of applications received from within the civil and public service, including my Department, amount to 33, thus giving a total overall of 52 persons.</P>
        <P>The most immediate implementation step for Enterprise Ireland is to provide for a new headquarters building designed to meet the business needs of the organisation. Enterprise Ireland, working closely with the Office of Public Works, has identified but not yet acquired a site for the Shannon relocation. The preferred site consists of 13 acres owned by Shannon Development. In co-<Col N="1981"/>operation with Shannon Development and OPW, the site was valued and a feasibility study was carried out. The site occupies a prime position near the centre of Shannon and is considered suitable for a major landmark building or civic structure related to the town centre.</P>
        <P>It is too early to comment definitively on a timescale for the transfer of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s headquarters to Shannon. The factors of significance in this regard will be the acquisition of property and the level of interest in the Shannon location expressed by CAF applicants. My Department is corresponding with the Department of Finance regarding the acquisition of the preferred site.</P>

	<P>The wages and employment conditions of workers employed in the construction industry are governed and safeguarded by the Registered Employment Agreement (Construction Industry Wages and Conditions of Employment) Variation Order, which is enforced by the labour inspectorate. Labour inspectors are empowered to seek compliance with payment of the statutory minimum rates of pay specified in the agreement. However, if it is the case that certain workers are paid less than other workers for comparable work and there are no other relevant differentiating features it may be appropriate to refer the matter to the Equality Authority for consideration under equality legislation.</P>
        <P>The enforcement of the provisions of a registered employment agreement may also be effected under the Industrial Relations Acts. A trade union, an association of employees or an individual employee may complain to the Labour Court that a particular employer is not complying with a registered employment agreement. If, after investigating a complaint, the court is satisfied that the employer is in breach of a registered employment agreement, it may order direct compliance with the agreement. Failure to comply with such an order is an offence punishable by a fine. If the Deputy is aware of any breaches of the registered employment agreement, he should contact the Labour Court or the labour inspectorate of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>

	<P>As I have indicated in response to previous questions, following detailed consultations with the board of Shannon <Col N="1991"/>Development, other stakeholders and regional interests on 28 July, I announced my decision on a future mandate for the company. Under the terms of the new mandate, Shannon Development is being given a more focused regional economic remit that will complement the roles of the national agencies, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, in attracting foreign direct investment and developing the indigenous enterprise base in the region. The company will also continue to be responsible for providing appropriate property solutions for both indigenous and overseas enterprises throughout the Shannon region and for the management and development of the Shannon Free Zone industrial estate.</P>
        <P>Discussions are underway between the agencies to give effect to the new mandate. Talks are also ongoing between Shannon Development trade unions and officials from my Department to clarify the terms of my decision. The company has not yet lodged its corporate plan with my Department but I expect to receive this in the near future.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 150, 151, 160 and 161 together.</P><Col N="1992"/>
        <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes rent supplement, is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive. The purpose of the scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. Neither I nor my Department has any function with regard to decisions on individual claims.</P>
        <P>Under the rules of the scheme, rent supplements are calculated to ensure that an eligible person has an income after the payment of rent equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum contribution of &euro;13 which each recipient is required to pay from his or her own resources. Where a person has an additional income as a result of participation on a F&Aacute;S training course, such as the moving on programme, the means test provides for a weekly disregard of up to &euro;60 per week and for half of any additional income between &euro;60 and &euro;90 to be disregarded for means assessment purposes. This type of additional income disregard was first introduced in budget 2000 and has been increased over the years to its current level.</P>
        <P>Lone parents who participate in the moving on programme are not penalised for doing so. For example, a lone parent with one child living in Carlow with rent of &euro;150 per week, whose sole income is a one parent family payment of &euro;185.10 per week, would ordinarily receive rent supplement of &euro;134.50 per week, resulting in a net income after paying rent of &euro;169.60 per week. If she takes up a place in the moving on programme, her total income before rent supplement and before paying rent would rise to &euro;280.10 per week. In these circumstances, she would be entitled to &euro;114.50 in rent supplement and her income after paying rent would be &euro;244.60 per week. She would be &euro;75 better off for having participated in the programme.</P>
        <P>Improvements in the training allowance disregards combined with the increases in social welfare payments ensure that lone parents continue to benefit from budgetary increases in training allowance rates. For example, in 2005 a lone parent with one child living in Carlow with rent of &euro;150 per week and participating on the moving on programme would have been entitled to a rent supplement of &euro;111.50 per week and her income after paying rent would have been &euro;212.60 per week. Following budget 2006, she is now &euro;32 per week better off arising from the combined social welfare and training allowance increases, including a &euro;3 per week increase in the amount of rent supplement payable. Overall I consider that the current rent supplement additional income disregards ensure that people have a financial incen<Col N="1993"/>tive to take up training opportunities but I will continue to keep the issue under review.</P>

        <Quest>about the letters a person (details supplied) in County Mayo submitted on a claim for unemployment benefit as proof of their attempts to get work; the number of letters submitted; the areas in which employment was sought; the way in which his Department stated that the person did not seek work; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>To qualify for an unemployment payment, a person must be available for and genuinely seeking employment. An unemployed person is required to provide information regarding his or her availability and efforts in securing full-time employment. On request, a recipient must demonstrate that he or she is making all reasonable efforts to find work and is not being unduly restrictive in terms of the nature or location of work for which he or she is available. The onus is on the recipient to demonstrate to the satisfaction of a deciding officer that he or she satisfies all the conditions for receipt of a payment.</P>
        <P>Having reviewed all the circumstances of the case, including all the evidence provided by the person concerned with regard to employment seeking efforts, a deciding officer disallowed the unemployment assistance claim from 4 January 2006, on the grounds that the person is not genuinely seeking work. The person concerned failed to provide sufficient evidence to show that he had been consistently seeking full-time work.</P>
        <P>It is open to the person concerned to appeal this decision and a form for this purpose has been issued to him. Under social welfare legislation, decisions on claims and the insurability of employment must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

	<P>It is generally accepted that for all people in working age households, the main route out of poverty is through employment. In the case of lone parents, the income disregards put in place in 1997 allowed for income up to &euro;146.50 to be disregarded as means, with lone parents with <Col N="1994"/>income between &euro;146.50 and &euro;293 per week still being eligible for a reduced rate of OFP.</P>
        <P>I believe that every support should be given to lone parents to give them an opportunity to continue to increase their earnings in their efforts to improve their own lives and those of their children. That is why I was pleased to significantly increase the upper income limit for the one parent family payment by &euro;82 per week to &euro;375 per week in the recent budget. This measure comes into effect in July. Lone parents working at least 19 hours per week are also eligible to claim family income supplement. The budget also increased the income limit for families with one child to &euro;465 per week, with effect from 5 January 2006.</P>
        <P>As a result of taxation measures introduced in the last budget, lone parents will not now become eligible for tax until they earn in excess of &euro;23,000 per annum. These policies will have an immediate positive effect on lone parents already in the work force and those who are considering employment as an option. Furthermore, I can confirm that my Department has conducted a review of the income support arrangements for lone parents which has fed into a wider review by the senior officials group on social inclusion into the obstacles to employment faced by lone parents and parents on low income.</P>
        <P>This report, including a number of detailed proposals, is to be published in full shortly with a view to initiating a debate on the main issues. It is my hope that this process will lead to an informed consensus that will inform policy and lead to the development of proposals which will better support all lone parents.</P>

        <Quest> further to Question No. 129 of 9 February 2006, the conditions under which recipients of the one parent family payment are entitled to retain certain social welfare payments and other secondary benefits in total or in part while they are participating in community employment schemes; the payments and benefits which can be retained; the community employment schemes to which this rule applies; if this rule also applies to community education initiatives; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>Financial support paid to lone parents is made through my Department&rsquo;s one parent family payment, which was established in 1997 to provide income for lone parents, while allowing substantial income disregards for those lone parents in a position to return to employment. The income disregards currently allow for income up to &euro;146.50 to be disregarded as means, with lone parents having income between &euro;146.50 and &euro;293 per week still being eligible for a reduced rate of OFP.</P><Col N="1995"/>
        <P>I was pleased to significantly increase the upper income limit for the one parent family payment by &euro;82 per week to &euro;375 per week in the context of the recent budget. This measure comes into effect in July. These income disregards also apply to OFP recipients on a community employment scheme.</P>
        <P>Recipients of the OFP are also allowed retain the secondary benefits &mdash; rent or mortgage interest supplement, fuel and smokeless fuel allowance, Christmas bonus and back to school clothing and footwear allowance &mdash; on the following education and training programmes: community employment, job initiative, workplace, revenue job assist, back to work schemes, social economy programme, F&Aacute;S training, back to education allowance and the vocational training opportunities scheme.</P>
        <P>For most people the most significant secondary benefit is rent or mortgage interest supplement, which is paid under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. An income limit of &euro;317.43 per week applies to the retention of these supplements. However, back to work allowance and family income supplement, in cases where one or both of these are in payment, are disregarded in the assessment of the &euro;317.43 weekly income limit.</P>
        <P>In addition, PRSI, reasonable travelling expenses and a child care allowance payable to certain people participating in approved training courses are also disregarded in the means test. Furthermore, people taking up employment through approved employment schemes or who take up full-time employment after being unemployed for a period of 12 months may retain an element of their rent or mortgage interest supplement on the following tapering basis over four years: 75% in year one; 50% in year two; and 25% in years three and four.</P>
        <P>An OFP recipient availing of an employment support scheme may opt to be assessed for rent or mortgage supplement under either standard supplementary welfare allowance rules or under the special retention rules and will be entitled to receive payment under whichever is the more favourable option. A person on a community employment scheme or other back to work scheme whose household income is above the &euro;317.43 weekly limit for retention of secondary benefits may still qualify for rent supplement under the standard rules. For example, an OFP recipient with one child on a community employment scheme is allowed to disregard &euro;60 per week and half of any additional income between &euro;60 and &euro;90 per week in the calculation of the rent supplement; therefore the net income will increase by that amount, &euro;75 where weekly CE earnings are more than &euro;90, on taking up a place on the scheme.</P>
        <P>In addition, a special projects fund, administered by my Department&rsquo;s locally based facilita<Col N="1996"/>tors, provides enhanced support to people who need additional help to progress to further training and employment. The facilitators also operate small scale family services projects in certain areas, which are designed to focus supports towards specific target groups with complex needs, including recipients of OFP, who avail of training programmes under this special projects fund and are entitled to retain their social welfare payment and rent supplement, if applicable, while attending the training course.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, I intend to make public shortly the findings of reports analysing the obstacles to employment faced by lone parents and reviewing the income support arrangements for lone parents. I then intend to engage in a consultation process with interested parties with a view to developing proposals designed to better support and encourage lone parents in achieving a better standard of living, improved employment and education opportunities, a better future for themselves and their children, and a more appropriate social policy in the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 157 to 159, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The couple involved is in receipt of two separate payments from my Department. The husband is in receipt of a full-rate invalidity pension of &euro;193.30 per week while the wife is in receipt of an old age non-contributory pension, which is payable at a reduced rate of &euro;157 per week. For the purposes of determining entitlement to the old age pension, half of the couple&rsquo;s joint means are assessed as the means of the wife, including, <Col N="1998"/>in this case, half of the husband&rsquo;s occupational pension.</P>
        <P>The recent budget made provision for a number of important measures designed to target resources at older people, including pensioners in receipt of a reduced rate of payment. These included an increase of &euro;16 per week, or 9.6%, for all non-contributory pensioners, including those in receipt of reduced rates of old age pension, and an increase of &euro;14 per week or 7.8%, for all contributory pensioners, including those on invalidity pension and those aged 66 or over. These increases are effective from January last.</P>
        <P>I was also pleased to announce that I propose to establish a standardised State non-contributory pension, replacing the old age pension and, for recipients aged 66 and over, blind pension, widow&rsquo;s and widower&rsquo;s pension, one parent family payment, deserted wife&rsquo;s allowance and prisoner&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P>All the schemes in question feature a common means disregard of &euro;7.60 per week, which dates back to the 1970s. The means disregard for the new non-contributory pension will be &euro;20 per week, an increase of &euro;12.40 per week. Over 30,000 pensioners who are currently in receipt of a reduced rate of payment will gain from this change.</P>
        <P>In the case in question, the new enhanced arrangements will mean that the spouse in receipt of the reduced rate of old age pension will, assuming her means remain unchanged, receive a further increase of &euro;12.50 per week from the end of September next. The increase in the general means disregard, from &euro;7.60 to &euro;20 per week, specifically benefits those older persons who are in receipt of reduced rate non-contributory pensions because one or both of a couple have income from occupational pensions, foreign social security pensions, capital or from some other source.</P>
        <P>In addition, I also propose to introduce a specific additional disregard of &euro;100 per week where the pensioner is in employment. This new disregard relating to earnings from employment is intended as an initial incentive to facilitate non-contributory pensioners who wish to continue working or to re-enter the workforce.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, consequent on the increase in the means disregard to &euro;20 per week, a single person, with no other means, will be able to have up to &euro;35,000 in capital and still qualify for a pension at the maximum rate. This figure is doubled in the case of a pensioner couple.</P>
        <P>To qualify for a fuel allowance, a person must, <i>inter alia</i>, be in receipt of one of the qualifying payments, living alone or with a person in receipt of a qualifying payment who would be entitled to an allowance in his or her own right and be unable along with other members of the household to provide for their heating needs in their own right.</P><Col N="1999"/>
        <P>In the latter regard, a person must satisfy a means test. Where an applicant and members of his or her household have a combined assessable income of up to &euro;51 per week above the appropriate rate of old age contributory pension for the couple, fuel allowance is payable. Where the couple are both aged over 66 and under 80 years of age, this income limit is &euro;393.60 per week or equivalent to &euro;20,467 per annum.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The invalidity pensioner did not qualify for a fuel allowance for the 2005-06 fuel season as the couple&rsquo;s overall income, comprising the invalidity pension, the old age pension and the occupational pension, was above the income limit for fuel allowance. Assuming the couple&rsquo;s income remains unchanged, the old age pensioner is also not entitled to a fuel allowance as she is not living with a person who is entitled to such an allowance in his own right.</P>
        <P>Any changes to the current arrangements for fuel allowance would be considered in a budgetary context. However, I am satisfied that the improvements for pensioners introduced in the recent budget levels are exceptional. The proposed modernisation of the current arrangements, including the enhanced provisions for persons in receipt of reduced rates of old age pension, is also a further demonstration of our commitment to all those who are elderly.</P>

	<P>Under the Road Traffic Act 1961 and the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations 1999 to 2004, it is a matter for the appropriate licensing authority to determine the eligibility of a person for a driving licence and to issue licences. Where a person is disqualified from driving following conviction for an offence under section 49 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, section 26 of that Act, as amended by section 29 of the Road Traffic Act 1994, provides that such a person is disqualified for holding any provisional or driving licence whatsoever during the period of disqualification.</P>
        <P>Article 29(7) of the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations, 1999 requires that a person hold a provisional driving licence in the category of vehicle in which the driving test is to be carried <Col N="2000"/>out. A valid driving test cannot be conducted until a provisional licence has been obtained after the period of disqualification. Application for a provisional driving licence may only be made on expiry of the period of disqualification.</P>

	<P Just="Left">As the Deputy is aware, responsibility for Dublin Port Company transferred from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to my Department on 1 January 2006. Dublin Port Company&rsquo;s involvement in the national conference centre competition was first mentioned in July 2004 in the chairman&rsquo;s interim report for the six months to end June 2004 to the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. The report briefly outlined that the company was party to one of the bids in the national conference centre competition. No request for ministerial consent or approval was initiated at that time.</P>
        <P>On 18 May 2005, Dublin Port Company wrote to the then responsible Minister, Deputy Gallagher, seeking ministerial approval to enter into an arrangement with the Anna Livia consortium, as detailed in draft heads of terms enclosed with the letter. The proposed arrangement was that in the event that the consortium was successful in the national conference centre competition, and subject to the Minister&rsquo;s consent, Dublin Port Company would make a site available to facilitate the consortium&rsquo;s proposal for a national conference centre.</P>
        <P>The company&rsquo;s request for ministerial approval was referred for advice to the Attorney General&rsquo;s office. The reply of 12 October 2005 from the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and my reply of 1 February 2006 to related parliamentary questions set out the dates on which the advice of the Attorney General was received.</P>
        <P>Following approval by the Government, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, announced on 16 November 2005 that Spencer Dock international conference centre consortium was being invited to become the provisional preferred tenderer for the provision of a national conference centre in Dublin. I understand negotiations are still underway with that consortium.</P>
        <P>In light of this announcement, the ministerial approval requested by Dublin Port Company on 18 May 2005 is not required at this time. However, in light of the latest advice from the Attorney General of 6 January 2006, as referred to in my reply of 1 February 2006, a response to the company&rsquo;s letter of 18 May 2005 is currently being considered.</P>

	<P>Under the State Airports Act 2004, before any assets can transfer to either the Shannon or Cork Airport Authorities, the Ministers for Transport and Finance will have to be satisfied as to the financial and operational readiness of the airport authorities. Accordingly, each airport authority is required to prepare a comprehensive business plan and obtain the Ministers&rsquo; approval for these plans before any assets can be transferred.</P>
        <P>Under the provisions of the Companies Acts the only way that the assets could be vested in the Cork and Shannon Airport Authorities is for the Dublin Airport Authority to make a distribution from its distributable reserves of a sum equivalent to the value of the assets. However, DAA currently does not have enough distributable assets to dividend out the assets of both Shannon and Cork Airports at the same time.</P>
        <P>The level of debt associated with the assets of Shannon and Cork Airports and the level of distributable reserves required to transfer those assets to the two authorities will emerge from the <Col N="2004"/>work currently underway on the development of business plans by the three airport authorities. The outcome of the business planning process will provide a basis for determining the most feasible options for carrying through the restructuring. The ability of the airport authorities to operate on a fully commercial basis will be fully assessed as part of this process and will be factored into the decisions made.</P>

	<P>All vehicles using public roads are required by law to comply with a range of standards in respect of their construction, equipment, use, weights and dimensions. The requirements are set out in the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 2002 and the Road Traffic (Construction and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 2003 to 2004. These regulations apply in the interests of public safety and to protect road infrastructure.</P>
        <P>The prescribed maximum axle and vehicle weight limits are not vehicle-specific but apply to vehicles generally. I have no plans to increase the current weight limits at this point in time. Regulation 59 of the Road Traffic (Construction and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 2003 provides for the issuing of special permits by local authorities for the use of vehicles on roads notwithstanding that they contravene certain provisions of the aforementioned regulations. A special permit may be issued for a maximum period of 12 months.</P>
        <P>Local authorities are best placed to assess the suitability of the roads in their functional areas for use by non-compliant vehicles, the appropriate routes and itineraries to be used in the making of journeys by such vehicles and to determine the appropriate duration of individual special permits.</P>

The study, which is being conducted on behalf of my Department by Acadamh na hOllscola&iacute;ochta Gaeilge, University of Ireland, Galway, in conjunction with the National Institute for Regional and Spatial Analysis, University of Ireland, Maynooth, is examining Irish language usage in the Gaeltacht as a basis for strengthening the linguistic development of the Gaeltacht as an Irish-speaking area and a review of the official Gaeltacht boundaries.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The huge task of implementing the single farm payment scheme was successfully achieved when over &euro;1 billion in single payments issued to 118,500 farmers last December, meeting the target we had set ourselves of making the payments on the first possible date. This was a major undertaking and the outcome, after painstaking preparatory work in establishing individual entitlements, was, by any standards, a major achievement.</P>
        <P>Under the 2005 single payment scheme, 143,000 applications were received. In addition to those applicants seeking to both activate their entitlements and also receive payment, applications were also received from farmers seeking only to activate their entitlements. It will be recalled that farmers who did not seek to activate their entitlements in 2005 would, under the EU rules, forfeit these entitlements to the national reserve.</P>
        <P>At the present time, total payments amount to &euro;1,126 million with 97% of farmers, who hold entitlements and applied for the single payment scheme, paid. In common with the coupled schemes, which the single payment scheme replaced, delays in processing can be caused by many factors, including incomplete application forms, errors on applications and discrepancies highlighted following computer validation, which must be resolved via correspondence with the applicant. In many cases, payment could not be made because applicants did not submit an application to transfer the single payment entitlements, with lands, by way of inheritance, gift, lease or purchase. Many of these applications were only received after the Department made direct contact with the farmers in question, during recent weeks, and some have yet to be submitted.</P>
        <P>The ongoing objective of the Department is to make payments to all of those farmers who have yet to receive their payment or are entitled to a supplementary payment as soon as their cases are cleared for payment. Every effort is being made by the Department to resolve the outstanding cases but many of these are extremely complex and, in other cases, the Department is still awaiting documentation and applications for the <Col N="2008"/>transfer of entitlements before payment can be made. A number of payment runs continue to be made weekly as the more complicated files are cleared.</P>

	<P>I am supportive of initiatives to promote food on all-island basis where this is of mutual benefit and leads to closer economic co-operation. Bord Bia, as part of its statutory role in promoting the development of Ireland&rsquo;s food and drink industry, works in close co-operation with its counterpart in Northern Ireland, Invest Northern Ireland. Joint promotions and events have been successfully organised, especially in the speciality food sector. Bord Bia is currently negotiating a formal inter-agency agreement to provide for structured ongoing co-operation in food promotion at international trade fairs, retail promotions on the British market, co-operation on developing the speciality sector on an all-island basis and market research and intelligence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The development of an all-island animal health policy is, however, a necessary prerequisite to the establishment of an all-island food label. The development of the animal health policy is being actively pursued in the context of North-South co-operation. In addition, an all-island food label would require negotiation between the relevant authorities regarding its status and conditions for use and general acceptance from consumers and buy-in by producers and processors island-wide.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The Minister has recently made regulations giving legal effect to Ireland&rsquo;s national action programme under the directive.</P>
        <P>There has been much comment and speculation in recent days and weeks about the effect of the nitrates regulations on farming. I am aware that the implementation of the regulations will be challenging for some farmers and I am also aware that there is a serious information deficit on some aspects of the matter. Clearly this is not in the interests of farmers themselves and I am anxious <Col N="2009"/>to bring clarity to the situation as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>As a first step, the Department has placed advertisements in the farming press explaining the main provisions of the regulations in clear and straightforward terms. A handbook is being finalised and will be sent to every farmer as soon as possible. Officials of the Department have already had discussions with Teagasc about arrangements for the delivery of information which will further help farmers to understand the practical aspects of the new regulations.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to giving the farming community all the practical help that it can. Following from commitments made in the Sustaining Progress agreement, which related explicitly to the nitrates directive, payment rates in REPS increased by 28% on average in 2004. The number of farmers in REPS reached record levels last year. The Department&rsquo;s Estimates for 2006 includes a provision of &euro;323 million for REPS, the highest ever.</P>
        <P>It also introduced improvements to the farm waste management scheme and the dairy hygiene scheme in 2004, and I have tabled proposals to the Commission for further major improvements to the farm waste management scheme which will provide a far more attractive package to farmers than that which was previously available. Only last week in Brussels, I met Commissioner Fischer Boel and impressed on her the need for early Commission approval of the scheme as submitted. I have secured an Estimates provision of &euro;43 million in 2006 for the revised scheme.</P>
        <P>Most of the controversy in recent days has centred on the nutrient management provisions of the regulations. These were finalised following difficult negotiations with the Commission&rsquo;s scientific experts, with both Departments making use of the advice provided by Teagasc. It was the Commission, however, that determined the final content of the regulations. Teagasc has recently indicated that it may be possible to review part of the advice it had given on the application of phosphorus, in a way that could improve the effectiveness of the regulations. The Government and the European Commission saw merit in allowing Teagasc time to elaborate this new advice and, accordingly, the Minister, Deputy Roche, announced a brief <i>de facto</i> deferral of the implementation of Part 3 of the regulations.</P>
        <P>Teagasc has been requested to provide, as a matter of urgency, the necessary scientific case to support any revision of the phosphorus tables in the regulations. The two Departments will carefully consider any submission received from Teagasc while also bearing in mind that any proposals for revision of the phosphorus tables will have to respect the environmental requirements associated with the nitrates directive and meet with the agreement of the European Commission.</P>
        <P>Teagasc has not been specifically requested to review its advice on nitrogen issues. However, to <Col N="2010"/>the extent that its revised submission on crop nutrient requirements suggests any further beneficial adjustments to the regulatory regime, these will of course be considered. The possibility of such further adjustments will also depend on its respecting the environmental requirements involved and on its acceptance by the European Commission.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A central issue arising from the nitrates directive is the need to secure a derogation which will allow certain farmers to operate, under appropriate conditions and controls, up to a level of 250 kg of organic nitrogen per hectare. The proposal was given an initial presentation to the EU nitrates committee in December, and further scientific data have been supplied to the Commission following bilateral discussions.</P>
        <P>The proposal will need to be discussed again at future meetings of the nitrates committee before approval can be obtained. Securing this derogation is vital for the most productive dairy farmers in particular, and it is important that the position on the regulations is clarified at an early date so that the negotiations on the derogation can proceed.</P>

	<P Just="Left">As indicated in the following table, since 1 January 2006, myself and the Ministers of State in the Department, along with Department officials, have met representatives of the farming organisations on issues of particular relevance to them, including the nitrates directive.</P>
        <P>In the weeks leading up to the signing of the nitrates regulations by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on 11 December, there had been a number of meetings with representatives of the major farming organisations. These meetings were part of the consultation process on the regulations, launched by the Minister, Deputy Roche, on 7 October 2005. This was itself the culmination of a lengthy and broader consultation process on the implementation of the nitrates directive.</P>
        <P>I very much regret the decision of some of the farmers&rsquo; organisations to suspend their involvement in the partnership talks. They retain the option of re-joining the discussions, and I would urge them to do so, but this is a matter that they must decide.</P><Col N="2011"/>
        <P>The Government believes that the farming pillar has a significant and useful part to play in the partnership process. The Government&rsquo;s objective is to continue to use this process as a proven and effective mechanism for the achievement of economic progress. In addition, it is desirable that the importance of the agri-food sector is reflected in national agreements as it has been for the last 19 years through six partnership agreements. The Department will therefore remain fully involved in the talks with the remaining farmer organisation and will stand ready to engage with others should they choose to rejoin the process.</P><Col N="2012"/>
        <P>To this end, a significant amount of preparatory work has been undertaken by the Department in advance of these discussions. All the farm organisations have made positive contributions at the initial plenary and bilateral sessions of the partnership talks on 2 and 8 February respectively, where they raised the implementation of the nitrates directive among other issues. The IFA and the ICMSA have also submitted comprehensive papers setting out in detail their views on what is required for a successful national agreement and the Department is currently examining these documents.</P><Col N="2011"/>

	<P>The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The Minister has recently made regulations giving legal effect to Ireland&rsquo;s national action programme under the directive. It is now important for farmers to be given as much accurate information as possible about where they stand legally and about the practical implications of the regulations.</P>
        <P>A good deal of recent comment and speculation has been selective and indeed misleading, and has only led to greater confusion among farmers. As a first step towards clearing up that confusion, the Department has placed advertisements in the farming press explaining the main provisions of the regulations in clear and straightforward terms. A handbook is being finalised and will be sent to every farmer as soon as possible. Officials of the Department have already had discussions with Teagasc about arrangements for the delivery of information, which will further help farmers to understand the practical aspects of the new regulations.</P><Col N="2012"/>
        <P Just="Left">The position of farmers on the nitrates regulations is that the regulations came into law on 1 February. The organic nitrogen limit of 170 kg organic nitrogen per hectare per year applies from that date, although the Department is in negotiations with the Commission on derogation arrangements for more intensive farmers. The rules about record keeping, about soil and weather conditions for spreading fertiliser and manure, and the rules about buffer zones, also came into force from 1 February 2006.</P>
        <P>Prohibited application periods for the spreading of organic and chemical fertilisers come into force on 15 September 2006 for chemical fertiliser and 15 October for organic fertiliser. The manure storage requirements also came into force on 1 February, though in practice farmers have up to 31 December 2008 to comply fully with these. The only exception relates to holdings with more than 100 pigs, which must have 26 weeks&rsquo; storage in place on 31 December 2006.</P>
        <P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has, however, announced a brief <i>de facto</i> deferral of the implementation of Part 3 of the regulations, which deals with nutrient management. These provisions were finalised following difficult negotiations with the Commission&rsquo;s scientific experts, with both Departments making use of the advice provided by Teagasc, although it was the Commission that determined the final content of the regulations.</P>
        <P>Teagasc has recently indicated that it may be possible to review part of the advice it had given <Col N="2013"/>on the application of phosphorus in a way that could improve the effectiveness of the regulations. The Government and the European Commission saw merit in allowing Teagasc time to elaborate this new advice and it is for this reason that the implementation of this part of the regulations has been briefly deferred.</P>
        <P>Teagasc has been requested to provide, as a matter of urgency, the necessary scientific case to support any revision of the phosphorus tables in the regulations. The two Departments will carefully consider any submission received from Teagasc while also bearing in mind that any proposals for revision of the phosphorus tables will have to respect the environmental requirements associated with the nitrates directive and meet with the agreement of the European Commission.</P>
        <P>Teagasc has not been specifically requested to review its advice on nitrogen issues. However, to the extent that its revised submission on crop nutrient requirements suggest any further beneficial adjustments to the regulatory regime, these will of course be considered. The possibility of such further adjustments will also depend on their respecting the environmental requirements involved and on their acceptance by the European Commission.</P>

	<P>With annual farm-gate production valued currently at &euro;270 million and retail sales in the order of &euro;650 million, the sector employs some 10,000 people across the production and distribution chain. The key issue that has impacted on the development of the horticulture industry as a whole in recent years is the increased concentration at retail level with the consequent significant change in the supply chain.</P>
        <P>My Department, recognising the marketing advantages and challenges of consolidation and scale, has contributed to the development of the industry, particularly through its grant aid schemes under the national development plan. These schemes have been a catalyst for investment and growth and have assisted producers to upgrade or develop new production facilities and have also enabled commercial enterprises to improve marketing and processing facilities.</P>
        <P>The scheme to assist capital investment on farms under the national development plan aims to promote the specialisation and diversification of on-farm activities, improve the quality of products and facilitate environmentally friendly practices and improved working conditions on farms. Since 2001 nearly &euro;13 million in grant aid has been paid to horticultural producers throughout the country to support investments to the value of &euro;38 million. In 2006 a further &euro;5.5 million grant <Col N="2014"/>package will fund projects to the investment value of &euro;16 million. My Department has received 174 applications which are being examined. It is planned to issue approvals to successful applicants by the end of March. All areas of horticulture are eligible for the scheme.</P>
        <P>Demand in the consumer and food service sectors is buoyant, both for fresh and prepared chilled produce and convenient value added products. The retail value of prepared horticultural produce was estimated to be &euro;59.8 million in 2004, representing a twofold increase on 2001 and there are real investment opportunities and challenges for development of this sector.</P>
        <P>Under my Department&rsquo;s capital investment scheme for the marketing and processing of agricultural products, a total of &euro;4.41 million has been awarded under the NDP to date in respect of 19 projects in the fruit and vegetable sector. Further awards will be made in the near future in respect of the call for proposals which issued in autumn 2005. In addition, horticulture producers benefit from EU aid under the producer organisation scheme. A sum of &euro;5.6 million was paid to ten recognised producer organisations in 2005. The development of producer organisations under EU regulations has made an important contribution to the development of the sector as it enables producers to benefit from their combined strength in the production and marketing of their product.</P>

	<P>In August 2005, I announced a grant aid programme for the development of the seed potato sector. The programme, which comes under the national development plan, funds capital investment projects for specialised seed production in 2005-06. A grant rate of 35% applies under the scheme. The main objective of the scheme is to improve the marketing infrastructure of the seed potato sector by providing grant assistance to producers towards the capital costs of equipment and facilities for the production, storage and marketing of seed potatoes. My main aim is to develop a competitive seed sector with strong linkages with ware growers to ensure that the &euro;100 million potato industry continues to grow to its full potential.</P>
        <P>To date 18 applications have been received and 14 approvals for investment under this scheme have been issued, amounting to &euro;767,000. A total of &euro;1 million has been provided for this scheme in the current year.</P>

	<P Just="Left">FIRM, the food institutional research measure, is a public good food research programme funded under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. Calls for proposals have issued periodically since 2000 and a total of &euro;63 million in funding has been awarded for 137 projects, including &euro;6.7 million, which was recently approved for 14 projects under the food safety and beverages themes.</P>
        <P>I am convinced that high quality food research, which creates new knowledge and capacity, is of significant importance to the continued development of the agri-food sector. This week my Department issued a call through the national press inviting a new round of research proposals from institutions under the five themes of food and health, food quality and manufacturing, food safety and security of the food chain, food, the consumer and the food supply chain and new uses for food and drink by-products. The themes have been selected to highlight strategic areas of opportunity for the food sector as well as consumer and food safety needs.</P>
        <P>The areas covered by these themes are the following: food and health includes functional foods, product reformulation for enhanced health, nutrigenomics and food surveillance; food quality and manufacturing refers to new innovative products, novel technologies for food processing and process control, food ingredients, as well as food composition, structure and sensorial properties, food waste management and new or innovative food products, including new uses for dairy fats. Proposals may incorporate meat, beverages, dairy products, prepared consumer foods, food safety and security of the food chain.</P>
        <P>This theme aims to build on research in the areas of microbiological and epidemiological research on food pathogens, chemical residues and contaminants in food products, novel processes and ingredients for control of pathogens in food and improved detection methods for food pathogens. Proposals are also invited on risk analysis, risk communication and risk management; food, the consumer and the food supply chain includes consumer studies to support the development of the food sector and studies aimed at food supply chain efficiency and traceability; and new uses for food and drink by-products. This is left open to encourage new ideas.</P>
        <P>The call is addressed to institutions that can demonstrate the necessary research capabilities, including universities, institutes of technology and Teagasc food centres. Proposals involving collaboration between research institutions are encouraged. Research work already funded <Col N="2016"/>under FIRM has led to the creation of a number of highly qualified research teams and the formation of recognised centres of excellence. The capability and critical mass that has been developed, together with the associated knowledge base, represents a major resource for industry and well as being instrumental in the development of a number of food products benefiting consumers.</P>
        <P>My Department has arranged five briefing sessions for researchers this week &mdash; two each in Dublin and Cork and one in Galway &mdash; to assist them in formulating their project proposals. The closing date for receipt of proposals is Friday, 31 March 2006. The proposals will be evaluated by external independent expert panels and then considered by the food institutional research committee, which comprises representatives of the private and public sectors.</P>

	<P>Trade in sheep between member states of the European Union is subject to the provisions of Council Directive 91/68/EEC, as amended, which provide reinforced controls on the movement of sheep and goats. Until recently, these controls provided, as a minimum requirement, that breeding and fattening sheep had to be certified by an official veterinarian as having been continuously resident on a holding for at least 30 days prior to export and that no sheep or goats had been introduced on to the holding in the 21 days prior to export. Slaughter sheep had also to be certified as having been continuously resident on the holding of origin for at least 21 days prior to export and were also subject to a &ldquo;standstill&rdquo; period of 21 days prior to dispatch during which no sheep or goats have been introduced on to the holding of origin.</P><Col N="2017"/>
        <P>These controls were introduced in the aftermath of the foot and mouth outbreak in 2001 and came into effect on 1 July 2004. Having been aware of the difficulties that these certification requirements caused, I instructed my Department to raise the matter with the European Commission in an effort to arrive at a certification procedure that best meets the concerns of farmers and exporters, while at the same time protecting animal health. I am pleased that, in response to our approach, the European Commission submitted proposals to amend these certification requirements to allow the official veterinarian to issue certification based on a written declaration by the farmer or on an examination of the flock register and movement documents.</P>
        <P>The proposals providing for these new arrangements were agreed to unanimously by the standing committee on the food chain and animal health on 11 November 2005 and came into force on 15 February 2006. I am confident that they will resolve most of the outstanding difficulties relating to residency-standstill certification for exports of sheep to France and the United Kingdom.</P>
        <P>While I am happy to facilitate live sheep exports in any way I can, securing outlets and the supply and availability of transport for the carriage of livestock is a commercial matter which is not within the remit of my Department.</P>

	<P>Under the 2005 research stimulus fund programme, 12 research projects were recently awarded grant assistance totalling &euro;4.5 million. The research projects cover a broad range of areas, including agri-environment, non-food crops and agri-food economics and will involve inter-institutional collaboration. Three of the projects selected for funding relate to research projects involving biofuels and energy crops and received total grant assistance of some &euro;900,000.</P>
        <P>This is an area of particular interest due to the environmental advantages of biofuels, increasing cost of fossil fuels and the opportunity farmers now have to explore alternative farm enterprises. Six of the projects selected for funding relate to the agri-environment area and were awarded total grant assistance of more than &euro;3 million. The research involved will be of a public good nature and the results will be made freely available.</P>
        <P>The projects now being funded should produce benefits not only for producers but for the wider rural community. They will also contribute to <Col N="2018"/>improved collaboration between various research institutions and to the establishment of critical mass in certain research areas.</P>

	<P>The prospects for forestry planting in 2006 are positive. This is the final year for planting under the current rural development programme and farmers can avail of a 20 year premium by planting under the current forestry grant and premium scheme. The scheme provides a 100% planting grant.</P>
        <P>I have provided for a budget of &euro;137 million towards the cost of forestry supports in 2006, the highest ever allocation for forestry. With the possibility of more land becoming available for afforestation under the single farm payment scheme, which enables farm-foresters to plant up to 50% of their eligible claimed areas with forestry, while still being in receipt of their full single farm payment, excellent opportunities exist for any potential farm-forester to earn additional income from forestry.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The incidence of brucellosis has been falling progressively in recent years. For example, the number of laboratory positives has fallen from 6,417 in 1998 to 228 in 2005. The total number of animals slaughtered under the eradication programme fell from 29,778 to 2,375 during the same period. There has been a further improvement in the position in 2005 compared with 2003 and 2004. The number of blood positives in 2005 was 228 compared with 664 in 2004 and 900 in 2003. The number of animals slaughtered fell from 14,841 and 6,195, respectively, in 2003 and 2004 to 2,375 in 2005.</P>
        <P>The substantial improvement in the disease situation is due to a number of factors, including continued co-operation from all parties with the eradication regime, the tightening up on illegal cattle movements through the cattle movement monitoring system, the regulation of dealers, prosecutions for breaches and the imposition of penalties for failures to comply with animal disease and identification regulations. I am confi<Col N="2020"/>dent this progress can be maintained into the future with the continued operation of the existing measures and the ongoing co-operation of farmers and all involved in the livestock industry.</P>
        <P>It is, however, vital that we continue to recognise that brucellosis is a highly contagious disease and we do not relax or relent in our efforts to eradicate it from our national herd. In view of this, we need to continue in the medium term with the existing comprehensive control and eradication measures, which have brought about positive results in recent years in terms of reduced incidence of the disease.</P>

        <P>The first regional food forum was organised by my Department and Bord Bia with the other food development agencies in County Donegal in late 2005 on the theme of market focus for small food enterprises.

State agencies and service providers were on hand to assist producers and food enterprises interested in growing their business and food products from the north west were showcased to highlight the importance of food to the region&rsquo;s economy. I also launched the North West Food and Drink Trade Directory, a timely guide and reference source for small food business in the north west.</P>
        <P>It is my intention to use this forum model in other areas during 2006 to ensure a continued focus on the potential for local food production. By working closely with farmers, small food producers and local agencies we can successfully promote food enterprise and innovation to develop unique products reflecting the strengths of each region.</P>
        <P>To promote local and regional produce more widely Bord Bia will, on 11 May, host an international speciality food forum, in association with Invest Northern Ireland, at the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, Dublin on regional and local foods &mdash; an opportunity for growth. The objective of the event is to support and develop sales of Irish small business and speciality food companies on the core markets of Ireland and the UK. The showcase will host up to 80 Irish speciality and premium food and drink producers on a cross-Border basis, with up to 150 trade buyers attending from Ireland and the UK. This show<Col N="2021"/>case will represent the largest range of speciality Irish food and drink companies under one roof in 2006 and will provide a valuable framework for networking with innovative regional and local companies.</P>
        <P>Varied routes to market are central to the development of small food businesses and the record growth of farmers&rsquo; markets is testament to this. Building on the outstanding success of the Farmleigh Food Market, Bord Bia and the Office of Public Works have drawn up a programme of one-day seasonal food markets on five OPW heritage sites with the objectives of enhancing public awareness of heritage sites and of fostering closer ties with the local farming, business and community interests. The heritage sites selected are: Fota House and Gardens, Cork, on 26 February; the JFK Arboretum, Wexford, in May; Castletown House, Kildare, in July; Newmills, Letterkenny, County Donegal, in September; and Emo Court, County Laois, in December.</P>
        <P>During 2006 Bord Bia will undertake research on the opportunities for Irish speciality and local foods in Great Britain, in particular the motives of speciality food consumers, to assist and orient small food companies interested in that market. Bord Bia will also undertake research into the authentic ingredients which form part of Ireland&rsquo;s food tradition and which could raise awareness of local and regional foods and so assist producers with production diversification.</P>
        <P>There are good prospects for the artisan and speciality food sector nationally and in the United Kingdom where the market is forecast to reach &euro;7.5 billion over three years. The output of the Irish artisan and speciality food sectors grew 10% in 2005 to reach &euro;475 million. Opportunities exist for the right products making the initiative to promote local and regional food economies.</P>

	<P>The Irish beef sector in 2005 was characterised by stability, consistency and high prices. Beef prices in all categories are up 6% on average for 2005, having reached a six year high in 2004. Irish beef production reached 524,000 tonnes in 2005, a drop of 2% on 2004 levels. Of this, 487,000 tonnes, representing 93% of our production, was exported with an export value to the Irish economy of well over &euro;1.3 billion, representing almost 20% of Irish food and drink exports. Some 192,000 tonnes or 40% of our beef exports went to EU markets, with the UK remaining our largest single destination with exports of 260,000 tonnes.</P>
        <P>The outlook for Irish beef exports in 2006 is largely positive with the decreasing production trend throughout continental Europe leading to a <Col N="2022"/>beef supply deficit of 350,000 tonnes. In contrast, Ireland&rsquo;s beef production is forecast to increase by 5%. This presents an opportunity for Irish beef producers to further consolidate their position in the high value EU market and should maintain a steady demand for Irish beef in 2006 with price growth again being achieved.</P>
        <P>Non-EU markets continue to be important alternative outlets for Irish beef and it is our intention to have the maximum number of third country markets open for our beef exports. The reality, however, is that continental EU and UK markets offer a much more attractive and secure outlet for Irish beef. The ending of the over 30 months scheme in the UK on 22 January 2006 further regularises the EU beef market. Certain adjustments may have to be made by Irish exporters if displacement of Irish product occurs due to the additional supplies of cow beef coming onto the UK market in 2006. It is also likely that the EU export ban on UK beef will be lifted in 2006.</P>
        <P>Assuming there will be a change in the export rule from April 2006, UK exports are forecast to be in the region of 30,000 tonnes in 2006. With the EU beef supply deficit, this quantity should be easily absorbed into the internal market with no adverse market repercussions.</P>

	<P>The EU regulations governing the single payment scheme make specific provision for farmers who were obliged, because of agri-environmental undertakings such as REPS and commonage framework plans, to reduce their stock numbers. Such farmers are entitled to apply to my Department to have their single payment entitlements calculated on the period before they de-stocked.</P>
        <P>It is noted that the person named joined REPS in 1997. Due to the requirements of the scheme, he needed to construct a slatted unit for his dairy enterprise. In order to provide full slurry storage capacity for all his stock he was then advised that he needed to provide a further slatted unit for his suckler enterprise. The person named decided to sell his suckler enterprise, including his suckler quota, and concentrate on his dairy enterprise which he increased from approximately 14,500 gallons to more than 33,000 gallons. Such changes of enterprise are deemed to be a management <Col N="2024"/>decision and do not fall to be reviewed under agri-environmental provisions.</P>

Having assessed the application, the single payment entitlements unit informed the person named that the circumstances outlined did not fulfil the <i>force majeure</i> criteria laid down in Article 40 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1782/2003. The person named then appealed this decision to the independent single payment appeals committee which recommended that the decision of the single payment entitlements unit should be upheld.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the person named changed his farming system during 2002, and as there is no provision under the single farm payment regulation to use 2003 and-or 2004 as an alternative reference period, the person named was advised to submit an application to the national reserve. The person named submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the single payments scheme national reserve under category C. Category C caters for farmers who, between 1 January 2000 and 19 October 2003, sold the milk quota into the milk quota restructuring scheme and converted their enterprise to a farming sector for which a direct payment under livestock premia or arable aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000 to 2002.</P>
        <P>More than 23,000 applications for an allocation of entitlements from the national reserve were received, when account is taken of farmers who applied under more than one category. Processing of these applications is continuing and the intention is to make allocations to successful applicants at the earliest opportunity. The Department of Agriculture and Food will be in touch with individual applicants as soon as their applications are fully processed when formal letters setting out my Department&rsquo;s decision will be issued.</P>

	<P>Detailed EU legislation lays down the conditions that member states must apply to the production of and trade in products of animal origin, including meat and meat products, as well as to imports of these products from third countries. Under harmonised legislation a series of health and supervisory requirements are applied in the member states to ensure that animal products are produced to standards that guarantee the safety of food and the protection of human and animal health. The application of these standards in the member states is monitored by the Food and Veterinary Office, FVO, of the EU.</P>
        <P>It is a requirement that animal products imported from third countries meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, member states. All such imports must come from third countries or areas of third countries approved for export to the EU. The FVO carries out inspections to ensure that only establishments that meet hygiene and health standards equivalent to those operating within the EU are approved. Where the FVO considers that public health requirements are not being met, an establishment may be removed from the EU approved list. If outbreaks of animal diseases occur in a third country, approval to export to the EU is suspended for the infected regions of the country, or the whole country, as appropriate, until the disease risk has been eliminated.</P>
        <P>I fully support the policy that animal products imported into the EU from third countries meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, EU member states. Irish farmers are required to ensure that their production systems and farm practices fully comply with a wide range of EU directives on important matters including traceability, animal health and welfare and consumer protection.</P>
        <P>In this context I wrote to the European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, Mr. Markos Kyprianou, concerning the sanitary rules applying to the import of livestock products, especially beef, into the European Union. In his <Col N="2028"/>reply the Commissioner outlined that, with respect to traceability and controls of residues of veterinary medicines, the purpose of EU legislation is not to impose on exporting third countries a system of guarantees that is equal to the EU system, but that the exporting country provides guarantees that are equivalent to the standards applied in the EU. The Commissioner indicated his service is committed to protect the health of European consumers and European livestock. The Commissioner has assured me that the Commission will not hesitate to take the appropriate protection measures if a product, imported from a third country or produced in the domestic market, represents a risk for the health of EC consumers, livestock or plants.</P>

	<P>The Irish beef sector in 2005 was characterised by stable market conditions and satisfactory prices. Some 487,000 tonnes of Irish beef, representing 93% of our production, was exported in 2005 with an export value to the Irish economy of more than &euro;1.3 billion or almost 20% of Irish food and drink exports. As a result of effective promotion and marketing to date, 192,000 tonnes or almost 40% of our beef exports went to continental Europe, with the UK remaining our largest single destination with exports of 260,000 tonnes.</P>
        <P>The outlook for Irish beef exports in 2006 is largely positive with the decreasing production trend throughout the EU leading to a beef supply deficit of 350,000 tonnes. This situation presents an opportunity for Irish beef producers to further consolidate their position in the high value EU market and should maintain a steady demand for Irish beef in 2006.</P>
        <P>Non-EU markets are important alternative outlets for Irish beef and it is my intention to continue our efforts to have the maximum number of third country markets open for our beef exports. The reality, however, is that continental EU and UK markets offer a much more attractive and secure outlet for Irish beef and we intend to continue to consolidate our position in those markets.</P>
        <P>In this regard, last September I launched the Bord Bia &ldquo;Irish Beef in Europe&rdquo; campaign which is aimed at building sales of Irish beef in European supermarkets and to establish the &ldquo;Irish Beef&rdquo; brand firmly in the minds of consumers. This particular campaign involved on-pack pro<Col N="2029"/>motions in over 8,000 stores which are frequented by some 40 million shoppers every week. I was happy to be in a position to provide Bord Bia with additional funding of &euro;500,000 in 2005 for this campaign.</P>
        <P>I participated in one of the on-site supermarket promotions myself in Italy last October. Feedback has been very encouraging in terms of improved demand in response to the promotion and Bord Bia, together with the meat exporters, are planning the details of a further promotion of this nature for our beef in 2006.</P>
        <P>The dairy sector has enjoyed a number of successful years on international and EU markets and once again performed solidly in 2005. Some 80% of Irish dairy production is exported to world markets across a broad range of products, including butter, milk powders, cheese, infant formula, food ingredients and functional foods. Exports in 2005 amounted to &euro;1.8 billion.</P>
        <P>There is a continual dynamic in global dairy market development and the barriers between internal EU and external third country markets are less restrictive than is the case for beef. The competitiveness of market support measures at EU level is therefore crucial to international trading and I maintain close contact with the Commissioner to ensure that an appropriate set of internal aids and export subsidies are available to maintain the competitiveness of Irish product on world markets. The availability of these aid mechanisms will enable the dairy sector consolidate and increase its share of international markets.</P>
        <P>New investment by Irish dairy processors in research and development will continue the drive towards greater levels of innovation and diversity in product mix and will help consolidate and increase our share of the world market. Such innovation is key to unlocking market segments currently restricted by virtue of the product mix available at present.</P>
        <P>In terms of competition from outside the EU, the Irish dairy sector has continued to excel against stiff competition from New Zealand, Australia, the US and Argentina. Sales to third countries represent some 20% of total Irish dairy sector output. Despite increased competitive pressures, world prices are expected to remain relatively stable in 2006 and, together with forecast increased global demand for dairy products of some 2% per annum until 2010, Ireland is well positioned to take full advantage of these international trading opportunities.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 209 and 210 together.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Communications, the Marine and Natural Resources is primarily responsible for the promotion and development of renewable energy, including biofuels. Nonetheless, the development of the biofuels sector is a matter that impinges on several other policy areas, including agriculture, transport and taxation, and involves various Departments and agencies. My Department has been represented on a number of interdepartmental groups considering the matter and there is also ongoing contact between my Department and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, for example, about the EU Commission&rsquo;s biomass action plan and strategy for biofuels, which will be discussed at next week&rsquo;s Council of Agriculture Ministers&rsquo; meeting.</P>
        <P>I am very conscious of the central role that agriculture can play in supplying the necessary raw materials for the production of biofuels. Oilseed rape, wheat and sugar beet can be used for the manufacture of liquid transport biofuels, while forestry by-products and other farming and food by-products, such as meat and bone meal and tallow, can be used for energy-heat generation. Tallow can also be used in biodiesel production. Factors such as the increasing cost of oil, the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and the opportunity for farmers to explore alternative land uses following CAP reform mean that the potential of this area must be fully explored.</P>
        <P>For the purposes of contributing to the development of policy on biofuels my Department, in conjunction with COFORD and Teagasc, has examined the potential of energy crops, wood biomass and farming and food by-products. In general, the production of energy crops for biofuels will have to be demand led and production by farmers will only occur if the economic returns are greater than those offered by traditional crop enterprises. The production of liquid biofuels from energy crops, in the absence of fiscal incentives, is not economic at current oil price levels. The budget announcement by the Minister for Finance of a major extension of the mineral oil tax relief scheme to cover, when the relief is fully operational, some 163 million litres of biofuels per year should further stimulate the production of crops for the manufacture of liquid biofuels. This initiative will benefit the environment in terms of a reduction in CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions, it will enhance security of supply of fuels, and it <Col N="2031"/>will create jobs and outlets for agricultural production.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Within my own area of responsibility, a range of developments are already under way or in the pipeline that will encourage the production and use of biofuels. These include grants to promote and develop sustainable forestry, including alternative timber use to reduce dependence on fossil fuels; promoting the use of wood biomass, for example, by the installation of a wood heating system at my Department&rsquo;s offices at Johnstown Castle; funding of forest-to-energy pilot projects; willow planting promotion; supporting biofuels research under the research stimulus programme; grant aiding the application of new technologies such as anaerobic-aerobic digestion and fluidised bed combustion, with a renewable energy dimension; and the use of by-products for incineration and co-incineration in place of fossil fuels.</P>
        <P>There are also a number of important developments on the horizon at EU level. The Commission has recently produced a biomass action plan and a strategy for biofuels. These are on the agenda for next week&rsquo;s meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers. In this context I will be seeking a review of the operation of the energy crops scheme.</P>

	<P>The Irish dairy sector has enjoyed much success on international and EU markets in recent years and performed solidly in 2005. Overall, exports of Irish dairy products and ingredients amounted to &euro;1.82 billion, as Irish exporters responded to strong market demand worldwide.</P>
        <P>Despite considerable policy changes at EU level export performance has been very resilient in recent years. We are now in the second year of implementation of the Luxembourg agreement on the reform of the CAP and there has been no material change in market performance nor have the predictions of price deterioration materialised. Indeed, the contrary is the case. The dairy prices and demand for Irish dairy products on EU and global markets held strong throughout the year.</P>
        <P>World prices for both butter and skimmed milk powder averaged 8% above 2004 levels and this solid market performance meant that use of intervention was particularly low for both products. In practical terms Ireland used intervention last year only to the extent necessary to take advantage of <Col N="2032"/>a rising market. The casein market also performed very well with an average price increase of 25% in 2005 over the previous year.</P>
        <P>The outlook for 2006 suggests a more challenging world market as increased output levels from Oceania, US and Argentina impact on the market. Despite this, world prices are expected to remain relatively stable. While oil prices and the value of the US dollar-euro exchange rates will be important factors in determining the competitiveness of Irish and EU traders on world markets, nonetheless global demand for dairy products is set to rise and I am convinced that Ireland is well positioned to take full advantage of these international trading opportunities.</P>
        <P>The negotiations on the new WTO round will present challenges and opportunities alike for the dairy sector. The removal of international trade barriers will create new trade opportunities and the main challenge for the Irish dairy sector will be to make the necessary market adjustment to ensure that the sector both protects its global competitiveness and secures its share of this growing market.</P>
        <P>I will continue to work constructively with the Irish dairy industry in addressing the competitiveness issues that it faces as it adapts to the new policy framework. In this respect the main priority will continue to be concentrated on having an appropriate market policy at EU level incorporating a competitive set of aids and subsidies that reflect the real needs of the industry and meet the challenges of export competitiveness.</P>

	<P>Ireland faces a wide variety of competitors on EU and world markets for the range of products we export. The ability to compete on agricultural markets is the based on a number of factors. These include the scale of production, exchange rates, price and the degree of competition within a particular market. The liberalisation of agriculture has made the marketplace for an export-orientated country like Ireland more competitive. To survive in this environment, the Irish agri-food sector must improve its productivity, reduce costs of production, invest in greater levels of research and development, become even more responsive to the demands of customers and increase the value of output sold.</P>
        <P>The agri-vision 2015 committee, chaired by Alan Dukes, undertook an examination of the changes likely to take place in the agri-food sector over the next ten years and made appropriate recommendations for action particularly in the area of competitiveness.

	<P>I am satisfied that the most recent CAP reforms allied to the agreement in December last on the financial perspective for the period 2007 to 2013 will provide for a stable and sustainable agricultural sector in the years ahead. The outcome to the negotiations on the financial perspective represented a satisfactory outcome on policy for agriculture and rural development from Ireland&rsquo;s point of view. The overall objective of ensuring that adequate funding will be provided for the continuation of the CAP and rural development measures was achieved.</P><Col N="2034"/>
        <P>I am very conscious of the economic and social damage to Irish agriculture, the rural economy and the fabric of rural society which would result from an unfavourable outcome to the ongoing negotiations on a new WTO agreement.</P>
        <P>The EU has positioned and prepared the CAP for the WTO negotiations through the CAP reforms of the Agenda 2000 agreement and the mid-term review. While Ireland remains committed in overall terms to negotiation of a new round, the objective is to ensure the continuation of the highest possible level of protection and support for the agri-food sector and, in particular, to ensure that the actual reductions in support and protection which the EU will be required to implement under a new round will not necessitate a further reform of the CAP. I will continue to work closely with both Commissioners Mandelson and Fischer Boel and my colleagues in the Council of Ministers to protect the interests of the Irish agri-food sector.</P>
        <P>At national level, the agri-vision report which was commissioned by my predecessor identified the rapidly changing nature of Irish agriculture and the issues facing the agriculture and food industries, including the need for market-driven production and greater levels of productivity. The report set out a framework for the future and the actions and changes that are required. The report placed great emphasis on meeting consumer requirements and the role of competitiveness in the context of an increasingly global market. I will be producing a plan of action in the near future that will set out a clear programme of work for my Department and other interests in the agri-food sector to enhance competitiveness and to fulfil the productive potential to meet consumer demands into the future.</P>

        <Quest>if she has had discussion with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with a view to alleviating some of the impact of the nitrates directive, having particular regard to her Department&rsquo;s interpretation as to the way in which the directive should be enforced; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The Minister, Deputy Roche, has recently made regulations giving legal effect to Ireland&rsquo;s national action programme under the directive.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to giving the farming community all the practical help necessary. Following from commitments made in the <Col N="2035"/>Sustaining Progress agreement, which related explicitly to the nitrates directive, payment rates in REPS increased by 28% on average in 2004. The number of farmers in REPS reached record levels last year. My Department&rsquo;s Estimate for 2006 includes a provision of &euro;323 million for REPS, the highest ever.</P>
        <P>We also introduced improvements to the farm waste management scheme and the dairy hygiene scheme in 2004, and I have tabled proposals to the Commission for further major improvements to the farm waste management scheme which will provide a far more attractive package to farmers than that which was previously available. Only last week in Brussels I met Commissioner Fischer Boel and impressed on her the need for early Commission approval of the scheme as submitted. I have secured an Estimates provision of &euro;43 million in 2006 for the revised scheme.</P>
        <P>Most of the controversy in recent days has centred on the nutrient management provisions of the regulations. These were finalised following difficult negotiations with the Commission&rsquo;s scientific experts, with both Departments making use of the advice provided by Teagasc. It was the Commission, however, which determined the final content of the regulations. Teagasc has recently indicated that it may be possible to review part of the advice it had given on the application of phosphorus, in a way that could improve the effectiveness of the regulations. The Government and the European Commission saw merit in allowing Teagasc time to elaborate this new advice and, accordingly, the Minister, Deputy Roche, announced a brief <i>de facto</i> deferral of the implementation of Part 3 of the regulations.</P>
        <P>Teagasc has been requested to provide, as a matter of urgency, the necessary scientific case to support any revision of the phosphorus tables in the regulations. The two Departments will carefully consider any submission received from Teagasc while also bearing in mind that any proposals for revision of the phosphorus tables will have to respect the environmental requirements associated with the nitrates directive and meet with the agreement of the European Commission.</P>
        <P>Teagasc has not been specifically requested to review its advice on nitrogen issues. However, to the extent that its revised submission on crop nutrient requirements suggests any further beneficial adjustments to the regulatory regime, these will be considered. The possibility of such further adjustments will also depend on their respecting the environmental requirements involved, and on their acceptance by the European Commission.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A central issue arising from the nitrates directive is the need to secure a derogation which will allow certain farmers to operate, under appropriate conditions and controls, up to a level <Col N="2036"/>of 250 kg of organic nitrogen per hectare. The proposal was given an initial presentation to the EU nitrates committee in December, and further scientific data have been supplied to the Commission following bilateral discussions. The proposal will need to be discussed again at future meetings of the nitrates committee before approval can be obtained. Securing this derogation is vital for the most productive dairy farmers in particular, and it is important that the position on the regulations is clarified at an early date so that the negotiations on the derogation can proceed.</P>

	<P>The purpose of the speed camera initiative is to enhance overall road safety and help reduce the numbers of deaths and serious injuries on our roads. The performance criteria to be applied will be determined by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the deployment of cameras will be focused on locations where there is an established or prospective risk of collisions. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as the traffic law enforcement agency in the State, will be responsible for the outsourcing project.</P>
        <P>The Garda authorities inform me that the safety camera project will commence with approximately 500 to 600 locations countrywide &mdash; about 15 to 20 locations per local authority area. Speed checks will take place at these locations at times decided by a matrix which will link the checks to speed related collision data. The number of locations will be increased as necessary to achieve the targeted road safety objectives of increasing compliance with speed limits across the entire road network, reducing the speed of vehicles at locations that have a speed related collision history and acting as a deterrent to driving at excessive speed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Sex Offenders Act 2001 contains provisions under Part 2 of the Act relating to the release from prison of persons convicted of a sexual offence listed in the Schedule to the Act. In accordance with the provisions of the Act, the governor of the prison or the person in charge at the time, must advise the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of the impending release of such offenders. In addition, the governor of the prison or the person in charge at the time must also inform the convicted person, prior to their final release from the prison, of their obligation to notify the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of his or her name and address within seven days of their release from custody. Thereafter, the offender must notify the garda&iacute; of any change of name or address within seven days of that change.</P>
        <P>Notification of any address where the offender spends either as much as seven days or two or more periods amounting to seven days in any 12 month period must also be given to the garda&iacute;. If the offender intends to leave the State for a period of seven days or more, he or she must inform the garda&iacute; of this fact and the address at which he or she intends to stay, and also notify the garda&iacute; of his or her return. The provisions of the Act also extend to any sex offenders entering this jurisdiction from abroad who have an obligation to register in their own countries.</P>
        <P>If the court imposed an order for post-release supervision, Part 5 of the 2001 Act obliges the convicted person to undergo supervision by the probation and welfare service for a specified period and to comply with such conditions that are specified in the sentence for securing that supervision. Should a sex offender fail to comply with their obligations as outlined in the Act, the offender is guilty of an offence and subject to a fine of &pound;1,500 or &euro;1,905 and-or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 12 months.</P>
        <P>Additional measures contained in the Sex Offenders Act 2001 make it mandatory for a convicted sex offender to inform their employer or future employer of their conviction if their job entails having unsupervised access to children. The Act also allows for a chief superintendent of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to request the court to make a sex offender order, whereby a sex offender can be prohibited from behaving in a particular way, where such behaviour is perceived by the court as having a potential danger to the welfare of children. It should be noted that Garda clearance is now required for potential employees in a <Col N="2040"/>number of occupations which entail access to or authority over children.</P>
        <P>My Department, the Irish Prison Service and the probation and welfare service are collectively examining all the issues involved in increasing the number of sex offenders attending programmes, both in prison and in the community. As well as looking at how to get prisoners into the current programme, they are examining how the services can improve the range of interventions available to offenders, and thereby increase the number of offenders addressing their offending. Their core concern is that any approach proposed should contribute to enhancing societal and community protection.</P>
        <P>In the context of the Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent Criminal Justice Review of Northern Ireland, an intergovernmental agreement on North-South co-operation on criminal justice matters was signed on behalf of the Irish and British Governments in July 2005. One of the items included in the work programme for the first year is the establishment of a working group to review the arrangements for exchanging information on registered sex offenders.</P>
        <P>The first meeting of the working group of officials to implement the agreement took place in Dublin in November 2005. The meeting agreed to the establishment of a registered sex offenders advisory group. This group will evaluate the potential for sharing information, including potential benefits and barriers, and will identify areas for future co-operation. The group will consist of representatives of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, my Department and the Northern Ireland Office. In addition, the probation and welfare service and the Probation Board for Northern Ireland are in the process of drawing up a protocol for the management of sex offenders which would establish mutual arrangements for continued enforcement of community sanctions. This development is the result of a memorandum of understanding between the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of Ireland on information sharing arrangements relating to sex offenders.</P>

        <Quest>the proposals he has for requiring new Garda trainees recruited from immigrant ethnic groups to undergo an intensive course in Irish; the reason he has changed his policy on this matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, I made a number of changes in September 2005 to the rules governing entry to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including removing the requirement to hold a qualification in both Irish and English in the leaving certificate or equivalent, in favour of a requirement to hold a qualification in two languages, at least one of which must be Irish or English.</P>
        <P>Irish society is increasingly diverse in its composition. The previous absolute requirement for Garda trainees to hold an academic qualification in Irish was undoubtedly a barrier to membership of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for many persons. My changes to the eligibility criteria have opened up entry to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to persons from all of our different ethnic communities. This is a hugely significant step which will help to ensure that future intakes of recruits to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na reflect the composition of Irish society, to the benefit of the force and the people it serves.</P>
        <P>I want to make it clear, however, that Irish will continue to have an important place in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Everyone who wishes must be able to communicate with the force through our native language. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a very strong commitment to delivering a service through Irish. Indeed, proficiency in Irish is strongly promoted within the force and that will continue to be the case.</P><Col N="2044"/>
        <P>Future recruits to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who do not have a qualification in Irish when commencing their period of training will, therefore, be required to achieve an appropriate standard in Irish before becoming full members of the force. Details of the Irish language training programme for Garda trainees will be finalised shortly by the Garda Commissioner, in consultation with my Department and the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy O&rsquo;Cu&iacute;v.</P>

        <Quest>his views on whether further steps are necessary to ensure that persons with criminal records are not issued with licences under the Private Security Act 2004, bearing in mind that he stated in reply to Question No. 191 of 7 December 2005 that the Private Security Act 2004 had put in place stringent criteria to ensure that the private security industry operated to a high standard and that all applicants for licence had to undergo criminal record checks by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; and if further legislative changes or other measures are neces<Col N="2047"/>sary arising from recent clear breaches of security, including the one at the National Gallery.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Deputy will be aware that the Private Security Authority has put stringent criteria in place to protect the private security industry from infiltration by criminals. All licence applicants will undergo criminal records checking by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This will apply to employees, principals and directors of private security companies. It is an offence not to disclose details of a conviction or convictions when applying to the authority for a licence.</P>
        <P>Licensing for individuals employed in the private security industry will commence on 1 April this year. From that time, employees of door security and security guarding companies, along with persons employed &lsquo;in-house&rsquo; by any organisation or business to perform security duties, who apply to the Private Security Authority for a licence, will undergo a Garda criminal records check as part of their licence application. Licences for individuals will become mandatory from 1 April 2007.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the measures put in place by the Private Security Authority, underpinned by the Private Security Services Act 2004, are geared to ensure that unacceptable persons are precluded from involvement in the private security industry.</P>

        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that in response to the disturbing number of road fatalities in Buncrana district, a Garda traffic corps unit was established in the district on a pilot basis with effect from 20 October 2005. The unit was in addition to the traffic corps personnel already operating in the Donegal division. An interim evaluation has been conducted which indicates that there has been a reduction in the number of road traffic fatalities and an increase in the number of road traffic offences detected in the Buncrana district since the introduction of the unit.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that Garda management is satisfied that the visibility provided by the traffic corps unit has had an influence on the reduction of certain crimes in the area, such as burglary and public disorder. I am also informed that, following this review, a decision has been made to extend the pilot scheme until 15 March 2006 when a further evaluation will be carried out.</P>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 20 July 2001 and applied for asylum. His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The person concerned was informed by letter, dated 29 August 2002, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him and afforded him three options in accordance with section 3(3)(<i>b</i>)(ii) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, namely, to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a deportation order or to submit, within 15 working days, representations to the Minister, in writing, setting out the reasons     he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.</P>
        <P>His case was examined under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 &mdash; prohibition <Col N="2049"/>of <i>refoulement</i>. Consideration was given to all representations received on his behalf for temporary leave to remain in the State. On 17 September 2003, I refused temporary leave to remain and instead signed a deportation order in respect of him. Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring him to present himself to the garda&iacute; in Ennis, County Clare, on 20 November 2003, in order to make travel arrangements for his deportation from the State. The person concerned failed to present as required and was classified as evading his deportation. The effect of the deportation order is that he must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.</P>
        <P>The person referred to by the Deputy married an Irish national in Belfast on 5 November 2004. I understand he was subsequently granted temporary residency in the United Kingdom, based on this marriage to a national from another EU state exercising her treaty rights there. The person concerned attempted to illegally re-enter the State on 4 November 2005, but was refused leave to land on foot of his valid deportation order and was returned to the United Kingdom.</P>
        <P>The person concerned has made an application through his legal representatives to my Department for the revocation of his deportation order and permission to reside in Ireland based upon his marriage. This application has yet to be decided and a reply is expected to issue soon to his legal representatives.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I have been informed by the Garda authorities, which are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that driving courses for members the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are conducted at the driving schools at the college in Templemore and in Garda headquarters on an ongoing basis. The courses incorporate cars from 1.4 cc, vans and personnel carriers and also include automatic cars. In addition, courses are conducted for other vehicles used throughout the force, including VIP vehicles, four-wheel drives, tow wagons, heavy goods vehicles and motor cycles.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, divisional officers or chief superintendents have the power to authorise a member who is a holder of a full class &ldquo;B&rdquo; <Col N="2050"/>driving licence &mdash; standard car licence &mdash; to drive official cars and vans, subject to the member being otherwise deemed suitable. This applies only to a car or van. This is known as &ldquo;chief&rsquo;s permission&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Members who have been issued with a certificate of competency &mdash; having completed an appropriate driving course &mdash; may also be authorised by divisional officers or chief superintendents to drive official vehicles. The certificate of competency allows a member to drive official vehicles where he or she has completed a course for that particular vehicle. The fact that members who hold a current class B driving licence may, with chief&rsquo;s permission, drive official cars is of assistance to Garda management from an operational point of view.</P>
        <P>The total budget allocated to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for 2006 is almost &euro;1.3 billion. As the budget is not allocated on an activity basis, it is not generally possible to identify separately the funds provided for the Garda driving and training school.</P>
        <P>The personnel strength of the Garda driving school at the end of 2005 was 24 &mdash; all ranks. Garda management state that the staffing levels and resources of the Garda driving and training school are currently being examined, with a view to reducing the number of personnel driving on chief&rsquo;s permission.</P>

The average weekly occupancy in 2004 was 243 and in 2005 it was 247.63. The reception and integration agency, RIA, does not maintain statistics on the average daily occupancy.</P>

I recently published the recorded figure for headline offences in 2005, which amounted to 101,659. Figures provided for 2005 are provisional, operational and liable to change.

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by officials in the citizenship section of my Department that there is no record of an application for naturalisation having been received from the person referred to by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>The person concerned arrived in the State in November 2001 and claimed asylum. Her application was refused in September 2002 and an appeal against this decision was refused in June 2003. She subsequently applied for permission to remain in the State on foot of her parentage of a child born in Ireland on 1 January 2005.</P>
        <P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2004, which came into operation on 1 January 2005, provided for significant changes in the eligibility to Irish citizenship of persons born in the island of Ireland. On the basis that the person concerned gave birth to a child on 1 January 2005, it was necessary for her to have been resident in the State for three years in the four year period prior to the date of birth of the child. Time spent in the State without the permission of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or where such permission was for the purposes of seeking asylum does not reckon for this purpose.</P>
        <P>Since the person concerned was in the asylum process until June 2003, she did not satisfy the three year residency requirement at the time of the child&rsquo;s birth and the child is not entitled to Irish citizenship. There can be no question, therefore, of the person concerned obtaining leave to remain solely on foot of the birth of this child. Furthermore, the person concerned is not eligible for naturalisation.</P>

	<P>In my response to Question No. 1189 of 25 January 2006, I informed the Deputy that my officials had sought clarification on aspects of the declaration lodged by the person concerned.</P>
        <P>Although a response was recently received through the Deputy&rsquo;s office, the information contained therein does not satisfactorily resolve the matter. It appears that the person concerned and her husband have been living in different jurisdictions for most of their married lives and my <Col N="2054"/>officials wish to be satisfied that the couple were living together as husband and wife at the time the person concerned lodged a declaration of post-nuptial citizenship on 4 February 2005. The information provided to date is not satisfactory in this regard.</P>
        <P>My officials are in the process of writing again to the person concerned with a view to having this matter resolved as quickly as possible.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for asylum on 23 October 2003. The claim was investigated at first instance by the Refugee Applications Commissioner who concluded that the person concerned did not meet the criteria for recognition as a refugee. The commissioner&rsquo;s recommendation was communicated to the person concerned by letter dated 14 July 2005.</P>
        <P>The person concerned appealed this recommendation to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal which, following consideration of the appeal, affirmed the earlier recommendation. The outcome of the appeal was made known to the person concerned by letter dated 7 February 2006.</P>
        <P>In accordance with normal procedures, the file of the person concerned has been forwarded to the ministerial decisions unit in my Department for final processing. I understand that a representative of that unit will be writing to the person concerned in the coming days to inform them of my formal decision in their case and of the options now open to them <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i> their position in the State.</P>

        <P>He was given the options to be exercised within 15 working days of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State, leaving the State before an order is made or consenting to the making of a deportation order. His case file, including all representations submitted, will be considered under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, which relates to the prohibition of <i>refoulement</i>. I expect the file to be passed to me for decision in due course.</P>

        <Quest>the reason his Department has continued to insist on the transfer of a person (details supplied) in County Dublin to Belgium in view of the existence of clear proof of illness arising from torture in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that information previously given by way of reply to a parliamentary question incorrectly indicated that this person failed to submit a relevant appeal; if he will authorise an extended period of residency on medical, <Col N="2057"/>humanitarian and safety grounds; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my replies to Question No. 149 of Thursday, 26 January 2006, and Question No. 181 of Thursday, 9 February 2006. In response to Question No. 149 of Thursday, 26 January last, I indicated that an appeal against the determination of the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner to transfer the asylum applicant to Belgium had not been received by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. In fact, an appeal had been made on 23 January but that information was not available to me when the answer in question was drafted. I regret that I unintentionally misled the Deputy on this point. In any event, the appeal was rejected by the appeals tribunal and the original determination to transfer was upheld. The applicant and her legal representatives have been informed of the outcome by the tribunal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The applicant in question is not being removed to the Democratic Republic of Congo but to Belgium, where her claim will be considered. Like Ireland, Belgium is a party to and thus bound by international obligations and human rights instruments prohibiting <i>refoulement</i>. The current development of a common EU asylum policy is predicated on the full and inclusive application by member states of the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees and its 1967 New York protocol maintaining the principle of non-<i>refoulement</i>. Council Regulation (EC) No 432/2003 is based on this common policy and all regulation states are considered safe for returning third country nationals.</P>
        <P>Having regard to these considerations and the fact that Belgium is responsible under the regulation for the examination of the woman&rsquo;s asylum application, which includes <i>refoulement</i> considerations, the transfer cannot be deemed to give rise to <i>refoulement</i>. I repeat that the transfer will be dealt with in a sympathetic and humane way and the woman&rsquo;s medical needs will be made known to the Belgian authorities. If necessary, medical escorts to accompany her on the flight will be provided.</P>

        <P>I understand from records available to the Department that she maintained her residency status in the State until 10 October 2001 but did not attempt to renew her permission to remain in the State until 5 June 2003. Evidence was requested to verify her presence in the State during the period in question to consider the residency renewal application but no response has been received to this request to date.

	<P>The person referred to by the Deputy arrived in the State in August 2000 and claimed asylum. That application was refused in January 2001 and an appeal was not submitted within the permitted time limits. I informed the Deputy in response to Question No. 22 of 2 February last that the person was granted permission to remain in the State on 30 September 2002 on foot of her parentage of an Irish-born child. She has permission to remain in the State until September 2007.</P>
        <P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may in his absolute discretion grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation as long as certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. The applicant must be of full age or, by way of exception, be a minor born in the State; be of good character; have had a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years; intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation; and have made, either before a judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.</P>
        <P>It should be noted in the context of naturalisation that certain periods of residence in the State are excluded. These include periods of residence in respect of which an applicant does not have permission to remain in the State, periods granted for the purposes of study and periods granted for the purposes of seeking recognition as a refugee within the meaning of the Refugee Act 1996. That means that time spent in the State by the person concerned prior to September 2002 is not reckonable for naturalisation. The earliest date she is eligible to apply for naturalisation is September 2007, as long as she has maintained <Col N="2060"/>her permission to remain without any gaps since it was first granted in September 2002.</P>
        <P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2004, which came into operation on 1 January 2005, provided for significant changes in the eligibility to Irish citizenship of persons born in the island of Ireland. On the basis that the person concerned gave birth to the child in question after 1 January 2005, it would have been necessary for her to have resided in the State for three years in the four year period before the date of birth of the child. For the purposes of calculating this three year period, time spent in the State without the permission of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or where such permission was for the purposes of seeking asylum does not reckon. Consequently, unless the child was born after 30 September 2005 &mdash; three years from the date the person concerned obtained permission to remain in the State &mdash; the child is not entitled to Irish citizenship.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Further information on the naturalisation process may be obtained from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform&rsquo;s website, <i>www.justice.ie</i>, or by telephoning the citizenship section helpline &mdash; at lo-call 1890 551500 or 01 6167700 &mdash; on Tuesdays or Thursdays between 10 a.m. and 12.30 p.m.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 255 and 256 together.</P>
        <P>All primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments for their pupils, either directly from psychologists employed under the Department of Education and Science&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, or through the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, which is administered by NEPS. Schools to which NEPS psychologists have not been assigned may avail of the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, whereby they can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, which will pay the psychologist the fees for this assess<Col N="2061"/>ment directly. Details of this process and the conditions which apply to the scheme are available on the Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The prioritisation of urgent cases for assessment is a matter for the school principal in the first instance. The number of NEPS psychologists has increased from 43 on establishment to 121 at present. The Public Appointments Service recently established new recruitment panels for NEPS. Regional panels are in place and the Department is in the process of appointing a number of new psychologists. Priority is being given to filling vacancies in areas of greatest need. Any increase in the number of psychologists in <Col N="2062"/>NEPS will depend on the availability of resources and must take account of Government policy on public sector numbers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">NEPS provides assistance to all schools and school communities which experience critical incidents, regardless of whether they have a NEPS psychologist assigned to them. NEPS processes applications for reasonable accommodation in certificate examinations from all schools and responds to queries relating to individual children from other sections of the Department and the specialist agencies. The information sought about the numbers of schools with access to NEPS is contained in the following table.</P><Col N="2061"/>

	<P>Major improvements in school staffing have been made in recent years with the hiring of more than 5,000 additional primary teachers. This represents the largest increase in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. <Col N="2063"/>Today there is one teacher for every 17 children, the lowest pupil-teacher ratio in the history of the State.</P>
        <P>Aside from decreasing average class size, the unprecedented increase in school staffing in recent years has greatly improved the services provided for children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas. Under the action plan for tackling disadvantage published in 2005, there will be a reduction in class sizes to 24:1 at senior level and 20:1 at junior level in 150 primary schools serving communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantage.</P>
        <P>With more than 600 extra resource teachers in place in this school year, children with special needs are getting more support than ever before. It should be acknowledged how much progress has been made in this area in recent years. I recently announced that I have secured sufficient funding to provide even smaller classes in our primary schools in the next school year. The Minister for Finance has committed to a further reduction in class size in the following year. Accordingly, over the next two years, the Department will put 500 extra teachers into primary schools to reduce class size and to tackle disadvantage.</P>
        <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued annually to all primary schools. The general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 29 pupils in the school. Schools with just one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that, with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases, but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children in the school.</P>
        <P>Next year this is being reduced to 28 children per classroom teacher and in 2007-08 it will be reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher. Departmental officials are drawing up the revised staffing schedule necessary to achieve this. Schools will be asked to use the extra class teachers provided as a result of the revised schedule to provide for smaller classes in the junior grades. In speaking about staffing in our schools, we have consistently said that priority will be given to children in disadvantaged schools and those with special needs. We have done this. In line with the Government commitment, mainstream class sizes are now being reduced.</P>

	<P>The Monasterevin sewerage scheme, which was funded under my Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme, was completed at the end of 2005 at a cost of &euro;7.2 million. The first phase of the scheme provided for the replacement of the existing waste water treatment plant. The sewerage network in the town and environs was extended and upgraded under the second phase. The capacity of the completed scheme is adequate to cater for the medium term requirements of the catchment area and my Department has no current proposals from Kildare County Council to further extend or develop the scheme.</P>

	<P>Most local authorities have locally based computer support for their housing functions. However, these need upgrading to provide for their complete housing management needs and the information needs of my Department. Consequently, the Local Government Computer Services Board, LGCSB, has been commissioned to develop an integrated housing project on behalf of local authorities and my Department.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Initially, work was conducted on business process mapping and standard coding methods; this was carried out under contracts to LGCSB by BearingPoint Limited Following this, a two-phase approach has been adopted for the implementation of the integrated housing project. An interim package &mdash; housing operations made easy or HOME &mdash; is currently being rolled out to all <Col N="2074"/>local authorities, with the exception of Dublin City Council which, due to the scale of its operations, is itself implementing and financing the development of a system to meet its needs. HOME is based on a product developed by Kerry County Council and the LGSCB would have engaged a number of small scale consultancies in the evaluation of this system and its roll out to other authorities. The recently published housing needs assessment of 2005 was supported by an improved IT platform developed under this interim package.</P>
        <P>Greater reliance on external ICT consultancy support is envisaged in the final phase of the integrated housing system. LGCSB is now engaged in public procurement for this purpose. Completion of the overall project will ensure updated and improved IT support for a range of local authority housing functions and permit the creation of an integrated national information system on social and affordable housing.</P>
