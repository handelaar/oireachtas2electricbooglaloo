      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 22, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I visited Budapest on 25 November for a meeting with Prime Minister Gyurcsany. At the meeting, we discussed issues on the EU agenda and, in particular, the negotiations on the financial perspectives for 2007 to 2013 and the development of Ireland&rsquo;s economic relations with Hungary. While I was in Hungary, I also launched the Irish-Hungarian Business Circle, a new body designed to promote trade and economic contacts between Ireland and Hungary.</P>
        <P>I attended the EuroMed tenth anniversary summit in Barcelona between 27 and 28 November. The Barcelona conference of EU and Mediterranean Foreign Ministers in 1995 marked the start of a new partnership phase of the relationship between the European Union and the Mediterranean. The tenth anniversary summit was co-chaired by the British and Spanish Prime Ministers. The summit adopted a code of conduct on the fight against terrorism and approved a chairman&rsquo;s statement. In addition to almost all of the Heads of State or Government of the European Union, the summit was also attended by representatives from the EU&rsquo;s Mediterranean partners including Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority, Syria, Tunisia and Turkey.</P>
        <P>I attended a dinner hosted by the King of Spain and delivered a national statement to the plenary meeting of the summit. I also had a bilateral meeting with the Prime Minister Mr. Blair to discuss issues on the EU agenda, including the future financial perspectives, and Northern Ireland matters. I met leaders from Palestine, Morocco and Israel and had a short exchange with the new German Chancellor, Angela<?oasys _jy ?>Merkel. I had previously written to the new Chancellor congratulating her on her appointment. I used this opportunity to reiterate my congratulations and indicated that I would be happy for the Chancellor to visit Ireland when her diary permitted.</P>
        <P>I hosted a working lunch for Mr. Tassos<?oasys _jy ?>Papadopoulos, President of the Republic of Cyprus, on 30 November. The President&rsquo;s visit marked a further step in the very positive relations between Cyprus and Ireland and we reaffirmed our commitment to strengthening economic, trade and cultural ties. We also had a very constructive discussion on developments in the EU in the run-up to the December European Council, focusing in particular on enlargement issues and future financial perspectives. The President briefed me on prospects for progress in the United Nations-led process in Cyprus.</P>
        <P>I attended the European Council in Brussels on 15 and 16 December. As I made a statement <Col N="1200"/>to the House last Wednesday I will not go into detail on its outcomes. The main outcome was agreement on the financial perspectives for the European Union for the seven years, 2007-13. The agreement is a good one from Ireland&rsquo;s point of view as it respects the October 2002 agreement on CAP funding and the 2003 CAP reform programme.</P>
        <P>The Prime Minister Mr. Blair was chair of the European Council and in that capacity had discussions with all delegations on the issues on the European Council&rsquo;s agenda, in particular the financial perspectives. I did not have any additional bilateral meetings with the Prime Minister as I had already had a substantive bilateral meeting with him in London on 9 December in preparation for the European Council.</P>
        <P>I am sure the National Forum on Europe will hold a number of meetings during 2006, continuing its good work on the period of reflection on the European Constitution. However, as the National Forum is an independent body and I have no function in its day to day operations, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on its planned work programme for 2006.</P>
        <P>While I have no immediate plans to meet bilaterally with the President of the European Commission, who visited Ireland in July 2005, I will meet the President at the forthcoming European Council.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It is pleasing that the categorisation of questions has been somewhat changed from the last time, when it was the subject of discussion in the House. At least Questions Nos. 1 to 22, inclusive, are on European issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">CAP direct payments and market support amount to &euro;293 billion of the agriculture budget. Is the Taoiseach satisfied there will be no further review of the Common Agricultural Policy until 2013, as has been stated? He referred on a number of occasions to the fact that there have already been major reviews of the policy, and changes implemented. Is he satisfied that the Government&rsquo;s decision to withdraw Part 3 of the nitrates directive and remaining sections can be implemented without a serious loss of production of up to 30% for many farmers, not just those involved in pigs and poultry? There is very serious concern about the method of implementation of the directive by the Government.</P>
        <P>Extraordinary rendition has been raised in the House by a number of Deputies. Is the Taoiseach and the Government satisfied with the guarantees given by Condoleezza Rice and the US Government that no persons are being transported through, to or from Shannon for the purposes of inhuman or degrading treatment or torture?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is outside the subject of the questions, which is EU issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there consensus on the matter among European leaders? As a nation that is <Col N="1201"/>friendly with the US and has strong historical, economic, political and cultural ties, is there any other way it can be demonstrated that there is nothing to hide? Perhaps we might be invited to inspect some of the planes.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach has had a number of meetings with Heads of Government and contacts within the European Union since the December European Council. Arising from yesterday&rsquo;s revelation in respect of the early child care supplement, did he brief those Prime Ministers on the package that the Irish Government was introducing to ensure that no abuse of this would take place? Is he happy, having done that, with the number of children of migrant workers currently in this country who will be eligible for this benefit and does he have an accurate figure of the extent of it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the financial perspectives, particularly the elements dealing with agriculture, the overall agreement was excellent from our point of view because we expect that, over the next period, our receipts will amount to about &euro;14 billion, while our payments will be &euro;13 billion. We will not become net contributors until the very end of the round, based on present projections, and we anticipate, notwithstanding our economic success and increase in national prosperity, that we will hold this position, which would effectively mean that we will have been 40 years in the European Union before becoming a net contributor. That is an extraordinary achievement, based on our <i>per capita</i> figures.</P>
        <P>Throughout the negotiations, as Deputy Kenny noted, we had a number of clear objectives, the main one being the future of Common Agricultural Policy funding. The agreement is very satisfactory to us. We never had difficulties with an examination or review of the process or the system but we had issues with that taking effect during the round and breaking the previous agreement. The position for which we and the French had effectively lobbied throughout the month, with some limited support from a few others, was maintained. They will begin that process in 2008 and 2009 with a review of the overall budget but the decisions will take effect at the end of the next financial perspective in 2014. That would be the normal position, even in this round. The Commission papers were published in 2003 and 2004 and there is always a long run in with these issues. It was the same in respect of the 1997 and 1998 papers and negotiations for the 1999 position did not start until 2000. That is a satisfactory position.</P>
        <P>On the nitrates directive, I am well aware of the position. The Deputy would be best tabling questions but we believe that the position we have obtained following long negotiations is a satisfactory one, and this has been explained to farm leaders and in Europe.</P>
        <P>On rendition, the position is clear because, in the view of the Government, we have categorical <Col N="1202"/>statements on behalf of Ireland, whereas other countries do not have these. After acting on our position on this, we received categorical assurances from Condoleezza Rice, which were confirmed by the embassy as late as last week. We are happy with those, although as I stated last week, we will take full account of all ongoing investigations, including the inquiries conducted by Senator Marty and others.</P>
        <P>The position on Shannon has been made clear by the US authorities and, because the matter has arisen so many times, we have gone back to seek clarity on it. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, sought and attended a meeting last year at which he received categorical assurances with which we are happy. In line with international agreements, if there are no issues of doubt, one must stick with international conventions, which we have done. However, we did not just leave it nor have we taken up any cosy arrangements. We have stressed our position and concerns to United States authorities and to one of its most senior representatives. She has given assurances to us and we must accept them on that basis.</P>
        <P>I have raised the issue of the early child care supplement, not so much to brief them on our position but to find out what other countries were doing and to find out how they were handling it. The regulation, EU 1408 of 1971, which is old states migrants from EU member states working in a country &mdash; in this case in Ireland &mdash; whose dependent children are resident in their own country are entitled to claim child benefit here in respect of their children, either in full or as a top-up if there is an equivalent payment at a lower rate in their country of origin. The regulation has been in place for 35 years and we were aware of it.</P>
        <P>Obviously the numbers traditionally have been very low but they have started to increase. There are not many, quite frankly. I do not want to highlight this on the basis of an ad, but the numbers are small. We have to look at what other countries are doing and see if there is a need to do anything else. On the face of it, the regulation is very clear but I want to ascertain what others do. I do not mind us abiding by our situation with very small numbers. Somebody asked me today if we knew about this issue and of course we did because the new payment is based on child benefit. We will honour our commitments.</P>
        <P>In the past, of course, this regulation has benefited Irish people. We were the substantial beneficiaries because Irish people emigrated to other EU states which had much more generous social welfare systems than we had. That was particularly the case in the 1970s and the 1980s, when Irish people were leaving in droves. The position has turned around. Recent benefit rate increases here, EU enlargement and net immigration have reversed the effect of the regulation. We have been advised that the reciprocal arrangement which has been in existence for over 35 years also <Col N="1203"/>applies to the early childhood supplement. In order to seek this benefit, the recipient must be working or self-employed. Therefore, it is not operated as a draw for persons who might simply wish to benefit from the social welfare system.</P>
        <P>If we look at the broader picture, there are many reciprocal arrangements in place. Last year we received over &euro;420 million for the Vote for the Department of Health and Children, mainly from our neighbours in the United Kingdom, in respect of health treatments here for people who worked abroad, including many Irish people.</P>
        <P>I am interested in how other countries are handling this issue. We have taken a very generous position in the last few years, which was the right thing to do in our role as supporters of enlargement. In terms of what we have received, as I pointed out in my earlier reply, we will be 40 years taking from the EU before we give anything. Our aim is not to breach the rules but I always like to be sure we are doing what everyone else is doing. That is why I sought the information on what others are doing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>As I understand it, the early child care supplement was introduced by the Government on the basis of child care costs as they pertain in this country. Was the Government fully aware of the implications of the payment being linked to child benefit and therefore being available for children not living here? Given the supplement was introduced as a child care cost measure, a different categorisation could have prevented any abuse, and notwithstanding the directive, it would also have meant we would not run the risk of abuse.</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach know the number of migrant workers here who have children living abroad? Is it well over 100,000 or&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a separate question which does not arise in these questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking about the element that is a child care cost.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>They are linked. If a person is in receipt of the new payment, he must be in receipt of child benefit. Our figures were based on that. The numbers are not huge as of now but we must protect the position. We are talking about a small number of thousands. In child benefit cases, we would be talking about less than 2,000, while benefit might be double that. I was aware of this and discussed it with the Department of Social and Family Affairs as far back as October. When we were doing our work on the child benefit costs, the cadre of resources in that was based on the new benefit so there is a direct link between the two.</P>
        <P>Hopefully, in all these issues where there are reciprocal arrangements, there is no problem with something that has existed for 36 years as long as <Col N="1204"/>it does not escalate into big numbers. We have taken a more generous position than others but that changes for all the other member states on 1 May. For people who did not make our moves on 1 May 2004 the two years are up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>On that issue, it really does not matter what others do. The Taoiseach says he wants to know what others are doing but that does not matter. If EU law requires it, then that is the position. What does it matter what others are doing? The Government introduced an early years payment so it would be separate and different from child benefit. The Government considered adding the money to child benefit, a tax refund and a number of other things, but the Minister specifically brought in a different and separate payment and conveyed the impression that it was to assist with the inordinately high cost of child care in this jurisdiction for children irrespective of their nationality. He communicated something different from what the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has found out. The numbers he used in parliamentary replies of 350,000 children make that clear.</P>
        <P>On the EuroMed summit and the statement the Taoiseach made in the newspapers after that summit that the time had come to call for a debate on enlargement, what considerations did the Taoiseach have in mind that motivated him to call for that debate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>To briefly return to the other issue, it always matters how EU regulations are applied in different member states and how people handle them. It is a regular occurrence that EU regulations are administered slightly differently in different jurisdictions; they are curtailed in some ways and extended in other ways. We have always had an open position and we transpose EU directives far quicker than most member states and implement them to the letter of the law &mdash; from my long experience, we do so far better than most.</P>
        <P>In this issue, all I am saying is it matters how others administer schemes, particularly such a generous scheme. In social welfare and other areas, when a country improves its position, there are payments, whether they are pensions or welfare systems, that operate under reciprocal arrangements in member state countries and we honour them. We did so in this case as well. When we improve our lot and there is a reciprocal arrangement under EU regulations, we pay up.</P>
        <P>On enlargement and the EuroMed summit, as we come to the end of a long round of enlargement that has been taking place since 1990, and the changes of 1988 and 1989 with eastern Europe coming in, now is a good time to look at where we go in future enlargements. The decision has been made on Turkey and how to implement it, and everyone accepts it will be a long drawn out <Col N="1205"/>issue. Even the Turks will accept we are talking about a decade.</P>
        <P>The decision on Croatia has also been made. More recently, the decision was made to move to the next stage with regard to Macedonia. The Thessaloniki Summit during the last Greek European Presidency a few years ago indicated that we will have to deal with the whole region, including Bosnia Herzegovina and half a dozen other countries, on some basis when they meet the criteria.</P>
        <P>More recently, my interpretation of the new neighbourhood agenda, which started under the Irish Presidency as a means of building up new neighbours in the south and east, was that it would build a different kind of stabilisation agreement and a new understanding of the benefits for the countries in question in dealing with the European Union, while not moving to EU membership. Ukraine would be the clearest country on the agenda. Other people have a different, more expansive view and would be prepared to enter another round of enlargement involving several of these countries.</P>
        <P>As Deputies will be aware, a number of the countries involved in the new neighbourhood agenda, which includes Morocco and other countries in the Mediterranean region, aspire to European Union membership or as close to it as they can get. Having moved from nine, to 12, to 15 to nearly 30 members, I do not see how we could start another round of enlargement which would take membership up to 30 or 40 members without first introducing the changes necessary for the European Union to function which have not been formalised because of difficulties with the draft constitution. Those who hold another opinion are entitled to it but I think they are ill advised.</P>
        <P>I have colleagues who have an expansive view of the nature of Europe&rsquo;s frontiers and think the continent has no end. In recent years, under Commission Presidents Santer, Prodi and now Barroso, I have said that somebody needs to start drawing a line because otherwise &mdash; Deputy Rabbitte will not disagree with me on this &mdash; pressure builds somewhere and suddenly one must sign up because it would be a terrible disappointment for a country if one did not move on.</P>
        <P>With regard to budget and other arrangements people say we must decrease the budget. Most of the large member states were in the 1% club this time and wanted to go back on the financial perspectives. Fortunately they were driven on with the help of Chancellor Angela Merkel. One cannot keep pressurising the Commission to fund the European Union and provide programmes, plans, objectives and aims and then decide not to finance it. The new neighbourhood initiative should be used rather than having endless pressure for enlargement.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>At the December summit the Taoiseach met the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, at a meeting which coincided with the so-called Stormontgate affair and the revelation <Col N="1206"/>about Mr. Donaldson. What implications does he consider these developments will have for the restoration of the institutions? Does he believe they might compromise the Government&rsquo;s relations and contact with Sinn F&eacute;in?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I discussed those issues at the meeting I had on 9 December, not at the summit. As the Deputy will recall, the Prime Minister had very little information and was not able to cast much light on what was happening. Subsequently, with my ministerial colleagues, I discussed this matter with PSNI Chief Constable, Hugh Orde, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, discussed it with some of his ministerial colleagues. We received an explanation that gave us some light. As I said earlier in the year, it is best to move these issues on. As it was explained to me it would neither damage nor enhance my relationship with anybody, so we just move on. Satisfactory answers on who was watching who were never given. The more it is explained the more it appears it was a complicated web in which everybody watched everybody. It will not affect our relationship.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The December summit in Brussels issued a statement on climate change and sustainable energy which referred to the Gleneagles plan of action. Was this taken on board, particularly in the area of technology transfer, during the Taoiseach&rsquo;s visit to India, and did it figure in his discussions with President Kalam or Prime Minister Singh? Will the Taoiseach indicate whether the nuclear non-proliferation treaty arose? Given that India has not signed up to the treaty Frank Aiken would have wished a Fianna F&aacute;il Taoiseach to raise it.</P>
        <P>Neither France nor the Netherlands has indicated there will be a new poll on the European constitution, while the Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen, taking on the Presidency in the second half of this year, has called on states that have already ratified the EU constitution to accept possible changes to the text. Is that view being treated with any sympathy by the Irish Government? The Polish President&rsquo;s view is that a new convention is needed to write a brand new constitution. Does the Taoiseach support either of those positions or does the Government have another view on the matter?</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the EuroMed conference and counter terrorism, I note a code of conduct on counter terrorism was agreed in Barcelona. Following that agreement can the Taoiseach say whether any serious view is being taken of the Council of Europe investigation that has accused European governments of silently condoning the practice of abducting suspected terrorists and transporting them? Is any serious view being taken of Amnesty International&rsquo;s open letter to European Heads of Governments which states: &ldquo;any involvement of member states in such transfers <Col N="1207"/>[extraordinary rendition flights as they are called] including the mere act of allowing facilities at airports is equally in breach of international law&rdquo;?</P>
        <P>In the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply to Deputy Kenny he mentioned that Dr. Rice was clear on behalf of the US Administration on this matter, but my recollection is that Dr. Rice refers to prisoners. She does not refer to the landing of planes used in the transfer of prisoners, empty or otherwise. Can the Taoiseach respond to that? Amnesty International&rsquo;s understanding under international law is that assisting the transport of the planes used, empty or otherwise, is viewed as complicity under international law. Has Dr. Rice been clear, as the Taoiseach stated, not only on prisoners but on the planes that have been identified as involved in this type of activity?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said last week, Dr. Rice stated that Irish airports were not used in any way related to these issues, for planes or people or anything else. She has been absolutely, categorically clear that Irish airports were not used. Her reply was re-stated through the Embassy last week. On the question of the Council of Europe investigation, it has made a number of recommendations and issued guidelines on which we would look positively. The rapporteur is Senator Dick Marty, who was appointed in November by the committee for legal affairs and human rights of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. He is expected to present his report to PACE this week, if he has not done so in recent days. That investigation is continuing in parallel with the Secretary General&rsquo;s questionnaire and the senator&rsquo;s original remit to examine secret prisons has since been extended to include rendition allegations. The Government is happy to co-operate in the conduct of that investigation if requested to do so. The parliamentary committee is also examining the issue and has set up a temporary committee to investigate allegations of the transport of illegally detained prisoners by the CIA in European countries. The committee has been mandated to collect and analyse information to find out whether the CIA or other intelligence services carried out abductions or extraordinary renditions, detentions and torture in secret sites. We will co-operate with any of those investigating bodies. The European Commission of Human Rights also asked for information.</P>
        <P>There has been movement on the issue of climate change. However, I suggest to the Deputy that he put down a question to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who deals with such issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the European constitution?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Different prime ministers expressed different views on the European con<Col N="1208"/>stitution. The Government&rsquo;s position is that we made an agreement last year that we would have a period of reflection, which would come to a conclusion in the summer under the Austrian Presidency. We are abiding by that decision. As part of that process, other countries&rsquo; governments are entitled to state their views about how they see things going forward. We have had a debate on the issue here and I have attended many conferences that have debated the proposed constitution. However, we must continue to feed into the debate under the Austrian presidency and see how we are in the summer when the Austrian Presidency concludes. One cannot just pick bits out of what was a carefully balanced document, negotiated right throughout the convention period. Some countries have a simplistic view that they will go down through the index and tick off the bits that are convenient to them, while saying that we should amend other parts. I do not agree with such views. The agreement was carefully balanced and one cannot just take out one section and proceed on that basis. It just will not work. People are entitled to articulate views that are unworkable, but we need to be honest now and again. Many of the suggestions which involve cherry picking the constitution will never happen, so making speeches like that are of little use.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I also mentioned the non-proliferation treaty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but I divided the questions and that will be in the second question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">From his extensive contacts at these meetings in Europe can the Taoiseach give some indication &mdash; and the period of reflection is nearly over &mdash; of the direction in which the debate on the constitution is going, as far as the European political establishment is concerned? What will emerge from the debate? Will the constitution be put again to the French and Dutch people in its present form and therefore to the Irish people? Perhaps the Taoiseach could elaborate on that.</P>
        <P>Did the Taoiseach have discussions with the many people he met, in particular the Hungarian prime minister, about the controversy that has developed over the kidnap and transport of prisoners for torture in countries outside of the European Union? What attitude have the other EU states adopted towards this issue? Are they all as trusting as the Taoiseach in accepting the denials of the United States Government?</P>
        <P>There is something that intrigues me that the Taoiseach, perhaps, might clarify immediately. He said previously, and again today, that he accepts wholeheartedly the assurances of the United States Government in regard to this country not being used for these so-called renditions, in other words, flights to torture. In view of the fact that the same Government gave the Taoiseach a totally fraudulent reason for the <Col N="1209"/>invasion of Iraq, does he not suspect that, perhaps, he should not trust it a second time? Has it occurred to him that it might be lying to him again?</P>
        <P>Last, we know that CIA-chartered planes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;have used Shannon. Why is he so sanguine about that? If it was known, for example, that international heroin traffickers had planes going from Shannon&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should conclude.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach elaborate on his meeting with the President of Cyprus? Will he report progress on the issue of the illegal occupation and partition of the island of Cyprus by Turkey? Did the Taoiseach offer assistance in the move towards the reunification of that island and the establishment of normal relations between Cyprus and Turkey? On the issue of his many foreign visits and meetings with heads of state and prime ministers, is he telling the House that the issue of extraordinary rendition has not been discussed or raised by him? Will he be specific as regards what opportunities he has availed of to reflect on this very important issue, particularly now that the European Council has indicated that there is confirmation of the suspicions regarding this practice by the CIA and other agencies? In the light of that, what action, if any, does the Taoiseach now propose to take, particularly on Shannon?</P>
        <P>In the matter alluded to earlier by Deputy Kenny, was the nitrates directive discussed at the EU summit, at the margins of it or indeed at any of the other meetings the Taoiseach attended? Did he raise the issue, particularly given that it is due for implementation at midnight tonight and the fears arising therefrom as regards the impact of these regulations on Irish farming, not least on intensive farming practices involving pig and poultry producers? Has the Taoiseach taken steps to try to alleviate the impact of these measures?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In reply to Deputy Joe Higgins, matters are moving along well. The socialists and the hard left around Europe are firm in their view in favour of a constitution. Most of them believe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The fake socialists.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;as Deputy Joe Higgins does, that the original proposal I negotiated was <Col N="1210"/>the correct one and they are ready to support it. However, opinion on the right is more difficult and we must see how that works out. Nonetheless, I know the Deputy and I will be on the one side if there is a campaign on this issue.</P>
        <P>The nitrates directive&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Another U-turn.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;-was not discussed at the European Council. It was discussed at both the Environmental and the Agricultural Councils. I think the Deputy knows that Ireland has been way behind other member states in reaching agreement on this issue.</P>
        <P>I have given the House a clear picture as to what the United States has said. It was not based on the European issue. Other countries are concerned about this. We sought our own guarantees concerning our position, our airport and our circumstances, and we received assurances in that regard. I have made that clear, as has the Minister, a number of times.</P>
        <P>With regard to my meeting with President Papadopoulos in Cyprus, we were involved to an enormous extent during the Irish Presidency in the search for a framework for an agreed comprehensive settlement. We have supported the UN Secretary General&rsquo;s efforts in this area but, unfortunately, his plan was rejected in the referendum on it almost two years ago in March 2004. Little progress has been made since. The Secretary General has been cautious since then about the prospects for any resumption of those efforts and stalemate continues. As we had been involved throughout this process and since, President Papadopoulos, a good friend and most helpful to Ireland, outlined the position to me.</P>
        <P>In the last report of the Security Council, which was released the day before I met the President on 29 November, the Secretary General stated there had been no substantial change in the positions of the two sides on his mission of good offices. He reported that the timing was not right to appoint a special envoy to Cyprus. The position remains in stalemate but we remain helpful in trying to find a resolution of this issue.</P>

        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest>if suitably trained home help staff and adequate home help hours will be provided at community care level in 2006; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>An investment package of &euro;150 million has been put in place for 2006 and 2007. This is the largest ever increase <Col N="1211"/>in funding for services for older people and the package has a strong focus on community based supports. Of that investment package, an additional &euro;33 million full year cost was allocated to the home help programme. This represents a significant increase over the Estimates provision of &euro;112 million for 2005.</P>
        <P>This development funding will enable the HSE to provide an additional 1.75 million hours nationally in 2006. The additional resource will further enhance the service and facilitate the expressed wish of many more older people to continue to live in their own homes for as long as possible. It should be noted that &euro;55 million was also allocated towards the provision of home care packages, 1,100 of which are provided at present and an extra 2,000 of which will be provided during this year. These comprehensive packages, which include co-ordinated and integrated care provided by nurses, home care attendants and therapy services such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy, may also include an element of home help services.</P>
        <P>The funding outlined was provided to the HSE on a national basis. The HSE is responsible for the delivery of the home help service across the country and also for the training of home help staff. The HSE has informed the Department that training programmes have been developed to ensure home helps receive appropriate training and these training programmes have been rolled out in the HSE over the last number of years. These programmes will continue in 2006 to improve skill levels of home helps. In addition, home helps also receive regular, on the job training in conjunction with other health professionals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to training of home helps, has the Minister reviewed any of the curricula? Can he list Piaget&rsquo;s four stages of cognitive development or Erikson&rsquo;s eight stages of development? These are included in one of the courses for people who are studying to be home helps. I do not know what they are and I am sure the Ceann Comhairle, who is also a medical doctor, does not know what they are. I wonder about the content of some of these courses which are supposed to teach people to be home helps. Who devises and monitors them? This was a FETAC course. The Minister should investigate the content of these courses. They might not be appropriate to what people are doing.</P>
        <P>The lack of transparency regarding the number of home help hours is causing a huge problem for Opposition Members. Even the person in charge of this area in the HSE could not tell me how many home help hours were provided last year. If medical services are to be provided using the home care packages, is VAT at 13.5% being applied to those packages? If there is an element of a social service involved in the home care packages, will VAT be applied at 21%?</P><Col N="1212"/>
        <P>As the Minister of State knows, the HSE does not have to pay VAT. There is also tax relief at source for people who put their relative in a residential nursing home. Will VAT be an issue for people accessing these services or in providing value for money for the people getting the services? Will this service be a value for money issue for taxpayers rather than being a service provided by the HSE?</P>
        <P>Over past years, especially with regard to the health strategy, Quality and Fairness &mdash; A Health Strategy for You, the Department has failed to implement many of the recommendations it promised at community care level with regard to home help services and looking after carers in the community. There are so many contradictions in what has come out and what was announced in the most recent budget that value for money and delivery of the service could continue to be a problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has raised a number of issues, but it is a bit of a joke to talk about contradictions in the recent budget. We announced a package of &euro;150 million in the budget for services for older people, including a number of community supports vital to maintaining people in their own homes and communities, which is the expressed wish of the majority of older people. The Deputy may be as critical as he likes of the past, but we have made a major effort to improve and build on the community support structure in place.</P>
        <P>With regard to the content of the various courses undertaken by the HSE, I will have the issue examined and come back to the Deputy on it. The HSE attaches great importance to providing adequate training to people who intend to become involved in the provision of home help. The private sector has become increasingly involved in the provision of home help throughout the country and it too attaches great importance to the training of people before taking up employment. I will check on the content of courses to ensure there is adequate provision. I am happy with the response we have received from the HSE in that regard, but I will seek further information and come back to the Deputy on the matter.</P>
        <P>The issue of VAT has been raised by a number of providers. The matter is being investigated and we have taken it up with the Minister for Finance. We realise the difficulties VAT creates and will clarify the matter. This is not something on which I can make a decision, but I will come back to the Deputy on the issue as soon as I have definitive news.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>When does the Minister of State think he can get back to us on that issue? The implementation of the home care packages will be difficult for some providers if there is no change.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1213"/>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I know the providers require us to bring some clarity to the issue in order that they can make plans for the future. We will renew our representations to the Minister for Finance. I cannot say how soon he will get back to us. I appreciate the urgency of the situation and know it would be helpful to have an early decision. We will try to get that decision as quickly as we can.</P>

        <Quest>if a submission has been received on the extent of the current risk to patients in view of the fact that for animals there is full protection from malpractice in the pharmaceutical sector while for humans there is not, and that there is no statutory fitness to practise or fitness to operate legislation on pharmacy; the steps she intends to take to protect patients and within what timeframe; if she can be held liable in any claims arising from malpractice in this area; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The practice of pharmacy is governed by the Pharmacy Acts 1875 to 1962. I am aware that the current fitness to practise provisions in these Acts are inadequate for the modern practice of pharmacy. On foot of the recommendations of the pharmacy review group I obtained Government approval in June 2005 to commence the process of drafting, as a priority, new pharmacy legislation to allow, among other things, the making of fitness to practise regulations for pharmacists. The purpose of these new provisions is to ensure the highest standards from pharmacists and to safeguard the safe and effective delivery of pharmaceutical services.</P>
        <P>My Department is at an advanced stage in drawing up the heads and general scheme of a pharmacy fitness to practise Bill and I intend to take a memorandum to Government in the very near future, seeking approval for the draft heads and general scheme and requesting that the legislation be referred to the parliamentary counsel&rsquo;s office for formal drafting of the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister accept that there is an urgency to this matter? Does she not find it extraordinary that animals here have better protection against pharmacy malpractice than humans? Does she not have a serious concern that the registry body has no power to strike pharmacists off the register? It has power only to put people on the register. In its estimate, two to three pharmacists should be struck off the register each year. That is the approximate level of malpractice. Does the Minister accept that she has responsibility to ensure not just fitness to practise legislation is speeded through the House, but also fitness to operate a pharmacy? Fitness to <Col N="1214"/>operate a pharmacy has not been mentioned and I ask her to include it and comment on it.</P>
        <P>We are all conscious of scandals, for example, where terrible things were done by Dr. Shipman. The role of the pharmacy in that scandal is relevant and germane to this issue where we do not have proper regulation. If such a scandal arises here, which seems more likely than unlikely, will the Department be exposed to litigation because of its failure to deal with what is clearly a matter of protection and public safety?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that the legislation governing the regulation of pharmacy is unsatisfactory. It dates back to 1962 and much has changed in the intervening period. At a recent event I was told by the incoming president of the pharmaceutical society that when his father was its president many years ago, he expected the new law during that year. That was 30 years ago. I do not know why we have not been able to frame legislation in the intervening period, but the matter is urgent. There are many urgent matters on my desk, including the Medical Practitioners Bill, the regulation of the nursing profession, illegal charges in nursing homes etc.</P>
        <P>There are two issues here. The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland only has a role with regard to recommending removal from the register where there is a breach of criminal law. It has no right to strike off others. The tool used traditionally by the State to penalise malpractice is the GMS contract. While it was the case in the past that there was hardly a pharmacy that did not have a GMS contract, there are a growing number that do not. Therefore, that route is not available to the State. The matter is a priority.</P>
        <P>Recently, I had a good meeting with the pharmaceutical union and it raised with me the issue of the operation of the premises as well as the individual. I have asked my officials to examine that in the context of the first Bill. A second Bill will deal with the service aspect, the physical conditions and such matters which, while important, are less urgent. To deal with the legislation quickly, we want to deal with the regulatory aspects, particularly with regard to fitness to practise. I hope to bring the scheme to the Government within a matter of weeks.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Since the late 1990s, a number of parents of children with autism began to take High Court cases to obtain specific educational services for their children. Since 2002, my Department has been involved in 74 cases in which applicants are seeking access to such appropriate education services. In cases involving children with disabilities this also includes, on occasion, access to appropriate health related supports.</P>
        <P>These cases are broken down as follows. In 2002, there were 35 cases, 15 of which were judicial review cases and 20 plenary cases. In 2003, there were 18 cases, seven of which were judicial review cases and 11 plenary cases. In 2004, there were 12 cases, five of which were judicial review cases and seven plenary cases, and in 2005, there were nine cases, five judicial review cases and four plenary cases. In that time, three cases have proceeded to full hearing, the first in 2003 and the second during 2005. The court ruled in favour of the State on both occasions. The third case has yet to be determined. A number of other cases which commenced prior to 2002 are also being dealt with by my Department.</P>
        <P>The cost to my Department, excluding the costs of the State defence which is borne by the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, in each of the years since 2002 was as follows. In 2002, there were no legal costs and settlements amounted to &euro;438,450, totalling &euro;438,450.</P>
        <P>In 2003, legal costs amounted to &euro;2,492,579 and settlements amounted to &euro;297,106, totalling &euro;2,789,685. In 2004, legal costs amounted to &euro;1,339,660 and settlements amounted to &euro;297,181, totalling &euro;1,636,841. In 2005, legal costs amounted to &euro;2,741,436 and settlements amounted to &euro;290,987, totalling &euro;3,032,423. It should be noted that these figures do not include the costs of staff involved in responding to these cases.</P>
        <P>These cases are, in the main, taken against the Department of Education and Science and allege a failure on behalf of the State to provide for an appropriate education as provided for in the Constitution. While these cases are mainly taken by parents of children with autism, there are also a number of cases relating to ADHD and intellectual, physical and sensory disabilities.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should note that the Department of Health and Children is not specifically named as a defendant in all these cases but is involved due to its role in the formulation and development of policy in respect of the provision of health care and support services. The Health Act 2004 provided for the creation of the Health <Col N="1216"/>Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, significant progress has been made in recent years regarding enhancing and developing services for people with disabilities. I am satisfied that the level of investment in disability services demonstrates that the Government is committed to the provision of appropriate services to enhance capacity within the health services to deliver on the various legislative provisions contained in the national disability strategy. This includes continued enhancements to services to allow children with disabilities participate in the education system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>Some of the court cases probably follow on from the cases where people sought education and, having been granted it, felt the support services were insufficient. Does the Minister of State agree that planning for the provision of the support services involves a far more efficient way of spending funds than meeting the costs of litigation to deny those services? Given the figures the Minister of State has just mentioned, one can only conclude that the latter is the approach.</P>
        <P>I received a similar reply from the Department of Education and Science to the effect that, for two years, there was in the region of &euro;10 million in respect of one side of the court action &mdash; there may well be an overlap in the figures, which essentially implies the State was denying services to children.</P>
        <P>Children who received primary education on foot of legal action are now presenting for second level education but the support services are not in place. Bearing in mind that there is a relationship between the Department and the Health Service Executive in terms of the provision of the required support services, it seems nobody is counting the children in question. This is a denial of their entitlement to an appropriate education.</P>
        <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the second level children are being captured properly? It seems they are only captured properly when there is a court action. This morning I communicated with a parent whose child requires speech therapy. The family lives in Kildare where the HSE does not have services specific to children with the child&rsquo;s diagnosis. If the family moved to west Dublin the child would receive the required services but it does not receive them because the family is living in Kildare.</P>

	<P>On the Deputy&rsquo;s point that people who cannot avail of services would be able to avail of them if they moved to another area, this should not prevail under the Health Service Executive &mdash; it should be possible to avail of them. I will take up the specific matter if the Deputy gives me the details.</P><Col N="1217"/>
        <P>On the Deputy&rsquo;s point on the lack of planning, much planning is being done but the State cannot prevent anybody from taking a legal case if he is not happy with the services he is given. There is much planning associated with the provision of these services.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is correct regarding the lack of provision of services in occupational therapy and speech and language therapy. However, we have provided increased capacity in the universities to educate people in these disciplines. Unfortunately, these people will not graduate for a few years. We are doing everything we can to try to recruit people from abroad to fill the positions in this area for which staff are unavailable in Ireland. Although everything is being done to hire more therapists, I agree there is a lack of them in the country at present.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest>her plans to prevent the cancellation of elective operations and procedures; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[3279/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is regrettable that some patients have their operations postponed and I recognise that this can cause inconvenience and stress for them and their families. Every effort continues to be made by the HSE and hospitals to keep cancellations to a minimum. However, due to <Col N="1218"/>fluctuating demands on the acute hospital system, in some instances it is necessary to reschedule planned treatment, particularly when priority has to be given to emergency cases.</P>
        <P>The Government has pursued a number of policy initiatives to increase throughput of the acute hospital system by way of improved infrastructure, providing additional acute beds, increasing the amount of day surgery, increasing the number of consultants and providing more step-down accommodation and home-care packages. For example, the number of patients treated on a day-case basis has doubled between 1997 and 2004. The number of approved consultant posts increased by 56%. The National Treatment Purchase Fund has also been successful in facilitating treatments for patients in private hospitals, here and abroad. To date more than 38,000 patients have had treatment arranged for them by the National Treatment Purchase Fund and waiting times for elective surgery have fallen significantly. It is now the case that, in general, anyone waiting more than three months for surgery will be facilitated by the National Treatment Purchase Fund.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Twomey is aware, the Health Service Executive, through the National Hospitals Office, has lead responsibility to manage and deliver the services provided in acute hospitals. The Department of Health and Children will continue to work closely with the HSE in monitoring the delivery of acute hospital services to ensure that the postponement of elective operations and procedures is kept to a minimum.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Even today a great number of patients are having neurosurgical, cardiothoracic, orthopaedic and other major operations cancelled. Basic diagnostic procedures, such as colonoscopies for bowel cancer, are being cancelled on an all too regular basis. A report was published in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> on 22 January 2005 which highlighted seven faulty work practices within our hospitals. I am sure the Minister has seen the report. Why did none of these deficiencies in work practices turn up before the benchmarking process was implemented? Why were benchmarking payments awarded to all the professionals in the health service when the seven work-related issues we read about in the report, and which are obviously widely publicised, were not addressed? The Minister will have seen references to them. They have been known to every Member for at least ten years and many of them have been commented on in this House for a number of years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When commenting on the work practices referred to in the report, the Minister used some very strong language. She was very critical and used phrases including &ldquo;indefensible&rdquo; and &ldquo;highly inefficient&rdquo;. In light of this, why was nothing done about the work practices during the course of the past several years, during which period they were <Col N="1219"/>well known? Why did they not turn up when the benchmarking process was being considered? We expect the Minister to give us the answers because, apparently, all the background details on benchmarking have been destroyed and we will therefore not be able to find answers in the records.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is always unacceptable when somebody has elective surgery cancelled. To put the matter in perspective, the percentage of cancellations is between 2% and 3% per annum, although that is still too many. I was reading that in the United Kingdom 15% of elective work is done by the private sector for these kinds of reasons.</P>
        <P>The HSE recently commissioned process mapping exercises of ten of our acute hospitals to examine their practices throughout the hospital. Those exercises are now to hand, I have had an opportunity to read them and they will be published shortly. They form the basis for the HSE&rsquo;s allocation of funds to those hospitals during this year.</P>
        <P>The recommendations will require major internal reform of how hospitals operate. For example, in the Cork area the time a patient spends in hospital is on average one day shorter for every procedure than for the Dublin area &mdash; I do not know why this should be the case. Much of the difficulty clearly has to do with pressure, although I do not want to take from the fact that there are many pressure areas, such as issues concerning older patients and the speed at which they can be accommodated in more suitable accommodation when doctors medically discharge them. Issues also arise with regard to work practices, discharge policies, length of stay and so on. These matters form the main basis of the reform now underway, which, in particular, will this year take the route of the funding allocations.</P>
        <P>I do not have information on the benchmarking exercise. I do not think it went into the kind of detail to which the Deputy refers, which was one of the flaws of the exercise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Some &euro;1 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money was invested in professionals working in the health services and benchmarking. Now it seems the T&aacute;naiste is seeking to scapegoat many of those working in the health services with this sort of fast-tracking and some of the information coming out of it, some of which is ancient news. I am surprised the T&aacute;naiste never tried to do anything about this in the past.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>These difficulties do not arise in the private system which, to be fair, does not deal with trauma and accident and emergency cases, which cause many of the difficulties in the public system. I acknowledge that the health care system is experiencing a major shortage of consultants, which is why it is extremely important to get a <Col N="1220"/>new contract of employment that suits the public health care system in particular. That would greatly add to the system. For example, currently only a consultant can discharge a patient. We are too heavily dependent on junior hospital doctors, of which there are 4,000 whereas there are 2,000 consultants. We need to reverse that balance, which would greatly help, particularly in the discharge area. Instead of services being led by consultants, they would be delivered by them. That process proves highly successful in other countries and I have no doubt it will do so here also.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept that the accident and emergency action plan has failed. On the contrary, a wide-ranging approach has been adopted by the Health Service Executive to improve access to accident and emergency services, improve patient flows through accident and emergency departments, reduce waiting times, free up acute beds and provide appropriate longer-term care for patients outside the acute hospital setting. A particular focus of the action plan has been placed on those patients in acute hospitals who have completed the acute phase of their treatment and are ready for discharge to a more appropriate setting.</P>
        <P>The HSE has made considerable progress and is continuing to make sustained efforts in this regard. A range of measures, including the provision of high dependency beds, intermediate care beds in private nursing homes, additional beds in public nursing homes, home care packages and enhanced subventions, have facilitated approximately 1,500 patients to leave acute hospitals. In addition, &euro;6.6 million is targeted at increasing the level of home support available in the community, which should assist in keeping people well in their homes and thus avoid the necessity for presentation at accident and emergency in many cases.</P>
        <P>Within the context of the action plan, the HSE undertook an audit of efficiencies and process. The study was conducted in ten hospitals, and its conclusions point to a number of areas for further improvement. These include strengthened discharge planning processes, improved clinical decision making at every stage and better co-ordination of and access to diagnostic services. A key action for 2006 for all hospitals with accident and <Col N="1221"/>emergency departments will be the full implementation of the efficiency audit recommendations. In tandem with this, a programme of financial incentivisation will be introduced, aimed at rewarding those hospitals that are meeting agreed performance targets and facilitating overall improved performance.</P>
        <P>The HSE will continue to maintain a focus on the implementation of system-wide measures to further improve the delivery of accident and emergency services.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I was abroad when the Taoiseach gave the interview. To be fair to the Deputy, I do not know whether she is quoting him out of context. However, the Taoiseach is more than aware of the difficulties and pressure in accident and emergency units. He may have been suggesting we should put matters in context, although that is not to justify what happens from time to time &mdash; on too many occasions.</P>
        <P>Each day, approximately 4,000 people present at accident and emergency units. Even on the worst days &mdash; there was a very bad day two weeks ago &mdash; fewer than 10% of those who presented were on a trolley overnight, although that figure is still far too high. All our efforts are focused on finding alternatives, particularly for those who have been medically discharged from the acute phase to better settings &mdash; they are better for a host of reasons &mdash; and improving access to diagnostic facilities. Work is underway in that regard, although the facilities have not been put in place. We have gone to tender with regard to improved primary care, particularly on the north side of Dublin, as this is an issue which is placing huge pressure on some of the hospitals on the north side of the city.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that the Taoiseach is very sensitive to the difficulties being experienced by too many patients at accident and emergency level in some of our hospitals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I would hate to see the Taoiseach not being sensitive if that is the kind of statement he can make about distressed relatives.</P>
        <P>Let us deal with the real and measurable improvements the T&aacute;naiste promised would occur within months of her statement last January. How many minor injury units and chest pain and respiratory clinics have been provided and where are they located? Is the MRI scanner for Beaumont Hospital in place and, if so, for how long has it been in place? How many of the acute medical units promised by the T&aacute;naiste are <Col N="1222"/>in place? Is the T&aacute;naiste aware that the one hospital that has managed to provide this kind of unit, St. Luke&rsquo;s in Kilkenny, was penalised and fined by the T&aacute;naiste during the past year?</P>
        <P>What is the delay with regard to the out-of-hours service in north Dublin, which was promised over one year ago? While there was an urgency about it at that time, there does not now seem to be any urgency from the T&aacute;naiste. Why has the service not been put in place? There is clearly a desire among general practitioners in north Dublin to provide it. What is happening that the T&aacute;naiste cannot even provide that simple measure? At what locations is GP access to diagnostics available and how many GPs can access diagnostics in this new and desirable way? What improvements have been made with regard to palliative care and where have they been made? All of these matters were contained in the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s ten-point plan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely. With regard to acute medical units, AMUs, to which the Deputy referred, a number of hospitals, including St. James&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin, have them. A number of other hospitals sought to completely over-spec what the HSE and the Department felt was required. If people in the health care system think a pot of money is available, they sometimes feel they have to go for the largest possible slice of that money as a cure for all their ills. The HSE made a decision, with my support, that until we knew the outcome of the mapping exercise, which was examining all the internal functions of the hospital, we would not allocate additional funding to be spent in the same way. That exercise, which will be published shortly, hospital by hospital, details a significant number of interesting facts. For example, in some hospitals 100 staff work in accident and emergency units and deal with 100 patients a day, a ratio of one staff member to one patient. A patient must often go through a number of layers before he or she can get near a staff member to treat him or her.</P>
        <P>The doctors on the north side of Dublin submitted a tender which the HSE felt was not adequate to provide the service. I understand the HSE is in discussions with the doctors on the north side of Dublin. Professor Drumm recruited Dr. Sean Maguire, who set up the first out-of-hours facilities in the UK and, subsequently, in Ireland. He is a doctor with huge experience in this area and is currently spearheading the discussions on the out-of-hours facilities with the doctors on the north side of Dublin, which I understand will be completed soon.</P>
        <P>The MRI scanner for Beaumont is a second scanner. I understand a mobile facility was to be acquired. The hospital is in a position to make that happen very quickly.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, public procurement means that although a decision may be made today, unfortunately it takes many months before <Col N="1223"/>some of these developments can happen, for good public procurement reasons.</P>
        <P>The focus on accident and emergency services is thorough and robust. I had a meeting with the Health Service Executive yesterday which dealt with many of these issues, particularly care of the elderly. A package worth &euro;150 million has been made available for this purpose. If this money is used to support people at home, it will have a major impact on the flow of patients through hospitals.</P>

        <Quest>the purpose of a contribution of &euro;30,000 made to the Irish Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society from lottery funds; and the purpose of a separate payment of &euro;30,000 to ISANDS by the Health Service Executive.</Quest>
        <QRef>[3086/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society, ISANDS, provides support services to parents and families of babies who are stillborn or who die around the time of birth. The society has been funded by the former Eastern Regional Health Authority and, latterly, the Health Service Executive, HSE, since 2001.</P>
        <P>In 2005, the HSE grant amounted to &euro;35,000. In addition, a once-off grant of &euro;30,000 was provided by my Department out of national lottery funding. It is a condition of this grant that certification of expenditure be submitted to the Department as soon as possible after the end of the 2005 financial year. My Department is advised by the executive that the approved funding was used by the society in 2005 to help support its activities, including telephone support for bereaved families, publication of newsletters and services of remembrance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I think the T&aacute;naiste will agree with me that ISANDS carries out tremendous work. The purpose of my question was to ask why the society received a once-off payment in 2005. The society takes 5,500 calls per year. In addition, it must hold meetings throughout the country, hire hotel rooms, which often cost approximately &euro;300 per night, and send off newsletters to its members and others who have been bereaved. Such newsletters cost approximately 96 cent each to post, which amounts to approximately &euro;2,000 in total.</P>
        <P>The society has spent approximately &euro;79,000 on its excellent work at the old holy angels plot in Glasnevin cemetery, where 50,000 babies are buried in unmarked graves. It is shocking to think that the society depends on the Dublin mini-<Col N="1224"/>marathon to raise approximately &euro;13,000 per year. It may not be a significant electoral issue but 500 families experience this trauma every year. People often face delayed trauma many years after the original event. These people often need the service provided by a support group and ISANDS provides them with such a service on a voluntary basis.</P>
        <P>Can the T&aacute;naiste assist ISANDS in any way? The former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, stated that he would provide ISANDS with an office. Will the T&aacute;naiste give me a commitment that she will provide the society with proper office facilities and proper annual funding so it can conduct its business? What is the function of the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s national lottery fund? How much does it contain and how is it dispensed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I strongly support ISANDS, which I met in Glasnevin a few months ago. Like Deputy Gormley, I know of many people affected by stillbirth who receive considerable consolation and support from ISANDS. According to the HSE, ISANDS&rsquo;s annual requirements are in the region of &euro;35,000. The society has not yet received funding for 2006. I am not aware of the commitment made by my predecessor, Deputy Martin, but I will examine the matter. The commitment is not included in the brief I received for the question.</P>
        <P>The national lottery grant from the Department of Health and Children is advertised. The Department receives approximately &euro;5 million per annum from the national lottery. There are usually ten times more applications than the available funding can cover. It is a slice of grants from the national lottery in any one year that is made available to the Department. The grant always goes towards once-off expenditure items and generally goes towards capital expenditure. For some reason, the society received no money in 2003 and experienced a serious shortfall. I understand the national lottery grant helped to clear this shortfall. I am happy to meet ISANDS and will be very sympathetic to any particular requirements it may have.</P>

	<P>Does the T&aacute;naiste agree that insult was added to injury when stillbirth was not included in the Madden report? In 2005 and 2004, ISANDS was inundated with calls from people who experienced additional suffering because of the organ retention scandal. Funding must be a priority. I would appreciate it if the T&aacute;naiste made every effort to assist these people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>ISANDS is more than aware of my support for it. The Madden report recommended the establishment of a working group to examine how its findings in respect of organ retention could be applied to stillborn children and adults. We are in the process of establishing this working <Col N="1225"/>group and will invite ISANDS to be a representative on it, which will be very important.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 133, 135, 140, 199 and 207 together.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to exploring fully the scope for the private sector to provide additional capacity in the health system. In this context, my Department issued a policy direction to the HSE last July aimed at freeing up additional beds in public hospitals for public patients. This will be achieved through the development of private hospitals on the sites of public hospitals and the transfer of private activity to those hospitals, thereby freeing up capacity for public patients in public hospitals.</P>
        <P>The initiative is expected to provide up to 1,000 additional beds for public patients over the next five years. It brings together different elements of Government policy in a coherent and practical way with the aim of increasing bed capacity for public patients, encouraging the participation of the private sector in generating extra capacity, maximising the potential use of public hospital sites, promoting efficiency among public and <Col N="1226"/>private acute service providers, promoting greater competition in the supply of hospital services and offering improved quality and choice to all patients.</P>
        <P>Attached to the policy direction was an assessment framework which the HSE has been requested to follow in respect of proposals to locate private hospital facilities on public hospital sites. It requires that the evaluation should have regard to a detailed assessment of need and existing and planned capacity on a particular site and within the relevant region. It should also provide for a rigorous value for money assessment of any proposal which would take account of the value of the public site and the cost of any tax expenditure. In addition, it will make clear the need for adherence to public procurement law and best practice.</P>
        <P>Since the publication of the policy document by my Department in 2005, the HSE has received expressions of interest from six major companies for the development of private hospitals co-located with public hospitals. Each company expressed an interest in more than one site. The HSE has ultimate responsibility for the implementation of this policy and I expect to see progress in this regard over the coming months. The chief executive officer of the HSE has stated to the Joint Committee on Health and Children that the Government&rsquo;s policy regarding private hospitals on public grounds has never been an issue for the HSE.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I take it that the HSE is responsible for implementing this plan. However, the proposals issued by the HSE in respect of the new consultants&rsquo; contract only mention public-only contracts. The T&aacute;naiste will find it difficult to square the circle if public-only contracts are the only contracts up for negotiation. The new private hospitals must be run by consultants who have either private-only contracts or public-private contracts. The fact that we could not get right for six months the tendering for the out-of-hours general practitioner service in north Dublin does not bode well for the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s plans for private hospitals. It does not bode well if consultants are to have public-only contracts and these private hospitals are to be supported by the HSE, which is very lukewarm about the proposal. How can the circle be squared?</P>
        <P>Is the HSE responsible for hiring consultants at the moment? Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al no longer exists. Who is responsible for approving and implementing consultant positions? Is it the responsibility of some official in the HSE or can the HSE simply appoint consultants as it suits it as soon as the consultants&rsquo; contracts have been renegotiated?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The HSE is responsible for hiring consultants and Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al has been subsumed into the HSE since the end of December last, which makes sense.</P><Col N="1227"/>
        <P>Consultants are currently contractors in the health care system and are not employees of the hospitals. We wish to move to them being employees. A public-only contract commits the individual to work on all patients that come into a specific hospital for a particular salary. There would be no incentive with regard to remuneration received for a doctor to take one patient over another, and this would be a desirable scenario.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>There are roughly 2,000 consultants at the moment. There are approximately 500 consultants in what is termed as category 2, which means they work on-site in public hospitals and off-site in other places. There are approximately 1,500 consultants in what is termed as category 1. These can carry out public and private work on one site. Very few do not have a private practice. It has been decided that no more category 2 consultants will be employed. Private hospitals must move to employing their own staff.</P>
        <P>There are 2,500 private beds in public hospitals, for which the hospitals get paid by insurers in any one year. One Dublin hospital only gets paid for approximately 20% of the beds, although 46% of the beds are used for private work. This is an incredible statistic at one level. The idea behind the hospital initiative is to remove private beds from the public hospital system and convert these to public beds for use by public patients. This is the reverse of how it is being presented in some quarters. The role of the HSE is to assess applications, and there have been six different expressions of interest. The HSE will shortly formally go to tender to receive expressions of interest.</P>
        <P>The HSE will have to consider whether needs are being served in a particular area. It may be the case that there is adequate private provision in a specific area and it may not make sense to create another private facility. It may also be that capacity is such in a public hospital that it would not make sense to have another facility co-located. In the context of a new contract, these hospitals may well supply services and occasionally supply staff to the public system, rather than the other way around, or the public system supplying private facilities with staff.</P>
        <P>We will be in transition for some time as the existing consultants&rsquo; contract has no review clause and is therefore a legally binding document for all consultants who have it until they retire. The timeframe is at least another 20 years or more depending on whether one takes the view of these consultants retiring at age 60 or 65. Our current cohort of consultants have a legally binding contract that entitles them to public and private practice, either on-site or off-site. This is the transitional arrangement we will have for the next 20 or 25 years, unless everybody opts for a new contract, which is unlikely despite being <Col N="1228"/>desirable. It would not be attractive enough for those who have a big private practice.</P>
        <P>We wish to see a new contract focused on patients not on whether patients will pay in public hospitals. We wish to see a review clause in the contract as it is not desirable to have a contract which is not subject to review at least every five years to ensure it is meeting the needs of the health care system. There is no difficulty in what is being put on the table for discussion. We need to employ, as I acknowledged earlier, more than 2,000 more consultants in the health care system over the coming years. We should employ them on the basis of a contract that serves the needs of the public health care system in a better fashion than the current contract arrangements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister accept that what she is doing is deepening the divide between public and private patients within the health service? This will surely raise questions for her with regard to entitlement. She must be aware that everybody in the country, including the Minister, is entitled to access public care. Is she being naive in thinking that by building private hospitals on public land, private patients will automatically go to the private hospital despite being entitled to go to a public hospital? Private patients will presumably continue to exercise this entitlement. Does the Minister intend to take away this entitlement from people with current health insurance? This would be a major action and the Minister should comment on it.</P>
        <P>With regard to capacity building in the public hospital sector, does the Minister recognise the financial loss in providing generous tax breaks to the private and for-profit sector? This is essentially a new player in the provision of Irish health services. A generous attitude is being taken by the Minister, as well as the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, in this regard. This is a loss to capacity building where it is needed most, in the public hospital sector.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister accept that the sector is not competitive? The Minister has the idea that these hospitals will compete, but there will not be competition between the two unless a system similar to that of the US is implemented. Private hospitals there must provide accident and emergency services. How can a public hospital compete with a private hospital when the public hospital is required to provide accident and emergency services and correctly does so for everyone, regardless of whether a patient has health insurance?</P>
        <P>I have a question regarding the loss to acute public hospitals. These are currently able to garner some of their income from private patients so will the shortfall be made up? How will the Minister prevent cherry-picking by the private hospital sector, which will be looking for profit? Profit and making money for investors will be the motive and nobody can complain about it. How will the Minister prevent a scenario where <Col N="1229"/>hospitals carry out many procedures that are not a high priority but are lucrative? Meanwhile, public patients will attempt to cope and access care in a public hospital sector that is deprived of necessary funding and incapable of competing with private hospitals that have tax breaks and do not have a requirement to provide accident and emergency services. There is not a level playing field, although this is an argument put forward by the Minister.</P>
        <P>The Minister should consider what she is doing because this is ultimately not the way to go. This process will create further division and inefficiencies with regard to value for money in the health service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy appears to misunderstand what is happening. Everybody is entitled to access our public hospital system and I wish to see that continue. However, I wish to see patients selected into a public hospital system on the basis of medical need, not on the basis of whether they have private health insurance. This is what currently happens. There are 2,500 private beds in the public hospital system. Of the workload of one Dublin hospital last year, 46% was elective work on private patients. Approximately 31% of the hospital&rsquo;s accident and emergency cases were private patients. This is not fair to the public hospital system.</P>
        <P>The public hospital system received approximately &euro;200 million from insurers in 2003, although work valued at &euro;581 million was carried out. This is not a good return. Private hospitals account for 40% of open heart surgery. I am not arguing that private hospitals are the panacea for all illnesses in the country. However, converting 1,000 private beds for use by public patients makes much sense from the perspective of the public patient. It does not make sense that some people can access the public hospital system more quickly than others.</P>
        <P>Everybody is equal in the accident and emergency area. This is because no extra fee is given to the consultant on the basis of whether a patient has health insurance. This is a bone of contention with accident and emergency consultants. However, we cannot have preferential treatment at accident and emergency level. Unfortunately, if anybody has a financial incentive in preferring one patient over another, it very often happens.</P>
        <P>To the best of my knowledge, in health care systems all over the world, including Sweden, one of the most socialised countries in Europe, many private operators have been brought in to run public hospitals.</P>
        <P>I can imagine the reaction I would get if I announced that here but that is what they have done. The Labour Government in the UK has announced and begun to implement a policy whereby 15% of all elective work will be done by private operators. Patricia Hewitt, in an interview with the <i>Financial Times </i>yesterday, said it was for reasons of efficiency, so there is a role for both <Col N="1230"/>approaches. We must ensure the public hospital system treats patients and is not obsessed with whether they have private health insurance or are in a position to pay more than others. I cannot conceive any way to make that happen as long as there is an incentive to take one patient in preference to another, which is what sometimes happens. It is not satisfactory and leads to cancellations, difficulties and unnecessary delays for too many public patients.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children famously said Ireland was closer to Boston than Berlin. Given the sheer inequity of the US health service why does she support the Americanisation of ours? Does she agree that a for-profit motive is at work in the US that leads to profit before people? Has she heard Dr. Risteard Mulcahy and Mr. Maurice Nelligan on the subject? They say that public patients are under-treated and private patients are often over-treated because money is involved. The gap will widen in such circumstances and it is not good for the patient. Have they got it wrong and misunderstood the T&aacute;naiste? Have we who agree with them also misunderstood the concept?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children aware that the Minister for Finance is unable to tell us the cost to date of tax relief for developers of private hospitals? In response to a parliamentary question last month he was unable to tell me the names and locations of hospital developments that have benefited. Is the T&aacute;naiste aware that the Minister for Finance, her colleague, confirmed that the criteria for qualification for these tax reliefs were based only on the capacity of each hospital and not on any assessment of public health need at local, regional or national level? Does the T&aacute;naiste not agree that the money spent on these reliefs would be far better employed in direct investment in our public health system? Does she not agree that these reliefs enrich those who are involved in private hospitals and such facilities for profit only? Does she not agree that fact and the fact that she perpetuates the system runs contrary to her statement of last month, when she said: &ldquo;The reality is that if you have private health insurance or can afford to pay you have speedier access to our health system and that is something I want to change&rdquo;? They are fine words but how is the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s approach achieving that?</P>

	<P>Every party supports tax relief for films and other things such as urban renewal which have all been worthy schemes that have achieved fantastic results. We do not, however, seem to be capable of supporting, through tax measures, sensible investment in the health care system. If we can attract investment into the health service through private financing we would be very foolish not to consider such opportunities. We should only support them if they suit a public hospital system because it would not be sustainable in every situation.</P>
        <P>At the moment private hospitals are emerging in various places completely outside the public hospital system. This is a measure whereby the public and private systems can work closely together to provide services for patients and the conversion of up to 1,000 private beds for use by public patients is just such a measure.</P>

    <Title>Leaders&rsquo; Questions.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Before I get into the substance of the question I ask that the Taoiseach dissociate himself from the remarks made by the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science with special responsibility for children yesterday evening when he alleged that Fine Gael was a racist party. I ask the Taoiseach to instruct him forthwith to withdraw that remark. It is not racist to ask legitimate questions about where taxpayers&rsquo; money goes, nor is it racist to point out that the Government has not done its sums and that the scheme announced by the Minister for Finance to help parents of all nationalities with the high cost of child care in Ireland now appears to be open to children not living in the country.</P>
      <P>On 7 December 2005 the Minister for Finance, in the Budget Statement, said &ldquo;the Government acknowledges the continuing cost pressures on parents, particularly those with young children&rdquo;. He then announced the early child care supplement of &euro;1,000 for every child under six. The costing of &euro;353 million was, he said, based on 350,000 children who are under six. In the Taoiseach&rsquo;s speech he said it constituted realistic and effective support for families and children facing the pressures of life in a modern dynamic economy. The Government does not have a great track record on budget day announcements, be it on pre-1953 pensions or the estimates for medical cards.</P>
      <P>It is clear, therefore, that the purpose of the early child care supplement is to help parents with the cost of child care in this country. Will the Taoiseach explain why the supplement will now be payable in respect of children who do not live in Ireland and whose parents do not, therefore, face the same high costs of child care? How does he explain to taxpayers in Ireland that part of what they pay in tax goes toward the cost of child care in other countries, when the clear intention of the measure was to be an early child care supplement to deal with child care costs in Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Under EU regulations migrants from EU member states working in Ireland whose dependent children are resident in their own country are entitled to claim child benefit here for children, either in full or as a top-up, if there is an equivalent payment but at a lower rate in their country of origin. That has been the position since 1971.</P>
      <P Just="Left"><?oasys _ic14- ?>This arrangement has been there for 36 years. Obviously, the numbers have been low over those years and this regulation is designed to facilitate people who wish to move to and work in different member states. We have had reciprocal arrangements here since 1 January <Col N="1233"/>1973 for a whole range of areas which have worked for the benefit of Irish people moving abroad, as happened in the 1970s and 1980s when the flows from this country were 30,000 to 40,000 per year. They were able to receive these benefits. To moan and groan because it has turned the other way, now that 2 million people are working here and people are coming to this labour market, is a bit sad. In the past, there were benefits for Irish people who emigrated to other EU countries with far more generous social welfare systems than ours. Recent benefit increases here, EU enlargement and net immigration have reversed the effects. Ireland has long benefited from these reciprocal arrangements and continues to do so. I mentioned earlier that, under EU regulations, the Irish health service benefited to the extent of &euro;420 million last year as a result of similar benefits for people now in Ireland, many of whom are returned emigrants.<?oasys _ic0- ?></P>
      <P>Our advice is that this reciprocal approach, which has existed since 1971, also applies to the early child care supplement. To do anything else on budget day would be to say that it was all right for that arrangement to apply in the case of child benefit, as it did for the past 36 years, but, because we are enhancing the position for our own people, we are in some way going to block that off. The figures for child benefit are about 1,800 and, for children, about 4,000 under-18s, one quarter of whom are under six. The additional money, in a budget of &euro;350 million, would be &euro;1 million. Are we to be real scrooges and change a 36 year-old regulation to save &euro;1 million in a calendar year? We did not do that but, if we did, there would be people in here calling me the biggest racist that ever was. Let us not have a lecture on this.</P>

	<P>Nobody will give the Taoiseach a lecture. I ask him again to dissociate himself from his Minister of State, who branded the Fine Gael Party racist yesterday evening, and request that he ask the Minister of State to withdraw his remark. If the Taoiseach wants any co-operation in this House, he ought to do that in his reply because I will not stand for that kind of allegation from him or any of his Ministers.</P>

	<P>It is beneath the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, in particular, to draw down a remark like that. It is not in keeping with his or his family&rsquo;s tradition and I ask the Taoiseach to end the matter in his reply.</P>
      <P>By calling this a top-up payment, the Government has landed in its current difficulties. Nobody is moaning and groaning and, as I said, it is not racist to ask a legitimate question about legitimate taxpayers&rsquo; money going towards the <Col N="1234"/>child care costs of children in other countries. The Taoiseach is now indicating that the Government has some discretion in this matter. If he had linked this to child care costs here, which was his intention, he could have done it by having a vouched system for bona fide child care facilities and their costs in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I understand it was claimed last night on the nine o&rsquo;clock news that 25% of the 100,000 Polish people resident here have children in Poland. What is the cost, in the Government&rsquo;s calculation, of that? Half an hour ago, the Taoiseach informed me that, in child benefit cases, we would be talking about fewer than 2,000. I do not know what figures his assumptions were based on in the first place. Can he tell me whether there is a figure at which a review of this would be triggered? Will that be 1,000, 2,000, 10,000 or 50,000 children living outside Ireland? If the Government has discretion, why does it not focus its resources on children of all nationalities living here, as distinct from what it has now done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>One does not have discretion in reciprocal arrangements but, in some cases, people administer their systems differently. As I said earlier, it is always good for us to know how people administer systems. Reciprocal arrangements are applied across Europe and regulation 1408/71 has been around for all those years.</P>
      <P>With regard to the figure, the Department of Social and Family Affairs states that currently there are about 1,800 child benefit claims, made in respect of approximately 4,000 children under the age of 18 by EU nationals with children resident in other member states. Assuming that one quarter of those children are under the age of six, the additional annual costs for such children will be approximately &euro;1 million. I would like to see what other countries do in reciprocal arrangements but in health, where we received &euro;400 million last year, we should not start to close off arrangements. Perhaps people will interpret it as being generous or assume we do not have these arrangements but we must remember that Irish people, under this very arrangement, were beneficiaries for many years.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kenny raised the issue of vouched arrangements. I do not think much of such arrangements, quite frankly. If I was the Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;I would re-think it. I will explain why. I went through these arrangements and discussions at great length last year and sat in on all the meetings. The Deputy&rsquo;s vouched arrangement would automatically exclude women in the home and that is not very bright.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should stay quiet; I have only two minutes. He had his opportunity at the weekend.</P>
      <P>A sum of &euro;500 million to National Toll Roads and a loss of revenue to the State estimated by DKM Consultants to be &euro;900 million between now and 2020 totals &euro;1.4 billion, which is the amount of money the Minister claims he will raise on the new tolls. The M50 is now a distributor road for Dublin. As well as this, the Secretary General of the Department of Transport informed the Committee of Public Accounts that 2,200 additional trucks will go on to the West Link bridge as soon as the port tunnel opens. This, she said, is the equivalent of 6,600 cars or the annual increase in the rate of traffic over the bridge.</P>
      <P>The Minister&rsquo;s solution after 2008 is to buy NTR out and open four new tolls. What will happen in the two years between now and 2008?</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>Why, for example, did the Minister not opt for an arrangement whereby one moves the toll plaza to a more appropriate site, introduces electronic, barrier-free tolling, for <Col N="1237"/>which there is no technological impediment, throws open the bridge in the six or nine months this would take to do and pays the rent to National Toll Roads?

	<P>I accept the Minister is constrained but even within those constraints he could have devised a deal that was in the better interests of the Irish taxpayers and motorists, on whom he now proposes to impose four new tolls for a distributor road. It is outrageous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>I advise the Minister to keep away from anything electronic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No decision has been made about any new toll road locations on the M50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>That is another change from yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been no change since yesterday or from last week. There is no such arrangement. The National Roads Authority has made a number of arrangements, one of which is to terminate the discussions with National Toll Roads relating to the upgrading of the West Link toll facility. It was considered that a satisfactory commercial and strategic solution that met the objectives of the NRA for the development and management of the M50 could not be achieved. The NRA has tried for some considerable time to come to an agreement with NTR but those discussions have failed and the authority will not continue with them. The reason is that the NRA believes it would infringe on national and EU procurement rules and a number of other arrangements.</P>
      <P>On the zero rate of the West Link toll from mid-2008 and compensation for NTR in accordance with the West Link agreement, which stands until 2020, it is the view of the NRA that the process will take about two years. First, it will carry out the strategic management examination of traffic flow on the M50, which, subject to my memory being correct, will be finished towards the end of this year, in October or November. Then it will invite tenders for electronic tolling on the M50 to replace the plaza arrangement in place and bring the tolling more into line with what is in other countries by using what is known as the Hong Kong model. Hong Kong was the first place to introduce electronic tolling, which is far more efficient. The NRA will invite tenders for the design, building and operation of a multi-point, free flow, barrier-free toll regime on the M50.</P><Col N="1238"/>
      <P>Any decisions are subject to two conditions: the carrying out of the full examination of traffic flow on the road and an examination of the kind of new arrangements that could be put in place. The NRA will have to come back to Government on this. I am not too sure when it will do so but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>After 2007, I would say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;no decision made on those issues and no scheme has been presented.</P>
      <P>Yesterday saw the beginning of the upgrade of the M50, which is a phased project involving about &euro;1 billion. The first phase will cost approximately &euro;250 million. By the commencement of the second phase, we would like to see the toll plaza replaced by electronic tolling. In fact, we would like to see that done more quickly. I am not sufficiently technically knowledgeable in this area to know why it takes the period stated but that is the view of the experts. I and the Ministers must accept their advice that it will take two years.</P>
      <P>Obviously, all the other issues in Transport 21 will come into play over a period. There is a problem in the interregnum and there is no doubt about that. However, discussions are ongoing about the traffic plan that will have to be completed over the next few months and about how quickly alternative arrangements can be put in place. No decision has been made by the Minister or the NRA&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>It will not be made until after the general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it will come up for discussion in October when the traffic flow&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Which October?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>What are the alternatives?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will have to wait to see the alternatives when the traffic flow plan is completed, which was part of the original Bord Plean&aacute;la decision. One of the conditions was that the NRA would have to produce a traffic plan and present it to the Department and the Minister. The Government would then have to make a decision but we cannot do so until we see the comprehensive traffic plan, which is due to be finished in October or November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know whether that leaves the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, hanging on one of his virtual gantries and the Taoiseach is backing off or whether the Taoiseach is, as usual, playing with language. What he actually said was that no decision has been taken about the location of new tolls. I have been raising this question, as have other col<Col N="1239"/>leagues in this House, for more than five years and now the Taoiseach informs me that although the Minister went on television on Friday night and his staff briefed all the newspapers for Saturday, no decision has been made. What exactly is going on? Why would one need to embark on a new traffic study if one was not planning new tolls? Does any Minister in the Cabinet need to be told about the traffic congestion on the M50? The Government proposes to impose three or four new tolls on that congested road. This is absolutely daft.</P>
      <P>Where does the Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement about the NRA pulling out of the negotiations leave us, having regard to the watertight contract NTR appears to have? Where do we proceed from here? What about the two years when the initial refurbishment takes place and the grade separations are installed? The situation will get immensely worse as a result of the traffic coming out of the port tunnel and the Taoiseach says that there is no immediate prospect of any alleviation for the long-suffering motorist. As I understand it, far from the Government being involved in detailed discussions about the future, it was only after the row at the Committee of Public Accounts that there was any serious engagement on the side of the State, either from the Department or the National Roads Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is rubbish. It is nonsense. The Deputy&rsquo;s party is calling on me to man-manage the project while the Deputy is saying something entirely different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is speaking out of both sides of his mouth at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a solution. There is nothing new about barrier-free tolling. There is nothing impossible about electronic tolling&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Except that we have a contract we must honour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will have to ask the Minister to allow Deputy Rabbitte to conclude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government could construct a proper plaza at a more appropriate point, maintain the income stream to the State and avoid imposing new tolls on motorists. This puts electronic voting, PPARS and all the rest in the shade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>In the shade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Taoiseach will deny &mdash; and I give him the opportunity to do so again &mdash; that he approves this hare-brained, daft, unworkable and punitive arrangement devised by the Minister, Deputy Cullen.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1240"/>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte is twisting the facts completely. That was a typical Labour Party attempt&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should not take it out on others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach, without interruption please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In the remaining minute, I will try to answer some of the issues. Deputy Rabbitte asked if decisions were made and if I sanctioned them. Decisions were not made except on the issues I raised. Deputy Rabbitte asked if a decision was made to put multi-tolling on numerous points on the M50 and the answer is no.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Why did the Taoiseach brief the newspapers on it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not announced. On completion of the NRA&rsquo;s toll demand management study, which it must complete under the arrangement and which is expected in October or November, the NRA will submit specific proposals for the future tolling of the M50 to the Minister. It is not envisaged that we will eliminate tolling on the M50. There will be proper public consultation and involvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the opposite of what the Minister told us. The Taoiseach should send him off with Ivor Callely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>While the NRA may implement tolling schemes on a statutory basis, the agency fully accepts that to make policy decisions of this significant type, when it has completed the demand-led study, it must come back and decisions will then be made. It has stated that it has terminated discussions in which it has tried for a long period to get an agreement with NTR. It has failed to do that because of infringement on national and EU procurement rules. It has also decided that the zero rate of the Westlink road from two years time will end and it will have to compensate NTR in accordance with the Westlink agreement that runs to 2020. I hope that is clear.</P>
      <P>The other decision made is that we will go ahead with the upgrade work, which will help the road, along with the Naas Road work and the other issues that have been undertaken. Almost &euro;1 billion of work will be undertaken and a revenue stream will be necessary for the second phase from a toll. We cannot just eliminate a toll road. If it could be done faster I would want to see that.</P>
      <P>I accept Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s point that this has been tried and tested in other countries. I have seen it, it is known as the Hong Kong model, where the user receives a bill like a telephone bill from a technological recording. Apparently, however, there is a period required to do that and <Col N="1241"/>while they negotiate under the 2020 agreement, that is the position. I am sure the Minister will have more time to outline it in more detail another day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for big tolls and small tunnels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach just does not get it. The agony of the M50 cannot go on as at present for another two years. If a warlord in the Hindukush controlled a vital pass and fleeced the unfortunate peasants who had to pass through it every day for their livelihood, some people would say, &ldquo;That is Afghanistan; it is the dark ages&rdquo;. Does it not defy belief that in the capital city of the Ireland of 2006, every day tens of thousands of working people making their way to work are held to ransom because they have to cross the River Liffey, control of which has been given to a private company? Many working people with no public transport options sit unnecessarily in cars for two hours a day every day just to get to work. To illustrate that with a simple calculation, if that went on for 20 years, they would spend an entire year and a month camped on the M50. Put another way, that is the equivalent of three years and three months working an eight hour day. We have 700 metres of privately owned road and a bridge with 40 kilometres of a super highway on either side of it financed to the tune of &euro;1 billion by the taxpayer that acts to funnel the same taxpayers, tens of thousands of them, into the jaws of National Toll Roads to be robbed every day. The Taoiseach is proposing to extend this medieval anachronism, which jails thousands of people daily and fines them at the same time, for another two years.</P>
      <P>My research showed that the first we heard of tolls was in Greek mythology. There was a boatman called Charon who charged a penny to ferry the shades of the dead across the River Acheron so they could get to the afterlife. That gentleman could tout for business on the Westlink because by the time the unfortunate motorists reach the bridge, they resemble the shades of the dead in every way from frustration, anger and exhaustion.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the constraints put on the Government by the manoeuvrings of dubious politicians and bureaucrats in a previous period. It is time to nationalise the M50 and to get this anachronism off the backs of working people, not just for Dublin but for the whole country, and to do it immediately. Let us get rid of this incredible farce. The Taoiseach just does not understand what working people must endure on a daily basis just to get to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am well aware of the problems of the M50 and the history of it. As Deputy Joe Higgins knows, when we used to follow other economic policies, we did not have to worry about the traffic on the M50 because of the policies he supported at that time.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1242"/>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>Those are the Taoiseach&rsquo;s socialist policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The concern at the time was that we would not get sufficient flows of traffic to justify the road. There is an agreement in place. It is simple for Deputy Higgins to suggest scrapping it but there is an agreement until 2020. Satisfactory arrangements between the NRA and NTR cannot be reached. For that reason the NRA says it will take control of the situation but it must honour the agreement with NTR. It has been suggested even when the NRA is taken out of the equation and electronic tolling is introduced, with the upgrade of the work that will go on until 2010 costing &euro;1 billion, NTR will have to be paid &euro;45 million per year. NTR disputes that figure, saying it should be far higher. That is an issue the NRA and NTR will have to sort out in due course but it must be done in an ordered way.</P>
      <P>There is a contractual agreement and the NRA is now saying it cannot reach an agreement with NTR and is now taking it out of the equation. It will move the plaza and tender for a replacement arrangement that will introduce free flow electronic tolling on the M50. It will carry out a traffic study between now and the end of the year, get on with the upgrade, which started with phase one yesterday, and we will see if the new operator the NRA will bring in will help the position.</P>
      <P>Deputy Joe Higgins knows well that removing the plaza and introducing electronic free flow is not the only resolution, there are the other changes. When it was built they were talking about 700,000 registered cars in the State and we are now talking about 2.1 million. The population has increased by 1 million in 15 years. That must be taken into account. The removal of the plaza and free flow electronic tolling will not resolve that. Already there are plans looking beyond that to the orbital route and other issues. We must complete the Naas Road, which is now well advanced and ahead of schedule. We must deal with the tunnel opening, the extension of the M50 and the compensation of NTR under the arrangements for removing it from the equation. These issues have been set out.</P>
      <P>In response to the issue raised by Deputy Rabbitte, a fair question about what happens on the locations of the tolling in future, that decision cannot be made until the comprehensive report is presented in the autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Taoiseach wants to talk about policies that are redundant, he should talk about tolling. While it was okay over London Bridge with an ass and cart in medieval times, it is hardly appropriate for Dublin in 2006. The revenue could easily have been found elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>We could print the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government slashed capital gains tax for speculators, saving them billions, <Col N="1243"/>and slashed corporation tax for big business but has saddled working people who must use the M50 with this new tax. All over the country it is noticeable that it is the commuter belts that are being hit, in other words, working people travelling to and from work.</P>
      <P>In his previous role the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, brazenly wasted &euro;50 million on scrapped voting machines and we have major wastage on many infrastructural projects. The Dublin Port tunnel, for example, will be delivered late and may run &euro;200 million over budget. We suggested to Deputy Finian McGrath who acts on this issue on behalf of his constituents that the next time he inspects the port tunnel he will probably have to wear a scuba diving rig-out. Despite this, the Government brazenly insists it cannot remove this anachronism.</P>
      <P>I remind the Taoiseach that even Ireland&rsquo;s conservative Constitution states that private ownership should be curtailed by the common good. If there was ever an example of such curtailment being required in the common good, it is the need to remove forthwith the barriers over the river to bring considerable relief to tens of thousands of hard-pressed people on a daily basis. This measure would not, by any means, be the answer to all the problems as these require massive public transport infrastructural investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason for the proposal is to try, over the next few years, to increase by 50% the capacity of the M50 and remove the toll plaza without getting rid of tolling, without which we would not be able to complete the kind of investment we require. We already spend much more than the European average on infrastructure. This year, we will spend &euro;1.6 billion on main roads and approximately &euro;750 million on secondary roads. We cannot catch up and make these levels of investment, while also putting in a metro orbital route around Dublin and all the other transport initiatives, by having them funded exclusively by the taxpayer. Countries which were much wealthier than Ireland in the past have toll regimes. We must upgrade and enhance the M50, spend &euro;1 billion on the new phases and bring in the best technology possible. The National Roads Authority will go to tender for the best arrangements and we will, I hope, see some best international practice on the roads. The NRA has made the decision to remove the toll plaza but one cannot do so overnight. It is in a contractual arrangement until 2020 but has indicated the plaza will be removed in two years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am just explaining the factual and legal position with which I am trying to deal, namely, a contractual arrangement made in good faith. As I indicated, I would like the toll plaza to be removed quicker and do not understand the reason it will take two years to do so. We will try to proceed quickly. The first phase will involve completing the study by October. If a new freeflow electronic arrangement goes to tender, the position will improve and there is no argument about that. I am setting out the position.</P>

I am not aware of any difficulties or problems with the legislation which will be taken on Second Stage on Thursday. I am told the legislation on nursing homes is extremely complex because it goes back over many old Acts and areas. However, it is still hoped to have it before the House during this session, probably in March. It is hoped to have the legislation passed and the payments processed this summer.

The second promised Bill relates to the urgent matter of our European neighbours&rsquo; attitude to bird flu, where they are searching people coming into airports and ports for food. The animal health Bill would suggest a level of urgency about this matter, but there is no publication date for that Bill.

On 25 January I was informed that signing and ratifying the convention was under review. Does the Government propose to sign and ratify the convention? On today&rsquo;s Order Paper, pages 73 and 75, two agreements are listed, one as No. 1 in the statutory section and the second as No. 1 in the non-statutory section. If both agreements are administrative and legal, as was suggested to me some weeks ago, why is the first one in the statutory category, which seems to suggest there was a legal requirement to publish it and bring it before the House?

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to focus on three aspects of the Bill, namely, digital mapping, compulsory registration and how easement might be used to deal with the land grabbing that is occurring.</P>
      <P>The more mystique that surrounds the issue of property transfer and ownership, the greater control professional practitioners have. Simplifying the registration process must be welcomed. The use of a digital mapping system to advance the electronic conveyancing system is an important component of the Bill. It will hopefully reduce the need to visit personally the Land Registry Office and speed up the legal system around conveyancing, making it more efficient and less costly. Digital mapping is being used by many local authority planning departments, but it can be applied to many other functions as well. It is a very user-friendly system.</P>
      <P>Having the capacity to map a property is one issue, but if the ownership is not registered, information will simply not be available to have complete records. In a document it published on the issue, the Law Reform Commission stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">Arguably that ultimate aim has been in contemplation at least since the Land Registry was established by the Local Registration of Title (Ireland) Act 1891 ... The 1891 Act was replaced by the Registration of Title Act 1964, and this enshrined the ultimate aim by including specific provisions for extension of the system of compulsory registration, by designating any county or county boroughs as a &ldquo;compulsory registration area&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The Law Reform Commission informs us that over 30 years later, only three counties have such status. It states:</P>
      <P LI="1">Notwithstanding the considerable progress which has been made in recent years in com<Col N="1252"/>puterising the Registry of Deeds records, the fact remains that the system remains governed by the original 1707 Act and later amending Acts ... The case for updating the system remains unanswerable.</P>
      <P FLI="0">What difference will the Bill make to the compulsory registration of title? Section 10 seems less than explicit, seeking to promote and extend the registration. The word &ldquo;promote&rdquo; is used, rather than &ldquo;compulsory&rdquo;. Section 53 specifies the timeframe for registration where compulsory registration applies. The location where it does not apply should, therefore, be the focus of our concern. In this respect the Bill is very disappointing. There was an opportunity to do something much more substantial. We do not need a piece of academic legislation but rather legislation with some definite practical application. With regard to compulsory registration, the Bill achieves very little.</P>
      <P>Section 57 amends the 1964 Act to widen the powers conferred by that section to include the granting of lease or easement in respect of property. I want to draw attention to a problem that is occurring where the easement might be sought. Until the 1990s, many local authorities took over housing estates but did not take ownership of the public open spaces. If one goes into the Land Registry Office and checks out estates that are very mature, one will find that the original developer is registered as the owner. The open space was a planning requirement under the Planning and Development Act 1963 and planning permission for the houses would not have been granted without a mandatory open space requirement being fulfilled. The problem is that the land is still registered with the original developer and increasingly, the greedy developers return in an attempt to confiscate the land for the purpose of further development, arguing that higher densities are now allowed. Residents&rsquo; groups are rightly outraged. Original house purchasers going back 20 or 30 years had understood, from the promotional brochures and from the conditions of the planning permission, that the land was part of the overall development. They have every right to feel very angry with what is occurring. In most cases, the residents maintain the housing estates themselves. They invest in grass cutting machines, they plant flower-beds, erect signs and so on, yet then they discover a notice at the end of the road stating that an application has gone into the local authority to build an apartment block or a car park or extra houses on the open space in their housing estate.</P>
      <P>The open space was designed as an amenity. The only way to establish formally that amenity at this stage is an easement. Section 10 of the Bill suggests that a new authority may undertake research projects relating to the registration of land. The problem I have outlined needs urgent attention. This might prove a useful area for some of the research, instead of having courts clogged <Col N="1253"/>up by cases from resident groups which are forced to take action. This is a matter not confined to one county. I understand that many counties are experiencing a similar problem.</P>
      <P>The property registration authority will have a co-ordinating role and that is to be welcomed. The fact that matters are to be simplified is welcome, especially the digital mapping. There are flaws in the Bill, but perhaps these can be amended on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>

	<P>Galway West is a lovely place to visit. I am happier in Tallaght, however.</P>
      <P>My first reaction on reading through this Bill was to think of that famous scene in the movie, &ldquo;Chinatown&rdquo;, where the private detective played by Jack Nicholson is in the Los Angeles hall of records investigating bogus land deals. He rips out the page of a registry of land sale transaction. I am not suggesting that such deeds occur in this jurisdiction, but it is an interesting point. The Bill will remove the possibility of anyone in this country emulating Jack Nicholson in the future.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides a statutory basis for the registration of titles and deeds on computer in the Registry of Deeds and the Land Registry. It also provides for an electronic mapping system as part of the process of introducing an electronic conveyancing system. It is interesting to note that this involves the repeal of legislation dating back, in some cases, to 1707. It is also interesting to note that a primary objective of the 1707 Act was the prevention of forgeries. That certainly puts a different light on the term &ldquo;the good old days&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>When most of us reflect on areas such as the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds in the early 18th century, it conjures up clerks in wigs sitting on three-legged stools making entries in musty leather-bound ledgers with quill pens. Much of the activity in this area still reminds of us of those far-off days. It is good to see, therefore, that his Bill provides for the movement of the key areas of registration of deeds and title into the 21st century. Now it will be possible for the definition of a deed to include a reference to information stored in electronic form or, as it is also described, a non-legible form. This is capable of being converted into a legible form. This should greatly facilitate officials and members of the public in searches for records kept by the registry and more immediate access to records through electronic means.</P>
      <P>Electronic registration and storage of information in regard to the Registry of Deeds and the Land Registry will help to make the process easier and faster, and consequently more econ<Col N="1254"/>omical. Not many people could read or write in 1707, not even those who could afford to buy land and property. Those who could draft deeds and entries in leather-bound ledgers were looked on as whizz-kids in their day. We have to move with the times and the electronic storage and retrieval of information is the way we are going. The computer is today&rsquo;s ledger and the computer mouse is today&rsquo;s quill pen.</P>
      <P>I speak as someone who has always been brave enough to admit that in terms of modern technology I am still a child of the past. However, I am doing my best. I often get queries about Land Registry issues and matters that relate to this legislation, although not every week. In a busy urban constituency office and clinic, one deals with all types of problems, not many of which relate to this matter the House has in hand. However, I get sufficient queries in this area to appreciate that there is a need for modernisation. It is good that we are looking at this issue and I wish the Minister of State well in that regard.</P>
      <P>Effective and efficient property regulation structures and systems are essential requirements for a successful economy. Even those who want to be in government and have to battle on for another 500 days will know that the economy is thriving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Where is the evidence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>People are working and the economic climate is good &mdash; even Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe knows that. I will take him on some other day when I do not have a cold. It will be a long, hard 500 days and I am fit and well for the battle. I hope the Deputy can keep up with it.</P>
      <P>Registration of ownership of land confirms and underpins the owner&rsquo;s right to use and enjoy it. It is necessary, for example, to demonstrate good title to sell or transfer land, whether the owner is trading up or whatever. That is important, irrespective or whether the owner is a private individual or a business enterprise.</P>
      <P>Having good title to land allows an owner to make use of the assets to borrow funds, which, in the case of a company, may be needed to launch or expand a business enterprise or diversify into another area of commercial activity. In the case of private individuals remortgaging may be undertaken to extend the home or assist a family member in gaining a foothold on the property ladder. Looked at from that perspective, it is clear that effective land registration should have the capacity to contribute in a meaningful way to enterprise and economic activity.</P>
      <P>Efficient registration systems, that is, those in which procedures are straightforward, delays are avoided and costs are kept to a minimum, also have the capacity to enhance national competitiveness by making the country a more attractive investment location within the international community. It is interesting that the World Bank again drew attention recently to the need for <Col N="1255"/>sound property registration systems as a means of improving the economic climate and enhancing business activity. The mains aim of the Bill is to restructure and modernise land registration structures in the State, update and streamline the law relating to registration deeds and reform the law relating to the registration of title to land.</P>
      <P>The new property registration authority will be a statutory body with a representative board along the lines of the existing Courts Service. I am glad to note that the Minister&rsquo;s intention is that the composition of the new authority will bring stakeholder expertise to bear in the discharge of its functions. I understand that the new structure is intended to facilitate stakeholder involvement in the strategic management and modernisation of registry services, provide channels of knowledge and, indeed, feedback from the conveyancing and property sectors, leading to increased responsiveness to customer needs, which is very important, and ensuring quality customer services. It will make commercial and business expertise available to the new authority to ensure cost effectiveness in the provision of services. It is also intended to facilitate staff representation to ensure staff participation in the management of change within the new organisation, while increasing the visibility and profile of the property registration services.</P>
      <P>While there will always be criticism of this business, it is good that we are modernising the system and dealing appropriately with the Registration of Deeds and Title Bill. I wish the Minister well in that regard and I look forward to supporting the Bill. I am happy to concede to my colleague, Deputy Fiona O&rsquo;Malley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this Bill. It tidies and updates our legislation, which is always important. A matter which might arise on Committee Stage is that it is becoming increasingly obvious that local authorities have not secured title to particular pieces of land. What provisions are in the Bill to secure such titles, which everybody for many years, including the local authorities, assumed were vested in the local authorities? There is an ongoing case in Leopardstown in my constituency. More recently a similar type of issue arose in Dublin city centre with regard to Dartmouth Square, although I am not sure if the circumstances are the same.</P>
      <P>In Leopardstown and throughout the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown local authority area there are many sites where title was not secured. How can we streamline matters for local authorities, in the public interest, to ensure that lands intended to be ceded were, in fact, ceded? Will there be an opportunity to discuss this on Committee Stage? I was anxious to mention this matter on Second Stage so we might be able to deal with it on Committee Stage. I am grateful for the opportunity to do so.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1256"/>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill is welcome, partly because of the need to upgrade administration but also because the availability of technology requires legislation such as this. If I have a criticism of the Government&rsquo;s policy in this area it is that it has chosen, once again, to opt for a narrow reform rather than for wider reform of the legislation regarding property. Last Tuesday, in the National Library, the Taoiseach launched the tenth report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. What happened to the ninth report of that committee? That was launched with great fanfare a number of years ago but we have not seen a single legislative proposal from the Government to enact any of its recommendations.</P>
      <P>There has been a gradual improvement in all aspects of the registration of land and public access to information on same. However, it remains an imperfect practice. The current Land Registry based in Waterford was an early example of the Government&rsquo;s so-called decentralisation programme but all it did was make it difficult for people in the rest of the country to access information that would have been available in Dublin. It was just located to a new centre. I hope the new body being established under this Bill will not suffer from the same geographical problems but will increase the amount of information that might be available to the public.</P>
      <P>Other contributors to this debate have mentioned that we could have used the Bill to strengthen the Derelict Sites Act, which gives local authorities some powers, after a great deal of time and searching for the owners of derelict properties, to acquire title to such sites. However, we should go further. If an owner does not become available within a set time period, such properties should automatically be vested in the local authority. This would apply to properties which are obviously derelict, regardless of whether they are built upon, and have the effect of downgrading a local community.</P>
      <P>Such legislation should exist. It exists in the United States where an investigation regarding the rights and responsibilities of property owners can be instigated not so much by a local or state authority or the national government but by individual members of the public. Why are we not legislating to provide that members of the public can get information on who owns and is responsible for a particular property in their community, particularly if that property is a building that is not structurally sound or is a vacant site which has been allowed to become littered and a stain on the area? On these grounds we can go much further in terms of the law on property. I am disappointed the Government and the Minister appear to have made no effort to act upon the recommendations in the ninth report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution and, given the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme, there is little likelihood that such legislation will be in place by the next general election.</P><Col N="1257"/>
      <P>Given the opportunity presented by this new organisation and technology that will allow the identification of property to become easier, there should be standardisation of property leases. Attempts have been made in the past to do this through Private Members&rsquo; legislation. The lease on my house, as is the case for most people here, is written in very arcane language. It refers to the property being located in the geographical area identified by the local parish, which was the parish of the established church, the Church of Ireland. There is an inconsistency, first, in the language used in leases, which should be a little more user friendly and, second, in the geographical terms by which property is identified. This Bill could have been an opportunity to address this. Perhaps the new organisation, when it is up and running will put such changes into effect.</P>
      <P>Last night I attended a meeting in the town of Ballincollig in my constituency, although it will no longer be part of my constituency at the next election due to boundary changes. That meeting highlighted a particular difficulty regarding State ownership of property and the transfer of such property to community interests. The meeting was organised by the Ballincollig soccer club which had been promised four years ago, by the then Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, that it would be given an area of ground for sports and amenity purposes as part of the development resulting from the sale of Murphy Barracks in Ballincollig.</P>
      <P>Most of the ground was to be made available on the open market to commercial interests. The land was subsequently sold and has been developed but the amenity area is still undeveloped. There is now a landlocked section of property which cannot be accessed because the planning authority made a mess of how access was to be provided. The biggest problem, however, is the question of the title. I understand this issue is currently being dealt with by the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office and I hope it comes to a proper conclusion.</P>
      <P>What I and the attendance at the meeting last night find frustrating is how, in transferring State property to these interests, such a double standard applied. Why were the commercial interests, so obviously and quickly looked after? Why were the community interests treated so shoddily? Many of the difficulties brought up regarding title are used as unnecessary obstacles but these obstacles seem to be easily overcome when commercial development is involved. It is a double standard that State agencies should no longer apply.</P>
      <P>The Green Party will not oppose this legislation. We believe it is necessary. However, perhaps the Minister will address the need for wider ranging legislation on property and property rights, the need to develop, in the public interest, properties and pieces of land of which the current owners are not making proper use and the need for mechanisms to allow State authorities, particularly local authorities, to secure the better use of <Col N="1258"/>such property. Representing a largely urban constituency, I can identify many such properties which current legislation does not allow the local authority to acquire and develop as quickly as is necessary. This legislation might have been an opportunity to push that agenda a little further. If the new agency uses the powers being conferred on it in terms of defining property and improving the availability of information on property, that is a good thing. There is much further to travel in terms of legislation that better meets the needs of our community and individual citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the introduction of this long overdue legislation. Review and reform of the system of registration of title is badly needed. Conveyancing and land and property law here are complex and archaic. It is important that our systems are brought up to date in a coherent manner.</P>
      <P>According to the Minister, the programme of reform has three stated aims. It proposes to simplify the law in this verbose and confusing area and to make it more easily understandable to both legal practitioners and the public. It also proposes to update the law in this area in the light of changes in social demographic and economic needs and to make conveyancing easier and faster, thereby reducing the sometimes enormous costs associated with the legal service. I hope the Minister succeeds in this, that the process will be easier to understand and that costs of procedures will be reduced.</P>
      <P>The legislation will benefit many people, in particular young people trying to buy their first home or new house. They are well acquainted with the substantial costs associated with such a move, not least of which are solicitors&rsquo; and professional fees. Measured on the recommended scale, these fees are 1% of the total price plus &euro;100. The main outlays are stamp duty, Land Registry fees and fees for searches. However, there is also normally a charge for miscellaneous outlays such as telephone, posters and photocopying. It is important people are treated fairly in this area and I welcome controls that will facilitate this. There is enough pressure on young people today without adding more through the current outdated and complicated system which places a heavy burden on them in terms of cost and time.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill for electronic conveyancing as the conveyancing process is unduly costly and time consuming. Conveyancing practice is, undoubtedly, protected and evidence suggests that it takes a great deal longer than it should or does in other European countries. The one to two-month period involved in the process of buying a house in this country should be reduced and I welcome any measures that bring new efficiency to the process to bring it in line with our counterparts in Europe, <Col N="1259"/>especially in this age of technology and instant monetary transfers.</P>
      <P>Up to now, solicitors have had a monopoly in conveyancing. Our cumbersome legislation added to their ability to retain that monopoly. It also allowed them to stall and delay in order to charge higher fees, or perhaps this was general incompetence. These delays served to place additional burdens on members of the public who were, for the most part, unable to do anything to speed up the process. Solicitors must realise that their survival may depend on whether they modernise and become more responsible and accessible to a more demanding public. Many firms depend on conveyancing and it forms a significant element of their business.</P>
      <P>As the Land Registry becomes more effective in marketing its on-line service, legislation is amended to simplify transactions and becomes more understandable, and consumers become more familiar with on-line transactions, the demand for solicitors will lessen unless they modernise, change their attitude and realise that if they cannot provide a more professional efficient service, consumers will work around them. If they continue as they are, the logjam in the registration system will remain, at least in the short term.</P>
      <P>I have some reservations about the Bill and the process of its implementation. Will the Minister indicate how this legislation, if passed, will progress as there appears to be little or no funding in place to progress it? There is not much sense in passing a Bill and not providing funding to operate it. This will be expensive legislation. How will we compulsorily register all land in the country currently not registered unless staff and a proper registration authority are in place in every county? We can talk forever about electronic conveyancing, but if land is not registered, we have no land to convey through electronic conveyancing. The starting point is registration. How can we get the land registered if we do not provide extra staff? Without them the authority will exist as a quango and will not get the work done. It is important the Minister takes on the task of seeing this legislation through to implementation and that he does not allow it to sit on some shelf gathering dust.</P>
      <P>I compliment the staff of the Land Registry office. Complex deals that take up considerable time pass through that office and something should be done in this regard, particularly where land is held by different owners. When all but one of the owners have passed away, there should be a provision in place to ensure that owner can acquire the property more quickly. That is not happening and I ask the Minister to examine that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this important and long overdue legislation. Many of the procedures involved are archaic. I wish to address this issue <Col N="1260"/>from the point of view of modern needs and as a person with a special interest in history. It is obvious we need an efficient and less cumbersome form of legislation.</P>
      <P>In light of the amount of business currently being transacted, one does not need props to support solicitors&rsquo; earnings. If we want to be competitive in the modern world, we must find more efficient ways of dealing with these issues. I look forward to the other pieces of the jigsaw such as the electronic conveyancing referred to by Deputy James Breen and promised in this legislation.</P>
      <P>Our Land Registry deeds are an historical treasure trove in terms of our social history. They are a bit like the Land Commission records which are not yet generally accessible. These documents can be used to illuminate political and social history. As we move into the electronic age, it is important that these ancient deeds are properly preserved and made accessible. It would be a long-term project to have these documents recorded in electronic form so that they can be more easily consulted, but this is something to which we should aspire. The Minister and his officials are focused on the needs of a modern economy, and rightly so. However, I urge him to ensure that the heritage aspects are properly scrutinised and looked after.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill because it is a decisive step to take the legislation into the 21st century and it will make information more accessible to citizens, especially with regard to Government matters. The administration of the Land Registry should be as simple as possible given the importance of property and land. It is something that has been difficult over the years, which may be understandable. It is difficult because it is a paper-based system. This is the ideal opportunity to move from that system to a new one. It must be difficult to transfer property unless we use technology or some other expensive system. What the Minister has promised to do will make the conveyancing of property much less expensive, as long as we negotiate with lawyers and others who have made the process costly.</P>
      <P>The Land Registry is an important element of this State. It was established in 1707 and my experience of dealing with it as a public representative has been positive. It is efficient, effective and thorough. There is no point in speeding up a process while overlooking the fact that somebody has a legal right to a property. The process is detailed and important because property is valuable. An example of a case I dealt with involved a lady who bought a house from her brother-in-law, who was not registered with the Land Registry. The people from whom her brother-in-law bought the property were not registered, nor were the people from whom they bought it. The whole chain of unregistered ownership extended back to 1934. To have the issue resolved, the woman must ascertain whether all the people who benefited from that land still have a claim on <Col N="1261"/>it. It is a very detailed process and people do not understand its importance.</P>
      <P>In other recent cases with which I dealt, I found the Registrar of Titles to be most helpful. Like Deputy James Breen, I get in touch with the Land Registry on behalf of constituents and I find that the staff are very helpful, co-operative, efficient and fast. If one goes into the office, one can get a map quickly and the courteous and helpful staff will assist with the identification of the property concerned.</P>
      <P>The office is an open-plan office, not a box in a corner of the room. It is a client-based, user-friendly service. When the new facilities are provided, it will be important to have similar facilities in Roscommon when the new building is opened there.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, for whom I have great admiration and who is a very efficient Minister, has a great grasp of the legal needs of his Department and I thank him for introducing this important legislation.</P>
      <P>Property is now very valuable and the question of church property is also important because it is no longer exempt. Many old church properties, in particular those of the Church of Ireland with their small cemeteries, have been left without real ownership. The proper registration and acquisition of titles by local authorities is important. However, there is still much to be done. One must still physically send title deeds to the Land Registry. One can do so by post although I know many prefer to go into the office. That is how the Irish like to do their business. When they go into the office, people know the deeds will arrive on the day and they can get a dealing number there and then. We must aim for the type of scenario envisaged by the Minister. Ultimately, one should be able to transfer property and send one&rsquo;s deed to the Land Registry electronically.</P>
      <P>The investment the Minister has made with regard to digital mapping is very welcome. Currently, it takes a long time to have transactions registered and there are often delays in terms of mapping. Hopefully the digital mapping initiative will improve matters. South Dublin County Council, for example, made its services available electronically although this initially seemed difficult. It put its entire planning application system on-line so that one can look up every plan, map and specification. The council achieved this within a very short period and I compliment it on its initiative. Before this, one had to go to the planning counter in South Dublin County Council to get maps, the office was only open during certain hours and the whole process took much time. The service is now available on the Internet. This type of initiative is needed with regard to the Land Registry in that one should be able to do everything on-line. It would improve our system of conveyancing and put an end to complaints regarding long delays, searches and so forth.</P><Col N="1262"/>
      <P>The main gap in the legislation relates to the encouragement of first registration. I like the idea that the title is tidied up, registered with the Land Registry and is very clear and certain. I realise that solicitors find the system of first registration very daunting and therefore do not use it. They will go to the Registry of Deeds instead although first registration is much cheaper. The Land Registry could take measures in this regard. Searches can be daunting and if one gets them wrong, one must start all over again and go through the whole process. Verified searches are also required. They are not required for other transactions and are costly and cumbersome.</P>
      <P>The Land Registry must examine what it requires with regard to first registration. It could intervene in terms of the required searches to make matters easier for solicitors. One should ask why it needs verified searches? Surely the Land Registry could check them rather than requiring the solicitor to get a verified search. Staff should be designated to promote the first registration system and assist people in getting through it. This will help increase the number of titles registered.</P>
      <P>The compulsory registration system should be extended. I have my doubts in that it might be too much to ask that all land in the State be compulsorily registered. Forcing the issue will make people register but will require the help of the legal profession. The Registry of Deeds and the Land Registry should also consider free first registration. The Land Registry system is more expensive than the Registry of Deeds system. If they integrate, the two bodies should consider balancing their fees to make it more attractive to register with the Land Registry.</P>
      <P>I would like to address the time limits with regard to the stamping of deeds and the penalties incurred if a deed is not stamped within a month. One month is probably too short a period within which to stamp a deed. However, we must consider the issue of time limits with regard to land registration. There should be a time limit and it would be good to have a requirement to register within a certain time. As it stands, some titles are not registered for ten years or more, and some are not registered until someone discovers the fact. A time limit should be considered but it should be a very reasonable one.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and thank the Minister again for his comprehensive explanation of its contents and other legislation that will come before us in the relatively near future. I liked the Minister&rsquo;s overview and description of the old Registry of Deeds office and all that is contained in it.</P>
      <P>It has become commonplace for people to criticise our land law because of its complexity but such criticism is entirely justified. Land law is frequently referred to as being draconian, and that criticism is easily justified. The law that governs property rights dates back centuries, as the Minister stated. We did not need the Law Reform Commission to inform us that such law is out<Col N="1263"/>dated and needs to be changed. We have had Law Reform Commission reports but little has changed to date. I welcome this Bill as a first step in the process of change.</P>
      <P>The complexity of property law is made even worse by the rituals that have grown up over the same period in land transactions. Anyone who is fortunate enough to own his or her own home will know that, at the very least, it takes up to six weeks to go through the rituals of buying one&rsquo;s home. In the modern age of technology where past transactions, old deeds and contracts are available electronically, I cannot understand why people should be dragged through this process any longer. The Minister explained that in other jurisdictions the process involved takes only 14 or 15 days compared to six or seven weeks in this jurisdiction. We should aim for the process to be completed in that shorter timeframe, and the Bill will help in that respect.</P>
      <P>In the interests of the consumer, we need to examine more closely the processes and checks that are said to be involved in conveyancing. Are all these checks necessary and are they being carried out? When an 80 year old house is changing hands, why does the chain of title need to be validated again and again? Do repetitive processes such as this in the conveyancing process serve any purpose? These are some of the issues I want to raise.</P>
      <P>In this context, I am pleased the Minister has taken steps to simplify matters in this area. However, as we agree, this Bill is only one small step. There is a large element of repeal and re-enactment in the Bill. It is not all new material, as the Minister has informed us, and the Bill will pave the way for the storage of deeds and maps on computer. That is very welcome but we need to stop being content with playing catch-up. We need to look ahead and bring forward legislation that will facilitate the greatest possible use of the technology available to us.</P>
      <P>I would much prefer if today we were in a position where electronic conveyancing was the norm and buying and selling a house involved a far more simple and straightforward process. Even after the enactment of this Bill, we will still have two distinct and different systems of land registration &mdash; the Registry of Deeds on the one hand and the Land Registry on the other. If we are serious about simplifying conveyancing, we should have one uniform system. I am glad the Minister announced that one such uniform system, which is essential, will be included in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to Professor John Wylie, one of the foremost authorities on this subject, at a recent meeting of an Oireachtas joint committee. He stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">It is really absurd, when the State has been independent for . . . 80 years, that we still have a ... land conveyancing which is based . . . [on] <Col N="1264"/>old English feudal law. It is ridiculous in this day and age, when our lives are ruled more and more by computers that our conveyancing system is still based on the age of the quill pen and ink.</P>
      <P FLI="0">That is the manner in which the Minister described the office of the Registry of Deeds. I agree that those in the registry have done and continue to do excellent work but we must move forward with the times, as Professor Wylie recently explained to the committee.</P>
      <P>If we are to make substantial progress in this area, there must be a strategy for getting all titles into the Land Registry. This has been done in England where a strategy was devised and now approximately 99% of the landbank of England and Wales is on the register in the Land Registry. We should aim to do likewise in this country.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Law Reform Commission and the officials in the Minister&rsquo;s Department who work on the area of land reform. It is of paramount importance that they are given whatever resources are necessary to speed up and modernise land and conveyancing law.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the replacement of old legislation dealing with the Registry of Deeds dating back to 1707, or Queen Anne&rsquo;s time. It will put the Registry of Deeds on a sound footing and it makes sense to make certain changes to the Registration of Title Act 1964 with a view to making electronic conveyancing a reality.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Deputy James Breen referred to stamp duty, which is an issue raised regularly by residents in my constituency. Where parents are living in the family home after the children have left and want to trade down and buy a less expensive house, they must pay stamp duty again, having paid it on their original home. At the same time, the person buying the house from them must also pay stamp duty. The Government is getting stamp duty on the double. I have asked the Minister to examine this issue because the system is unfair. People are being taxed twice.</P>
      <P>I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to the implementation of the changes envisaged in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Land Registry Office will soon be located in Roscommon, which has been promised for many years. My late father told me that during every election campaign &mdash; Deputy Brady will be glad to hear this &mdash; Fianna F&aacute;il would always promise the people of Ballina that the biscuit factory would be located there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>They must be fond of biscuits in Ballina.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>We got the biscuits but we never got the factory. Similarly, the Land Registry has been coming to Roscommon for a long time. While I am not confident, I hope it is a part of decentralisation that will happen soon.</P><Col N="1265"/>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is at last reforming the Land Registry. The people are paying for the service through stamp duty and direct taxation but when they want to obtain title deeds or get their property registered and there is a problem, they may have to wait up to four years as the Land Registry has a long waiting list. The staff of the Land Registry do an excellent job in difficult circumstances. There is no point establishing a new agency if we do not intend to provide the necessary resources and staff. What happens in the Land Registry is a disgrace. I do not know how the staff have tolerated it and why they have not gone on strike. They work under terrible conditions, which is not right. I am glad the Minister is reforming the office as it is time to do so.</P>
      <P>People and their property must be protected. They must know when they register their title that it is for life. A constituent of mine had a right of way through her property. When she planned to do some building on her property, she checked and found that a certain person &mdash; I must be careful what I say in this regard &mdash; had registered the property and taken away the right of way. I told my constituent to go to her solicitor and that she should put the matter in writing immediately. An investigation took place but nobody knows to this day who registered the property. My constituent had it re-registered in her name, for which I am glad, but the problem should not have arisen. I will make no further comment on the matter except to say that a layman could not have done what was done. The Minister can read between the lines. However, my constituent won her case and got her property back, although the case may yet take a further step. The Land Registry found that the property had been re-registered, although it could not find out who had done so. I hope that whatever equipment is installed as part of the current reform will ensure that such an incident can never occur again.</P>
      <P>Great difficulty has arisen in getting local authority affordable housing property registered. It is time action was taken in this regard. Residents are entering into contracts and agreements with local authorities but the process is being held up because the property is not registered in the Land Registry. This should be dealt with more quickly so that residents do not have to wait.</P>
      <P>This reminds me of the situation when local authorities began selling local authority houses. When a local authority house is to be sold, a valuation is made of the property and the tenants are offered the opportunity to buy. In the Mayo County Council area, if that offer is not taken up within six months, the house is revalued. Last year, a couple in my area had their house valued and agreed to buy. However, their solicitor found that the local authority had not registered the property with the Land Registry and the deal could not proceed. After approximately nine months had elapsed, the property had to be revalued by the local auctioneer, who increased the price by 37%. This problem is now to be dealt <Col N="1266"/>with in that there will be an independent valuation authority to deal with such cases. However, my point is that if the local authority had done its work in the first instance by registering the property, the problem would not have arisen.</P>
      <P>The deeds for many properties came from the Land Commission. I do not understand why one Government agency cannot pass information to another. If a person is looking for a land certificate from the Land Commission, it can take five or six years to get it from the Department of Agriculture and Food, which should not be the case. The people involved are citizens who pay their taxes. They are looking for what is theirs, yet they must wait for the information to be passed from one agency to another. It is not good enough.</P>
      <P>The staff of the Land Registry have worked in very difficult circumstances. If a problem arises, they try to deal with it, especially in sad circumstances.</P>
      <P>When the new agency is established, will it be accountable to the D&aacute;il? Will Deputies be able to table questions on the new agency or will it be like the National Roads Authority or the Health Service Executive in that we will table questions and the Minister will reply that he has no responsibility in the matter? This will result in nobody&rsquo;s business being nobody&rsquo;s business. The matter will be taken out of politicians&rsquo; hands but they will take the blame when their constituents come to them looking for answers. We will not be able to call those responsible to account even though the people elected us to represent them in this House and bring forward legislation.</P>
      <P>I hope something will be put in place to allow Members to table questions about problems with the Land Registry without them being ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle or Leas-Cheann Comhairle on the basis that the Minister is not responsible for the matter. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is responsible for this matter. The Land Registry should be under the control of the Houses of the Oireachtas or, at the very least, Members should be permitted to table questions. Powers should not be taken away from Members in respect of this issue. Members can at least table questions at present and receive answers. They can put pressure on the Department of Agriculture and Food to hand over its documentation to the Land Registry if it must be handed over. If we did not have this facility, it would be catastrophic for the people.</P>
      <P>The time has come for us to modernise the Land Registry to ensure that it does not take two or three years for the sale of a house to be registered. It should be carried out quickly. Currently, solicitors blame the Land Registry while the Land Registry blames the solicitors, but it is the person buying the house who feels the pressure. These people who are frustrated with the Land Registry and solicitors have only the politicians to whom to turn to sort out their problems. The process should be more open. Solicitors should be forth<Col N="1267"/>coming about the date they send details to the Land Registry and the dealing number. The Land Registry should confirm when it receives the documentation and issue a date for the processing of the case.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, it is akin to the national lottery at present. Documentation is sent to the Land Registry with no guarantee when it will be dealt with. A buyer can get the sale registered quickly or he or she could wait years for it to be registered. In my former career as an auctioneer, I dreaded hearing that a problem with title had arisen with a property whose sale I was handling. I knew that I would not complete the deal and would not be paid for two or three years because problems would arise when it was sent to the Land Registry.</P>
      <P>We should modernise the Land Registry but we should give it the resources, staff and equipment it needs. I hope this Bill will not lead to the matter being dispensed with so that politicians will no longer be able to table questions in the D&aacute;il in respect of the registry. I want to put on the record that people are frustrated with the public service. If the Minister of State rings any Health Service Executive area tomorrow morning looking for information, he will find that the newest member of staff in every HSE area is the message minder. The same scenario arises in county councils and Government agencies. It will probably be the last time the Minister of State hears from anyone in that HSE area.</P>
      <P>I rang the Department of Social and Family Affairs and discovered that any caller would need a degree in using a telephone to get through to the person to whom he or she wanted to talk. A caller is first given a number. He or she rings that number, is asked for a particular number and is then transferred to another line. The same situation arises with county councils. It is not possible to contact a member of staff. One&rsquo;s call is diverted&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is drifting away from the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I may be drifting away from the Bill but I am not drifting away from its principle which is that the people of this country are frustrated with the Civil Service for which they are paying good money. They cannot get through to the Land Registry, HSE or county councils. They are asking us, as politicians, what we are doing about this. Whatever system is established needs something for the customers. If they ring the Land Registry, they should be able to talk to someone who will answer their questions and give them the necessary information instead of being diverted to message minders.</P>
      <P>The Land Registry should be modernised quickly. I do not want to see a situation arise like that which has arisen in the health service or the county councils with the introduction of another <Col N="1268"/>layer of bureaucracy but no improvement in services. If this happens, we will have failed again as we have failed repeatedly over recent years. We are very good at creating jobs and introducing legislation but they do not appear to improve the service to the public. People are becoming angry and frustrated with State services and it will not be long before they take to the streets to express this anger and frustration very sharply. Very busy people pay good money for services but cannot get answers from either their solicitors, the Land Registry, the HSE or anyone else. I hope this Bill will work and bring about a modern Land Registry to enable people to know that their business will be completed in a very short period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>Electronic conveyancing is a major step into the future and is this Bill&rsquo;s ultimate aim. The legislation proposes to computerise the registration of titles and deeds in the Land Registry preparatory to Ireland adopting electronic conveyancing, as many countries have done. We know cases where people have gone abroad and returned within a few days, having purchased a property abroad after going through all the legal channels, sorting out their mortgage and signing off on the entire transaction. It is time to change the way such matters are dealt with in Ireland and this Bill is possibly part of such a change.</P>
      <P>The manner of bearing witness to land transactions has evolved through the ages. We have moved from the feudal symbolism of seizing, with its clods of earth, and beating the bounds, which denoted the freehold possession of land. The modern method of validation uses the pen and ink signatures of the transacting parties and attesting witnesses. The objective remains the same: to identify the parties to a transaction, confirm their consent and intentions and accurately describe the land being transferred. There is much in the process that has not changed.</P>
      <P>The public deserves a faster and less stressful way of buying and selling property. This Bill provides much of the legislative framework for a fully electronic process which will handle the transactions on-line. I hope that if it is handled electronically, it might make the process cheaper. A frustrating aspect of the process is the fact that if a person engages a solicitor to act for him or her, the first question he or she is asked relates to the cost of the property. This reflects the amount that the solicitor must receive. This must be changed because one is essentially looking at the same type of transaction. If a person is buying a home or business, there should be a cost for it. There may be slight variations but it is a rather crude way of deciding the bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill will fundamentally change our relationships with conveyancers who will, under the projected system, prepare electronic documents and verify the details against the register. They will then be able to use a secure network to communicate drafts to the other parties to the <Col N="1269"/>transaction and obtain approval of the documents. When they are finally approved, they will automatically be given legal effect through the entry of the results into the register.</P>
      <P>The single most important task over the next few years will be the establishment of the system. The degree to which the potential of this technological innovation is harnessed will be a test of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to it. Our national housing stock has been conservatively valued at more than &euro;300 billion, with more than &euro;50 billion in mortgages. Concerns have been expressed about the degree to which we are indebted, however, that is another issue. As part of its purpose of providing a legal framework for electronic business, will electronic signatures and contracts be given the same status as written contracts? This is a very important issue that must be addressed.</P>
      <P>This Bill will substantially subordinate legislation to attain its goal of facilitating the process of electronic conveyancing. The speeding up of this process would make a major contribution towards avoiding the possibility of &ldquo;gazumping&rdquo;. I do not think this practice existed a few years ago and buyers were hit with it when property prices began spiralling out of control. The repeal of the antiquated registration of deeds legislation, which dates back almost 200 years, and the amending of the Registration of Title Act 1964 are just two constituent parts of the electronic jigsaw. If the conveyancing process is to be speeded up significantly, the use of electronic contracts and signatures will not be the main factor. It will boil down to the rapid flow of information in a standard form to facilitate the quick delivery of such information to the end user, the home buyer. This flow of reliable information should enable him or her to make an informed decision regarding purchase and should achieve the desirable aim of discouraging gazumping. The information will generally flow between solicitors, lenders, surveyors, local authorities and the Land Registry, which in this Bill is embracing the electronic revolution.</P>
      <P>The key to the success and the ultimate aim of electronic conveyancing is the integrity and security of the flow of information, which the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds will bring about. Certification authority for digital signatures of necessity would require approval, and while lightness of touch in the general commercial way may be acceptable, it would be another matter with regard to land.</P>
      <P>One&rsquo;s own home is for most people their most valuable asset and a single large purchase in which they will at some point be instructing a solicitor. In most cases it will be the only time a person will instruct a solicitor. To foster public confidence, any electronic method of conveyancing must have, and be seen to have, the utmost integrity. Electronic voting was tested in two constituencies and although it appeared to work, the equipment is now shelved. The simple reason for <Col N="1270"/>this was the element of doubt created that it was not the best solution. With regard to the purchase of a home, we must be seen to be completely above board. This may be a difficulty, and Deputy Ring referred already to electronic voting. Lessons may have to be learned from that experience.</P>
      <P>Digital mapping is a major project that needs to be implemented to ensure that electronic conveyancing will become a reality. Not alone should land related information be available to customers of the Land Registry, it should be linked into the European Land Information Service, or EULIS as it is also known. Land information for European countries will become available through EULIS to facilitate international transactions for property and finance. We have many international transactions at present. Ordinary people are buying property abroad and we should be linked into this system. We have the opportunity to consider this and take it on board.</P>
      <P>Infrastructure is slowly but surely being put in place to realise the grand plan of the rapid land transfer system. As the Bill indicates, it is merely preparing the way for an electronic conveyancing system and it represents a somewhat cautious approach to the electronic conveyancing challenge. Once everything is in place to ensure the quickest take-up of the technology and the earliest introduction of a fully integrated electronic conveyancing system, it is essential to set a strict but reasonable timescale for its introduction. We may have it on the books but it is important to set a timeframe and to introduce it on a given date.</P>
      <P>At the time of introduction, electronic conveyancing should be compulsory. Changes are coming whether lawyers like it or not. We should not shy away from these changes but embrace them and work towards the benefits that they can bring. The Bill is part of the process of modernisation of the registration system and migration between types of registries, and the availability of an electronic register will hasten this process. It will enable registries to play a pivotal role in the successful implementation of the electronic conveyancing in Ireland, and I hope we proceed with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies for their contributions and for their broad support for this measure. While it contains many technical proposals and measures, it also establishes the property registration authority to manage and control the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds. The aim of the Bill is to modernise and streamline registration mechanisms and procedures.</P>
      <P>The Government recognises the contribution an efficient and accessible land registration system can make to improving the climate for business and enhancing business activity. It is an essential requirement in a modern successful economy. We should not underestimate its practi<Col N="1271"/>cal importance for individual home owners wishing to dispose of their property or to borrow funds for whatever reason.</P>
      <P>Many of the points raised in Deputies&rsquo; contributions were of a detailed nature and are therefore more appropriate for discussion on Committee Stage. I wish to respond on some of the more general policy issues that were raised during the debate. Promoting and extending registration of ownership of land will be a key function for the new property registration authority. The first attempt to introduce registration of title in Ireland was in the Record of Title (Ireland) Act 1865. Its scope was, however, limited to land sales that were sanctioned by the Landed Estates Court under the Landed Estates Court (Ireland) Act 1858. This legislation was an attempt to free up large estates incumbered by family settlements by permitting sale of the land and using the proceeds to discharge the incumbrances. This allowed the purchasers to acquire clear title to the land in question. The 1865 Act made provision for registering such titles but did not establish a dedicated land registry. As a result, little use was made of the registration option.</P>
      <P>Apart from this little-known historical episode, the various land purchase Acts at the end of the 19th century led to the establishment of the local registration of title system in Ireland. The land purchase legislation provided loans for tenant farmers to purchase their holdings from landlords subject to annual repayments in the form of land purchase annuities. As these schemes involved the advancing of large amounts of public funds, it was considered that title to the lands in question &mdash; which formed the security for the loans and which might have to be sold in the event of default &mdash; should be secured by means of registration in a modern system.</P>
      <P>Arising from this, the Local Registration of Title (Ireland) Act 1891 established the Land Registry and provided that the registration of title was compulsory in all cases where land was purchased under the land purchase schemes. All this land has remained within the registration of title system. The system brought about by the 1891 Act is the correct system for the registration of titles, pioneered by the theorist Torrens and reflecting on the local register the actual ownership of the land. The significance of the 1891 Act is that we have now arrived at the stage where approximately 85% of the land in the State, including almost all farmland, is registered in the Land Registry.</P>
      <P>The Registration of Title Act 1964 modernised the 1891 Act and restated its basic and essential provisions in a reformed format. It foresaw the gradual extension of compulsory registration, but in reality very little progress has been made in compulsory registration, notwithstanding that the registration of titles system in the 1964 Act is the superior system for the registration of land transactions. Listening to some Deputies and their <Col N="1272"/>complaints about the Land Registry and the delays therein, one might wonder if it is the superior system that is alleged. Those are, however, operational matters. The theory of the Land Registry is undoubtedly superior to other registration systems.</P>
      <P>Compulsory registration was applied to counties Carlow, Laois and Meath in 1970. The compulsory registration order that the Minister made in September last means that counties Longford, Roscommon and Westmeath will join these counties as compulsory registration areas with effect from 1 April next. Since most of the farmland in these counties is already registered in the Land Registry, the main impact of the order will be on transactions involving urban land in these areas.</P>
      <P>While urban land outside compulsory areas may be registered under existing provisions on a voluntary basis, much of it remains unregistered because of the time and effort that may be required to register it and because of the difficulties that may arise in sorting out complex pyramid titles. It is difficult to state how many unregistered titles remain at the present time, and there may be as many as 350,000. A major challenge for the new authority will therefore be to devise a strategy to promote and extend registration of urban land.</P>
      <P>The Minister has already agreed to a change in land registration rules proposed by the rules committee which increases the self-certification limit on applications for first registration received from solicitors from &euro;250,000 to &euro;1 million. This means that a solicitor who has examined a title and is satisfied that the property is free from any adverse rights, restrictive covenants or incumbrances can certify it and apply for absolute title for his or her client and this will be accepted by the Land Registry.</P>
      <P>The reforms contained in this Bill will undoubtedly lead to operational efficiencies within the Land Registry and, as a result, to increased capacity to deal with applications for registration. On the need for additional resources, the Minister prefers to await the views of the authority on this matter in due course.</P>
      <P>Several Deputies mentioned the need to modernise our land and conveyancing laws. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is committed to law reform in the two related areas for which he has responsibility, namely, substantive land and conveyancing law and the land registration systems which are dealt with in the Bill before us. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is involved in a joint project with the Law Reform Commission with a view to modernising our land and conveyancing laws. The first phase of the project resulted in a Law Reform Commission consultation paper on reform and modernisation of land law and conveyancing law which contains more than 90 recommendations for a radical and far-reaching overhaul of all our land and conveyancing stat<Col N="1273"/>utes. It was published in October 2004 and was followed by a consultation process.</P>
      <P>The next stage of the project was the publication of a Law Reform Commission report which the Minister launched on 14 July 2005 and which contains a draft land and conveyancing law Bill. The Government legislation programme which was published last week provides for the publication of the Bill in 2006. Work is already under way on preparing a text for publication.</P>
      <P>The joint project identified more than 160 pre-1922 statutes which should now be repealed, the earliest of which date back to the 13th century. The repeal of redundant statute law and the removal of outdated notions such as feudal tenure will represent a significant contribution to the process of regulatory reform, including statute law revision, to which the Government has committed itself.</P>
      <P>In light of a recent judgment of the European Court of Human Rights, the Minister wishes to put on record a few words concerning adverse possession. The statutory position is that applications for title based on adverse possession of land are made to the Land Registry under section 49 of the Registration of Title Act 1964. In such cases, the applicant claims that the rights of the registered owner have been extinguished under the Statute of Limitations and that the applicant is now entitled to be registered as owner. For obvious reasons, the Land Registry considers all applications for registration based on adverse possession with particular care and attention. In each case, the facts and circumstances are examined in great detail and it is usual for notices to be served on the parties whose rights have allegedly been extinguished by the passage of time.</P>
      <P>Some applications are withdrawn by the applicant on receipt of correspondence from the Land Registry outlining the legal conditions that are necessary to acquire title by means of adverse possession. Where it appears to the Registrar of Titles that an application in any particular case is vexatious or frivolous or does not meet the stringent requirements of section 49, the application will be refused. It is open to any party to a section 49 application to appeal a decision of the Registrar of Titles to the courts but in practice, such appeals are rare.</P>
      <P>The Registrar of Titles has informed me that the stay that she placed, with effect from 7 December 2005, on the processing of applications based on adverse possession of land was temporary pending consideration of the European Court of Human Rights judgment in the case of J.A. Pye (Oxford) Ltd <i>v</i>. the United Kingdom. The stay was lifted with effect from 5 January 2006. The full implications of the ECHR judgment in this case have yet to be determined. However, it does not become effective until mid-February at the earliest. In the event of a successful appeal of the judgment by the UK authorities under existing appeal mechanisms, the case will be recon<Col N="1274"/>sidered by the Grand Chamber at Strasbourg and a new judgment will be delivered in due course.</P>
      <P>Before concluding, the Minister wishes to inform the House that he intends to introduce several amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage which are intended further to improve efficiencies within the registries. These proposals have been triggered by earlier discussions in Seanad &Eacute;ireann and by the responses of the Land Registry and the Law Society to issues that have been raised in connection with the Bill. They include the phasing out of land certificates and certificates of charge. It is accepted by interested bodies, including the Law Reform Commission, the Law Society, the Irish Mortgage Council and the Land Registry, that the continued use and operation of land certificates and certificates of charge constitutes an obstacle to the introduction and operation of electronic conveyancing. The Minister intends to provide on Committee Stage for a phasing out of these certificates.</P>
      <P>Another issue concerns permitting applications for qualified title. While existing legislation allows the Registrar of Deeds and Titles to grant qualified title in certain cases, such as where the registrar is not satisfied that absolute title is justified, it does not allow applicants to apply for such title. The Minister intends to remedy this shortcoming by allowing applications for qualified title. The 1964 Act already contains provisions that permit, with the passage of time, the conversion of such titles into absolute titles.</P>
      <P>The Minister intends to provide that leases of registered land will also be registered. At present, the owner of registered land may lease the property, or part of it, and the lease is deemed to convey an unregistered leasehold interest. For the lease to be registered, the lessee must apply for a first registration. This takes both time and money. The Minister intends to amend the 1964 Act to make it much easier to register leases of registered property. The aim of these amendments is to simplify registration procedures further with a view to reducing delays and paving the way for electronic conveyancing of land.</P>

	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Arthur Morgan.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Competition (Amendment) Bill 2005 and to continue a debate that has been taking place for approximately two years. The debate has taken on a prominence far beyond the benefits intended by the Bill and has been deliberately engineered in Government circles to distract from the broader debate on the bad deal consumers have received in recent years. It has been the perfect vehicle for the Government to distract attention from the inflationary policies it introduced prior to the previous general election when it pump-primed the economy for electoral purposes. Then came rip-off Ireland to distract people from the mismanagement of the economy. The issue has been the subject of disproportionate focus.</P>

	<P>Prior to pumping the economy for the next general election, the Government will say it has tackled the issue of the lack of competition by the bold provisions of this Bill, but that is nonsense. It does not attack the core issue of competition in this society. As evidence from Central Statistics Office and other reports have shown, the groceries order was not a major reason for the lack of competition in the market.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, relying on the steady feed of information from focus groups, cleverly realised that while the country and the economy were doing very well, there was a sense of unease at the loss of certain values and characteristics we once treasured, namely, the sense of community, belonging and place. There is now a feeling of alienation, despite the wealth we have. The Taoiseach is astute and, a year or so ago, made the political decision to project himself as a community man, despite the fact that, as a Minister and then Taoiseach for effectively the past 20 years, he and his colleagues have done more than anybody to bring those changes about and damage our sense of community. He did so first with transport policy and now with retailing.</P>
      <P>The groceries order was an attempt to protect a form of retailing that connected with the community and provided choice in the form of the <Col N="1276"/>local corner shop. The Taoiseach, for all his talk about protecting the community, is destroying it. He proclaims Mr. Puttnam&rsquo;s book on how to develop communities but everything Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats have done in Government diminishes our sense of community. At the centre of any community lies the corner shop and genuine concern exists that watering down the provisions in terms of protecting the competitive environment for those small shops will lead to a situation where large multinational supermarkets are able to become more dominant. That is bad for the development of our communities and is the reason for my party&rsquo;s opposition to this Bill.</P>
      <P>The experience elsewhere is the same, as statistics and comments have revealed. Correctly, we compare ourselves primarily with the UK, which, howsoever the statistics are twisted, has been clearly unsuccessful in maintaining local shops. Massive out-of-town shopping centres dominate that country&rsquo;s retailing sector, resulting in huge losses. The Minister may try to fudge the figures or change the facts by quoting the proximity of a certain percentage of householders to the nearest petrol station, but that does not represent the classic community outlet or the type of shop we are trying to protect and develop. Being able to walk 4 km to the nearest petrol station is not, in my estimation, the type of retailing environment we need to protect and develop our communities.</P>
      <P>I briefly remarked earlier on a committee meeting I attended at which the CSO made an utterly compelling presentation. Evidence from the 18 to 20 years of the grocery order suggests that, for the vast majority of the time, there was no statistical difference between the price of goods covered by the order and those not covered. That simple but undeniable fact belies the arguments and shows that this issue was blown out of all proportion. One of the prime reasons for the relatively small divergence revealed in figures for recent years is that the grocery order included a significant proportion of basic foodstuffs produced in this country, such as milk and bread, which we will never import. They fall within a completely different competitive price pattern from most of the goods on the non-grocery order. For example, practically all our clothing comes from the Far East, where the cost of workers can be less than &euro;1 per day. A slight price difference will apply in that situation between grocery order dominated products, which tend to involve a higher percentage of home produced goods, and outside products.</P>
      <P>Another competitive retailing issue is the difference between prices here and in the UK across all price bands, which can in part be explained by our threatened fate of becoming an extension of the UK&rsquo;s distribution system. Rather than having our own wholesale system and suppliers, we are becoming in effect a continuation of the Manchester section of the British distribution system. I have investigated this matter and am concerned <Col N="1277"/>that, as a euro country, we suffer from circumstances in which goods produced in the European Union are imported into the UK, where an exchange rate difference occurs, and then go through a further exchange transaction when shipped to Ireland. We suffer from being a subset of the UK&rsquo;s distribution system and are being hit by two or three exchanges.</P>
      <P>The Government needs to examine the issue of the costs involved in exchanges. If we allow Ireland to go the way of America and Britain, where large retailers dominate, these problems will only increase. The dominance of Tesco here and in England cannot be ignored. While that dominance arose through the company&rsquo;s good management and competitive instincts, as a policy maker, I am not sure that I want a situation to develop here where we have one large multiple in effective control of the Irish groceries market. If I look at what was achieved during the history of the groceries order, I see no major increases in prices compared to other goods. It was one small but valuable part in the protection and development of the independent grocery sector here, which, despite being much stronger in comparison with our neighbouring island, is being gotten rid of by Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>
      <P>I share the concerns of some previous speakers on the failure of the Bill to address the core issues. If the Minister believes he can provide better order through this competition Bill, it behoves him to tackle the core provision of the groceries order, that is, the restriction on predatory pricing. However, the legislation will not do that and will have to be amended on Committee Stage if the Minister wants it to do so because, for all the talk about companies being able to take on legal cases with the Competition Authority if there is proof of dominance or unfair competition, it will be incredibly difficult for retailers to carry through successful cases.</P>
      <P>We have seen the complete inability of the Competition Authority to undertake effective action where there was strong evidence of lack of competition. If such cases did not result in prosecution, how can we believe, unless we legislate against predatory pricing, that small retailers will be able to use the Competition Authority to protect themselves? Even if the Minister is allowed this approach, there is a fundamental flaw in his means of achieving his objective and I wish he would amend the Bill accordingly.</P>
      <P>The restriction on so-called &ldquo;hello&rdquo; money is welcome because that could lead to uncompetitive practices but it should be extended beyond the narrow remit of groceries as defined within the Bill to a broad range of everyday household items. A case can be made for an amendment which allows for no restrictions on offers. If a company discounts massively and provides cheap loss leaders to bring customers into stores, it should not be able to restrict the offers it makes. It may use such tactics of its own free will but this should not be allowed on a completely restrictive <Col N="1278"/>basis because that is not in the interests of consumers. Companies use such practices to attract people but the costs involved can be recouped by selling other products for slightly higher prices. A check on the honesty of such a system would be to determine whether restrictions are placed on offers.</P>
      <P>A range of amendments could be made to sharpen this Bill but I return to my primary question of why this issue was given prominence. I believe it was given such an airing because it was a distraction from the broader economic mistakes that have been committed by the Government. That is one of the reasons my party is opposing the Bill, which will remove something proven to be effective and important, not only for the retailers who may be taken out of business by powerful multiples, but also in terms of the protection and development of communities. Our sense of village, town and urban life requires the existence of a local store so that people are not reliant on large multiples in out-of-town locations, which the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government seems to favour &mdash; the Lord knows why, as he is supposed to be responsible for the environment. We should not be left with that type of urban society because the Taoiseach is correct that such a situation is not conducive to communities. The Government either believes in developing communities or in looking after big business. I sense that it espouses the latter attachment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>My party does not support the primary purpose of the Bill, which is the revocation of the groceries order. Sinn F&eacute;in supported the retention of the order because it was introduced to address the fact that large supermarket chains would, in its absence, use loss leaders &mdash; products sold for less than the cost of production &mdash; to lure customers into stores by creating a distorted impression that the goods sold were cheaper than those of rivals. Small stores with tight profit margins will find themselves unable to compete. Ultimately, communities and customers will suffer if small retailers are forced out of business and people cease to have access to small retailers based in their communities. There is also serious concern that the revocation of this order will adversely affect local producers.</P>
      <P>In a joint submission to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul, the Combat Poverty Agency and Crosscare raised concerns that the repeal of the groceries order &ldquo;may well cause a negative impact by worsening the inequalities that already exist in the groceries market, owing to issues of access and availability of low-cost, nutritional foodstuffs in low density and low income areas&rdquo;. They suggested that the revocation of the order would put low income families at greater risk of food poverty. These charities said it would be worth considering extending the <Col N="1279"/>order to cover meat, fish, fruit and vegetables because perishables were not originally included.</P>
      <P>The ban on below-cost selling and the retail planning guidelines have ensured that retail development in the State takes place in a relatively sustainable manner and have provided a measure of protection to small traders and local economies. My party does not support the conclusion of the Government&rsquo;s Consumer Strategy Group report, upon which it seems the Minister based his decision to revoke the order, which calls for an end to the ban on below-cost selling of groceries. In particular, we contest the statement in that report that the ban on below-cost selling inflates prices and harms consumers.</P>
      <P>In tandem with the moves being implemented by way of the legislation before the House is the equally regressive relaxation of the retail planning guidelines by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche. Unfortunately, it appears to me that if one wants to change Government policy, and particularly in the case of Deputy Roche, then one gets a large company to lobby the Minister strongly. If one looks at the case of Wrigleys and the chewing gum tax, the Minister backed off. He backed off in the Ikea case too and there are other examples with his Department, such as incineration. That is most unfortunate.</P>
      <P>My party does not believe it is acceptable for retail and planning policy to be dictated by a single furniture retailer seeking to enter the Irish market, which is what happened in the case of Ikea. There was no impediment to Ikea entering the market while the original retail planning guidelines remained in place, particularly given that it operates stores that are within those guidelines in a number of other countries.</P>
      <P>My party is keenly aware of the consequences of such superstores in other states, where corner shops, grocers, banks, post offices, public houses and hardware stores disappeared from urban and rural communities. As we have said on many occasions, following the US model of building massive, out-of-town retail warehouse outlets will have a detrimental effect, not only on smaller and indigenous retailers who have abided by the retail planning guidelines but also on local communities and the environment. Developments of this size have enormous implications for traffic congestion and use of land, but their most obvious impact is on the local economy.</P>
      <P>I have raised the following matter on numerous occasions but am compelled to raise it again because it has not been addressed, namely, that competition law is being used mischievously by the Competition Authority to attack the right of certain workers, particularly actors, musicians, film crews and freelance journalists, to be collectively represented. When the original competition legislation was going through this House, guarantees were given that this situation would not occur. It is ridiculous that these low-paid workers <Col N="1280"/>are being targeted by the Competition Authority. The Minister has indicated that he is unwilling to make legislative changes to address the position in which these workers find themselves. This is simply not good enough and underlines the necessity to remove responsibility for labour affairs from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I reiterate the call I have made previously for the Minister to amend the Industrial Relations Acts in respect of the definition of employee to rectify this unacceptable situation.</P>
      <P>I also have serious concerns regarding the agenda of the Competition Authority on other fronts. It is becoming increasingly obvious that a central objective of the authority is to push the Government&rsquo;s privatisation agenda, as was seen from its recent report calling for the opening up of CIE&rsquo;s profitable bus routes to private operators. It is clear that the Competition Authority, along with the Government appointed National Consumer Agency, which last week was severely rebuked by the Broadcasting Complaints Commission for breaching broadcasting regulations by engaging in political advocacy in its campaign to have the groceries order rescinded, are mere vehicles of the Government to further its assault on the public delivery of essential services. The aforementioned are not independent bodies, as people have been led to believe.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise another matter of urgent importance. The legislation is largely designed to facilitate large retail chains and I wish to draw attention to the conduct of one such chain, namely, Dunnes Stores. A shop steward with the union Mandate was sacked from her position at Dunnes Stores in the Ashleaf Centre in Crumlin for wearing a union badge on her store uniform. The company compounded this action by its subsequent refusal to attend a meeting about the disciplinary action with the worker, Ms Joanne Delaney, because she was accompanied by her trade union official. According to Mr. Brendan Archbold of Mandate:</P>
      <P LI="1">The decision by Dunnes to sack a member of Mandate for wearing her union badge is symptomatic of a wider campaign by the chain to undermine this union and to systematically erode our right to represent our members effectively. For a considerable period of time now, it has been clear to Mandate that the company has wilfully and methodically sought to obstruct our efforts to engage with them on a variety of issues. This is just one example of the company&rsquo;s deplorable attitude to Trade Unions.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This case is symptomatic of a wider degradation of workers&rsquo; rights, which has been under way in this State for a number of years by some employers. It is useless for the Minister to wax lyrical about the benefits of social partnership while allowing certain employers to engage in anti-union tactics such as those to which I have referred which are designed to intimidate <Col N="1281"/>workers who wish to become more active in the trade union movement. I call on the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to intervene directly with Dunnes Stores to ensure the immediate reinstatement of this worker and make it clear to the company that this kind of action will not be tolerated. This issue has been raised in the Scottish Parliament and in Westminster and will do serious damage to the reputation of this State in respect of the protection of workers&rsquo; rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill because I believe it is of considerable importance to consumers and retailers. I have a vested interest in the retailing sector and understand the importance of small businesses and retail outlets to the fabric of every town, county and region. I have worked with the Musgrave group and the BWG group and am aware that investment in the retail sector has played a critical role in this economy. The retail sector has become increasingly competitive, with competition between multiples and independent retailers. This has led to an increase in the overall level of retailing as well as an enormous improvement in choice. The retail sector does not want to be ring-fenced but wants competition that is fair.</P>
      <P>The groceries order was effective in 1987 but the definition of groceries has changed considerably since then. The changes proposed concerning the Competition Authority are important and are very much welcomed by the trade. However, predatory pricing needs to be addressed carefully and I am disappointed by the manner in which the Minister has chosen to deal with this issue. If multiples offer a promotional line, they should do so for a specific period in all outlets. If they are allowed to focus promotions on a confined range of stores, that will be to the detriment of smaller retailers in towns and villages. I am not simply referring to grocery retailers but to pharmacists and other retailers, including restaurateurs.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">This motion addresses the social services inspectorate that is supposed to look after people in public, private and other forms of residential institution within this State. It was promised but not delivered by the Government during 2005. We are calling on not only the Government but particularly the Taoiseach to move on this issue. If he is happy to look after the child care needs of children in Latvia and Poland, the least he could do is look after issues surrounding the care of the elderly in his own country. He has paid lip service in the past 12 months to this as a priority for his Government.</P>
        <P>The charge against the Government tonight is that there is no commitment to the care of the elderly in the community or residential sector. The Government has dragged it heels on this issue and kicks and screams against every proposal made by the Opposition. It only moved on issues related to the care of the elderly in the last budget because there will be an election next year. Prior to that, nothing was done for the care of the elderly in the lifetime of this Government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>All vulnerable adults, such as those with a disability, in this society deserve the protection of the State but they are not getting it. Children do not get the protection of the State, as we have seen time and again in regard to vetting, which is not coming through. The proposals I have for the social services inspectorate will protect elderly people in every setting in society. The Government has only paid lip service to this idea in the past 12 months. Words are not enough, it is time for the Government to stand up for what it believes or it will have zero credibility with the people at the next election.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, promised legislation before the end of 2005, but not even the heads of a Bill have been delivered as we start this new D&aacute;il session in 2006. It is worth remembering what was said. The T&aacute;naiste stated in April that there are commitments in the health strategy, Quality and Fairness &mdash; a Health System for You, in Sustaining Progress, the social partnership agreement for 2003-04 and An Agreed Programme for Government of June 2001 on the establishment of a social services inspectorate on a statutory basis and the extension of its remit to other social services, including residential services for older people. In the nine months since those words were spoken, nothing indicates any more commitment on the Government&rsquo;s behalf to the establishing of a social services inspectorate than there was in April 2005. It is a shocking indictment of the Government.</P>
        <P>The former Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, the self-styled champion of the elderly, Deputy Callely, in July 2003 told the D&aacute;il that health boards were involved in the preparation of draft standards of care for residential institutions for older people. These draft standards were to build on the standards required of private nursing homes under the Nursing Home (Care and Welfare) Regulations 1993 and to have regard to international good practice in this area. It is obvious neither Deputy Callely nor the Government chose to follow up and ensure these standards were finalised or implemented. If they were finalised, where are they now and why were they not implemented in the past two years by the Government?</P>
        <P>In 2005, we tabled a parliamentary question to find out what services for older people, promised by the Government in the health strategy, which was Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s manifesto on health prior to the last general election, were being provided. We were promised 600 day hospital beds but none was delivered, at least to the best of our knowledge because the HSE could not tell Fine Gael how many day hospital beds for the elderly were provided since 2001. We were promised 1,370 assessment and rehabilitation beds but how many have been delivered since 2001? There was a total of 95, a 7% success rate. We were promised 7,000 extra day care places in 2001. How many have <Col N="1284"/>been delivered? Only 2,250 were delivered, 32% of the figure promised. We were promised 5,600 beds in community nursing home, community care, community support and extended care beds &mdash; the Government pledged to provide 800 beds every year for seven years. How many have been delivered? A total of 537, a 9.5% success rate in delivery of Government promises on services for older people.</P>
        <P>Should it come as a surprise, therefore, that the Government has totally failed to implement legislation that would protect the elderly or establish an inspectorate that would protect elderly people from abuse in public and private residential nursing homes? I will not go into detail on what has happened in many of those nursing homes. I will leave that to Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, who has done trojan work on this issue in recent years.</P>
        <P>Other promises were included in the health strategy, specifically in the care of the elderly area, that have become stuck in the 2001 time-warp, promises made before the last election. Legislation was enacted to clarify entitlements because many elderly people still do not know their entitlements, but under the HSE, which was supposed to equalise services across the State, there are still differing rates of subvention in different health board areas and different interpretations of entitlements. This basic legislation has not been implemented.</P>
        <P>Every time a Minister discusses care of the elderly, it is pointed out that our population is aging and the percentage of people over 70 is increasing year on year, but where is the framework policy to address this? After five years, the Government has failed miserably to even publish a policy document on care of the elderly. Many ideas have been bandied about, with report after report, such as the O&rsquo;Shea report, the Mercer report and another Cabinet working group that is to report back to the Ministers for Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs. As we move further into the century, the Government has no idea how it will fund care of the elderly in future.</P>
        <P>This lack of commitment was demonstrated in the last budget, where the Government trumpeted the broadening of subvention criteria as a great step forward. Broadening the criteria for the subvention is not much use if the rates of subvention patients can get are still stuck in the 2001 time-warp. How much help would it be for patients to receive between &euro;131 and &euro;160 per week to pay nursing home charges? Has the Minister any idea of the changes in the cost of nursing homes since 2001? If he thinks they have not changed, he is also stuck in a time-warp. There has been a dramatic change in the cost of nursing home care.</P>
        <P>The Government is also failing miserably to provide services for people in the community. We will need to keep a close eye on events because there appears to be a drift towards privatising much of this service. I wonder whether a large number of home help hours are being repackaged <Col N="1285"/>into small parcels to be delivered by the private sector, without an overall increase in the delivery of care in the community.</P>
        <P>Not only is the Fine Gael Party calling for the immediate establishment of the social services inspectorate &mdash; we have had enough dilly-dallying from the Government on this important issue &mdash; but all the issues which arise as a result of its establishment must be acted on immediately. Legislation on entitlements must be introduced and applied equally throughout the country. The purpose of establishing the Health Service Executive in what the Government describes as a reform process &mdash; it is far removed from reform &mdash; was to have a uniform approach.</P>
        <P>With regard to subvention payments, only 5% of the elderly population reside in a nursing home or avail of any other form of residential care. Those who end up in such care should be given the utmost protection and comfort. Families should not have to go broke looking after elderly relatives. The Government must have the courage of its convictions and deliver a policy on funding care for the elderly, rather than continuing to tinker at the edges. The funding package of &euro;150 million for care of the elderly the Government announced for 2006 suddenly dropped to &euro;110 million when the details emerged. This figure must be scrutinised more closely in future to ascertain what precisely is being delivered in the area of care for elderly people.</P>
        <P>In terms of expenditure, the only advance the Government made in this area since 2001 was to introduce medical cards for those aged over 70 years. The delivery of this measure was considered stroke politics at the time. While giving medical cards to all those aged over 70 years is not a bad idea, giving them to multimillionaires and paying general practitioners three times the rate paid for less well-off medical card holders demonstrates the major shortcomings in the system. Unless this measure is followed up with all the other Government promises and the Government demonstrates a commitment to the care of the elderly, its credibility will be completely undermined. The reason the Fine Gael Party is putting pressure on the Government in this area and making primary care and care of the elderly in the community our political priority is to embarrass the Government into looking after elderly people properly in their communities.</P>
        <P>During questions earlier, I was shocked by Ministers&rsquo; lack of knowledge about services they claim to be providing in the community. The current position must change and the Government must take as its starting point the need to provide care for the elderly. The messing around must stop. The Government must quickly provide proper care of the elderly in the community and residential institutions and ensure that those living in such institutions are protected.</P>

	<P>While this is an important debate, it is unfortunate that it takes place in the full and certain knowledge that the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, has laid before the House no evidence of changes he has made in the Department and the Health Service Executive since the Leas Cross story broke about a year ago. It is shameful that he has sat on his hands and that the Government has done no productive work on this issue in the intervening period.</P>
        <P>As a letter the Minister of State received from the Health Service Executive demonstrates, he was informed in May last year that up to ten nursing homes could have to close in north County Dublin if changes were not made. The level of care in Leas Cross and many other nursing homes around the country was appalling. The Minister of State has been charged with the responsibility of changing this but has failed miserably to do so. It is a disgrace that the Government has not produced the legislation it promised, as my colleague, Deputy Twomey, stated.</P>
        <P>I received a letter on 31 May 2001 under the Freedom of Information Act before the legislation was amended. It states:</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>It was sent on 31 May 2001, long before the Minister of State was appointed to office.</P>
        <P>The fourth, eighth and ninth nursing homes on the list are Bedford House in Balbriggan, Rostrevor nursing home and Rathfarnham nursing home, respectively. In the 12 months since the Minister of State was appointed, the case against Rostrevor nursing home has concluded successfully with the courts imposing a fine of &euro;8,000 on the home&rsquo;s operator. In the second case today&rsquo;s issue of <i>The Irish Times</i> features a report on the Rathfarnham nursing home. A letter dated 30 June 2005 from a doctor who was on an inspection team which visited the home states:</P>
        <P LI="1">As a member of the inspection team of this nursing home in the past 12 months, the only possible outcome is the non registration of the above nursing home. My conscience would not allow me to consider any other alternative. As a medical doctor I stand over the reports I have already signed regarding this home&rsquo;s non registration. My medical integrity would be at issue were I to decide otherwise. I have no difficulty making myself available giving evidence as to <Col N="1287"/>the breaches I noted on my inspection visits in the district court should the proprietor appeal.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These remarks, made in June 2005 and after the Minister of State&rsquo;s appointment, relate to a nursing home which was regarded as a problem home in 2001. The Government&rsquo;s lack of interest and failure to take action on foot of promises it made in 2002 to change the nursing home regime have resulted in people suffering unduly in nursing homes. Many hundreds of such homes are excellent and have the highest possible standards but those to which I referred are not the only ones with appalling standards. The job of the Government is to protect the weak and elderly and it has singularly failed to do so. For example, it has failed to amend legislation to address the nursing homes which were mentioned in 2001, were still causing problems in 2005 and, to the best of my knowledge, continue to be a problem in 2006. The Government has shown a complete failure of intent and commitment.</P>
        <P>How do we know some nursing homes are so bad? We find out through the Freedom of Information Act. Unfortunately the Health Service Executive is treating the Act as a barrier to getting information on nursing homes. Time and again one must submit an application and &euro;15 to secure information. I asked the Health Service Executive, through a parliamentary question, to provide me with the number of successful convictions secured against nursing homes in the past ten years. The reply I received stated that I should seek the information under the Freedom of Information Act. The Health Service Executive is rapidly becoming the &ldquo;Health Secrets Executive&rdquo;. There is no transparency or openness about the manner and means in which nursing home procedures are dealt with.</P>
        <P>I was told by the Health Service Executive when I rang today that, despite the written promises I received from the Minister of the day last year following events at Leas Cross, which indicated that nursing home inspection reports would be placed on the HSE website as soon as they were available, one can search its site as much as one likes but one will not find transparency or information on any nursing home inspections that have taken place in the State since the Leas Cross case. This is another case of the Government failing to deliver its commitment to change and the Health Service Executive failing to provide true, honest and open information to Deputies who seek it. Members of the Oireachtas are the least of those who count. The people who count in this regard are patients in the nursing homes and their families who are being denied access to this information. The Minister of State, as I have shown, has failed in his job. Over the last few days I have met people who work in different nursing homes in my constituency in north County Dublin. The most significant legislative problem people face is that the Minister has failed to protect the whistle <Col N="1288"/>blower. I know nursing home carers and nurses who feel if they took their requests to the Health Service Executive they would not be protected and would lose their jobs. They have told me there are still appalling situations in nursing homes. One of them, which would concern us all, is that when people die in a nursing home they are not properly laid out and no respect is shown to the bodies before they are placed in a coffin. Another is where if residents are able to go to the toilet their bodies are not washed by the staff afterwards. In other cases clothes are recycled. People may have just one outfit and clothes in the nursing home are given to everybody. There is no compassion, concern or commitment to look after those people by the people who operate those nursing homes.</P>
        <P>I repeat that the vast majority of nursing homes are excellent but those that are not are appalling hell-holes in which people are treated like animals. The Minister has taken no action to change that situation. The case of the Rosstrevor nursing home shows that unless the legislation is changed all the inspectors in the world will change nothing. The High Court found that the legislation the Minister promised to change almost a year ago, and which the Government promised to change four years ago, is not strong enough to close an appalling nursing home such as Rosstrevor. The Minister has the legislation to change the nearest chipper were mouse droppings found in it. What about the elderly who are being abused in some of these nursing homes? The Minister offers them no protection. This Government has failed to protect those people, a shameful situation which must change.</P>
        <P>The law requires that within two months of a person&rsquo;s admission to a nursing home a contract of care be signed by the nursing home and the patient. Thus the needs of the person and the provisions of the nursing home are written down and signed off by everybody concerned. However, the Health Service Executive has no contracts of care with patients in private nursing homes. In many cases it is hard to escape the view that people are dumped there and that nobody cares about them, least of all the health board that placed them there. That is a shameful situation and one about which the Minister could command knowledge. The least he could have done when he got his job was to call in the nursing home inspector and ask to see what is happening in his constituency. I have facts on bad nursing homes in the Minister&rsquo;s constituency and would be glad to give them to him. They are not good, but he has done nothing about it.</P>
        <P>I challenge the medical profession to come clean with the knowledge it has. I refer to members of the medical profession who are registered owners of nursing homes. I ask that Bedford House and its operation over the past few years be examined by the media. There is an important issue there. If somebody who has a special oath and commitment to the medical pro<Col N="1289"/>fession runs a nursing home, it should be the best place.</P>
        <P>The fundamental issue is transparency and openness. I do not know who wrote the Minister&rsquo;s script. The work I have done tells me that throughout the country, in each former health board region there have been thousands of breaches of the regulations &mdash; many minor, some not so minor and many of them major. This has been the position over the last few years it continues. There has been no change in the law and that is where the Minister has failed. Time and again the nursing home inspectorate suggests things should change and then says it is seeking legal advice. Year after year the legal action fails to happen and the problems continue.</P>
        <P>I have done much work on this and all my spare time goes into it. The Minister&rsquo;s job is to spend all his time at this work and if I were marking his card I would give him zero because while there are many changes he could have made he has done nothing. I challenge the Minister to bring in the legislation he promised, to protect the elderly, the weak, the sick, the infirm, the sufferers of dementia and the psychiatric patients put into nursing homes. The Minister has a duty of care to them. If they were children people would be screaming outside the House demanding change and the Minister would have acted. Perhaps because they are old people they may not be as valued or as emotive an issue. Old people are valued and important in our community and we must show them great respect and honour. What happens to people in the worst of our nursing homes, and what we do to address it, will be a judgment on all of us and on the integrity of our health service. The Minister has failed in his statutory duty and should resign.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>This motion is extremely important. Its main aim is to ensure our elderly will be well cared for in both private and public nursing homes. Leaving politics aside, many people, including myself, never thought the actions reported by &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; could happen to the elderly in a Christian, caring Ireland. Crimes against the elderly were perpetrated. My colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, has put great effort into this and has behaved in a professional way over years of research into this. I do not single out the Minister but speak of the Government&rsquo;s inactivity. I hope the Minister in his reply will indicate why the legislation on the inspectorate is not being introduced. I cannot understand it. Is he saying it cannot be done or that it should not be done? My colleagues have pointed out that it has been promised so many times and I cannot understand why any Government could leave itself open to the charge that it failed to care for the elderly by bringing in that legislation. Legislation comes through this House every day, which is the purpose of the D&aacute;il. The &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; investigation taught us all a lesson. In east Galway I know 20 or 30 private nursing homes <Col N="1290"/>and I am aware of no complaints. I know several people who spend valued time in them. One must stand back from this and examine carefully the findings of the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; investigation team. It happened in one place already and due to human nature, if it is let go unchecked, what is contemplated today could be an accepted practice in the system in ten years&rsquo; time. That is why the inspectorate is so vitally important.</P>
        <P>As far as I know, there is never any trouble in a nursing home with people that are active and whose mental capabilities are such that they are able to look after themselves as far as is practicable. These people are not only inside the nursing home as they are also able to walk out during the day and meet their neighbours. An inspectorate is important for these people, but it is not necessary. However, some people lose their senses and are unable to look after themselves. Such people may have to be spoon-fed and looked after like children. It is only then that this inspectorate should be there on behalf of those people because such people have dignity, they have served this country well over the years and they should not be stripped of their dignity in the last years of their lives. This should not be allowed in any civilisation, Christian or otherwise. It should not be allowed to happen, whether it is due to profit, uncaring attitudes or whatever.</P>
        <P>If Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd put down a question in this Parliament about the HSE, why would he be told that he could not get the answer here, but through the Freedom of Information Act? Why should that be the case? In schools and colleges, the done thing is to ensure that parents know what exactly is happening in those establishments. That is as it should be. However, nursing homes are treated like an enclosed order. When will that change? When my parents were alive, nursing homes did not exist, but if I thought that I had unwittingly committed my parents to a nursing home that did not meet the expected specifications because I could not get the information, I would stand outside the gates of this House with a placard, and so would the Minister of State. We would not take &ldquo;no&rdquo; for an answer.</P>
        <P>When I am told that the only way I can acquire such information is to make a freedom of information request, I wonder what I am elected for. What is a democracy? What is a national parliament? What are we doing here? If I know the Minister of State well enough, I believe he would want to change that, but I cannot understand why the Government will do nothing.</P>
        <P>In the last budget, we were delighted that &euro;110 million was made available for public nursing homes. Why, therefore, are more and more people approaching me in my constituency because they are forced to apply to the HSE western area for access to State-run nursing homes such as St. Brendan&rsquo;s in Loughrea? The figures show that there are more people lining up for access to these homes. Any old person in receipt of only the old age non-contributory pension, <Col N="1291"/>with no relative to help them and with the subvention that currently exists, is not able to make up the &euro;500 to &euro;700 per week that is now charged by the vast majority of nursing homes.</P>
        <P>There is a shortfall of about &euro;200 per week. Where does that come from? It is all right if the old person&rsquo;s sons and daughters are around and are able to pay. I see nothing wrong with family members having to do things like that, but some people do not have anybody belonging to them, or the people belonging to them are so stressed out with high mortgages that they cannot pay. I do not know where the &euro;110 million is going, but it is certainly not going to those people.</P>
        <P>In the assessment of eligibility, 5% of the market value of the house owned by the patient is taken into account. That would be fine if the house was modern enough to be rented while the person was in the nursing home and was making money, but most of those houses by their nature are small and conventional as elderly people have lived in them for the previous 20 years. They make no money as they are lying idle, yet the 5% of market value makes the world of difference in the amount of subvention they receive. It is time such a policy is taken out of the equation because it is very unfair. Where the house is not being used and is not making money, it should definitely be taken out of the equation. It is of no use to the patient in that nursing home.</P>
        <P>The Government and the HSE claimed that there would be much investment in State-run nursing homes. I can only speak about what I have seen in my constituency. There has been a very fine establishment in St. Brendan&rsquo;s Loughrea for generations. It used to be able to take about 160 patients. A badly-needed new refurbishment is now under way, but when it is finished the hospital will only be able to take 80 patients. We were told many years ago by the former Western Health Board that an equal number of places would be created in Ballinasloe. Now we find that the entire campus in the old St. Brigid&rsquo;s psychiatric hospital is about to be put up for sale. It will make millions of euro. I feel that the money raised from the sale will go into the coffers of the HSE at national level and we will be left holding the last straw.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s party colleagues are well represented in east Galway. I want to put a marker down tonight on behalf of all old people in my constituency that we will not tolerate what is going on. If ever there was an election issue, this will be one of them. We know that there is a lot of money in the sale of that hospital and we do not want it redistributed elsewhere. With all due respect, to put nursing homes in Dublin, Louth or Cork will not wash with us. We want them in east Galway because that is where the assets are coming from. The Minister of State might tell the House why the legislation regarding inspectors is not being introduced. We see no <Col N="1292"/>valid reason it should not be introduced immediately.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">I wish to share time with the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley.</P>
        <P>I welcome this opportunity to address the House on these important issues. I acknowledge the significant investment made by the Government in the care of older people by providing &euro;110 million in additional revenue funding in the budget announcement for 2006. The full year cost is &euro;150 million. The Government is committed to maintaining older people in dignity and independence in their homes and, in accordance with their wishes, for as long as possible. It is also committed to providing high-quality, long-term resi<Col N="1293"/>dential care for older people when living at home is no longer possible.</P>
        <P>The nursing home sector is governed by the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 and subsequent regulations. The Nursing Home (Care and Welfare) Regulations 1993 set out the standards to which the private nursing home sector must adhere for the purpose of registration under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990. The regulations only apply to the private nursing home sector and do not cover public long-stay facilities for older people. However, there was a commitment in the health strategy, Quality and Fairness &mdash; A Health System for You, to extend the remit of the social services inspectorate to other social services, including residential services for older people.</P>
        <P>Legislation is being prepared in the Department to provide for the establishment on a statutory basis of the health information and quality authority, HIQA, with the social services inspectorate, SSI, function as part of the HIQA. The SSI function will be vested in a new statutory office to be known as the Office of the Chief Inspector of Social Services. The legislation will also provide for the establishment of a registration system in respect of residential services for children, older people and people with disabilities to replace existing registration procedures in the Health (Nursing Homes) Act and the Child Care Acts. It is intended that the functions of the office of the chief inspector will include, <i>inter alia</i>, monitoring of standards in respect of residential services for people with disabilities, older people and children in accordance with the Child Care Act 1991 and Part 2 of the Children Act 2001 &mdash; family welfare conferences, and registering and carrying out inspections in respect of those services.</P>
        <P>The preparation of the draft heads of this legislation is at an advanced stage and it is expected that these will be submitted to Government shortly. It is intended to publish the draft heads to allow for a period of consultation on their contents prior to commencing the drafting of the Bill, and it is anticipated that it will be published later in the year.</P>
        <P>The SSI has operated on an administrative basis since 1999 and has been focused since then on child welfare and protection services, specifically on residential and foster care services. It is proposed that the HIQA will be the new authority for setting standards for all health and personal social services. As I have already said, the extension of the SSI remit results from commitments in the health strategy that its remit would be extended to cover other social services, including residential services for older people.</P>
        <P>It is of the utmost importance that the public has access to information on health services. We are all agreed that in this day and age it is unsatisfactory for people not to have comprehensive and easily available information on services being provided in nursing homes. The HSE national <Col N="1294"/>care group manager for older persons&rsquo; services established a national nursing homes steering committee in July 2005. One of the priority tasks outlined for this committee was the standardisation of inspection documentation to make the information on inspections more transparent and easily understood by both nursing home proprietors and the public. At the time, a number of different reporting templates were in use.</P>
        <P>The HSE nursing home inspection and registration teams are using a standardised reporting template on an interim basis. The inspection report is based on the standards and criteria laid down in the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 and the Nursing Homes (Care and Welfare) Regulations 1993. A final reporting template will be agreed later this year. The information contained in the nursing home inspection reports can be accessed by the public, either by requesting a copy from the nursing home proprietors or from the HSE under the Freedom of Information Act. When the final reporting template is established, it is proposed to implement web-based access to these reports.</P>
        <P>Nursing homes are required to be registered by the HSE. Registration certificates must be placed in a prominent position in nursing homes. If a registration has certain conditions attached to it, these will be displayed on the registration certificate. When it is necessary for older people to move into long-term residential care, it is important that they have a choice of top quality nursing home care. For this reason it is important that a robust inspection process be in place to ensure that the quality of these homes remains at a high standard. To this end, the HSE will continue to inspect nursing homes in accordance with the Nursing Homes (Care and Welfare) Regulations 1993.</P>
        <P>In general, where problems occur, the inspection team which inspects the private nursing home will discuss its findings in detail with the owners or operators and this will generally ensure that the matters raised are addressed. The HSE may remove a nursing home from its register or refuse to register a nursing home if it is of the opinion that, <i>inter alia, </i>the premises to which the application or registration relates do not comply with the regulations or the continuance of services in the home will not be or is not in compliance with the regulations.</P>
        <P>A working group&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Another one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;has been established by the Department to develop the standards for residential care settings for older people. Membership of the group comprises officials from the Department, the HSE, the SSI and the Irish Health Service Accreditation Board. The group will commence the development of standards for the inspection of both public and private residential care for older people and, in doing so, will consult <Col N="1295"/>with appropriate and interested parties. In addition, the Irish Health Services Accreditation Board has examined the development of accreditation standards for both public and private residential care for older people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government&rsquo;s commitment to the development of a comprehensive range of services for older people can be demonstrated clearly by outlining the resources made available in recent years for service developments. From 1997 to 2005, inclusive, additional spending on health care services has been in excess of &euro;300 million. This funding is being used for a variety of services, including the nursing home subvention scheme, home care grants, the home help service, the elder abuse programme and support to voluntary organisations.</P>
        <P>In addition, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, announced a &euro;150 million package to expand and improve services for older people and palliative care in 2006 and beyond. This will mean a major improvement in home and community-based support for older people. A comprehensive health and social care service will be developed in a way that is reliable and that respects and values older people. This is the largest ever increase in funding for services for older people. These initiatives set out the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to older people and putting older people at the centre of health policy now and in the future. The investment package is focused on caring for people at home, in accordance with their expressed wishes. It is a major step in focusing new resources on home care first and foremost, while still supporting appropriate residential care. This is in line with international trends and reflects the growing independence of older people who want to stay living in their communities.</P>
        <P>It is entirely right that we should devote substantial additional resources to services for older people. They have made a great contribution to our society and to our current economic and social success. In this way, we are saying that the next generations value their contribution and will respect their needs and their continuing role in our society. This new investment involves additional resources of &euro;150 million in a full year, that is, &euro;110 million in 2006 and &euro;40 million more the following year. Reflecting the new emphasis on home and day care, almost three quarters or &euro;109 million of the full year costs are being committed to community care supports.</P>
        <P>This investment is a response by the Government to older people&rsquo;s preference to be cared for at home rather than going into residential care. Very often that may require some additional home help or more developed home support, including various therapy services. All the evidence shows that families caring for elderly relatives continue to provide care in partnership with the support services put in place for those who <Col N="1296"/>require it. It is estimated that 28% of nursing home residents have a low to moderate dependency level and many of these residents might very well have continued to live at home if the right supports had been made available to them at the appropriate time.</P>
        <P>The budget package provides for a number of initiatives, including home care support packages. These home care packages deliver a wide range of services and have been piloted successfully in several regions in recent years. They include the services of nurses, home care attendants, home helps and the various therapists, including physiotherapists and occupational therapists. A home care package will vary according to the care needs of the person so that, for example, there might be a greater emphasis in some packages on home care assistants while other packages may require a greater level of therapy and nursing.</P>
        <P>The priority will be older people living in the community or who are inpatients in an acute hospital and who without this support would have to be admitted to long-term care. The home care packages will also be available to those older people who have been admitted to long-term care and who now wish to return to the community. In addition, the packages will be offered to people who are already using existing core services, such as home helps, but need more assistance to continue to live in their community.</P>
        <P>The packages are delivered through the HSE, by a range of providers, including the Health Service Executive, voluntary groups and the private sector. The scheme will be as flexible as possible and highly responsive to the real needs of the individual so that where a family or friends of an older person wish to provide these services, they will be encouraged to do so, with support, and linking in with the HSE, voluntary or private sectors. Approximately 1,100 home care packages are provided to people at present. By the end of this year a total of 2,000 additional home care packages will have been provided. This will amount to a trebling of the current service provision.</P>
        <P>The 2,000 packages will support more than 2,000 persons as, for example, individuals could in some cases need a care package on a temporary basis. The major thrust of this initiative is to be directed at older people. However, there will be some flexibility in the scheme so that a person who is under 65 years and may need home care may receive it as appropriate.</P>
        <P>Home helps are an essential part of supporting older people at home, thereby delaying or preventing admission to long-stay residential care. They also help to keep people out of acute hospitals or help their early discharge from hospital. There is a continuing demand for home helps because of the increased number of older people. An additional &euro;33 million full year cost is being allocated for this programme, &euro;30 million of which will be for 2006. This represents a signifi<Col N="1297"/>cant increase over the Estimates provision of &euro;112 million for 2005.</P>
        <P>The additional funding of &euro;30 million will provide 1.75 million more home help hours. As with home care packages, it is expected that these additional resources will be implemented in a flexible way by the HSE so that particularly vulnerable individuals who need a home help but who are under 65 years of age can access the service.</P>
        <P>Day care and respite care are an integral part of delivering a comprehensive community service for older people. The service provided may include a mid-day meal and a bath, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, chiropody, laundry and hairdressing; social contact among older people; respite for family members and-or carers; and social stimulation in a safe environment for older people with mild forms of dementia. The provision of &euro;9 million in a full year will allow for an additional 1,325 places per week in such centres. The number of older people who will benefit from these new places will be substantially more than 1,325 since over the whole year one place can provide a service for more than one person.</P>
        <P>The investment of &euro;9 million will allow for additional programmes for specific needs, such as activity therapy. It will also mean that many day care centres can open for five or seven days a week rather than the two or three days that is often the case at present. There will be an investment of &euro;7 million in 2006 with the balance of &euro;2 million being provided the following year.</P>
        <P>There will be a significant increase in the resources available to the &ldquo;meals on wheels&rdquo; service. An additional &euro;2.5 million will be provided in 2006 together with a further &euro;2.5 million in 2007. Again, this is part of the range of services which help support older people to continue living in their own homes. In the provision of meals on wheels we depend on the voluntary support of individuals and organisations to bring the meals to people. Often this is the only outside contact these people have. While the meal is necessary and appreciated, the social contact is also most important. It is a service that brings great comfort to those who receive it and it is one we are happy to support by providing additional funding this year and in the years ahead.</P>
        <P>The Government strongly supports the development of sheltered housing accommodation for older people as it provides a real alternative to residential care and reflects the desire of older people to live with as much independence as possible. To support the development of sheltered housing, a full year commitment of &euro;1 million will be allocated, split evenly between 2006 and 2007, to provide front-line health service support for sheltered housing, such as therapists and public health nurses.</P>
        <P>In addition, the HSE will be asked to develop proposals in the primary and community care areas which are new ways of delivering service <Col N="1298"/>and-or reflect best practice elsewhere. The proposals should reflect significant emphasis on home care and involve non-statutory agencies working in partnership with the HSE. A total of &euro;4 million, &euro;2 million in each of the next two years, is being provided for such initiatives to improve and increase services delivered to older people. We are seeking initiatives that will make a difference.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>A total of &euro;2 million is being allocated to address the issue of elder abuse, again split evenly between 2006 and 2007. This level of funding will facilitate the implementation of the full range of recommendations contained in the report, Protecting Our Future, and will provide for the development of a research function in this area. Approximately &euro;2.5 million has been made available in recent years towards implementing the report.</P>
        <P>With regard to the development of the nursing home subvention scheme and additional long-stay bed capacity, a total of &euro;20 million is being allocated to the nursing home subvention scheme for residents of private nursing homes. This represents an increase of 14% over 2005, which has an estimated spend of &euro;140 million. The &euro;20 million is a 2006 full year cost and will go towards supporting increasing numbers entitled to basic nursing home subvention, reducing waiting lists for enhanced subventions and bringing greater consistency to the different levels of enhanced subvention support throughout the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>When will we get a report on that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened closely to what Deputy Connaughton had to say and I know that in setting up the HSE the intention was to have uniformity in the delivery of services throughout the country. He made a case with regard to subvention and how it works in his area. I will take on board what he said and report back to the Deputy in the near future on it.</P>
        <P>Some &euro;8 million is being provided to cover the cost of 250 extra nursing home beds which the HSE is in the process of sourcing from private nursing homes.</P>
        <P>Regulations have been made recently to ensure the assessment criteria for subventions, which have not been updated since 1993, reflect the major changes in property values. The property ceiling that was set at &pound;75,000, approximately &euro;95,000, in the 1993 nursing home subvention regulations is being increased, having regard to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government house price indices, to &euro;500,000 for Dublin and &euro;300,000 for the rest of the country. The assets ceiling is also being increased to &euro;36,000 from the previous &pound;20,000. Previously, the first &pound;6,000 or &euro;7,618 of an applicant&rsquo;s assets would be disregarded when applying for a subvention. This is now being increased to &euro;11,000.</P><Col N="1299"/>
        <P>Specialist palliative care is another area we dealt with in the budget. In addition to services for older people, &euro;9 million was provided in the budget day package for specialist palliative care, including home care and community initiatives in 2006. This allocation includes funding for 24 additional extended care beds in Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospice in Harold&rsquo;s Cross. A further &euro;4 million is being allocated in 2007 to develop palliative care services, giving a full year cost of &euro;13 million.</P>
        <P>It is clear from the budget day package that the Government is firmly committed to developing services for our older people. The emphasis on developing home care packages and the increases in the home help and meals on wheels schemes and other community based supports will aid older people to remain in their own homes and communities for longer, in accordance with their wishes. Additional funding has been provided to the nursing home subvention scheme to go towards supporting the increasing numbers entitled to subvention and to reduce waiting lists for enhanced subvention.</P>
        <P>Following on the publication of the Mercer report on the future financing of long-term care in Ireland, a working group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and comprising senior officials from the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs, was established. The objective of this group was to identify the policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care, taking account of the Mercer report, the views of the consultation that was undertaken on that report and the review of the nursing home subvention scheme by Professor Eamon O&rsquo;Shea. The report of the group has been completed and was recently submitted to Government.</P>
        <P>In terms of staffing resources for a statutory inspectorate, this would have to be explored by the stakeholders in the overall context of ensuring that standards are met and that health service staff are utilised in the most effective way.</P>
        <P>It is clear to the House from what I have outlined that the Government&rsquo;s commitment to older people cannot be denied. The focus is on supporting older people in their homes and communities for as long as possible and at the same time supporting those who require residential care if the time comes that such is the most appropriate care required. The Government is committed to ensuring high quality care to all older people in public, private and voluntary nursing homes and is working towards having the best standards and inspection processes in place to achieve this. We acknowledge that we must continue to develop policy in this area to meet the growing demand for services and that we cannot be complacent in this regard.</P>
        <P>We gave commitments in the House about bringing forward legislation and I have outlined the stage at which we are with regard to that legislation. We intend to bring it forward. It has <Col N="1300"/>not happened as quickly as we would want, but we are committed to bringing it &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this important issue which affects some of the most vulnerable people in our society.</P>
        <P>As my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, mentioned, the policy of the Department of Health and Children is to maintain older people in dignity and independence in their own <Col N="1301"/>homes, and in accordance with their wishes, for as long as possible. Indeed, the majority of our older people are fit and well and leading full, independent lives. However, where this is no longer the case, the Department is committed to providing high quality long-term residential care. This is the minimum we can afford our older citizens who have played a major part in helping our country to achieve the success that it enjoys today.</P>
        <P>The majority of long-term residential care is of a high standard and affords a good quality of life to those older people who live there. However, even with the best will in the world, there are always exceptions to the rule, and there will always be situations where older people feel vulnerable or, worse, exploited. That is why the Department is committed to developing quality standards and putting in place a robust inspection process for all nursing homes, both public and private. My colleague has outlined the steps that are being taken in this regard. These include the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority and the establishment of the social services inspectorate function on a statutory basis, with the office of the chief inspector having the function of registering and carrying out inspections, including services for older people. They also include the establishment of a working group by the Department to develop the standards for residential care settings for older people. Of course, the HSE will continue to register and inspect private nursing homes under the Nursing Homes (Care and Welfare) Regulations 1993.</P>
        <P>Coupled with these developments, the Department is fully committed to developing the services needed to tackle elder abuse, and in recent years there have been great strides in developing supports for older people who feel defenceless. The report of the working group on elder abuse, Protecting Our Future, was launched on 11 November 2002.</P>
        <P>Elder abuse is a complex issue and difficult to define precisely. It may involve financial abuse, physical abuse or sexual abuse, or it may arise due to inadequacy of care. It is defined in the report as &ldquo;A single or repeated act or lack of appropriate action occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust which causes harm or distress to an older person or violates their human and civil rights.&rdquo; In defining elder abuse, this report has, hopefully, given older people, who feel they are the subject of abuse in any shape or form, the confidence to report their anxieties, as appropriate, to a social worker, a public health nurse, a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or any professional or care worker.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has recently set up a helpline number, lo-call 1850241850, that is dedicated to dealing with allegations of elder abuse, and this should encourage those who feel they are being abused in any way, and those who <Col N="1302"/>witness such abuse, to make the necessary contact and have their voices heard. The importance that the Government affords to the issue of elder abuse is reflected in the fact that a total of &euro;2 million was allocated in this year&rsquo;s budget to address the issue, split evenly between 2006 and 2007. Some &euro;2.5 million has been made available in recent years towards implementing the recommendations of the report, and the level of funding put in place for the next two years will facilitate the implementation of the full range of recommendations. This funding will go towards putting in place dedicated elder abuse officers and clerical support in each local health office area. It will also provide for the development of a research function in this area.</P>
        <P>The report also recommends that a senior case worker be appointed to each former community care area and it is anticipated that the Health Service Executive will shortly recruit a senior case worker for each local health office area. Among the responsibilities of the senior case worker, in conjunction with the appropriate health service providers, will be the assessment of suspected cases of elder abuse referred to the local health office area.</P>
        <P>I agree with my colleague the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, that the Government has looked after and will continue to look after the elderly, the most vulnerable people in society.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>The lo-call number does not do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Moynihan-Cronin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am pleased to have the opportunity to make a contribution to this important issue and to compliment Fine Gael on tabling the motion. The Government&rsquo;s record in bringing forward promised legislation is abysmal and it is particularly bad in the health area. It is quite disgraceful that we do not yet have the necessary legislation to refund the illegal charges paid by people in nursing homes. No other group would be left waiting for over a year to have its money returned to it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We do not yet have the promised legislation on the health information and quality authority. The heads of the Bill have not even been drafted although this authority is considered an essential element of the reorganisation of health services. The delay in bringing forward the legislation on an independent inspectorate for nursing homes is even greater. The health strategy 2001, which was launched with such aplomb, now lies in shreds with virtually none of its promises fulfilled. This failure is greatest in the case of older people. We do not have any new public nursing home places, <Col N="1303"/>we have no new strategy for the care of older people and we have no independent inspectorate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The fact that the legislation on an independent inspectorate has not been afforded priority reflects the Government&rsquo;s lack of concern for one of the most vulnerable groups in society, that is, those who are no longer able to continue living in their own homes because of age and infirmity. The failures in the nursing home sector are well known. What else needs to come to light for the Government to take action? That it knows there is a problem and is failing to do anything about it is evidence, if it is ever required, of the lack of priority it affords to the inspectorate.</P>
        <P>On a number of occasions I have had reason to raise in this Chamber the scandal that elderly people in need of long-term care in public nursing homes in areas of Dublin are now facing a waiting period of up to 12.5 years. That is a fact. In the first instance, priority is being given to the removal of residents who are taking up acute beds in one of our hospitals. Consequently, many elderly people are forced to remain at home relying on family support. Community care and the home help service are being cut back, irrespective of what the Minister of State says to the contrary. Commitments towards extra funding do not even match the cuts made over the past two years. This is happening at a time when beds are unoccupied in the public sector and when there are also beds available in private nursing homes.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise the issues of inspections and uniformity of standards in nursing homes. There are no inspections of the State&rsquo;s 500 nursing homes, which care for 12,500 people. I have been informed that there are not enough staff to ensure that, in all areas of the country, the requirement of two inspections of private nursing homes per year, as required by the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990, is met. I firmly believe there is a need for the establishment of an independent inspectorate. It is shameful that the Government has not acted on the main recommendations of a series of published reports that call for independent inspection of nursing homes. There is no specific legislation dealing with the quality of HSE long-stay care places for older people and the places are not subject to an external assessment of quality.</P>
        <P>Existing legislation governing standards of care is extremely vague, to say the least. The providers or funders of public care homes, the HSE areas, are themselves the regulators of the private sector. One of the points that must be faced up to is that behind the State&rsquo;s reluctance to see an independent inspectorate is a belief that its establishment could result in damning reports of the standards, comfort and staffing ratios in many of the State&rsquo;s public nursing homes. Major questions regarding the age and physical structure of homes, as well as allegations of abuse and neglect, need to be addressed as a matter of urgency.</P><Col N="1304"/>
        <P>The Human Rights Commission&rsquo;s report on older people in long-stay care, dated 2002, states there is a need for systematic study of the inspections carried out by the HSE to determine, for example, whether the statutory requirement to have two inspections per year is being met. The study would indicate the sorts of problems being identified and the action taken to address problems. It would determine whether there are structured interviews with residents&rsquo; relatives, whether health boards have consistent standards, whether inspections are sufficiently broad to provide information about the quality of life of residents and whether the HSE is being sufficiently rigorous in following up when problems are identified. The latter point is vital. It is difficult enough to get a reply to a question from the Department without it referring the question to the HSE. It is important that there be a follow-up.</P>
        <P>A systematic study would determine whether the HSE is reluctant to close homes because of a shortage of places, whether the powers available to the inspectorate are adequate, whether the reporting arrangements are adequate, whether all reports should automatically be made public &mdash; this is very important as it has not been the case to date &mdash; and whether there should be a facility for the inspectorate to report directly to the Houses of the Oireachtas or committees. This must be intrinsic to any legislation brought before the House. I ask the Minister of State to take this on board.</P>
        <P>Other fundamental issues that must be addressed in legislation involve older people who need care or older people for whom care is not provided in the community, who cannot get a HSE area place and who cannot afford private nursing homes. Such people are left in limbo and this must be addressed. What are the implications of all these issues?</P>
        <P>We must tackle the lack of equity in health services and the apparent lack of a concerted approach on the part of the relevant bodies, especially the Government and the HSE, to addressing these issues. Included in this is the obvious lack of relevant community care and support for older people. The need to formulate policy and, above all, implement that policy is not just a matter of the rights of older people who have contributed to the development of our Celtic tiger but it also concerns recognition of the fact that all of us are entitled to a future of dignity and equality, which I regret do not exist at present. It has been clear for some time that the situation facing many older people has reached crisis point. There has been a lack of emphasis on older person&rsquo;s issues. If it had not been for the efforts of the Opposition &mdash; myself, the Labour Party and Fine Gael &mdash; in this House for the past ten years to raise these issues consistently, there would have been no movement, which should be acknowledged.</P>
        <P>We all know that the Government does not like freedom of information legislation and it has <Col N="1305"/>already made it more difficult and more expensive for people to use it. The health boards did not provide adequate information about the services they provided but the HSE seems to be even less forthcoming. It seems that the Department of Health and Children and the HSE are in breach of their obligations under the freedom of information legislation to make available information to the public on matters which affect them. Neither body has the manual of its procedures, known as the section 16 manual &mdash; the Minister of State should look it up &mdash; readily available as is required by the legislation, which is a scandal. The HSE seems to have no clear view of its obligations under the legislation, which I regret.</P>
        <P>Prior to the highlighting of the Leas Cross scandal on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;, successive Ministers for Health and Children and Ministers of State at that Department were aware of the problems that existed with the operation of private nursing homes. The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, speaking on a Private Members&rsquo; motion on nursing homes in June 2005 stated that there was no doubt about the shock that resounded throughout the country following the transmission of the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme. He also said that the Government had a commitment to older people. It has a peculiar way of showing it. Action is required, not meaningless scripts. I hope Deputy Sean Power, as a relatively new Minister of State, will take on his officials on this issue if they are not prepared to come forward with the required legislation. He has made commitments in the past. He should stand up and be counted on this important issue.</P>
        <P>Well before the Leas Cross controversy, in response to questions in the House, I was told by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children and her Department that on the basis of the existing inadequate inspectorate, they had found that staffing levels and nursing policy issues were relevant and needed to be addressed, maintenance of accommodation standards was deficient, hygiene problems existed in nursing homes and there was lack of activity for residents. We should try to imagine getting up at 7 a.m. and remaining sitting in the same chair until 10 p.m. before going to bed. The Minister and her Department also found evidence of insufficient record keeping, lack of active involvement with local authorities on fire safety issues, lack of equipment appropriate to clinical practice, such as pressure mattresses, and a discrepancy in the contract of care.</P>
        <P>Basic information on the care of residents in nursing homes was withheld. It is time we opened the halls and windows of the Department of Health and Children. We should stand, once and for all, for the older people who have done so much for this country. Let us stand up to the bureaucrats and bring forward the legislation. Nothing less is required.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BreedaMoynihanCronin"><NameTxt>Ms B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this important <Col N="1306"/>debate. I support the Fine Gael motion. We need to revisit the legislation whereby the Minister no longer has responsibility to answer to the Deputies of this House. With the abolition of the health boards, public representatives have no way of getting answers. The Minister of State&rsquo;s colleagues will tell him that their parliamentary questions to the Minister for Health and Children are sent to the HSE, which can take up to six months to reply. Members from all sides are elected with the expectation that we can get answers on behalf of our constituents, but we are not getting answers.</P>
        <P>I wish to deal with two specific issues in my contribution. The first concerns the enhanced nursing home subvention, which is available to the elderly in nursing homes or those waiting to go into nursing homes who have no income other than the social welfare pension. An elderly person in my constituency applied for enhanced nursing home subvention in November 2005. I will provide her name to the Minister of State following my contribution. She received correspondence from the HSE stating that she had been put on a waiting list. The letter stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Dear . . . your letter dated the 14th of November 2005. In reference to the payment of enhanced nursing home subvention in respect of the above named, I am to confirm that [the woman] has been placed on a waiting list for consideration for the payment of enhanced subvention as and from the 15th of November 2005. This section will contact you in writing when payment of enhanced subvention can be considered in this case.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The family of this unfortunate woman contacted me after Christmas to ascertain whether I could discover where she was placed on the waiting list. I contacted the HSE southern area and to my amazement was told that she was 452nd on the waiting list for enhanced subvention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>She will be dead before she gets it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BreedaMoynihanCronin"><NameTxt>Ms B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
	<P>What kind of system are we operating? We are literally throwing our elderly people aside and letting them die before we provide care.</P>
        <P>We listen to members of the Government on radio and read their quotes in the newspapers about our wonderful economy and the strides we have made. We have made no strides in this regard. This system was introduced when my father was a Member of the House 25 years ago but there was never a waiting list like the one that exists today. The Minister of State or whoever replies during this debate should tell me whether funding will be provided to the HSE to reduce the waiting lists. Some 452 people were on the list last November but how many are on it now? How much funding will be provided and will that funding clear the waiting list?</P><Col N="1307"/>
        <P>No elderly person deserves to be in this situation. We know how difficult it is for a parent or anyone else to go into a nursing home. It is bad enough for those who can afford it but it is more horrific for those who must wait to get a few bob together to try to get care for their parents. I know that the Members on the Government benches have hearts. They would not agree to have 452 people on the waiting list for enhanced nursing home subvention in the HSE southern area. It is not good enough.</P>
        <P>The second issue I wish to raise is that of the home care or C&uacute;ram grant. A pilot scheme was established in the Southern Health Board area in 2004. Approximately 44 people who are looking after elderly and ill relatives at home received letters stating that they were awarded grants but they never received a penny. No money was provided last year to facilitate the commitment made by the health board to these people. I want an answer tonight or tomorrow as to when the money will be paid to the 44 or more people who received letters of commitment from the health board telling them how much they were to get before they were told that, while they had been awarded so much, unfortunately, the board had no money to pay them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Minister provide the money or ignore the plight of these people, who received letters but have no hope of receiving help to look after their elderly relatives? I hope they will not look for enhanced subventions because they will be waiting for much longer. I want to hear answers to two questions tomorrow night. When will the waiting list for the enhanced subvention be dealt with and when will the money be provided in the form of home care grants?</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this very important issue. I hope the Minister of State will provide clarification on the levy. The IFA issued a press release on 20 January 2006 which accused the Minister for Agriculture and Food of misleading the IFA annual general meeting by saying that it was not necessary to pay a restructuring levy of &euro;25 million in 2006. Less than 24 hours later, the Commissioner responded to a question on the matter put by my colleague, Mair&eacute;ad McGuinness, MEP. She asked whether a country like Ireland must contribute to the restructuring levy in 2006 if it grows sugar beet that year and whether it should <Col N="1308"/>intend to cease production in 2007. She stated that this issue was crucial as it would determine whether Ireland produces sugar beet in 2006, which could be the last season for growing sugar beet in this country. The Commissioner responded that the only way to avoid this payment to the restructuring fund is to do away with sugar beet production in 2006 and 2007.</P>
        <P>The Minister must clarify this matter because the situation is becoming very serious. A total of 3,700 farmers grow sugar beet who need to know now about the position regarding the levy. A total of 1,000 people employed in the sugar beet processing industry and ancillary activities also need to know how matters stand regarding the levy. Greencore Sugar issued a letter to its growers dated 27 January 2006 which mentioned the necessity of clarification regarding the temporary quota cut in 2006. This cut, which appears likely to happen, could range between 8% to 14%. The decision is critical, particularly if the restructuring levy must be paid on the entire quota. The letter went on to state that Greencore Sugar faces substantial risks attached to processing a sugar beet crop in 2006. The company would like to process sugar beet in 2006 but must engage with its partners to see how these risks can be mitigated or eliminated before such a decision is made.</P>
        <P>Farmers must decide whether to grow sugar beet this year. They must make arrangements about matters such as conacre, fertiliser, seed and getting the land ready. They are making these arrangements at the moment. The Minister of State must clarify whether or not the levy must be paid if sugar beet is grown in 2006. What is his understanding about the quota cut?</P>
        <P>It is a sad day for Ireland to see the end of the sugar beet industry but people are beginning to accept that it will happen. However, it is crucial that we find out whether 2006 or 2007 is the last year for growing it. If 2007 is the last year for growing sugar beet, will a levy of &euro;25 million be paid this year and a levy of &euro;38 million next year? I am pleading with the Minister of State to clarify issues surrounding the levy because it is a matter of smoke and mirrors at the moment. The people affected are angry, upset and confused. I am sure the Minister of State realises that much hinges on the operation of the levy. I could address the compensation fund but it is a matter for another occasion. On this occasion, we need clarification regarding the levy. Must it be paid this year? The Minister told the IFA that it does not need to be paid but the Commissioner has stated that it does. Who is right? We need an answer tonight. I await the Minister of State&rsquo;s answer with anticipation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Stanton for raising this important issue. I wish to put on record that the Minister did not mislead anyone with regard to the levy. It will be a matter for beet growers and Irish Sugar Limited to make decisions about sugar beet growing in light of the <Col N="1309"/>reformed sugar regime on which political agreement was reached by the Council of Ministers in November 2005.</P>
        <P>The main features of the reform package have already been widely publicised. After a long and difficult negotiating process, we succeeded in having the proposals changed to provide a longer phasing-in period, as well as a number of options to enable the sector to adapt to the new regime. There will be a lower reduction in the support price of sugar than originally proposed &mdash; 36% instead of 39% &mdash; as well as phasing in of the corresponding reduction in the minimum sugar beet price over four years, instead of the two-step reduction originally proposed.</P>
        <P>We also secured an enhanced compensation package. Beet growers will be compensated for up to 64% of the price reduction in the form of direct payments which will be worth approximately &euro;121 million to Irish beet growers over the next seven years. A once-off payment of almost &euro;44 million will also become available in the event that sugar beet production ceases in Ireland. In that event also, an aid package of up to &euro;145 million becomes available for economic, social and environmental costs of restructuring of the Irish sugar industry involving factory closure and renunciation of quota. This would involve the submission of a detailed restructuring plan for the industry.</P>
        <P>The reform agreement reached last November provides that at least 10% of the restructuring fund shall be reserved for sugar beet growers and machinery contractors to compensate notably for losses arising from investment in specialised machinery. This proportion may be increased by member states after consultation of interested parties provided that an economically sound balance between the elements of the restructuring plan is ensured. The entire compensation package has an estimated value in excess of &euro;300 million.</P>
        <P>The final legal texts giving effect to the reform agreement could not be approved by the Council of Ministers until the opinion of the European Parliament had been received. That opinion was delivered on 19 January and it is now expected that the legal texts, which are currently being discussed at technical level in Brussels, will be approved by the Council at its meeting in February. In parallel, the EU Commission is working on preparation of detailed implementation arrangements which can only be finalised once the Council texts have been adopted. Until all the various legal texts have been adopted, it will not be possible to finalise the implementation arrangements definitively but all parties concerned appreciate the importance of having this process completed as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The Minister and her officials have been keeping in close touch with stakeholders about these developments. One issue on which she hopes to decide shortly is the choice of reference year or years for determining an individual farmer&rsquo;s sin<Col N="1310"/>gle farm payment entitlements. I am glad to have the opportunity to update the House on this important issue. It is up to the growers concerned and Irish Sugar Limited to make commercial decisions in light of the new regime. Teagasc, in accordance with its statutory responsibilities, is available to provide advice where required.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this very important issue. When members of our Defence Forces are sent on overseas missions, the least they can expect is that their medical needs will be looked after by the State. These men and women serve at the request of Government, the Houses of the Oireachtas and the UN. We must not forget the difficult and often life-threatening situations in which they are placed on our behalf.</P>
        <P>The ongoing mission to Liberia, in which the Defence Forces have served with great distinction, is a particular case in point. This mission is difficult and dangerous. However, the recruitment of a doctor who had been removed from the medical register in his country of origin and the assignment to him of the key responsibility to provide medical assistance to our troops was an extremely serious lapse. The circumstances that led to this must be investigated fully and our concerns must be answered.</P>
        <P>In these days of instant access to information, a simple web search reveals a considerable amount about Dr. Lieberthal. It is a fact that, at the same time that Dr. Lieberthal was being considered for appointment, information was available which clearly detailed his unsuitability for the post. An official statement from a provincial department of health in South Africa, carried on a website entry from November 2002, states clearly that Dr. Lieberthal had been suspended from Johannesburg Hospital, and that an audit of all the operations that he had carried out there was to be conducted. Another website listed Dr. Lieberthal as fourth on a list of the top 100 newsmakers in South Africa for 2002, having set a new record for the highest number of complaints laid against a doctor at the Health Professions Council.</P>
        <P>It is clear that Dr. Lieberthal was removed from the medical register long before he was appointed in Liberia. That this was not uncovered prior to appointment raises very serious questions regarding the manner in which his qualifications were scrutinised. The company responsible for <Col N="1311"/>hiring Dr. Lieberthal, Medicare Solutions Limited, is based in the UK. A search of the UK companies office website shows this company is based in Surrey but no telephone number is given and there is no website for the company. I rang international directory enquiries and they were unable to find any telephone number for a company entitled Medicare Solutions, at the Surrey address or any other address. I hope the Minister can help solve the status of the company.</P>
        <P>I understand that this company may have been paid &euro;2,000 per day and that Dr. Lieberthal may have been paid out of this sum. I would appreciate if the Minister could confirm this. What payments, if any, were made to the company? I also understand that Dr. Lieberthal applied to the Irish Medical Council to be registered, but that his application failed. As the Minister may be aware, virtually all employment contracts for doctors stipulate that registration in the General Register of Medical Practitioners maintained by the Medical Council is essential.</P>
        <P>With these facts in mind, there are a number of serious questions that may be answered by the Minister this evening. If he cannot do this he may do so at a later date. When did the military authorities discover that Dr. Lieberthal&rsquo;s registration had been erased from the South African medical register? How was this information brought to their attention? When was the Minister informed? How was the requirement for medical personnel in Liberia advertised? Was there a tender process, and if so, on what basis was the evaluation made and how was this company accepted? Was this a once-off arrangement, or has this company been contracted in the past to supply medical personnel?</P>
        <P>Is the Minister aware of any other Department or agency that has operated a similar process with this company? Is this company currently supplying any medical or other personnel to the Defence Forces? How much money has been spent on the provision of medical personnel in Liberia? Will the Minister ensure that, from now on, all medical personnel contracted to work with the Defence Forces will be registered with the Medical Council and will be a position to show a certificate of good standing to prove such registration?</P>
        <P>In light of the fact that Dr. Lieberthal also attended to up to 500 Swedish soldiers sharing Irish resources in Liberia, is the Minister concerned that the State is now legally exposed to an unacceptable degree following the appointment of this doctor? There is a serious shortfall of medical staff employed within the Defence Forces, of which the Minister will be acutely aware. What action will the Minister take to address this problem?</P>
        <P>In assuming ever greater responsibilities, the Defence Forces will continue to rely on foreign nationals contracted to work for specific missions overseas. That a disgraced doctor, erased from his <Col N="1312"/>own country&rsquo;s medical register, could be employed to provide medical cover for Irish troops on mission overseas must be addressed by the Minister as a matter of urgency. The process that was or is in place put an unsuitable person in charge of the medical needs of Defence Forces personnel, not only from this State but also from one of our EU neighbours. This must not happen again and the Minister should outline how he proposes to change the current procedures.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has raised a number of questions, and although my response will not answer some of them, I will get him the appropriate replies. I was informed of this case on Friday, 27 January 2006. I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern that this case should have arisen. My first priority in dealing with this is the welfare of the troops who were attended to by this man. To that end the director of the Medical Corps contacted each person who served in Liberia during the period in question alerting them to the case and advising them of the measures the Medical Corps were putting in place to deal with any concerns they may have.</P>
        <P>As a result any Defence Forces member treated by the person concerned and who wished to discuss any aspect of his or her treatment with a medical officer was invited to consult their local military medical officer or alternatively to contact the special medical hotline established by the Army Medical Corps. I understand that, to date, there has been one call to this line.</P>
        <P>The background to this case arises from the Defence Forces policy of providing medical care for personnel serving with large contingents overseas. In the case of missions such as Lebanon and Liberia it is the practice to send medical officers as part of the contingent. Given the arduous nature of the Liberia mission, with troops undertaking frequent long-term patrols away from base, it was deemed necessary to have two doctors with the battalion. The mission in Liberia is, of it nature, a peace enforcement one. This resulted in a situation whereby medical officers who had been recruited prior to 1993 could not be detailed to serve there and could only be selected to serve there as volunteers.</P>
        <P>These requirements, coupled with a general difficulty in recruiting and retaining doctors in the Defence Forces, created a situation whereby the medical officer requirements for the mission could not be fully met among the doctors serving at that time. Following a tender competition involving a number of agencies, a contract was placed with Medicare Solutions Limited, Unit 15D, Oakcroft Road, Chessington, Surrey, England. I do not have a telephone number but I will try to get it tomorrow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think there is one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The contract was initially for a period of three months commencing on 1 June <Col N="1313"/>2004 and was subsequently extended to February 2005. Following a further tender competition a fresh contract, at &euro;2,630 per doctor per week, was placed commencing 1 March 2005. During this time Medicare Solutions had supplied a number of other doctors for periods lasting from a few weeks to three months. This contract expired on 31 December 2005. As and from 1 January 2006 the Defence Forces have been in a position to provide doctors from within the Medical Corps. We will not in the foreseeable future enter into any similar type of arrangement to that I am now describing.</P>
        <P>The procedure for selecting suitable individual doctors was that candidates were identified and selected by the Medical Corps from the <i>curricula vitae </i>supplied to the Department by Medicare Solutions, which had expressed an interest in working with the Irish military contingent in Liberia. This selection was done on the basis of the professional qualifications, and particular clinical experience, of the various applicants as per their individual CVs. Dr. Lieberthal was selected to replace another previously selected candidate who had decided at very late notice not to proceed to Liberia. There appeared to be nothing whatsoever untoward in the CV supplied in respect of Dr. Lieberthal.</P>
        <P>Dr. Lieberthal was first appointed for a three-month period from 8 December 2004. He was retained in Liberia until 31 December 2005, when the overall contract with Medicare Solutions expired. He worked in a civilian capacity and provided primary military medical care services to troops, that is, largely care of the routine general practitioner type. He also provided a similar level of medical service to a small contingent of Swedish military personnel. It was only after the contract had expired that it came to the attention of my Department that Dr. Wynne Lieberthal had been struck off the South African medical register by the Health Professions Council of South Africa in July 2004 after their investigation of various charges brought against him under the relevant South African legislation.</P>
        <P>I am extremely concerned as to how this case arose and I will ensure that all necessary steps are taken to avoid any possible repetition. I am awaiting an urgent report from the chief of staff. Legal advice is being sought as to the performance of the specialist medical recruitment agency engaged to provide suitably qualified doctors who either had or would be expected to fulfil the requirements of the Irish Medical Council. It would not be appropriate to anticipate the outcome of legal advice and possible follow-up action at this early stage.</P>
        <P>The requirement to pursue Irish Medical Council registration was included in the contract with the agency. However, I understand that the person in question applied for but never obtained Irish Medical Council registration. The delay in identifying this failure to obtain such registration will form part of the report on the case. While <Col N="1314"/>the safeguards in place will be reviewed along with the performance of the agency, it should be pointed out that in the first instance the person himself should not have commenced or sought work based on falsehoods.</P>

      <sTitle>Sheep Farming.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the important matter of why sheep farmers in the Ballycroy, Tiernar and Bangor areas of County Mayo have been asked to remove stock for six months of the year and to destock up to 70%, which will mean the extinction of their farming livelihoods. I do not know if the Minister is aware that the overwhelming majority of those farmers are already involved in REPS and have heavily destocked in recent times.</P>
        <P>This is a very serious matter and could not be more so for the 300 farmers who are affected. They are sheep farmers who farm commonage in the Nephin Beg range in the Mulranny, Tiernar, Ballycroy and Bangor areas of County Mayo. The areas affected include the proposed national park for Ballycroy and also private land. There has been a lack of information from the State about what is happening. People came down to Mayo from on high and made assessments without any input from the farmers, who are trying to eke out a livelihood on the mountain. It is a scandal that so little information was provided, yet draconian measures are now being proposed which will sound the death knell of farming in this disadvantaged area and will be the <i>coup de gr&acirc;ce</i> for sheep farmers.</P>
        <P>It is proposed that 70% destocking should take place and that sheep be taken off the mountain for five to six months. This is illogical because if the sheep are taken off the mountain for that length of time it will prove impossible to keep them on the mountain after that. They will simply not go up again. If they are taken off the mountain they will have to go somewhere but where can they go? At least one sheep farmer affected has no low land available to him. What is he to do? Who will find a place for his sheep? Who will pay for the rent of land to accommodate them or provide housing for them for five or six months?</P>
        <P>These same farmers have already been badly squeezed by the State. They are already involved in good farming practices such as REPS. Over 90% carry out their farming activity to REPS and they have already undergone a 30% destocking. Yet they are indiscriminately being made to pay a terrible price.</P>
        <P>The national plan for the national parks and wildlife service should have been up and running over eight years ago but it is not. It was supposed to be in place when the commonage framework plan was introduced in 2002. That was to be the alternative for those who were not suited to or would not go into REPS, as the scheme was not suitable for everybody. REPS was to be the plan of the Department of Agriculture and Food and <Col N="1315"/>the national scheme was to be that of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Until that scheme is in place the commonage framework plan cannot be implemented as the national plan was to be the alternative to REPS for those who did not want to go into that scheme.</P>
        <P>The present proposal involves the pursuit of an agenda by faceless bureaucrats who have little or no understanding of the harsh reality of life in rural Mayo. I wonder if they want to know. The result will be the demise of sheep farming and the further depopulation of an already sparsely populated area. I wonder if the plan is to wipe out the farmers completely. People are supportive of the proposed national park in Ballycroy, but must an entire population of 300 sheep farmers be wiped out for the sake of a few day-trippers? These farmers are owed a full explanation of what is going on and demand fair play from the Minister, as I do. They deserve to survive so that they and their children can have a future in farming. <i>Homo sapiens</i> matters too.</P>

	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue. As my Department has the lead role in matters involved in this question I am pleased to respond.</P>
        <P>In June 2002 the European Commission secured a judgment against Ireland in the European Court of Justice, in case C117/00. The case, which focused on the Owenduff and Nephin Beg areas of County Mayo, was taken under the birds directive and concerned the extent to which the habitat of the red grouse was compromised by the overgrazing of sheep. Since that time considerable work, designed to address the issue of overgrazing, has been carried out by my Department and by the Department of Agriculture and Food. The work mainly finds expression in the production of commonage framework plans. These agri-environmental plans relate to just under 500,000 hectares of commonage land throughout the county including the Owenduff and the Nephin Beg area.</P>
        <P>Having regard to the extent of environmental damage and the stocking levels currently on the land in question these lands produce a destocking requirement for each commonage. These requirements range from fairly low levels in commonage areas that are lightly damaged to 70% and higher <Col N="1316"/>in areas that are severely damaged. The actual destocking requirements in CFPs are to be monitored and revised at regular intervals and are to have regard to the success or otherwise of measures that have already taken place on each of these commonages. Recent monitoring carried out in severely damaged areas of Owenduff and Nephin Beg has shown that considerable damage is still in evidence. Accordingly it is not possible at this time to revise downwards the full destocking requirement specified in the CFP plans.</P>
        <P>My Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food are in ongoing contact with the European Commission on the subject of our response to the judgment of the European Court. A fundamental element of that response is that the destocking prescriptions in the Owenduff and Nephin Beg areas and elsewhere will be implemented. For individual landowners the implementation of these destocking requirements will be met through REP plans or, alternatively, through a plan drawn up under my Department&rsquo;s farm plan scheme.</P>
        <P>Approximately 60% of sheep farmers grazing the complex participate in the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, operated by the Department of Agriculture and Food. REPS is a voluntary scheme and participants with commonage land must comply with the commonage framework plan grazing requirements. The scheme will continue to make a positive contribution to specific environmental objectives and will continue to complement actions taken by my Department to address this serious issue.</P>
        <P>Implementation of the commonage framework plans commenced in 2002. Where a commonage framework plan required destocking in excess of 50% in that year it was capped at 50%. The overall plan was to rise to a maximum of 60% in following years until such time as a reassessment of the commonage was undertaken. In recent consultations with farming representatives it was reiterated that the recovery plan for the<?oasys _jy ?>Owenduff area will continue to require an annual period of total destocking. My Department remains in negotiation with farming representatives about the precise duration of this destocking period and I am confident that a resolution can be found shortly which will be acceptable to both sides and credible in terms of our obligations under the European Court of Justice judgment.</P>

	<P>Cancer patients in the south east who require radiotherapy are referred to St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital Dublin and Cork University Hospital. Two radiation oncologists, one from each hospital, have sessional commitments at the hospitals in the south east. The more recent appointment in September 2005 is a joint appointment with Cork University Hospital. She has a five sessional commitment to the south east, which is a significant additional resource to cancer patients in the region. Both appointments will ensure that there is appropriate radiation oncology input into the multi-disciplinary treatment of cancer patients and that patients have equitable access to the services in both Dublin and Cork. The protocols for the referral of patients are developed by the relevant consultants. In 2005, two new linear accelerators were commissioned at Cork University Hospital and patients from the south east are benefiting from improved access to this increased radiotherapy capacity supported by the consultant radiation oncologist to whom I have referred. The funding for these services is encompassed in the allocation by the Health Service Executive to the relevant hospitals.</P>
        <P>Last July I announced the Government&rsquo;s plan for a national network of radiation oncology services to be put in place by 2011 and commencing in 2008. The network will consist of four large centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway and two integrated satellite centres at Waterford Regional Hospital and Limerick Regional Hospital. The satellite radiation oncology service at Waterford Regional Hospital is to be managed by Cork University Hospital. The Health Service Executive, in association with the National Development Finance Agency and my Department, is currently developing the output specifi<Col N="1318"/>cations for the delivery of substantial additional capacity through a public private partnership. The associated human resource plan, which is essential to deliver on the Government&rsquo;s objective, is also being developed as a matter of priority and will take into account the developments at Waterford Regional Hospital.</P>
        <P>I am determined to continue to build on the substantial developments and increased capacity in cancer care so that we have a world class service available and accessible to patients in each region.</P>

        <P>The Mater and children&rsquo;s hospital development is the largest single capital development project in the HSE capital programme. It involves the redevelopment of the Mater campus to include considerably expanded and improved facilities for the Mater itself, and the construction of new, purpose-built accommodation which will replace the Children&rsquo;s University Hospital, Temple Street.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the context of the decision to be taken on the possible relocation of the facilities at Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, I asked the Health Service Executive to undertake a review of tertiary &mdash; highly specialised &mdash; paediatric services to ensure that paediatric services are provided in the most efficient and effective manner. The HSE engaged a team of management consultants to provide a report on the strategic organisation of tertiary paediatric services in Ireland. Its report is expected to be furnished to the HSE tomorrow evening for consideration at the scheduled HSE board meeting on Thursday.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised the hospital that it will await its consideration of the report before giving approval for the project to proceed to tender.</P>
        <P>Following receipt of the report, my Department will have discussions with the HSE to determine how the development project is to be advanced. My primary concern is to ensure that we arrive at a solution which is in the best interests of children.</P>

        <Quest>the number of medical cards promised and delivered, in view of recent announced figures; her views on the fact that despite promises in November 2004 for 30,000 extra full medical cards, recent figures from the Health Service Executive show an increase of people on full medical cards of just 4,728.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Health Service Executive that in January 2006, 1,155,727 people had medical cards, which is 10,644 more than the corresponding figure, 1,145,083, for January 2005.</P>
        <P>I made a number of significant changes in 2005 to make it easier for people to qualify for a medical card or a GP visit card. The income guidelines and the income allowances for children, which are taken into account for the purposes of assessment of eligibility for the medical card, were increased from 1 January 2005. A higher rate of increase was applied to the allowances for children and was specifically aimed at assisting low income families with children to access primary care services. Other significant changes I have introduced include: assessment is now based on people&rsquo;s income after tax and PRSI; allowances <Col N="1320"/>for children and dependants were increased; and account is taken of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent and mortgage payments, child care and travel to work.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In October 2005 the income guidelines for medical cards and GP visit cards were increased by a further 20%. Thus the income guidelines have increased by 29% since 2004. The HSE has publicised these changes and has provided a national information helpline. The executive will continue to encourage people to apply and has made the application process as simple as possible.</P>
        <P>In December 2005 my Department asked the HSE to take account of the welfare, taxation or other changes announced in the budget on the operation of the income guidelines and to identify any changes which may be required to ensure that medical cards and GP visit cards continue to be available to those who need them. I expect to receive a report from the HSE shortly about this matter.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 139, 144 and 157 together.</P>
        <P>Avian influenza, bird flu, is an infectious disease of birds caused by type A strains of the influenza virus. The Department of Agriculture and Food is responsible for controlling avian influenza in birds and mammals other than humans. That Department has put in place a range of measures aimed at maintaining Ireland&rsquo;s avian flu free status.</P>
        <P>The health sector&rsquo;s role in avian flu relates to the human health implications that would arise were there to be an outbreak of avian flu here. My Department is working very closely with the Department of Agriculture and Food in this context and there are ongoing meetings between officials to discuss issues of mutual concern.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department of Agriculture and Food is also an active participant in my Department&rsquo;s <Col N="1321"/>influenza pandemic expert group. A sub-group of the expert group has developed these guidance documents for use in the event of an avian influenza outbreak in animals in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Guidance on the investigation and management of suspected human cases of avian influenza has also been developed and circulated within the health system. These guidance documents are available on the HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre website, <i>www.hpsc.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food is issuing a comprehensive &ldquo;biosecurity information pack&rdquo; to almost 7,500 poultry flockowners who have registered with them. This mailshot includes public health advice on bird flu prepared by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The overall aims of influenza pandemic planning are to reduce mortality and morbidity, and to minimise the resulting disruption to society. However, the consequences of a global pandemic are still likely to be serious. Pandemic planning can only mitigate the effects and my Department and the Health Service Executive are working closely together on pandemic planning. This work is ongoing on a number of fronts, as follows: the influenza pandemic expert group is updating expert guidance; the pandemic influenza operational response plan is being updated in line with the most up to date expert advice. This work is being progressed through working-implementation groups established by the HSE to address actions within the following functional areas &mdash; surveillance, health services, public health measures, vaccines-antivirals etc., communications, laboratories and materials management. My Department is a member of the HSE steering group and is also actively involved in the vaccines-antivirals and communications groups; my Department is establishing a standing interdepartmental committee to consider issues which go beyond the health aspects of an influenza pandemic. This committee will assist with planning for such an emergency and will also be available in the event of an emergency arising; and arrangements to procure a stockpile of H5N1 vaccine for key health care workers and other essential workers are in train. My Department is also actively pursuing an advanced purchase order for a pandemic strain vaccine.</P>
        <P>An emergency supply of more than 45,000 treatment packs of antivirals, Tamiflu, was purchased in 2004. A further 1 million treatment packs of antivirals, Tamiflu, are being stockpiled. A total of 600,000 packs have already been delivered. The remaining 400,000 packs will be delivered this year. Arrangements are also being made to purchase a supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, oseltamivir phosphate powder, to treat children aged between one to five years of age.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Recommendations for the stockpiling of antivirals are kept under constant review by the influenza pandemic expert group. In October 2005, the expert group reviewed recommendations with <Col N="1322"/>regard to stockpiling of zanamivir, Relenza, in addition to oseltamivir, Tamiflu. This was in light of a case report of resistance to Tamiflu. The expert group advised that a quantity of Relenza should be stockpiled. The situation was reviewed again at an expert group meeting last week and this decision was confirmed. My Department is now finalising arrangements for the purchase of this additional stock, including quantities and timeframe for delivery.</P>
        <P>Treatment with antiviral drugs will play an important part in the response to an influenza pandemic, but it is not the only response. Non-pharmaceutical public health interventions aimed at reducing the spread of infection also have an important role. The expert group is currently updating guidance in this area with reference to the latest recommendations from the World Health Organisation.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 141 and 244 together.</P>
        <P>A wide-ranging approach has been adopted by the Health Service Executive to improve access to accident and emergency services, improve patient flows through accident and emergency departments, reduce waiting times, free up acute beds and provide appropriate longer term care for patients outside of the acute hospital setting.</P>
        <P>A particular focus of the action plan has been placed on those patients in acute hospitals who have completed the acute phase of their treatment and are ready for discharge to a more appropriate setting. The HSE has made considerable progress, and is continuing to make sustained efforts, in arranging for the discharge of these patients in order to free up more acute beds for emergency patients. In addition, high dependency beds and intermediate care beds in private nursing homes, along with home care packages, are being used to ensure that patients are appropriately placed.</P><Col N="1323"/>
        <P>Under the action plan, the HSE has contracted 48 high dependency beds in private nursing homes for patients with more demanding care needs while additional step-down facilities for intermediate care have so far helped 582 people to move out of hospital. Additional home care packages and enhanced subventions have facilitated the discharge of 530 people. A total of &euro;6.6 million is being targeted at increasing the level of home support available in the community to avoid people having to be admitted to acute hospitals.</P>
        <P>Within the context of the action plan, the HSE undertook an audit of efficiencies and process. The study was conducted in ten hospitals, and its conclusions point to a number of areas for further improvement. These include: strengthened discharge planning processes; improved clinical decision making at every stage; and better co-ordination of and access to diagnostic services.</P>
        <P>A key action for 2006 for all hospitals with accident and emergency departments will be the full implementation of the efficiency audit recommendations. In tandem with this, a programme of financial incentivisation will be introduced, aimed at rewarding those hospitals that are meeting agreed performance targets and facilitating overall improved performance.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive will continue to maintain a focus on the implementation of system-wide measures to further improve the delivery of accident and emergency services.</P>

	<P>My Department is advised by the Health Service Executive that the reason for the discrepancy between the INO figures and the HSE figures for the numbers of people waiting on trolleys in accident and emergency departments is that the figures are compiled at different times of the day. The INO figures are collected at 8 a.m. each day, while the HSE figures are collected at 2 p.m.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy&rsquo;s question in regard to waiting lists relates to the management and <Col N="1324"/>delivery of health and personal social services, which is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004, the parliamentary affairs division of the executive has been asked to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>The total number of speech and language therapists by Health Service Executive area, including voluntary hospitals and intellectual disability agencies, at end September 2005 is shown in the following table.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Employment information with regard to community care areas in Dublin is also shown. It should be noted that these latter figures are exclusive of speech and language therapists employed in any hospitals and intellectual disability agencies located within the community care areas. All figures are expressed in whole time equivalent, WTE, terms. The Deputy will also wish to be aware that the total number of speech and language therapists employed at end September 2005 represents an increase of 162, WTE, or 42% over end-December 2000 figures.</P>

	<P Just="Left">In 2005, the T&aacute;naiste met the Irish Heart Foundation to discuss, <i>inter alia</i>, services for patients with stroke. Following that meeting, the foundation, with the support of a grant of &euro;70,000 from my Department, convened a national stroke review group, NSRG. The NSRG has representatives from the HSE &mdash; population health &mdash; and from a wide range of relevant professional and voluntary organisations &mdash; community health nurses, speech therapists, volunteer scheme etc. The group developed a research protocol based on methods used for an audit of hospital and community services in the UK.</P>
        <P>The research is a national audit of stroke services, to include an audit of hospital-based stroke services: organisational aspects of care in acute hospitals, especially reorganised stroke care, and a clinical audit of stroke care, involving review of clinical case notes for a selected sample of patients; and an audit of community-based stroke services, to include surveys of GPs, allied health professionals, patients and carers, and nursing homes.</P>
        <P>These audits will provide excellent baseline information on which to benchmark progress in developing stroke services. The NSRG will monitor progress of the research and use the findings to make recommendations on the development of stroke services. My Department and the Health Service Executive will consider policy implications in the light of this national service audit.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 146 and 241 together.</P>
        <P>In an era of evidence based medicine, we must also have evidence based management. It is widely agreed that the most developed system for assessing comparative efficiency and for creating incentives within the acute hospital sector, and for encouraging good performance, is casemix. It <Col N="1326"/>assists hospital managers to define their workload, measure their productivity and assess quality. It is accepted that it is the only system capable of dealing with the complexities of acute hospital management.</P>
        <P>Casemix is now an international system, used in most countries with a developed health care system. It is constantly evolving to keep pace with changing clinical and management practice. A casemix programme was initiated here in 1991 and it is open and inclusive, with all stakeholders actively encouraged to participate in and contribute to the process. My Department works with hospitals to implement suggested improvements in a manner that enhances the consistency and accuracy of the system. At local level, hospitals are encouraged to establish structures encompassing both management and clinicians and advise on the operation and implementation of the programme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Here, casemix is used as part of the budgetary process in order that hospitals are fully funded for the patients they actually treat. Full account is taken of patient complexity and all unique local issues, such as long-stay patients that cannot be discharged, high cost cases, specialist hospitals versus general hospitals, teaching hospitals versus non-teaching, urban versus rural, etc. All benchmarks within the system, including cost-per-case, are generated by direct reference to each hospital&rsquo;s peer group. The programme in Ireland is unique in that it is budget-neutral, with all funding deducted going back into the acute hospital system.</P>
        <P>Many hospitals that lose funding under the programme review their management of patient services and go on to provide better services to more patients and consequently gain funding in the following years. The benefit of casemix is that hospitals can receive recognition and funding for all their patients, taking into account their cost and clinical complexity. The only loser in this process is inefficiency.</P>
        <P>A major review of the entire national casemix programme has taken place in consultation with all stakeholders and is actively being implemented. This review led to a complete modernisation of the system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am committed to rewarding good performance and as casemix is the most internationally accepted performance related acute hospital activity programme, it is agreed between my Department and the Health Service Executive that casemix will be used as a central pillar in acute hospital funding policy.</P>

	<P>Supply shortages of particular drugs usually arise from regulatory or manufacturing difficulties. These shortages are usually unforeseeable and of short duration. In many cases, there are already reimbursable alternative products available through the community drug schemes or, in some instances, only some dosages in the product range are unavailable.</P>
        <P>As soon as my Department becomes aware of shortages in vital medicines, contact is made with the company concerned and every effort is made to source an alternative product from a reliable source. As happened in the recent case of injectable vitamin B12, where there were no licensed reimbursable alternatives, another product was sourced and is being reimbursed. Where the alternative product is unlicensed in Ireland, reimbursement for medical cardholders is a matter for the local area of the HSE. There is a separate reimbursement protocol for drug payment scheme patients.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The National Council on Specialist Palliative Care was established arising from the report of the national advisory committee on palliative care which is the blueprint for the development of palliative care services. The terms of reference of this council include examining, monitoring and making recommendations on the development and implementation of national policy on palliative care services for adults and children in Ireland to provide a high-quality palliative care service with equity of access based on need and availability across all regions and in all care settings.</P>
        <P>Since October 2001, this Department provided additional revenue funding in excess of &euro;16 million to the former health boards to develop palliative care services in line with the recommendations in the report. In 2006, a further &euro;9 million is allocated to the Health Service Executive, HSE, for specialist palliative care, this figure includes the provision of 24 extended care beds this year in Our Lady&rsquo;s, Harold&rsquo;s Cross. Some &euro;2 <Col N="1328"/>million of this is for the development of palliative home care and community based initiatives throughout the country. This level of funding will also facilitate the HSE to develop action plans in accordance with the recently published Needs Assessment on Palliative Care for Children, and to introduce targeted projects which will provide experience-based knowledge and baseline information to assist in the further development of services. In 2007 an additional &euro;4 million is to be allocated to develop the service, giving a full-year cost of &euro;13 million.</P>
        <P>Under the Health Act 2004, the HSE has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for the provision of palliative care services. At present the HSE is going through a process of evaluating the proposals received from local areas in relation to community based initiatives.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Sleep apnoea is a condition that interrupts breathing while asleep. This is usually caused by an obstruction blocking the back of the throat so that the air cannot reach the patient&rsquo;s <Col N="1329"/>lungs. The cessation of breathing automatically forces the sufferer to wake up in order to start breathing again. This can happen many times during the night, making it hard for the body to get enough oxygen, and preventing the sufferer from obtaining enough good quality sleep.</P>
        <P>Sleep apnoea is not a notifiable or reportable disease in any of the formal reporting mechanisms or registers in Ireland but it is suggested that there may be something of the order of 4,500 to 5,000 people diagnosed with the condition. It ranges from mild to quite severe. This condition can lead to a reduction in quality of life.</P>
        <P>Diagnosis is made by way of clinical and other examinations and comprehensive diagnosis includes examination of electrical activity in the brain, eye movements, heart rate, respiratory effort and blood oxygen levels. Treatment varies depending on the degree and severity of the illness.</P>
        <P>The management and delivery of health and personal social services is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004 and my Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 152 and 221 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Madden report on post mortem practice and procedure, which I published recently, contains some 50 recommendations. Some of the recommendations are exclusively the remit of my Department, for example, the formulation of human tissue legislation, others are a matter for the HSE, for example, an audit of organs retained in hospitals, and others fall under the aegis of other agencies, for example, the coroners' legislation is a matter for the Department of Justice Equality and Law Reform. My Department is examining each of the recommendations in consultation with relevant bodies. I have asked for an action plan to be prepared for the implementation of the recommendations and progress made will be closely monitored.</P>
        <P>EU Directive 2004/23/EC which sets quality and safety standards for procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of tissues and cells is in the process of being transposed into Irish law. This legislation will only deal with tissues and cells for human application.</P>
        <P>As regards stillbirths and maternity hospitals, Dr. Madden had access to all of the information collected by the Dunne inquiry, with particular reference to the issue of pituitary glands which is dealt with in chapter six of her report.</P>
        <P>As recommended in the report, I am establishing a working group to examine issues pertaining to non-paediatric post mortems, that is, babies who died before or at birth, minors and adults. I have asked Dr. Madden to chair the group and will announce the full membership shortly.</P>

	<P>Robust infection control measures and improved hospital hygiene have been identified as key actions required to control the spread of health care associated infections, HCAIs. To assess the extent of good hygiene practices in hospitals the first ever national hygiene audit of acute hospitals was carried out last year. The results of the first hygiene audit will form the basis for the changes that are required in both work environments and work practices so as to meet the highest possible standards of cleanliness in hospital settings. The HSE has decided to repeat the national audit commencing next month in order to assess the extent of the <Col N="1332"/>improvements made at hospital level since the inspections last year.</P>
        <P>I do not accept the criticism about the second audit. There can be no possible excuse on medical or administrative grounds for now suspending the hygiene audit. Staff in hospitals around the country are working hard to improve hygiene standards. It would be unfair to both patients and staff to suspend the hygiene audit. Now that a certain momentum has been created to tackle hospital hygiene it is reasonable to measure the improvements made and to identify areas where further actions may be necessary.</P>

        <P Just="Left">For the purposes of the surveillance, prevention and control of this infection the Health Protection Surveillance Centre collects data on MRSA bacteraemia, also known as bloodstream infection or blood poisoning, as part of the European antimicrobial resistance surveillance system, EARSS. The EARSS collects data on the first episode of blood stream infection per patient per quarter. It was designed to allow comparison of antimicrobial resistance data between countries and possibly regions but not between hospitals. Data in respect of the first quarter of 2006 is not yet available.</P>
        <P>The publication of the revised SARI guidelines on the control and prevention of MRSA in hospitals and in the community, the Clean Hands Campaign, the national hygiene audits and the development of national standards in relation to infection control and hospital hygiene are some of the measures aimed at bringing about change in the hospital system. The HSE has announced that the second national hygiene audit of acute hospitals will commence in February and will assess the extent of the improvements made at hospital level since the inspections last year.</P>
        <P>I recently wrote to the Health Service Executive in relation to the communication of infor<Col N="1334"/>mation to patients infected with MRSA, the discharge from hospital of patients with MRSA and the national policy on hospital visiting times. The HSE is presently considering how best to ensure that good practice and the proper procedures are followed in such circumstances. It is now a matter for the HSE to continue to develop and implement the necessary strategies needed to ensure the effective control of health care associated infections including MRSA.</P>

        <P>The Health Service Executive has established an investigation team to comprehensively review services provided by the executive to Ms Evelyn Joel over the period January 2004 to January 2006.

To review the scope, range and level of services provided by the HSE to Ms. Evelyn Joel, during the period January 2004 to January 2006 having regard to her medical condition and circumstances; 2. To review the delivery and co-ordination of these services to Ms Joel; 3. To review existing protocols and procedures in the delivery of these services; 4. Having regard to the review findings to make recommendations as appropriate and to submit its report to the Health Service Executive; and 5. To complete the report as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>I expect that the review team will comprehensively examine all services provided by the HSE to Ms Evelyn Joel. I am not in a position to predict how long it will take to complete its review.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 163 and 349 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The youth homelessness strategy was published on 31 October 2001. The strategy provides a strategic framework for youth homelessness to be tackled on a national basis. The goal of the strategy is &ldquo;to reduce and if possible eliminate youth homelessness through preventative strategies and where a child becomes homeless to ensure that he or she benefits from a comprehensive range of services aimed at reintegrating him or her into his or her community as quickly as possible.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Under the strategy, the former health boards, now the Health Service Executive, HSE, have lead responsibility for implementation of the strategy and they prepared detailed action plans to address youth homelessness in line with the objectives set out in the strategy. During 2005, my Department requested the HSE to undertake a review of the action plans to ascertain the extent of their implementation. A report on this matter is awaited.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition, the National Children&rsquo;s Office, now part of the recently established Office of the Minister for Children, had been assigned responsibility by the Cabinet committee in relation to co-ordinating and monitoring the implementation of the youth homelessness strategy, YHS. In this regard, the youth homelessness strategy monitoring committee, YHSMC, under the chairmanship of the aforementioned National Children&rsquo;s Office and representative of the child care policy unit of my Department and other relevant stakeholders, was established.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The committee identified key areas, which required attention to drive the implementation of the strategy in an effective, co-ordinated way, on a nationwide basis. A number of sub-groups were established as follows: Inter-agency co-ordination and linkages the programme of action for children office, a unit within the health board structure with a co-ordinating function across all health board regions which agreed to take on the co-ordination and linkages functions within the HSE arena. The office of the Minister for Children will continue to deal with cross-sectoral co-ordination issues. Leaving and aftercare national guidelines on leaving and aftercare were approved by the YHS monitoring committee and were circulated by my Department to the former health boards in July 2004. The purpose of the guidelines is to assist the HSE in developing its leaving and aftercare policies with the aim of, <i>inter alia</i>, protecting those leaving care who may be vulnerable to homelessness. The statistics sub-group recommended the introduction of a new <Col N="1337"/>youth homelessness contact form as a way of gathering more reliable and consistent statistics. My Department circulated the form to the former health boards in December 2003 for introduction on 1 January 2004. The contact form provides more information than was previously collected, and revised tables on youth homelessness are being included in the interim minimum dataset for 2004. The revised tables include new categories for reasons for homelessness such as young <Col N="1338"/>person abandoned by parent-caregiver, young person running away from care placement and family dispute-breakdown. The revised tables also examine the reason given for homelessness with the outcome, and the reason given for homelessness with the age of the young person. The full statistics for 2004 have not been compiled yet. The interim minimum dataset for 2003 provides the following reasons for children becoming homeless:</P><Col N="1337"/>

          <i>Education and Training</i>
        </P>
        <P Just="Left">A sub-group was established to look at the education and training objectives of the youth homelessness strategy. Membership of the group included representatives of the statutory and voluntary education and health sectors. It was agreed that there was a need to look at a broad understanding of the homelessness process to understand the potential impact of education and training elements as part of the solution for young people who are homeless. Consideration was given to: (i) the preventive aspect of educational and training interventions; (ii) processes to ensure that education-training elements form part of the ongoing support of children and young people who are homeless; and (iii) the role of education-training in the prevention-reinte<Col N="1338"/>gration of children in the care or detention systems.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The group finalised its report and it was sent to the relevant Departments, the National Educational Welfare Board and the Health Service Executive on 21 June 2005.</P>
        <P el="2">
          <i>Information and Advocacy</i>
        </P>
        <P>A sub-group was established to examine information and advocacy in the context of the youth homelessness strategy, with a particular focus on making relevant information more accessible to young homeless people or young people at risk of becoming homeless. The group finalised its report and it was sent to my Department, the Health Service Executive and Comhairle on 21 November 2005.</P>
        <P>Since the publication of the youth homelessness strategy, significant progress has been <Col N="1339"/>made, including: approximately &euro;12 million has been allocated by the Department of Health and Children to the former health boards for the development of youth homelessness services since 2001; 195 new whole-time equivalent posts have been filled across the Health Service Executive, up to 31 December 2004. Although these posts impact on youth homelessness services, they are not all exclusively dedicated to youth homelessness services; 11 new units have opened nationwide; and over 42 new-extended services, including aftercare, have been developed around the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Health Service Executive is responsible for the management and delivery of health and personal social services. In recent years many services have been developed to counter the problem of youth homelessness in the Dublin region. The crisis intervention service for young people out of home is based in the city centre and includes an outreach service, emergency out of hours social work service, reception centre, residential units and a day centre. A director for homelessness was appointed in the former Eastern Regional Health Authority, Health Service Executive Eastern area, in 2000. I am advised that this is now the role of the national care group manager social inclusion since the establishment of the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>In Cork, Liberty Street House became fully operational in 2003, and acts as a focal point for youth homelessness services in Cork. The centre provides a variety of services &mdash; social work, medical, financial &mdash; for young people out of home or in danger of becoming homeless.</P>
        <P>Services for homeless children are also provided by the other Health Service Executive areas and generally these are provided as part of the child protection and welfare services. The services provided include units for young people out of home supported lodgings, and the provision of out-reach, leaving and after care services.</P>

        <P>An agreement is in place between the Department of Health and Children, the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, and the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of Ireland, APMI, which sets out the supply terms and prices of medicines supplied to the health services. The agreement covers all reimbursable prescription medicines in the general medical services and community drug schemes, and all medicines supplied to hospitals and the Health Service Executive. A price freeze is in place in regard to prices charged for products supplied under the terms of the agreement.</P>
        <P>The original manufacturers of the product referred to by the Deputy divested ownership of the product to another company which subsequently increased the price of the product without prior consultation with my Department and in breach of the above agreement.</P>
        <P>Negotiations are currently taking place with the company concerned with a view to reaching a satisfactory conclusion.

        <P Just="Left">In April 2004 funding of &euro;500,000 was allocated to the Southern Health Board under the cardiovascular health strategy. The funding enabled the board to establish a consultant-led cardiology service for patients in Kerry for the first time. A consultant cardiologist was appointed in March 2005 by way of a sessional partnership between Bon Secours Hospital Tralee and Kerry General Hospital. This consultant has resigned from his post, as of 1 June 2006. This appointment has been recently re-advertised by the Bons Secour Group. An application for a full time consultant cardiologist for Kerry General Hospital has been with the NHO since May 2005. The HSE southern area are awaiting approval and confirmation of funding to proceed with the appointment. The provision of additional consultant posts will proceed within the context of the restructuring of the acute hospital services and the negotiation of a new contract for hospital consultants.</P>

	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. Accordingly, the Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>There are currently three rates of subvention payable, that is, &euro;114.30, &euro;152.40 and &euro;190.50 for the three levels of dependency which are medium, high and maximum. Included in these payments is an increase of 25% which came into effect in April 2001.</P>
        <P>The HSE has discretion to pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual&rsquo;s level of dependency in a case, for example, where personal funds are exhausted. The average rate of subvention paid by the HSE <Col N="1343"/>generally exceeds the current approved basic rates. The application of the subvention scheme is a matter for the HSE in the context of meeting increasing demands for subvention, subject to the provisions of the Health Act 2004. An additional &euro;20 million has been provided for subvention payments this year including addressing the variations in payments in different areas.</P>
        <P>The broad policy questions relating to long-term care have been examined by an inter-departmental group on long-term care which has now reported to Government. Among the issues it has examined is the question of the appropriate level of State support for long-term residential care, which includes the issue raised by the Deputy of regional variations in costs of care. The Government is now considering this report.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">According to the most recent Health Service Executive-employers agency survey of nursing resources, recruitment remains ahead of resignations and retirements. Employers reported that 1,131 vacancies existed at 30 September 2005 &mdash; an increase of 13 compared to the previous quarter. This gives a vacancy rate of 3.24%. The vacancy figures should be seen in the context of overall employment which now stands at 34,878 whole time equivalent nurses and midwives, 41,655 individuals, a 36% increase since 1997.</P>
        <P>There will always be some level of movement due to resignations, retirements and nurses availing of opportunities to change employment and locations. There is an additional pressure this year due to the lack of domestic nursing graduates in autumn 2005 because of the move from a three year diploma to a four year degree programme to train nurses. The HSE&rsquo;s nursing and midwifery recruitment and retention national project is monitoring the situation on an ongoing basis. During 2005 the HSE has conducted a successful recruitment drive in India and the Philippines. The HSE is also targeting inactive nurses for recruitment through an extensive advertising campaign. The financial arrangements for those undertaking back to nursing courses were improved last year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A combination of agency nurses and overtime working provides an additional input of nursing resources to cope with difficulties arising in the <Col N="1344"/>provision of services while employers continue the recruitment process to fill vacancies. It should be noted that in addition to covering vacancies, agency nurses are also used to &ldquo;special&rdquo; &mdash; one to one nursing &mdash; patients and clients and to cover for permanent nursing staff availing of various leave entitlements. The HSE is currently finalising the compilation of data on the full cost of agency nursing and overtime in 2005. The latest available data from the HSE is that up November 2005 the estimated cost of agency nursing was &euro;45.65 million and nursing overtime &euro;44.57 million.</P>
        <P>I am not sure of the Deputy&rsquo;s source of data relating to numbers of Irish trained nurses leaving the country each year. It is my understanding that to suggest 1,500 nurses leave to work abroad is a gross over estimation of the true figure. Irish nurses and midwives who wish to work abroad are required by the authorities in the host country to obtain a verification of their nursing registration from An Bord Altranais. Figures supplied by An Bord Altranais show that 689 Irish nurses received verifications to work abroad in 2005. That an Irish nursing qualification is welcomed abroad is an attraction for some young people considering their career options. The data from An Bord Altranais shows that Australia is the most popular destination for Irish nurses. However, it should be noted that Australia is a very popular destination for Irish people generally in their 20s and 30s. It is my understanding that many of the Irish nurses who work abroad return to Ireland each year having gained valuable experience in overseas health systems.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Department of Health and Children referred the article referred to by the Deputy to the Irish expert body on fluorides and health in November last. The Irish expert body on fluorides and health was established to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the forum on fluoridation and to advise the Minister for Health and Children on new and emerging issues including any new research.</P>
        <P>The expert body has advised the Department that the article in question was tabled at the expert body&rsquo;s plenary meeting on 30 November 2005.</P>
        <P Just="Left">From its inception, the expert body applies the fundamental scientific tenet that any single piece of scientific evidence by itself remains hypothetical unless it can be repeated or confirmed by other scientists. Therefore, any such evidence must be submitted to examination by other scientists, usually by publication in recognised scientific journals after the submission has been approved by independent referees. This pro<Col N="1346"/>cedure reflects a global scientific standard, adopted across all scientific disciplines. The peer review process provides both a rigorous evaluation on the procedures used in research and the conclusions drawn, as well as ensuring reproducibility of results. All decisions taken by the expert body are thus informed by the best available and most reliable scientific evidence. This approach is consistent with the methods used by the forum on fluoridation, 2002.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The United States National Library of Medicine provides the international gold standard for all scientific publications.

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Based on information supplied by the Health Service Executive, HSE, the number of persons covered for services under the general medical services, GMS, scheme in 1997 was 1,292,852. The cost of providing general practitioner services and drugs and medicines to a population of this scale under the GMS scheme in 2006 is estimated to be in the region of &euro;1.7 billion. This figure is based on the HSE&rsquo;s estimate of the cost of providing these services to medical card holders in 2006 and assumes the same GMS population profile as exists at present. It should also be noted that the estimate does not take into account the costs of other health services provided free of charge to holders of medical cards.</P>
        <P>The following estimates are based on the capitation rates payable in 2004 to general practitioners, the cost of drugs and medicines and fees paid to pharmacists and include an estimate in respect of payments which would be made to GMS GPs for practice support and other allowances. No allowance has been made in these figures for rate changes which might result from the June 2005 recommendations of the Labour Relations Commission or any additional costs which might result from future contractual negotiations.</P>
        <P>The estimated additional cost of providing medical cards to all those aged under five years not currently covered by this benefit would be in the region of &euro;66 million.</P>
        <P>In relation to the population cohort of persons aged 70 years and over, I understand that the Deputy is inquiring about the cost of providing services under the GMS scheme. GMS GPs are in receipt of enhanced capitation rates for 116,210 persons in this age category at an estimated cost of &euro;239 million. Standard capitation rates are paid in respect of 211,228 persons who held medical cards prior to reaching 70 years of age at an estimated cost of &euro;323 million.</P>

There has also been a marked increase in the numbers of children in relative foster care. The number of children in relative foster care has increased from 39 children in 1990 to 1,237 in 2003. General foster care accounted for 2,084 children in 1990 but has risen to 2,718 in 2003. The number of children in residential care has declined to 441 children in 2003 compared to 756 in 1990. This shift of care provision from residential to fostering and particularly fostering with relatives is an intentional and positive direction.</P>
        <P>There are many factors which lead to a child entering the care system ranging from respite breaks on a voluntary basis due to the ill health of parent or carer to severe cases of sexual abuse or neglect. Family support services may not always, therefore, be a sufficient response to protect the welfare of some children, for example, where there are chronic addiction problems, serious criminality, violence in the family, a previous history of physical or sexual abuse.</P>
        <P>The past 15 years has witnessed an increasing awareness of child abuse as a phenomenon in Irish society as evidenced by a number of high profile inquiries. The findings and recommendations emanating from these inquiries have informed and shaped current child protection policy and procedures and the legislative and statutory basis for dealing with children at risk has been strengthened. With increased societal awareness of child abuse accompanied by a better recognition of abuse and higher professional standards there has been a related increase in child protection referrals and reports.</P><Col N="1349"/>
        <P>The upward trend in the number of children in care is not solely an Irish phenomenon. A report commissioned by the HSE in 2004, Child Care and Family Support Services: International Comparisons, found that rates for children in care in Ireland are lower than in many comparator jurisdictions such as Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland.</P>
        <P>The majority of children are in care as a result of a care order. Children entering the care system via the child protection and legal system are subjected to a multi-disciplinary process that has a clear assessment and threshold. Judicial decision to grant an order is impartial, based on an informed analysis of fact and all salient issues as to what is in the best interests of the child. While the HSE endeavours to sustain a child within its family of origin wherever possible, the welfare of the child is of paramount importance.</P>
        <P>The dominant focus in child care services since the early 1990&rsquo;s has been on the protection and care of children who are at risk. More recently, the policy focus has shifted to a more preventive approach to child welfare, involving support to families and individual children, aimed at avoiding the need for further more serious interventions later on.</P>
        <P>The HSE directly provides or funds a range of diversified targeted parenting interventions throughout the country. Access to these services is often by referral from a statutory or voluntary service and participants are likely to be known to child and family services. Family support programmes are provided by services such as the community mothers, family support workers, teen parents support projects and Springboard projects, and encompass specific interventions such as the Parents Plus programme, the Family First parenting initiative as well as a range of general parenting programmes and supports.</P>
        <P>In recognition of the importance of family support services my Department established a review of family support services in 2003. This review will inform the planning process and ensure the balanced future development of services provision. A steering group which included Department of Health and Children officials and nominees of the former health board Chief Executive Officers Group was appointed to manage the review. A consultative forum, representative of the major stakeholders in family support, both voluntary and statutory, was appointed to support and advise the steering group.</P>
        <P>The family support strategy is the final strand of this extensive review. The strategy is a blueprint for the future development and delivery of family support initiatives. The strategy sets out a commitment to expanding family support services and refocusing child welfare budgets and services in order to provide a more appropriate balance between safeguarding and supportive programmes. It is anticipated that the strategy will be completed and published in early 2006.</P><Col N="1350"/>
        <P>An additional &euro;8 million has been included in the HSE vote in 2006 to facilitate the further development of child protection and family support services by the HSE, in particular early intervention and preventative services and to allow for the implementation of further provisions of the Children Act 2001.</P>

	<P>The 2003 public health doctors agreement was negotiated between my Department, the Health Service Executive, HSE, and the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, the representative body of public health doctors. This agreement allowed for 60 posts of director of public health medicine, DPH, specialist in public health medicine, SPHM, 30 posts of specialist registrars, SpR, 94 senior medical officer, SMO, posts and a maximum of 86 area medical officer, AMO, posts. It was agreed that no further AMOs would be recruited.</P>
        <P>A joint implementation group, JIG, comprising representatives of the Department of Health and Children, the HSE and the IMO, was established in 2003 to oversee the implementation of this agreement. Since then this group has overseen competitions to fill specialist registrars, principal medical officers and senior medical officer posts. More than &euro;13 million was provided in 2003 for the implementation of the agreement and while most of this funding was issued on a once-off basis in respect of retrospection, the ongoing costs of this agreement will be more than &euro;7 million per year.</P>
        <P>The competitions that were organised to fill all senior medical officer vacancies failed to yield a sufficient number of suitably qualified candidates. While my Department has no direct role to play in filling these posts it has suggested, through the joint implementation group, that the remaining vacancies in this grade should be advertised both nationally and internationally. The IMO, however, is opposed to this suggestion and wants the HSE to fill these vacancies through confined competition.</P>
        <P>Currently, there is a total of 18 vacancies for public health doctors throughout the country. Of these, there are 15 vacancies for specialists in public health medicine in various HSE areas. I have been informed by the Public Appointments Service that it is currently in the process of organising competitions to fill these high level posts to be held within the next six to eight weeks. Interviews for the two principal medical officer vacancies are to be held in February and post-interview selection is in progress for one senior medical officer post.</P>
        <P>On 16 January, management attended an LRC hearing, initiated by the IMO, to discuss the vac<Col N="1352"/>ancies issue. The chairman recommended that both sides meet, outside of the LRC, to ascertain the exact number of vacancies. Both sides will then return to the LRC for a further hearing.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Food safety legislation in Ireland derives in the main from our membership of the European Union and in this regard on 1 January 2006, new European food and feed hygiene legislation came into effect. The hygiene package is a legislative package which merges, harmonises and simplifies detailed and complex hygiene requirements previously contained in a number of Council directives and creates a single transparent hygiene policy which is applicable to all food operators. The principal objective of the new general and specific hygiene rules is to ensure a high level of consumer protection with regard to food safety. To this end an integrated approach is necessary to ensure food safety from the place of primary production up to and including placing on the market or export.</P>
        <P>The hygiene package is applicable to and binding in its entirety on all members states and thus food business operators in all member states must comply with its requirements. While the same rules must be complied with across the EU, it is a matter for each member state to determine the particular enforcement provisions and penalties within its jurisdiction. My Department is finalising a statutory instrument which will include the necessary enforcement provisions to enable auth<Col N="1353"/>orised officers to react to and deal with situations posing a food safety risk.</P>
        <P>The hygiene package sets out specific requirements for food stalls, mobile food vans and other temporary and mobile food businesses such as those operating at markets. Requirements relate to the site, construction and condition of the premises, along with the need to make provision for facilities for hand-washing, cleaning, appropriate food contact surfaces, hygienic storage of food, temperature control and waste disposal. While the primary responsibility for food safety rests with food business operators, it is a matter for the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, as competent authority for the enforcement of food safety legislation, to ensure compliance with the relevant legislation. The authority carries out its enforcement functions through service contracts with official agencies. Country markets are therefore subject to inspection by the FSAI&rsquo;s official agencies, for example, environmental health officers from the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>To ensure that the stalls operating at such markets meet the highest food safety and hygiene standards, the FSAI have prepared a guidance note on food stalls in association with environmental health officers and Irish food market traders. I am satisfied that these legislative requirements are sufficient to ensure that food safety is not compromised and that public health is protected.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 195, 212 and 245 together.</P>
        <P>Incidence and mortality rates for cervical cancer in Ireland are in the mid-range of rates observed across Europe. Data supplied by the national cancer registry for the period 1994 to 2002 shows that the average annual incidence of cervical cancer in this country was 170 and the average annual number of deaths from the disease was 80.</P>
        <P>I am committed to the national roll-out of the cervical screening programme in line with international best practice. An international expert examined the feasibility and implications of a national roll out of a cervical screening programme. The examination included an evaluation of the current pilot programme, quality assurance, laboratory capacity and the establishment of national governance arrangements. Following the publication of this report my Department undertook a consultative process with relevant professional and advocacy stakeholders. The consultative process is completed and there is considerable support for the programme roll-out and the need for improved organisation, quality assurance and governance arrangements to support a national roll-out.</P>
        <P>I made available an additional &euro;9 million to the Health Service Executive for cancer services development in 2006, including the continuation of preparations for a national programme. The service plan of the executive provides for such preparation which, I understand, will involve improvements in quality assurance, new technology, training, and the creation of a national population register. I will meet the Irish Cancer <Col N="1357"/>Society tomorrow to discuss, <i>inter alia</i>, a national cervical screening programme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>While Ireland has experienced an increase in the incidence of asthma, I would point out to the Deputy that the incidence in Ireland is similar to that in other developed countries. A number of initiatives have been taken in recent years with regard to this condition. These initiatives include research and the co-ordination of an EU policy on asthma. While my Department has no plans to develop a specific asthma strategy, I understand that the HSE is developing measures on asthma as part of its actions on chronic illnesses.</P>
        <P>Prior to 1971, there were inadequate provisions for people with excessive medical and medicines expenses. In 1971 the long-term illness scheme, LTI, was introduced whereby the Health Service Executive may arrange for the supply without charge of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with a specified con<Col N="1358"/>dition for the treatment of that condition. The LTI does not cover general practitioner fees or hospital co-payments. The conditions are mental handicap, mental illness for people under 16 only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism, conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia.</P>
        <P>From 1971 onwards people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In November 2004, the Government provided funding for an additional 30,000 medical cards, and for 200,000 new GP visit cards, which allow holders to receive general practitioner services free of charge. In June last year, I simplified the means test for both medical and GP visit cards. It is now based on an applicant&rsquo;s and spouse&rsquo;s income after income tax and PRSI and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, child care and travel to work. On 13 October 2005, I announced that the income guidelines for both medical and GP visit cards would be increased by an additional 20%. This means the income guidelines are now 29% higher than prior to these measures.</P>
        <P>Non-medical card holders and people with conditions not covered under the LTI can use the drug payment scheme, DPS. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;85 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme is user-friendly and significantly improves cash flow for families and individuals for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines. In addition, medical expenses above a set threshold may be offset against tax.</P>
        <P>The introduction of the medical card and DPS ensures that no individual or family is faced with undue financial hardship as a result of expenditure on drugs and medicines. Consequently, there are no plans to extend the LTI.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I have previously expressed concern regarding the increasing cost of the State drug schemes and the need to ensure better value for money for this expenditure. All aspects of the drug delivery system, from the manufacturer to the patient, are under review. A number of issues, <Col N="1359"/>including access to generic drugs and supply chain costs such as pharmacy mark-ups, are being considered with a view to addressing the rapidly rising costs in medicines expenditure both by the State and by private individuals. No single measure will achieve this by itself. International experience has shown that this is a very difficult task as the sophistication and range of treatments continue to increase along, quite justifiably, with increased expectations on the part of patients.</P>
        <P>With regard to increased use of generic medicines, it is my intention to give patients and, ultimately, the taxpayer, as the biggest buyer of drugs, better access to generic drugs where this is possible and appropriate. My Department has begun preparatory work for the introduction of structures appropriate to the Irish drug schemes. In addition, negotiations will shortly commence for a new national pricing and supply agreement with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA; and the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of Ireland, APMI, for supply of medicines to the health services and it is intended to address this issue within that agreement.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 206 and 217 together.</P>
        <P>The new contract will set out in detail formal employment arrangements for consultants practicing exclusively in the public sector. Its key features are as follows.</P>
        <P>Consultant-provided service is to be delivered by teams of consultants, where the consultants have a substantial and direct involvement in the diagnosis, delivery of care and overall management of patients. As part of a consultant-provided service, consultants will treat all patients and will be remunerated exclusively on a salaried basis. They will not receive additional remuneration for treatment delivered to insured patients. A commitment to public sector service alone will mean that consultants will treat patients only within the public hospital or public community facility.</P>
        <P>Each consultant&rsquo;s commitments will be set out in an annual work plan, supported by a series of performance indicators and review mechanisms. Work plans will be in line with clinical need, the nature and volume of clinical workload and the 24-7 nature of health services.</P><Col N="1362"/>
        <P>Consultants will work a 39-hour commitment over the 24-7 period agreed and detailed in the work plan, varying by specialty and location. Work plans will follow a framework developed at national level and will be agreed and reviewed annually by consultants, clinical managers and management.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Each work plan will detail specific duties, such as emergency commitments, operating time, ward rounds, outpatient clinics and diagnostic work, regular on-call commitments and involvement in supporting professional activities, audit and competence assurance.</P>
        <P>Each consultant will work as an integral part of a multidisciplinary team which is led and managed by a clinical director. As a member of the team, consultants will make decisions regarding the care, treatment and discharge of patients during the absence of a consultant colleague who has lead responsibility for such patients. As a member of a team, each consultant will be incentivised to increase productivity through a performance-related awards scheme.</P>
        <P>The primary role of a clinical director will be to manage and plan how services are delivered. Clinical directors will be appointed by the employing authority, will develop and implement protocols for service delivery, will have significant responsibility for how services are delivered and will be accountable for the use of resources. Contracts can be constructed for certain consultants that will allow for a defined and measurable commitment to medical education and training and research.</P>

	<P Just="Left">There are increasing demands on the acute hospital system to provide more treatments and to provide more advanced and specialised procedures. The capacity of the acute hospital system continues to increase in response to these demands. In 2001, the average number of inpatient beds and day places available for treatment of patients in public acute hospitals was 12,145. The hospital returns for 2005 show that this number has risen to 13,255, an increase of 1,110 inpatient beds and day places. Some 90% of treatment places in acute hospitals are overnight inpatient beds. To these must be added approximately 1,700 acute beds in private hospitals to give the full extent of acute hospital capacity in the country, which is nearly 15,000 beds.</P>
        <P Just="Left">
          
          An Agreed Programme for Government includes a commitment to expand public hospital beds in line with the health strategy commitment to increase total acute hospital bed capacity by 3,000 by 2011. Substantial investment in additional bed capacity in acute hospitals has already taken place. Funding has been provided to open an additional 900 inpatient beds or day places in public acute hospitals. In addition, a further 450 acute beds or day places are in various stages of planning and development under the capital investment framework 2005-09. In July 2005 I announced an initiative which will provide up to an additional 1,000 beds for public patients in public hospitals over the next five years. The Health Service Executive has been asked to develop an implementation plan and to prioritise proposals with reference to the public hospitals&rsquo; requirement for additional bed capacity.</P>
        <P>The Estimates for 2006 include &euro;60 million to open new acute hospital facilities, some of which will provide additional beds. These additional beds or day places will go some way to achieving our commitment in the programme for Government to increase total acute hospital capacity.</P>
        <P>My Department, in conjunction with the HSE, will review public capacity requirements in the acute hospital sector in light of developments since the health strategy was published. The HSE continues to implement the various measures in the ten-point accident and emergency plan. These measures take a wide-ranging approach and are aimed at improving access to accident and emergency services, improving patient flows through accident and emergency departments, freeing up acute beds and providing appropriate longer-term care for patients outside of the acute hospital setting. My Department will continue to work with <Col N="1364"/>the HSE to ensure that patients who require acute care receive that care in the most appropriate setting.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Archbishop Brady replied to the Minister of State confirming that the Minister of State&rsquo;s letter had been discussed at a meeting of the Irish Episcopal Conference. The archbishop welcomed the inter-agency review process and confirmed that when contacted each bishop would liaise with the HSE. He added that the church was anxious to outline how recent church initiatives met the recommendations outlined in the Ferns Report. Each bishop has written individually to either the Minister or the HSE to confirm his willingness to work with the HSE in the interagency review process in ensuring best practice in child protection.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The inter-agency review groups will be convened, chaired and reported on by the HSE and will include representatives from the church and the Garda. The HSE has already set up the internal structures necessary for the implementation of the Ferns Report, is working on the formation of the inter-agency groups, is drafting terms of reference and has made contact with the church representative in that regard.</P>
        <P>Under the commission of investigation terms of reference, as approved by Government, the Minister for Health and Children has the right to refer any Catholic Church diocese if, in her opinion, the diocese may not be implementing satisfactorily the recommendations of the Ferns Report. If there is a clear indication that the church authorities are not implementing the full recommendations of the Ferns Report, they will be referred and any follow-up action required will be taken to ensure proper child protection procedures within each diocese.</P>
        <P>The recommendations of the Ferns Report are paramount in this whole area and it is against these that the child protection policy and procedures will be examined. I am firmly of the view that these recommendations, implemented in a spirit of co-operation, will provide both the Government and the church with the necessary measures to address problems of clerical sex abuse.</P>

	<P>Legislation is being prepared in the Department to provide for the establishment of the health information and quality authority, HIQA, and the establishment of the social services inspectorate, SSI, function as part of HIQA on a statutory basis. The SSI function will be vested in a new statutory office to be known as the Office of the Chief Inspector of Social Services. The legislation will also provide for the establishment of a registration system in respect of residential services for children and for older people and people with disabilities to replace existing registration procedures in the Health (Nursing Homes) Act and the Child Care Acts.</P>
        <P>It is intended that the functions of the office of the chief inspector will include, <i>inter alia</i>, monitoring of standards in respect of residential services for people with disabilities, older people and children in accordance with the Child Care Act 1991 and Part 2 of the Children Act 2001, family welfare conferences, and registering and carrying out inspections in respect of those services.</P>
        <P>The preparation of the draft heads of this legislation is at an advanced stage and it is hoped to submit these to the Government shortly. It is intended to publish the draft heads so as to allow for a period of consultation on their contents prior to commencing the drafting of the Bill. The existing SSI will also be included in this consultation.</P>
        <P>A working group has been established by my Department to develop the standards for residential care settings for older people. Membership is as follows: Ms Dolores Moran, principal officer, Department of Health and Children, chair; Ms Alison Keogh, assistant principal officer, Department of Health and Children; Ms Michele Clark, <Col N="1368"/>chief inspector, SSI; Ms Mo Flynn, Health Service Executive; Ms Jennifer Doran, Irish Health Service Accreditation Board; Ms Julie Ling, Department of Health and Children; Ms Ann Kelly, Health Service Executive; Dr. Catherine Murphy, Health Service Executive; and Mr. Derek Finnegan, Department of Health and Children.</P>

	<P>At the end of September 2005 there were a total of 1,578 whole-time equivalent public health nurses or 1,905 individual public health nurses, employed by the Health Service Executive. The HSE sponsors 130 nurses per annum to undertake the higher diploma in public health nursing. The annual cost of this programme is in excess of &euro;4.5 million. The projected supply from these training courses is expected to meet current demand.</P>
        <P>In addition to public health nurses, care in the community is delivered by a mix of different skills and disciplines, including registered general nurses, home helps and health care assistants. In certain geographical areas, public health nurse vacancies are waiting to be filled. In these areas, registered general nurses and health care assistants are employed to enhance the skill mix and maximise the services of the existing public health nurses in that area.</P>
        <P>I have no doubt that the HSE fully recognises workforce planning as a dynamic process and that it must continue to be conscious of future developments and additional future demands, in the context of the most effective use of all human resources and mixes of skills.</P>

        <P>A multi-sectoral and multidisciplinary approach is required to implement the recommendations arising from a range of health promotion policies including the report of the national task force on obesity, which was launched in May 2005. The Department is considering how this approach could be advanced. Additional funding of &euro;3 million has been made available to the Health Service Executive to support the implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations. The population health unit, National Hospitals Office and the primary, community and continuing care directorates are planning in an integrated manner to ensure best allocation of this funding in targeting obesity according to the recommendations of the task force report.</P>
        <P>A proposal from the directorates is being forwarded to the strategic planning and reform innovation unit for approval. The proposal will build on developments to date and will include initiatives in the following areas: expansion of nutrition health education programmes in disadvantaged areas; the appointment of physical activity co-ordinators to promote physical activity and exercise programmes; the appointment of specialist community dieticians to support weight management and health promotion programmes; the development of a national training programme for key health professionals in methods to address obesity and excess weight; programmes with the food sector to ensure the availability of healthy food choices; work on the surveillance and monitoring of obesity; and further development of clinical obesity services.</P>

	<P>The HSE has informed me that it sent a reply to the Deputy yesterday on this matter. The information contained in the reply, which was provided to Deputy Kehoe in response to a parliamentary question on 22 November 2005, is that the 2004 figure of 8.9 million home help hours refers to projected figures for 2004. In some cases, owing to different recording mechanisms in different HSE areas, some home help figures also incorporated home help hours inclusive of all disciplines, including mental health, disabilities, children and families.</P>
        <P>The 6.9 million home help hours figure in the 2005 national service plan section for older people, which referred to activity for last year and this year refer only to older persons and, therefore, that figure and the 8.9 million are not comparable. The HSE, on examining the figures in <Col N="1371"/>the national service plan 2005, realised that the 6.9 million was understated by 665,821 hours and the national figure should be more than 7.5 million for this year for older persons.</P>
        <P>Given that there have been difficulties in collating information nationally, the necessary revisions are being made to systems and procedures by the HSE to ensure that routine information can be produced which verifies for the purposes of public accountability and management decision making the level of home help service delivered on an ongoing basis.</P>

	<P>All the international data suggests that good hospital management usually results in both effective financial control and high quality patient care. There is no evidence that poor patient care has resulted in financial gains. In fact, the reverse usually occurs.</P>
        <P>I agree that quality of care is an issue of concern to all of those who use the health services and quality is as important as value for money. I see no reason we cannot have both.</P>
        <P>The national case mix programme reviews all patient encounters, apart from outpatients, that occur in the 37 hospitals in the programme. The case mix programme operates four separate budget models and hospitals may win or lose in any one of them as they may have excellent management of one area, but less so in another. The models are inpatient, day cases, accident and emergency, and what is termed the &ldquo;split-year&rdquo; workload adjustment which incorporates the most up-to-date data available, for which finalised financial accounts are not yet available. Obviously, the press focuses on the overall adjustment. I am aware that some hospitals which we would all consider excellent institutions suffered some financial loss within case mix. However, if one examines the individual programmes, one sees that they were rewarded for good performance in some areas while losing in others.</P><Col N="1373"/>
        <P>Case mix collects data on the procedures and diagnoses pertaining to individual patients and the cost of treating them. While its primary focus is the budgetary process, it also provides data which allows others within the health service to focus on quality related issues. Many indicators already exist outside of case mix and the data collected as part of both the national HIPE programme and case mix programme can assist towards developing quality indicators. Some of these are used as performance indicators within the service planning process.</P>
        <P>It is possible to broaden the programme, as some other countries have done, to encompass issues such as re-admission rates, death rates and other quality related indicators, and this will be considered. At present, the focus is on broadening the programme and encouraging its use as a management tool and data set. This year the programme will be broadened by commencing an Irish cost weights programme which will result in Irish patient level cost data driving the reimbursement rates, including new areas such as dialysis and radiotherapy treatments performed on a day case basis, reviewing and refining the accident and emergency model, continuing to refine the day case model to reflect changing clinical practice, strengthening the national structures in order that work can commence on including more hospitals within the programme and commencing a review of outpatient departments so that they too may be included, at which point every patient encounter with the hospitals will be subject to case mix. When these matters have been concluded, a review of whether various quality of care indicators can be included as part of the programme will be initiated.</P>

He had publicly apologised on behalf of the State for its failings in that regard and had ensured that the <Col N="1374"/>victims had access to effective redress. The Taoiseach pointed to his public statements, in the D&aacute;il and outside, which had expressed outrage at the facts which had been established about the breach of trust by clerics who had abused children in their care. He fully shared and had expressed the dismay and sense of betrayal at the failure to confront this issue when it came to notice, which put more children in danger.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan, pointed out that the Government had brought forward major child protection legislation. It has also taken a number of other important initiatives, including the establishment of the Garda central vetting unit and the appointment of an Ombudsman for Children. The Government has accepted in principle the recommendations of the Ferns Report and will take further steps to improve the level of legal protection for children.</P>
        <P>Mr. O&rsquo;Gorman took the opportunity to outline to the Taoiseach the work being conducted by One in Four and there was a brief presentation. Mr. O&rsquo;Gorman highlighted the increased demand for the services provided by the group and stressed that the issue of abuse was not only a matter of concern to the victims but to society as a whole. Mr. O&rsquo;Gorman was appreciative of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the investigation of child sexual abuse and for taking action when required.</P>

	<P>The clinical indemnity scheme, CIS, has been established on the principle of enterprise liability. As such, the scheme covers institutions such as the Health Service Executive, voluntary hospitals, agencies providing services to persons with disabilities and so forth, rather than individual practitioners. The activities of doctors, nurses and others employed by enterprises included in the CIS are covered by virtue of their employment in the enterprises covered by the scheme. The CIS does not cover private hospitals, whether located on the grounds of public hospitals or elsewhere. These institutions are responsible for arranging their own insurance cover. Consultants in private hospitals benefit from the caps which have been placed on the extent of professional indemnity cover that they are required to purchase. The objective of the <Col N="1375"/>caps is to make the cost of this cover affordable for consultants in private practice. I do not believe that the consultants who may wish to work in private hospitals on the grounds of public hospitals will expect to receive more favourable treatment than those who work in other parts of the private hospital sector.</P>

The Government published the group&rsquo;s report, entitled A Vision for Change, on Tuesday, 24 January 2006.</P>
        <P>The report sets out how positive mental health in children can be promoted generally in our society and how specialist mental health services can be delivered efficiently to children who need them.

        <P>The group&rsquo;s report acknowledges gaps in the current provision of child and adolescent services and makes several recommendations for the further improvement of these services. Recommendations include early intervention and health promotion programmes, primary and community care services, specialist mental health services for the treatment of complex disorders and the provision of additional child community mental health teams. The Government has accepted the expert group&rsquo;s report as the basis for the future development of the mental health services.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The national service plan 2006 of the Health Service Executive provides a commitment to develop proposals to support patients who have to travel long distances to access specialist services, with particular focus on those travelling for radiotherapy treatment. I approved this plan in December and it was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas earlier this month. I made an additional &euro;9 million available to the executive for developments in cancer services in 2006, <i>inter alia</i>, to facilitate better access to radiation oncology services, including dedicated transport arrangements. The executive will be <Col N="1377"/>reviewing the transport needs of all patients, including cancer patients and the associated resource requirements.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The executive has in place several options for the transportation of patients receiving radiotherapy and other oncology services including the use of designated oncology transport vehicles and transport by air. These services and their development relate to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the executive under the Health Act 2004. Accordingly my Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to provide relevant details to the Deputy. If the Deputy is aware of any case where failure to provide transport is contributing to unacceptable delays for cancer patients, I ask him to provide details to the parliamentary affairs division for immediate examination and follow up. It is unacceptable if patient access to radiotherapy is compromised because of the absence of appropriate transport arrangements.</P>

        <P>There is no doubt that the implementation of management&rsquo;s proposals with respect to the contract will lead to a better, more patient-centred health service.

	<P>On the basis of the figures contained in the 2004 annual report of the Health Service Executive, shared services, primary care reimbursement service, it is estimated that the additional cost involved of providing GP visit cards to all those non-medical card holders under 16 years of age will be in the region of &euro;129 million. On a similar basis, the cost involved of providing medical cards to all those non-medical card holders under 16 years would be approximately &euro;181 million. These estimates are calculated by reference to the average annual capitation fees paid to general practitioners under the General Medical Services scheme for patients in this age cohort and include an estimate of other costs in respect of allowances and special payments which would be payable to GPs.</P>
        <P>The above estimate for the provision of medical cards to people aged 16 years of age includes the average costs of drugs and medicines and fees paid to pharmacists at the end of 2004.

The estimates do not take account of fee increases which would apply under the terms of the Labour Relations Commission&rsquo;s recommendations of 20 June 2005 and any additional costs which might result from future industrial relations negotiations.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It should be noted from the outset that the establishment of the Health Service Executive did not cost &euro;200 million. Owing to the creation of the HSE&rsquo;s Vote and the consequent introduction of vote accounting procedures, it was necessary to make some technical adjustments at Revised Estimates time in 2005 to accommodate this process. Furthermore, none of these technical adjustments required additional investment in the health services by the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>The first of these technical items related to the liquidation of health board approved overdrafts. Up to the end of 2004, an overdraft facility was approved as part of the financing of the health service. Health boards had been cashed with approximately 91% of their approved expenditure in the current year, with the balance of approximately 9% paid over in the following year. This recoupment rate was agreed between my Department and the Department of Finance in 1993-94 as being the appropriate level of cash funding in any year which, when taken together with an approved overdraft facility, ensured that the health boards had enough cash in any year to meet the cash commitments arising from spending their approved allocation. Vote accounting precludes the use of overdraft facilities and, <Col N="1380"/>therefore, once-off Exchequer cash of &euro;122 million was required to replace the bank financing previously available. This allowed the Exchequer to meet that portion of its liabilities in 2005 previously covered by way of an overdraft facility.</P>
        <P>The second technical adjustment required was in respect of statutory and voluntary deductions made in December 2004. With the establishment of the HSE in January 2005 it was necessary to make a total of 12 payments to the Revenue Commissioners and other beneficiaries in respect of each month&rsquo;s statutory deductions from health board employees&rsquo; salaries and voluntary deductions such as life insurance. Unlike accruals accounting, Vote accounting required that these deductions were accounted for in Vote spending for each month from January to December 2005, that is, in the month they arise, even though the December 2005 deductions were not due to be paid over until January 2006. Therefore, the HSE was obliged to charge each calendar month of 2005, as well as the deductions from December 2004, to the newly established Vote 40, resulting in 13 months&rsquo; deductions in 2005. This required a provision of once-off funding of &euro;94 million from the Exchequer in 2005. In total, the establishment of the HSE&rsquo;s Vote required a provision of &euro;216 million once-off funding.</P>

	<P>It has been accepted that the current infrastructure at Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital for Sick Children does not generally meet the standards required for a modern paediatric hospital. The available facilities do not satisfactorily accommodate the range and extent of current clinical and associated activity. In recognition of this, a project team was established to plan for the overall future development of Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, either on the existing hospital site or at an alternative green field location.</P>
        <P>The project team has undertaken a detailed examination of the potential to redevelop the hospital on its present site. The project team concluded that the existing clinical services could be retained and developed on the present site but also set out the implications of such an approach in terms of time, cost and disruption to services. As a consequence it is likely that the new hospital will be located at an alternative site.</P>
        <P>In the context of the decision to be taken on the possible relocation of the facilities at Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, I asked the Health Service Executive to undertake a review of tertiary highly specialised paediatric services to ensure that they are planned and provided in the most efficient and effective manner.

Their report is expected to be furnished to the HSE tomorrow evening for consideration at the scheduled HSE board meeting on Thursday.</P>

	<P>The position on the introduction of a no fault compensation scheme for infants who suffer brain damage at or close to birth remains unchanged. The Attorney General has raised serious concerns about the constitutional implications of establishing no fault compensation schemes. In the light of this advice it would not be prudent to establish such a scheme. Parents of infants who suffer cerebral damage at birth are entitled to pursue claims for damages on behalf of such infants where they believe that the standard of care delivered to their child fell below that which would generally be expected. The bulk of the damages awarded in successful claims go to meet the lifetime care costs of the child. Where there are no grounds for taking a personal injury claim, or where the claim is not successful, the children concerned are eligible for the same range of services as other children with disabilities not caused by birth-related injuries.</P>

        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest>her views on the fact that Ireland has one of the lowest ratios of acute beds to population in Europe where the EU average is 4.4 beds per 1,000 of population; the action she intends to take to correct this situation; the breakdown of the numbers, types and definitions of beds provided since 2001; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The World Health Organisation&rsquo;s European Health for All database of June 2005 shows that the number of acute care beds in Ireland in 2003 was three per 1,000 population and that the EU average for the same year was 4 per 1,000 population.</P>
        <P>The organisation advises caution in the interpretation of the cross-country data in the database. Health data recording systems and practices vary between countries, as do the availability and accuracy of data. Data comparability is also limited owing to differences in definitions and/or time periods or other national specifics in data recording and processing. For example, the Irish data do not include day beds. Day activity is now a significant component of hospital-based care. There has been a rapid movement in the last few years towards day case work where a variety of routine and complex treatments, surgery and diagnostic tests can now be performed with the patient being admitted and discharged from hospital on the same day. In addition, the Irish data do not include acute beds located in private hospitals, whereas some other countries include private beds and/or long term care beds.</P><Col N="1384"/>
        <P Just="Left">It should also be noted that the acute bed numbers<i> per capita</i> do not take account of variations in the age structure of the population in different countries. Acute bed usage tends to be concentrated in the older age groups both in terms of admission rates and average lengths of stay. Within the EU, Ireland continues to have a significantly younger population than the average.</P>
        <P>In 2001, the average number of in-patient beds and day places available for treatment of patients in public acute hospitals was 12,145. The hospital returns for 2005 show that this number has risen to 13,255, an increase of 1,110 in-patient beds and day places. Almost 90% of treatment places in acute hospitals are overnight in-patient beds. To these must be added approximately 1,700 acute beds in private hospitals to see the full extent of acute hospital capacity in the country, that is, nearly 15,000 beds.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The agreed programme for Government includes a commitment to expand public hospital beds in line with the health strategy commitment to increase total acute hospital bed capacity by 3,000 by 2011. Substantial investment in additional bed capacity in acute hospitals has already taken place. Funding has been provided to open an additional 900 in-patient beds-day places in public acute hospitals throughout the country. The Health Service Executive has informed the Department that at the end of 2005, 806 of these beds-day places were in place and the remaining 94 beds-day places will come on stream over the coming months. The majority &mdash; 80% &mdash; of additional beds-places provided so far are overnight in-patient beds. In addition, a further 450 acute beds-day places are in various stages of planning and development under the capital investment framework 2005-09.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I announced in July this year an initiative which will provide up to an additional 1,000 beds for public patients in public hospitals over the next five years. The Health Service Executive has been asked to begin to develop an implementation plan and to prioritise proposals with reference to the public hospitals&rsquo; requirement for additional bed capacity. The Estimates for 2006 include &euro;60 million to open new acute hospital facilities, some of which will provide additional beds. These additional beds-day places will go some way to achieving our commitment in the programme for Government to increase total acute hospital capacity.</P>
        <P>The Department, in conjunction with the Health Service Executive, will be reviewing public capacity requirements in the acute hospital sector in the light of developments since the health strategy was published.</P>

	<P>I am fully committed to the development of high quality and quality assured cancer care for all patients regardless of geography. This objective is shared by the chief executive officer of the Health Service Executive and is reflected in the executive&rsquo;s national service plan, 2006. There is a significant role for primary care services in the provision and development of cancer care. These services include health promotion, early detection and screening and palliative care. Primary care is a key element in the delivery of integrated cancer services involving secondary and tertiary services. The specialist management of specific types of cancers should be delivered by hospitals where care is more specialised thereby increasing the likelihood of better survival; there are higher caseloads of patients, increasing the experience and ability to sub-specialise; diagnosis and treatment planning is conducted by multidisciplinary teams; and audit and other quality assurance programmes are in place.</P>
        <P>While a limited number of centres will generate sufficient workload for breast or colon cancer, for example, they would not support the management of more complex but less common cancers including cancers of the pancreas, oesophagus, lung, bone, brain or paediatric tumours. There is significant evidence in international research that <Col N="1386"/>associates case volume and sub-specialisation with improved patient outcome.</P>
        <P>There has been significant investment in cancer care in the north west since 1997, more than &euro;47 million. Additional medical consultants have been appointed in the region in key areas of cancer care, including medical oncology, palliative care, histopathology, haematology and surgery. More than 20 cancer care nurse specialists have been appointed and there has been a 25% increase in oncology day case activity in 2005. BreastCheck has confirmed that it will commence breast screening of women in the 50 to 64 age group in the north west in 2007.</P>

        <Quest>if the British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, will be called on to hold a full independent public inquiry into the murder of Mr. Pat Finucane in the interest of transparency, in view of the findings of Judge Peter Cory&rsquo;s investigation into collusion between paramilitaries and security forces in Northern Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government continues to support a full independent public inquiry into the murder of Patrick Finucane. We have made clear that we want to see the standard agreed at Weston Park and set by Judge Cory adhered to. We continue to share the concern of the Finucane family that the new Inquiries Act, under which the British Government intends to have the <Col N="1388"/>Finucane case investigated, will not meet these standards. We have raised these concerns with the British Government.</P>
        <P>The family has our full and continuing support in all their tireless efforts over so many years to achieve the full truth in this deeply disturbing case.</P>

	<P>The Government remains fully committed to the peace process and the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. I met Prime Minister Blair in Farmleigh on 26 January. Our main topic of discussion was the way ahead in Northern Ireland. As was stated <Col N="1389"/>after my meeting with Prime Minister Blair, the early restoration of the devolved institutions is in the best interests of everyone in Northern Ireland &mdash; 2006 is the decisive year for this process. We would like to see the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive, and North-South structures restored as soon as possible. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland will convene talks with the Northern Ireland parties, commencing on 6 February, in an aim to restore the Institutions.</P>

        <Quest>when she intends to implement the legislation on the liberalisation of marriage venues and have the licence in the person of the registrar perform the ceremony in a venue other than the registrar&rsquo;s office (details supplied).</Quest>

	<P>An tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir, the Registrar General, is the person with statutory responsibility for the administration of the civil registration system, including civil marriages. I have made inquiries with an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir and the position is as follows. The Civil Registration Act 2004 provides for the commencement of the various provisions of the Act on a gradual basis. Parts 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8, which relate to the administration of the service and the registration of births, stillbirths and deaths, were commenced on 5 December 2005. The new provisions for marriage are set out in Part 6 and include univer<Col N="1390"/>sal procedures for notification, solemnisation and registration of marriages as well as a choice of venue for civil marriage ceremonies.</P>
        <P>Before the provisions can be commenced, a substantial body of work needs to be completed, including drafting and publication of regulations, guidelines and detailed procedures; establishment of a register of solemnisers in consultation with religious bodies; establishment of a register of approved venues for civil marriages; and the further development of the computer system to facilitate the administration of the new marriage provisions introduced in the Act. An tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir is unable to give a specific date for the implementation of the new marriage procedures but it is unlikely to be before October 2006. It is intended to give as much public notice as possible and a comprehensive public information campaign will be undertaken at the appropriate time.</P>
        <P>I am aware that some existing offices of registrars of civil marriages are less than ideal when it comes to conducting marriage ceremonies. This factor was taken into consideration in enacting <Col N="1391"/>the new marriage provisions and I am confident these provisions, once commenced, will lead to a significant enhancement of the services provided in the area of civil registration.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest>if special consideration will be given in the application of the casemix incentivisation scheme to hospitals experiencing unique service difficulties when funding is being allocated based on previous years&rsquo; casemix criteria; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[3235/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>All the hospitals which participate in the national casemix programme are actively encouraged to make submissions on issues of concern to them to the casemix technical group in my Department, which is involved in the management of the programme. No restrictions apply to the type of submission they may make. It could be a general issue affecting both their hospital and all hospitals or it could be a unique local issue. Local unique issues could be related to general matters, such as service difficulties, or to <Col N="1392"/>a patient whose care was unique or unusual, the cost of which was considerably in excess of the norm. Costs relating to matters which might reasonably be considered beyond local management control are allowed.</P>
        <P>The casemix group operates what is termed a &ldquo;data driven decision making process&rdquo;, that is, any decisions taken are based on real data submitted. The programme is operated in an open and inclusive manner, with all the data being shared among all the participating hospitals. Consequently, the decision to grant a special deduction is only taken where it can reasonably be considered valid, beyond local management&rsquo;s control and can be justified to all other participating hospitals.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Casemix adjustments are only part of the financial allocation process and specific to the year in question, nor are they on a cumulative basis as the process starts afresh each year. All the management data is regenerated, based on both the hospital&rsquo;s activity and costs and that of all other hospitals involved in the programme. The lessons learned from the previous casemix budget are carried forward and changes which have occurred, be they clinical, financial or management, are reviewed. Cost per case, length of stay and changing clinical practice data, such as the introduction of medical assessment units, are all reviewed and incorporated into the new budget model.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The activity and costs for a given year are reviewed<i> vis-&agrave;-vis</i> their peer group, resulting in hospitals being funded for the patients they actually treated, including exceptionally high cost or long stay patients. Any issues beyond the remit of case mix can be addressed directly with the National Hospitals Office and the Health Service Executive.</P>

        <P FLI="0">More than 5,000 GP visit cards have been issued by the HSE which has been requested to provide a breakdown of this figure by county directly to the Deputy. Since 2005 I have made significant improvements to the way in which eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards is assessed. In January 2005, I increased the income guidelines <Col N="1395"/>used in the assessment of medical card applications by 7.5%.</P>
        <P>In June 2005, it was apparent that the effect of rising income in our successful economy meant that the target of 30,000 additional medical cards and 200,000 GP visit cards would not be achieved. At this time I simplified the means test for both medical cards and GP visit cards. It is now based on an applicant&rsquo;s and spouse&rsquo;s income after income tax and PRSI and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, child care and travel to work. This is much fairer to applicants.</P>
        <P>I announced, on 13 October 2005, that the income guidelines for both medical cards and GP visit cards would be increased by an additional 20%. This means the income guidelines are now 29% higher than they were at the end of 2004. It will be noted that the income assessment guidelines used for GP visit cards are 25% higher than those used for medical cards. The HSE has publicised these changes to encourage people to apply and has made the application process as simple as possible.</P>
        <P>In December 2005 my Department asked the HSE to take account of the welfare, taxation or other changes announced in the budget on the operation of the income guidelines and identify any changes which may be required to ensure medical cards and GP visit cards continue to be available to those who need them. I expect to receive a report from the HSE shortly about this matter. My Department and the Health Service Executive will continue to monitor the number of cards issued. The Government&rsquo;s commitment in the programme for Government to extend eligibility for medical cards will be kept under review in light of other competing service priorities, available resources and the graduated benefits approach which I introduced with the GP visit card.</P>

	<P>All the hospitals which participate in the national casemix programme are actively encouraged to make submission on issues of concern to them to the casemix technical group in <Col N="1397"/>my Department, which is responsible for reviewing cost and activity data for inclusion in the budget model. Costs relating to matters which might reasonably be considered beyond local management control may be deducted following review. A deduction was allowed in relation to some costs incurred at the hospital. No allowance was made for pressure on services as this led to an increase in activity and a consequent lowering of unit costs, resulting in an improving financial outturn. This is reflected in the fact that the loss under casemix was less this year than last. I hope this trend will continue and it will return to having a positive outturn. It should be noted that the hospital has gained considerable funding over the years from casemix. In 2004 alone it gained almost &euro;750,000.</P>

	<P>This Department has funded a research project which involves a review of maternal records held by the Coombe Women&rsquo;s Hospital for the period 1996-2004. The aims of the project are to describe the prevalence and patterns of alcohol and nicotine use in a sample of pregnant women in Ireland between 1986 and 2004; to examine the association between a set of pregnancy outcome indicators &mdash; birth weight, Apgar score &mdash; and the consumption patterns; and to examine how alcohol consumption in Ireland, in a sample of pregnant women, relates to use in a similar population in other countries. The results are expected to be available later this year and will inform any future action required.</P>
        <P>The issue of the information contained on labels on alcoholic beverages was considered by the working group on alcohol which was recently established to help mobilise the stakeholders through social partnership to achieve a targeted and measurable reduction in alcohol misuse. The report recommended that a group, representative of all relevant stakeholders, would be established to consider what useful information could be included on non-draft alcohol products, taking account of international evidence. Any future action on the recommendations contained in that report, including the issue of the information on labels, will involve consultation with all of the appropriate stakeholders.</P>

	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. Accordingly, my Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy. The Deputy may wish to note, however, that efforts have been undertaken in recent years to improve staffing levels in radiography in the public health service. The success of these measures have contributed to an increase at end-September 2005 of 252 radiographers or 32% over the number employed at end-December 2000. There were 1,033 whole time equivalent radiographers employed in the public health service at end-September, 2005. In addition, the numbers of radiography training places in both the UCD diagnostic radiography course and the TCD radiation therapy course have increased in recent years. In 2003, the annual intake of students doubled to 40 in diagnostic radiography and more than doubled in radiation therapy from 10 to 25 in 2001.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 274 to 277, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The annual organ donor awareness campaign, which is organised by the Irish Donor Network and administered by the Irish Kidney Association, highlights the necessity for organ donation generally. The campaign, which is supported by my Department, highlights the need for organ donors by promoting the carrying of an organ donor card. I thank the Deputy for his suggestions with regard to increasing organ donation rates, and my Department will write to the Central Statistics Office and the Irish Blood Transfusion Service to ascertain their views on the suggestions.</P>
        <P>There are two systems that can be used to ascertain an individual&rsquo;s wishes on organ donation: the opt-in system and the opt-out system. The former system, which operates in this country, requires that the specific consent to donation of each person, or their relatives, be obtained before organs or tissues are removed. The opt-out system presumes that all citizens consent to donation unless they have specifically expressed a wish to the contrary.</P>
        <P>The practice in this country is that, even when a person has indicated his or her willingness to donate organs by way of carrying an organ donor card, or a driving licence marked accordingly, the consent of the next of kin is always sought. It is likely that this would continue to be the case in the event that the initiatives suggested by the Deputy are implemented. Even where opt-out systems are in operation the relatives of the deceased are approached as part of the donor screening process to seek a medical history of any high-risk behaviour. Thus, the relatives will always be aware that a donation is being considered and can register an objection to the donation.</P>
        <P>The European Commission is considering the question of a directive in respect of organ transplantation, including the issue of consent, and proposes to conduct a thorough scientific evaluation of the situation. It will present a report on its analysis to the Council of the European Union and it is expected that this report will inform decisions regarding the development of a legislative framework in this area. In the context of increasing the number of donor organs available <Col N="1401"/>for transplant, the Health Service Executive has been asked by the Department to undertake a review and analysis of the factors that impact on organ procurement and retrieval rates in hospitals around the country.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 278 to 280, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Report of the National Task Force on Medical Staffing, Hanly report, made a series of important recommendations about the development of hospital services. These covered issues such as the changes needed in NCHD work patterns; reform of medical education and training; the need for a significantly revised contract for medical consultants and an increase in the number of consultants and the reorganisation of acute hospital services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department is working closely with the HSE to build on, and progress, these recommendations. Negotiations on a new contract for consultants have begun. It is important that a new contract be put in place as soon as possible. I also want the discussions which have been under way for some time now about the work patterns of NCHDs to be brought to a successful conclusion at an early date. The Government last week considered a report from the medical education and training group, Buttimer report, in relation to postgraduate medical education and training, together with the Fottrell report on undergraduate medical education and training. I will, together with my colleague Deputy Hanafin, Minister for Education and Science, make an announcement in the near future on the measures agreed on foot of these reports.</P>
        <P>These measures, combined with ongoing investment in acute hospital facilities, extra consultant posts and the organisation of services around hospital networks, are designed to provide patients with faster access to high quality consultant provided services.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive, which has statutory responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services, has provided the following information <Col N="1403"/>regarding the national immunisation steering committee recommendations safeguarding against the use of out of date vaccines. HSE staff and general practitioners contracted by the HSE provide immunisation as recommended by the national immunisation advisory committee and in line with good clinical practice. A national review of immunisation and vaccination programmes took place in 2001. One of the main recommendations of this report was the central control and monitoring of all vaccines.</P>
        <P>In September 2004 a national vaccine cold chain delivery service was established. This centralised system is managed through the HSE national population health directorate which oversees the procurement, ordering, distribution, stock control and payment of all vaccines provided by the HSE. The distribution of all vaccines is carried out through a third party distribution system following a procurement process. All information is held on a database from which weekly and monthly reports are produced. The main activities of the service include ordering all childhood vaccines; monitoring of all GP and HSE vaccine orders; monitoring and ensuring that all vaccines are stored and distributed within optimum temperature; monitoring all batch numbers of stock and expiry dates; detailing receipt of all out-of-date vaccines returned from the HSE and GP surgeries; dealing with emergency situations. The cold chain delivery of services is dedicated to ensuring that vaccines are delivered and used in line with best practice.</P>
        <P>To safeguard against the use of out of date vaccines a service is also provided for the return of out-of-date stock from each delivery site on a monthly basis. When an order is placed and delivered all sites are asked to return out of date stock. To safeguard further against use of out of date stock, the delivery service wrote to all GPs and HSE sites in April 2005 specifically asking that all fridges be checked and that all out of date vaccines be collected, irrespective of vaccines type. The response to this initiative was excellent with approximately 63,000 doses received. This initiative will be repeated again early in 2006.</P>

This includes revenue funding of &euro;2.3 million to, <i>inter alia</i>, provide for the recruitment and training of staff to commence the national roll out of the screening programme in 2007.

	<P>The chairman of the National Cancer Forum recently submitted a report entitled A Strategy for Cancer Control in Ireland, 2006. As part of the development of this strategy, the forum, a multi-disciplinary group of experts in oncology, reviewed all issues relating to screening and has developed criteria against which all future screening programmes will be assessed.</P>
        <P>The forum has recommended that there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the introduction of a population based prostate screening programme in this country. This issue should be reassessed when the results are available from randomised trials currently being conducted. This position is consistent with the recommendations adopted by the European Union which advocate the introduction of cancer screening programmes which have demonstrated their efficacy having regard to professional expertise and priority setting for health care resources. The proposals do not provide for specific recommendations in respect of screening for prostate cancer. Appropriate treatment for men diagnosed with prostate cancer is available at major hospitals throughout the country. Any man who has concerns regarding prostate cancer should contact his GP who will, where appropriate, refer him to the appropriate services in his area.</P>

	<P>Representatives of the Adoption Board travelled to Belarus in October 2005. They met with officials of the national adoption centre and the Ministry of Justice. During the visit the Belarusian officials presented the Adoption Board with a draft protocol on inter-country adoption between Ireland and Belarus. Following examination of the protocol by the Adoption Board and the Attorney General a number of constitutional and legislative concerns were raised. The board is currently attempting to find ways to resolve the issues with the mutual agreement of both parties. The Adoption Board is treating the agreement as a priority matter. The Deputy will be aware that the agreement is subject to sensitive international negotiation and it would not be appropriate for me to go into any further details at this time.</P>

	<P>Part of the Deputy&rsquo;s question regarding the current allocations to various bodies dealing with the Traveller community relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. Accordingly, my Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Since 2000 over &euro;9.6 million in ongoing revenue funding has been allocated to Traveller <Col N="1407"/>specific health services such as the appointment of designated public health nurses for Travellers and the replication of primary health care for Traveller projects. This funding is allocated through the Traveller health units in each Health Service Executive area. Travellers and Traveller organisations are involved in partnership with HSE personnel through each Traveller health unit in the development of Traveller health services and in the allocation of resources.</P>

	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.</P>
        <P>There is no statutory obligation on the HSE to provide chiropody services to GMS patients. However, in practice arrangements are made to provide these services. Before the establishment of the HSE the nature of the arrangements for chiropody and the level of service provided was a matter for individual health boards and so a degree of variation in practice developed over time. Priority is usually given to certain groups of people, including people who are medical card holders aged 65 years and over. In several regions the service is provided by private chiropodists by arrangement with the HSE.</P><Col N="1409"/>
        <P>I consider that it is inappropriate for private chiropodists who are providing services on behalf of the HSE to charge patients a top-up fee, and I have conveyed this view formally to the HSE. My Department requested the HSE to initiate a review of the fee arrangements in place for the provision of chiropody services, with a view to ensuring that such additional fees will no longer be levied on persons in receipt of this service. The HSE has recently advised me that it has initiated a review of chiropody services.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Garda vetting is currently not generally available in respect of child care services. In respect of the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006, where that makes a contribution towards the staffing costs of certain workers working directly with children, it is a condition of the programme that such staff &ldquo;must have any clearance prescribed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform&rdquo;. The requirement of the programme only relates to such workers, and not to other people who may be present in the facility.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last year, an inter-agency working group on Garda vetting reported with a clear and focused strategy for enhancing national vetting arrangements from a child protection perspective. This strategy provided for an expansion in the criminal record vetting service provided by the Garda central vetting unit to all organisations which recruit persons having substantial, unsupervised access to children and vulnerable adults. This has significant implications for the education, child care, <Col N="1410"/>youth work, sports and voluntary sectors, among others.</P>
        <P>To provide for the increase in demand associated with such an expansion in the availability of vetting, the working group made a number of recommendations. I am pleased that the central vetting unit has now been successfully transferred to new, custom-designed office accommodation in Thurles, County Tipperary, from where it will soon complete expansion of its vetting service. I can also confirm that, during its expansion, the matter of the adequacy of staff resources will be kept under constant review.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The strategy is being overseen by an implementation group on Garda vetting comprising key stakeholders, including the education, health, child care and sports sectors, as well as Mr. Paul Gilligan, CEO of the ISPCC. The implementation group is overseeing the implementation of the practical recommendations of the report of the working group. Implementation issues include the training of the additional staff, accommodation matters, financial management arrangements, work process re-engineering and the preparation of client organisations and sectors for the availability of vetting. In terms of overall prioritisation across sectors, the central vetting unit will roll out its vetting service in the chronological order that each sector completes its own preparatory actions.</P>

	<P>The Pensions (Abatement) Act 1965 provides the legislative basis for the suspension or reduction of an allowance or pension where, after retirement, a scheme pensioner is employed in an agency or organisation in which the superannuation scheme paying the pension applies. Remuneration plus pension for the specified period should not exceed the up-rated remuneration for the post from which the pensioner retired.</P>
        <P>The calculation of pension abatement in the health sector was raised with me in the context of the lack of nursing graduates from the Irish education system in 2005. This gap arises because the three year diploma programme ended in 2004 and the first graduates of the four year degree programme will graduate this year, 2006. I requested that my Department review this matter and a revised circular 21/2005 was issued in October 2005. The new arrangements mean that, in effect, pensioners working in agencies or organisations covered by the scheme from which their pensions are paid, can earn up to 50% of the uprated remuneration of the former post, before abatement applies. These changes were introduced in response to a particular set of circum<Col N="1412"/>stances and the effective date of the revised arrangements is 20 October 2005.</P>

	<P>As part of the overall funding for health services in 2006, additional revenue funding of &euro;4.78 million has been allocated specifically for the development of cystic fibrosis services.</P>
        <P>I wish to see significant improvement this year in the level of services available to persons with cystic fibrosis. The current service deficits in this area are widely acknowledged and have been identified most notably in the Pollock report, and by the Health Service Executive working group which is looking at this issue. My Department is advised that the working group is due to report shortly and will be making specific recommendations in relation to a range of service improvements required for persons with cystic fibrosis, in particular the need to increase the level of clinical, nursing and allied health professional staffing in CF units around the country. As part of the implementation process I have asked the HSE to address in particular the identified deficits at the national adult referral centre at St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital in Dublin.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The publication of the working group report is a matter for the HSE and accordingly, my Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 313 and 314 together.</P>
        <P>Since the late 1990s, a number of parents of children with autism began to take High Court <Col N="1416"/>cases to obtain specific educational services for their children. Since 2000, my Department has been involved in 142 cases in which applicants are seeking access to such appropriate education services. In cases involving children with disabilities this also includes, on occasion, access to appropriate health related supports. These cases are broken down as follows: 2000, 36 cases &mdash; 15 judicial review, 21 plenary; 2001, 32 cases &mdash; 11 judicial review, 11 plenary; 2002, 35 cases &mdash; 15 judicial review, 20 plenary; 2003, 18 cases &mdash; seven judicial review, 11 plenary; 2004, 12 cases &mdash; five judicial review, seven plenary; and 2005, nine cases &mdash; five judicial review, four plenary.</P>
        <P>I am unable to say how many of these cases relate to primary or post-primary students. Due to the manner in which the judicial system operates, it can be some time before a case is entered. Furthermore, a number of the students would not be attending traditional primary or post-primary schools or other educational facilities due to the nature of their disability.</P>
        <P>In that time, five cases have proceeded to full hearing. One of these cases was settled during the hearing. Of the other cases which proceeded to full hearing, the court ruled in favour of the State on two occasions, one case was successfully appealed by the State to the Supreme Court and a further case has yet to be determined. A number of other cases which commenced prior to 2000 are also being dealt with in my Department.</P>
        <P>The cost to my Department, excluding the costs of the State defence which is borne by the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, in each of the years since 2000 was as follows:</P><Col N="1415"/>

        <P FLI="0">It should be noted that these figures do not include the costs of staff involved in responding to these cases.</P>
        <P>These cases are, in the main, taken against the Department of Education and Science and allege a failure on behalf of the State to provide for an appropriate education as provided for in the Constitution. While these cases are mainly taken by parents of children with autism, there are also a number of cases relating to ADHD, intellectual, physical and sensory disabilities.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should note that my Department is not specifically named as a defendant in all of these cases but is involved due to the role of my Department in the formulation and development of policy in respect of the provision of health care and support services. The Health Act 2004 provided for the creation of the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January <Col N="1416"/>2005. Pursuant to the Health Act 2004, the HSE has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for all health related supports. As such, my Department does not have responsibility in the provision of services to individuals. In a number of the cases the Health Service Executive is also named as a co-defendant.</P>
        <P>There has been significant progress made over the past number of years in enhancing and developing services for people with disabilities. An integral part of the national disability strategy is the implementation of two major legislative measures, the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004, both of which provide a framework for the planning and delivery of health and <Col N="1417"/>personal social services and education services for people with disabilities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The multi-annual investment programme published by the Government in December 2004 as part of the national disability strategy contained details of specific commitments for the provision of specific high priority disability services over the period 2006 to 2009. The programme, together with the enhancement of other key support services, is a key factor in building the additional capacity required to put in place the new framework provided for in the Disability Act and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act. The funding provided for in the national disability strategy amounts to &euro;900 million over the period 2006 to 2009. In addition to the costs associated with this programme, which amount to &euro;59 million in 2006, a further additional &euro;41 million is being provided this year, the bulk of which will be used to enhance the level and range of multidisciplinary support services available to adults and children with intellectual, physical and sensory disabilities, autism and mental illness, with a priority on enhancing the assessment and support services for children with disabilities.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the level of investment in disability services demonstrates that the Government is committed to the provision of appropriate services to enhance capacity within the health services to deliver on the various legislative provisions contained in the national disability strategy. This includes continued enhancements to services to allow children with disabilities participate in the education system.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 320 and 338 together.</P>
        <P>There has been an increase in recent years in the numbers of children being diagnosed with <Col N="1419"/>autism in Ireland. Similar increases have also been experienced in other European countries and in the USA. The diagnosis of autism is a clinical one, that is, it is based on a variety of observations rather than any defined laboratory investigation. Hence the evolving concept of an &ldquo;autistic spectrum&rdquo; which stretches from those severely affected to those with only mild disability.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is increasing recognition of autism in Ireland and other countries. What is not clear, however, is whether the increase is due to a greater awareness leading to better ascertainment or whether there is actually a true increase in the prevalence of autism. It is, however, recognised that the epidemiology of ASD is undergoing rapid change due in whole or part to better ascertainment and re-clarification. For general purposes, a figure of 0.3% to 0.6% has been suggested for the overall prevalence of autistic spectrum disorders, ASD. This figure includes high functioning autism and Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome.</P>
        <P>There are currently no national statistics available in Ireland. The health services have, at regional level, in recent years been expanding the level of information available to them on the numbers and needs of persons with autism in their regions. While some persons with autism, who also have an intellectual disability, are included on the national intellectual disability database, it does not contain information on this group as a whole. In addition, while the database provides information relating to the level of services being provided and current and future needs, it does not identify persons with specific disabilities such as Down&rsquo;s syndrome or autism. Its principal role is as a planning and monitoring instrument.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children and the Heath Service Executive, together with the Health Research Board, which manages the national disability databases on behalf of the Department, have been investigating the possibility of establishing an information system which would give a level of information on the numbers and needs of persons with autism, similar to that already available from the national intellectual disability database. This issue is now being examined in the context of the overall information requirements set out in section 13 of Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005.</P>

	<P>The Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations 1993 are administered by the Health Service Executive. There are currently three rates of subvention payable, &euro;114.30, &euro;152.40 and &euro;190.50 for the three levels of dependency which are medium, high and maximum. Included in these payments is an increase of 25% which came into effect in April 2001. There are no plans to increase the subvention rates at present.</P>
        <P>The HSE has discretion to pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual&rsquo;s level of dependency in a case, for example, where personal funds are exhausted. The application of these provisions in an individual case is a matter for the HSE in the context of meeting increasing demands for subvention, subject to the provisions of the Health Act 2004. The average rate of subvention paid by the HSE generally exceeds the current approved basic rates.</P>

	<P>The Government has invested significant resources in recent years in the development of additional respite facilities for people with physical, sensory and intellectual disabilities and those with autism. This funding has meant that a range of respite services, including centre based and day respite, is being provided around the country. For example, the 2005 annual report from the national intellectual disability database indicates an increase of 359.7% in the number of individuals availing of centre based respite services either as a planned or emergency intervention, bringing the total number of availing of respite services in 2005 to 4,004.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Deputy is aware an integral part of the national disability strategy is the multiannual investment programme, published in December 2004 by the Government, which contains details of specific commitments in relation to the provision of specific high priority disability services over the period 2006 to 2009. These commitments include the development of new residential, respite and day places for persons with intellectual disability and autism in each of the years covered by the programme.</P>
        <P>Additional funding amounting to &euro;59 million is being provided in 2006 to meets costs associated with the various elements of this programme. This funding will be used to put in place 255 new residential places, 85 new respite places and 535 new day places for persons with intellectual disability and those with autism, and also to progress the programme to transfer persons with intellectual disability or autism from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements.</P>
        <P>In addition to the specific high profile disability services which are included in the programme outlined, further additional funding amounting to &euro;41 million is being provided to enhance the multidisciplinary support services for people with disabilities in line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to build capacity within the health services in order to deliver on the various legislative pro<Col N="1424"/>visions contained in the national disability strategy.</P>
        <P>The management and delivery of health and personal social services in individual cases is a matter for the relevant HSE area.</P>
        <P>Capital funding amounting to &euro;55 million is also being provided in 2006 to support these developments.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 336 and 337 together.</P>
        <P>The report of the expert group on mental health policy, A Vision for Change, was launched on 24 January. This policy envisions an active, flexible and community-based mental health service where the need for hospital admission will be greatly reduced. It will require substantial funding, but there is considerable equity in buildings and lands within the current mental health system, which could be realised to fund this plan. <Col N="1425"/>Therefore, this report recommends that steps be taken to bring about the closure of all psychiatric hospitals and to re-invest the resources released by these closures in the mental health service. The closure of large mental hospitals and the move to modern units attached to general hospitals, together with the expansion of community services, has been Government policy since the publication of Planning for the Future in 1984.</P>
        <P>In A Vision for Change, a four-stage process is recommended for the closure of the hospitals as follows: to identify measures required to enable admission to cease and put these measures in place, to cease admissions to the hospital and draw up plans for relocation of existing patients, to implement plans for the relocation of existing patients and final closure of the hospital.</P>
        <P>The report emphasises that this process should take place on a phased basis with wards closing sequentially. The Health Service Executive has stated that it anticipates the closure of mental hospitals and the reinvestment of the proceeds to take place on a phased basis. It has also emphasised that hospitals can only close when the clinical needs of the remaining patients have been addressed in more appropriate settings such as additional community residences, day hospitals and day centres together with a substantial increase in the number of the well-trained, fully staffed, community-based multidisciplinary community mental health teams as is recommended in A Vision for Change.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 339 and 342 together.</P>
        <P>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive has responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for the management of human resources and determining the appropriate staffing mix required to deliver its service plan priorities within approved employment ceilings. The parliamentary affairs division of the executive has therefore been asked to respond directly to the <Col N="1426"/>Deputy in regard to the issues raised. The Deputy will be aware however of the substantial increases in health service staffing over recent years in line with service developments. Further information is given in the following paragraph on overall increases and in regard to increases in numbers of key personnel.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s health service employment census encompasses staff employed by the Health Service Executive, the voluntary hospitals and some intellectual disability agencies. The health service employment census shows a total of 101,513 wholetime equivalent staff, excluding home helps, at end September 2005. This compares with a total of 81,513 at end December 2000 and represents an increase of 20,000 or 24.5%. There has been an increase of 1,511 or 26.5% in medical and dental personnel, an increase of 5,701 or 19.5% in nursing personnel and an increase of 6,052 or 79.4% in health and social care personnel over end-2000 figures.</P>

	<P>The National Cancer Registry has routinely collected data on county of residence for all incidences of cancer since 1994. These data have been published in a number of reports, including Cancer in Ireland 1994-2000 and two all-Ireland cancer reports All-Ireland Cancer Statistics 1994-1996 and All-Ireland Cancer Statistics 1998-2000. Up-to-date tables describing cancer incidence by site, sex and county of residence are also available to the public on the registry website, <i>www.ncri.ie</i>. In addition to this routine analysis, the registry has carried out a number of analyses of cancer incidence for single counties in response to specific local issues.</P>
        <P>The most recent detailed analysis of the relationship between cancer incidence and county of residence was carried out for the second all-Ireland cancer report, for the period 1998 to 2000, which was published in 2004. While this report showed some relationship between region of residence and cancer incidence, there were a few instances where this relationship could be shown at county level. In general, the number of cancer cases diagnosed at county level were too few, and the variation in incidence between counties too small, for any meaningful conclusions to be drawn. The only clear exception to this was for lung cancer, where incidence and mortality were significantly higher in Dublin than elsewhere. This variation in lung cancer incidence between urban and rural settings was also found in Belfast <Col N="1427"/>and Derry and is consistent with the pattern of incidence of lung cancer in other countries.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have made significant improvements to the way in which an applicant&rsquo;s eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards is assessed. In January 2005, I increased the income guidelines used in the assessment of medical card applications by 7.5%.</P>
        <P>In June 2005, it was apparent that the effect of rising income in our successful economy meant that the target of 30,000 additional medical cards and 200,000 GP visit cards would not be achieved. At this time I simplified the means test for both medical cards and GP visit cards. It is now based on an applicant&rsquo;s and spouse&rsquo;s income after income tax and PRSI, and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, child care and travel to work. This is much fairer to applicants.</P>
        <P>I announced, on 13 October 2005, that the income guidelines for both medical cards and GP visit cards would be increased by an additional 20%. This means the income guidelines are now 29% higher than they were at the end of 2004. It will be noted that the income assessment guidelines used for the GP visit cards are 25% higher than those used for medical cards.</P>
        <P>In December 2005 my Department asked the HSE to take account of the welfare, taxation or other changes announced in the budget on the operation of the income guidelines and to identify any changes which may be required to ensure that medical cards and GP visit cards continue to be available to those who need them. I expect to receive a report from the HSE shortly about this matter.</P>

	<P>Significant preparatory work related to the implementation of <Col N="1430"/>the provisions of Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 has been undertaken to date by my Department with the Health Service Executive. In particular, a programme of consultation will take place over the next three months which is specifically designed to involve key stakeholders in the formulation of the structure which will support the delivery of the assessment of need process. The outcome of this process, together with other preparatory work, including mapping and identifying capacity and operational resources, will provide the basis for drafting the necessary regulations provided for in Part 2, and inform my Department in relation to the timescale for the full commencement of the provisions of Part 2.</P>
        <P>The preparatory work regarding Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 also has to take account of the related provisions in the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004. These relate to the assessment of children with special educational needs and the delivery of appropriate health-related support services by the Health Service Executive. These two legislative measures are complementary, with the same standards applying to the assessment processes provided for in both Acts.

	<P>The Government has agreed the key elements of a scheme for the repayment of long stay charges for publicly funded residential care. All those fully eligible persons who were wrongly charged and are alive and the estates of all those who were wrongly charged and died since 9 December 1998 will have the charges repaid in full. The scheme will not allow for repayments to the estates of those who died prior to that date. The repayments will include both the actual charge paid and an amount to take account of inflation &mdash; using the consumer price index &mdash; since the time the person involved was charged.</P>
        <P>Persons who were in publicly contracted beds in private nursing homes are covered by the terms of the Supreme Court judgment. The provisions of the judgment do not apply to individuals in private nursing homes who have entered these homes under the nursing home subvention <Col N="1431"/>scheme. The broad policy issues about State support for long-term care for older people, including residential care both publicly and privately provided, have been examined by an interdepartmental group.

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that as a general rule all vehicles imported permanently into the State must register for VRT purposes within 24 hours of arrival. This rule applies equally to vehicles imported by EU and non-EU persons. However, section 135(<i>a</i>) of the Finance <Col N="1433"/>Act 1992 permits a European or other foreign registered vehicle which is temporarily brought into the State by a person established outside the State to be exempted from the requirement to register for VRT purposes for a period normally not exceeding 12 months from the date upon which the vehicle concerned was brought into the State.</P>
        <P>There is no requirement for vehicles imported under the temporary exemption provisions to be presented to the Revenue Commissioners to avail of the relief. Documents relating to ownership, registration or bringing into the State of the vehicle must be kept with the vehicle when it is in use in the State. When such vehicles fail to meet the conditions for temporary exemption they must be permanently removed from the State or presented for registration. The details of such vehicles are therefore not normally captured or held in the vehicle registration system.</P>
        <P>These provisions are in line with Article 39 of the EU Treaty, which provides for the free movement of its workers within member states. The Deputy may wish to note that a reciprocal arrangement is also in place for our own State residents in fellow member states.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Permanently imported left-hand drive cars must be registered in the vehicle registration tax system and issued with Irish registration plates. However, in the registration process it is not obligatory either to identify such vehicles as left-hand drive or to provide the nationality of the persons importing the vehicles. However, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that based on information entered by customers on VRT form 4, at the time of registration, the numbers of left-hand drive cars known to have been imported in the years 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 are as follows:</P>

        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The amount of DIRT due to be paid each year is dependent on the amount of moneys on deposit and the rates of interest applying to such deposits rather than on the number of accounts involved. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the statutory return of DIRT filed by the financial institutions requires details only of the relevant amount of interest paid in the year and the appropriate tax in relation to the payment of that interest. Such DIRT returns are subject to audit by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P>A refund of deposit interest retention tax is provided for in very limited circumstances only, <i>viz</i> an individual who is not liable or fully liable to income tax and is over 65 years of age at some time during the tax year or is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity from maintaining himself or herself. Bodies qualifying for charitable status and companies are also entitled to refund of DIRT. The taxpayer must advise Revenue that he or she meets the legislative requirements and the amount of the retention tax suffered.</P>
        <P>With deposit interest rates being very low in recent years, the quantum of the interest earned and tax retained would be very small in many cases and may be considered uneconomic to reclaim. In 2004 the Revenue Commissioners issued some 15,000 copies of the relevant form &mdash; form 54D &mdash; to those who claimed refunds in previous years. A corresponding figure for the number of forms issued in 2005 is not yet available.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, each year, employers are requested to inform Revenue of the number of blank P60s they <Col N="1435"/>require. These forms are distributed in late November or early December. No delays were experienced in that regard in 2005.</P>
        <P>Employers who do not notify Revenue of their P60 requirements following the initial invitation to do so can receive the forms subsequently by contacting Revenue and blank forms are issued without delay. In the circumstances, therefore, issue of P60s by Revenue is not impacting on the repayment of tax to those who may have overpaid. Employers must provide the completed P60 to employees within 46 days from the end of the year. In respect of the year 2005, employers have until 15 February 2006 to provide the completed P60 to the employee.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 358 to 360, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The childminding relief I introduced in budget 2006 allows an individual to mind up to three children in the minder&rsquo;s own home, without paying tax, PRSI or levies on the childminding earnings received, provided the amount is not more than &euro;10,000 per annum. If childminding income exceeds &euro;10,000, the total amount will be taxable, as normal, under self-assessment. The income limit of &euro;10,000 refers to gross income. No deductions will be allowed, for example in respect of expenses, in determining the individual&rsquo;s income level.</P>
        <P>The new scheme is not a tax allowance, but is in fact an income disregard of &euro;10,000. Where an individual chooses to avail of this relief, it will automatically follow that the amount earned, once it does not exceed &euro;10,000, will not be assessable to tax or PRSI or levies and will thus be exempt from tax, PRSI and levies. Any change to make the income subject to PRSI under the scheme, either on a mandatory basis or in all circumstances on a voluntary basis, would require an amendment to the relevant social welfare legislation which would be a matter for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to consider in the first instance.</P><Col N="1436"/>
        <P>I understand that the &ldquo;rights and entitlements&rdquo; referred to by the Deputy are those derived from payments made under the PRSI system. Again, these are primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.</P>

	<P>Certain foster care payments are exempt by virtue of section 192B of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. This measure was introduced by section 11 of the Finance Act 2005 and applies with effect from 1 January 2005.</P>
        <P>The provision exempts from income tax, payments made by the Health Service Executive to a carer in respect of the care of foster children. Under the legislation, &ldquo;carer&rdquo; means an individual who is or was a foster parent or relative or who takes care of an individual on behalf of the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>The payments in question are those made in accordance with Article 14 of the Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulations 1995 or Article 14 of the Child Care (Placement of Children with Relatives) Regulations 1995. In addition, the exemption covers certain discretionary payments made by the Health Service Executive in respect of former foster children between the ages of 18 and 21 who continue to reside with carers. It also covers such payments to carers in respect of those aged 21 years or over who suffer from a disability or are in full-time education where the disability or full-time education commenced before they reached the age of 21.</P>
        <P>Finally, corresponding payments relating to foster children made in accordance with the law of another EU member state are also exempted under the provision.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The 2003 figures are not comparable with subsequent years because of changes which came into effect in that year. Furthermore, exceptional repayments which arise, for example, in cases which proceed through all stages of the appeal process and take many years to finally determine cannot be isolated in the above figures and make year on year comparisons inappropriate.</P>
        <P>The rate of interest applicable since 31 October 2003 is 0.011% per day &mdash; approximately 4% per annum. The rate in the period 1 September 2002 to 31 October 2003 was 0.0161% per day- approximately 6% per annum. The interest is tax-free.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the general question of whether the legislation is too restrictive, my predecessor as Minister for Finance, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, examined the whole question of taxpayers&rsquo; entitlement to repayment of tax and interest on tax repayments in the context of Finance Bill 2003 with a view to introducing, in so far as practicable, a uniform scheme which was fair and reasonable for taxpayers, and which also took into account the position of the Exchequer. On foot of that review, a new scheme was introduced in Finance Act 2003 which gives taxpayers a general right to repayment of tax overpaid subject to a four year time limit on claims. Depending on the circumstances giving rise to the repayment, interest is calculated from the end of the tax period to which the claim relates or six months from the date on which a valid claim to the repayment is made. A corollary to the restriction to four years on the taxpayer&rsquo;s right to a repayment was a reduction to four years in the Revenue Commissioners right to assess taxpayers, except where fraud or neglect is involved, where no limit applies.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the current provision is fair and appropriate and I have no plans to amend the legislation accordingly.</P>

<Col N="1439"/>        <Quest>if, arising from provisions included in budget 2006 relating to the provision of home care services for elderly persons in their own homes, such services will incur a 13.5% VAT charge while exactly similar services provided in nursing homes will be VAT exempt as outlined in correspondence, details supplied; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that home care services provided directly by the Health Service Executive, HSE, do not generally come within the scope of VAT, as public bodies are not regarded as taxable persons. This means that they do not charge VAT on the services they provide and cannot recover VAT incurred on their input costs.</P>
        <P>The package of services aimed at older people, announced by the T&aacute;naiste in the 2006 budget, is to be based on the pilot home care packages in place and will deliver a wide range of services. The packages are delivered through the HSE by a range of providers, including the HSE itself, voluntary groups and the private sector. Home care packages will consist of a mixture of grants, contracted care services, therapeutic input and equipment and other such community services as identified in the needs assessment as being necessary to facilitate the older person to remain living in his or her own home.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, where home care services are provided for by private companies for a consideration in the course or furtherance of business, the provider may be obliged to register and account for VAT at the appropriate rate depending on the type of service it provides. Home care provided to individuals consists of a variety of services which may be liable to VAT at different rates. The current VAT treatment of such services is in accordance with the EU sixth VAT directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply.</P>
        <P>However, officials from my Department, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Health and Children are examining this issue. In particular, they are trying to ensure that the home care services provided under this package are exempt from VAT in a manner that complies with EU law. In this regard, I understand that a national standardised needs assessment process will be developed by the HSE in 2006, which will design systems and approaches to the implementation of the home care packages based on its experience to date. When this is put in place, it should make it possible to exempt such services from VAT in line with EU law.</P>

	<P>The current tax relief for waste service charges is provided by granting relief at the standard rate to taxpayers in respect of the charges they have paid in the previous year. Where a fixed annual charge applies, the full payment qualifies for tax relief, provided it has been paid on time. Where a variable charge is applied for refuse collection, based on a weight or volume, the tax relief is restricted to a maximum of &euro;195 per annum at the standard rate of tax. Tax credits, as they currently apply in the tax system, are generally only of value when the taxpayer has sufficient income on which he or she pays enough tax to use them. Finally, the Finance Bill will be published on 2 February and it is not the practice to comment on it, one way or another, before it is presented to the D&aacute;il.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 373 and 374 together.</P>
        <P>My Department has made no commitments to the European tour in respect of the broadcasting of the Ryder Cup. In March 2003, the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act 1999 (Designation of Major Events) Order 2003 specified the events designated as events of major importance to society for which the right of a qualifying broadcaster to provide coverage on free television services should be provided in the public interest. Section 9 of the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) (Amendment) Act 2003 requires me to carry out a review of designated events not later than three years after the passing of the 2003 Act, that is to say, not later than April 2006.</P>
        <P>I announced my intention to commence this review in December 2005. The purpose of the review is to consider if the list of events designated in 2003 should be amended. As part of the review, I initiated a public consultation process. My Department wrote to the sporting organisations that organise the events already designated along with the European tour and Ryder Cup informing them of the review and seeking their <Col N="1442"/>views. My Department has also sought the views of broadcasters. I have received submissions from event organisers, broadcasters and members of the public via written submission, e-mail and on an Internet forum. The submissions received have been made available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>If, following the review, I should decide to amend the list of designated events, then, in accordance with the provisions of the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act 1999, I will publish my intention to do so and seek the views of interested parties. This would involve a further formal consultation with event organisers and broadcasters. EU approval would also be required before I could lay an order before both Houses of the Oireachtas to give effect to the designation.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 376 and 377 together.</P>
        <P>Article 29.5 of the Constitution provides that every international agreement to which the State becomes a party, except international agreements of a technical and administrative character, must be laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. However, my Department has gone further and introduced the practice of laying all international agreements, regardless of their character, before the House.</P>
        <P>The obligation to lay an international agreement before the House arises only when the State becomes a party to such an agreement. It has been made clear by the courts that, for the purpose of Article 29.5, Ireland is to be considered a party to an international agreement only when it has been ratified or acceded to, signed without reservation as to ratification or where it otherwise binds the State in international law. In addition, the agreement must be in force for Ireland. For example, if it is a bilateral agreement, the other country must also have ratified it.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, an international agreement is not laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann where it has been merely signed, subject to ratification, by Ireland. Similarly, an agreement which has been ratified by Ireland but is not yet in force will not be laid before the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>It is the policy of my Department to ensure that all international agreements to which the State is a party are laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann promptly. The Constitution does not specify a timeframe within which international agreements should be laid before the D&aacute;il, although it is clearly highly desirable, to say the least, that this be done quickly. Until recent years, no specific timetable was in place. However, since 2004, targets have been set. Currently, the target is for all agreements which have entered into force for Ireland in a given calendar year to be laid before the D&aacute;il no later than the end of the following calendar year. Accordingly, all international agreements which entered into force for Ireland in 2005 will be laid before the D&aacute;il no later than the end of 2006.</P>
        <P>In addition to the constitutional requirement to lay certain international agreements before the House, as well as the practice of doing the same for all international agreements, there is also the clear desirability of making such agreements widely accessible. Up to recently, agreements were published in hard copy in the Irish Treaty Series at the same time as they were laid before the D&aacute;il. I felt this was somewhat restrictive and, last year, I decided to make the Irish Treaty Series available on my Department&rsquo;s website. As a result, the texts of all international agreements published since 2002 can be downloaded from the Department&rsquo;s website free of charge.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition, new resources have been made available to help with the above. In particular, a new full-time post of treaty officer has recently <Col N="1444"/>been created in the Department. This should help ensure that, in future, every international agreement is laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in a prompt manner and is also made readily available to the public. The treaty officer will also be able to intensify, in co-operation with colleagues within my own Department and in the wider Civil Service, a process already initiated in 2005 of reviewing departmental files with a view to identifying any international agreements previously entered into which may possibly have not yet been laid before the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>I will now turn to the two specific agreements in question. The agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Ireland concerning security measures for the protection of classified military information and the acquisition and cross-servicing agreement between the Department of Defence of Ireland and the Department of Defense of the United States of America were both laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 26 January. The first agreement was laid on a statutory basis and the second on a non-statutory basis. The difference of treatment is due to the fact that the first is regarded as an international agreement for the purposes of Article 29.5, whereas the second is being laid before the House as a matter of good practice.</P>
        <P>On 13 January, the full texts of both agreements had been placed in the Oireachtas library for the information of Members and also made available on the Department&rsquo;s website. In the light of the improvements described above, I am confident that best practice will be followed &mdash; over and above, and rightly so, what is strictly required &mdash; and that all future international agreements will be laid before the House in a prompt manner.</P>

	<P>Following the &ldquo;No&rdquo; votes in France and the Netherlands, the European Council in June of last year decided to instigate a period of reflection on the EU constitution and the future of Europe. This issue will be reviewed during the current Austrian Presidency. EU Foreign Ministers are responsible for preparing this review.</P>
        <P>The Government remains committed to the constitution and does not favour either selective implementation or any renegotiation of the text. The constitution is a balanced document and we are anxious to maintain that balance. Although there are many ideas in circulation concerning the <Col N="1445"/>fate of the constitution, no credible alternative scenario has yet gained significant support and most member states remain firmly committed to the constitution.</P>
        <P>While not wishing to underestimate the significance of last year&rsquo;s referendum results, it needs to be remembered that 13 member states have now ratified the constitution and we expect some others to follow suit during 2006. It remains our hope that the current period of reflection across the EU will help create the conditions for the future completion of the ratification process and for the constitution to be brought into force. I acknowledge, however, that this is unlikely to come about before 2007.</P>
        <P>With regard to the implications for the Irish Constitution, the Deputy will be aware that Ireland intends to ratify the EU constitution by referendum and that the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill was published last May. In the absence of greater clarity at the European level, however, there is no intention to hold an early referendum to enable Ireland to ratify the EU constitution and, consequently, there are no plans to move the Bill to its Second Stage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The General Affairs and External Relations Council, at its meeting in Brussels on 30 January 2006 which I attended, approved the renewal of the EU&rsquo;s restrictive measures against Zimbabwe for a further period of 12 months, until 20 February 2007.</P>
        <P>I very much welcome this decision to renew these restrictive measures. This decision reflects the fact that there has been no progress by the Mugabe government in the past year towards meeting those benchmarks on improved respect for democracy, human rights and the rule of law which the EU has set for reviewing its existing <Col N="1446"/>relations with Zimbabwe. On the contrary, the internal situation has clearly disimproved, particularly in the aftermath of the Zimbabwean Government&rsquo;s Operation Murambatsvina, launched last May, which resulted in an estimated 700,000 Zimbabweans being forcibly evicted from their homes or deprived of their livelihoods. The response of the Zimbabwean authorities to the worsening humanitarian situation which their actions have created continues to be inadequate. In particular, those responsible for planning and launching Operation Murambatsvina should be held accountable for their actions, as recommended by the UN Secretary General&rsquo;s special envoy, Anna Tibaijuka, who investigated these events last July.</P>
        <P>The overall humanitarian situation in Zimbabwe remains critical, with the World Food Programme estimating that some 4.4 million Zimbabweans, representing one-third of the population, will require emergency food assistance this year. Ireland provided almost &euro;2 million in emergency and recovery support, including food assistance, to the people of Zimbabwe during 2005 via the UN and agencies such as GOAL and Tr&oacute;caire. Further funding is planned and will be announced shortly, in response to the UN World Food Programme&rsquo;s global appeal for $276 million for Zimbabwe for the current year. Ireland remains committed to delivering assistance directly to those most in need in Zimbabwe through a broad range of civil and aid organisations.</P>
        <P>The political and human rights situation in Zimbabwe also continues to be of concern. The overall climate remains one of repression, with restrictions on the media and peaceful civil and trade union demonstration continuing to be suppressed. An unwelcome development was the adoption of a constitutional amendment by the Zimbabwean parliament last August, amendment number 17, which allows the Zimbabwean government to confiscate the passports of those whom it regards as undermining the national interest. Following a ruling by the Zimbabwean High Court last month declaring such seizure of passports illegal, enabling legislation is now likely to be prepared to give effect to this particular provision.</P>
        <P>It is clear that international pressure needs to be maintained on the Mugabe government to alter its current policies. African governments and organisations such as the African Union are in a particular position to exert influence in this regard. The adoption by the African commission on human and peoples&rsquo; rights, at its recent session in The Gambia, of a resolution condemning the human rights violations currently being perpetrated in Zimbabwe and urging the Zimbabwean Government to respect its international human rights obligations, demonstrates the widespread concern which now exists within <Col N="1447"/>Africa itself regarding the course upon which Zimbabwe is currently embarked.</P>
        <P>Ireland, along with our EU partners, remains committed to working with others in the international community to help promote democratic change in Zimbabwe. The possibility of the EU reviewing and extending certain of its restrictive measures currently in place remains an option in the absence of any underlying improvement in Zimbabwe.</P>

	<P>Under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme, the development co-operation directorate of my Department, which is currently based in Dublin, will decentralise to Limerick. This is scheduled to take place during the first quarter of 2007. Already, a total of 25 posts in the directorate, including that of director general, are filled by officers who have signalled their intention to decentralise to Limerick.</P>
        <P>In addition, there are currently 15 officers serving elsewhere in the Department, mostly abroad, who have also expressed an interest in decentralising to Limerick. These officers will be assigned to the directorate on a phased basis. This total of 40 represents some 32% of the posts being transferred to Limerick. The process of recruiting further staff for Limerick via the central applications facility is also being accelerated. The aim is that, by the second half of 2006, most posts in the directorate will be filled by staff who will decentralise to Limerick. In addition, we are working in close co-ordination with the Office of Public Works on specific plans for office accommodation for the division in Limerick.</P>

	<P>The freedom of information Acts 1997 and 2003 established an independent process for consideration of freedom of information requests. As I have no role in respect of how the provisions of the Acts are applied in specific instances, it would be inappropriate for me to discuss the detail of individual requests. To do so would undermine <Col N="1448"/>the independence of designated decision makers and may also be prejudicial to the conduct of the appeals process provided for in the Acts.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, section 24(2) of the Acts provides for a mandatory exemption for certain types of records relating to security, defence, international relations and matters relating to Northern Ireland and deciding officers are required to refuse records that fall within its scope. I can confirm that the Department replied to two requests during 2005 that included a reference to the use of Shannon Airport. I understand that, while section 24(2) was appropriately applied to both requests, the requesters were provided with access to a number of records that did not come within its provisions.</P>

	<P>Two investigations are currently under way under the aegis of the Council of Europe. The first is an investigation by Senator Dick Marty, a rapporteur appointed by the legal affairs committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. The second takes the form of a questionnaire which has been sent to all member states of the Council of Europe by the Secretary General, Mr. Terry Davis.</P>
        <P>In respect of the first investigation, the Department of Foreign Affairs has not been contacted by Senator Marty who, in his most recent memorandum, accurately records the Government&rsquo;s &ldquo;total condemnation&rdquo; of the practice of rendition.</P>
        <P>In respect of the second investigation, as I informed the House on 14 December 2005, the Government is co-operating fully with the Secretary General&rsquo;s request. This will require input from a number of different Departments and Government bodies, and detailed work is actively and well under way in formulating the Government&rsquo;s response. This response will take its structure largely from the form of the questionnaire, namely, a description of domestic law relating to the issues raised by the Secretary General, followed by a comprehensive reply to his questions on the possibility that any &ldquo;unacknowledged deprivation of liberty&rdquo; might have taken place in Ireland. While the content of the Government&rsquo;s reply has not yet been finalised, I can assure the Deputy that my Department has no intention of withholding any information.</P>

	<P>As I indicated to the Deputy in my reply to Questions Nos. 397 and 272 of 8 November and 13 December 2005, respectively, I approved the tender and grant-aid of &euro;3.8 million for the Monaghan pool project in January 2005. This approval allowed the council to finalise the legal formalities with the contractor so that work could begin on the project. Construction of the pool is under way with a completion date of mid-year. To date, Monaghan County Council has drawn down &euro;1.62 million of the grant.</P>

	<P>Outbound tourism in the last three years has grown at a higher rate than inbound tourism. In 2003, expenditure by Irish residents travelling abroad &mdash; at &euro;4.16 billion &mdash; marginally exceeded tourism and travel earnings from visitors to Ireland &mdash; at &euro;4.06 billion &mdash; for the first time. This trend has continued in 2004 and 2005 where the last third quarter figures show a net outflow of almost &euro;400 million in our tourism and travel balance.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s economic prosperity, particularly in comparison with that of our main tourism markets, coupled with the greatly improved access to foreign tourist destinations, has undoubtedly contributed to this phenomenon. However, it is also clear that this has fuelled significant growth in domestic tourism. CSO figures over the last five years show domestic holiday trips up by 32% and expenditure up by over 50% over that period.</P>
        <P>Against a backdrop of intense international competition for Irish holidaymakers, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, which is responsible for promoting the home market, has significantly stepped up its home holiday campaigns in recent years backed by significant Exchequer resources.</P>
        <P>In 2006, some &euro;4 million has been allocated by F&aacute;ilte Ireland to home holiday promotion. F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s consumer website for the domestic market &mdash;<i>www.ireland.ie </i>&mdash; which was launched early in 2005 &mdash; has proven particularly successful in generating quality year round business for the sector. F&aacute;ilte Ireland also publishes the highly successful Discover Ireland series of brochures aimed at the domestic consumer.</P>

On 15 November, the council provided an addendum to the preliminary report in relation to the proposed new site and on 2 December 2005 submitted the revised contract documents.

	<P>My Department, with the exception of the National Archives, will be transferring to Killarney under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme. The number of applications received under the central applications facility, CAF, for approximately 130 posts exceeds the numbers required for most of the grades.

        <P>My officials are currently in the process of transferring staff, who have accepted an offer to relocate to Killarney, into the Department. This process will proceed on a phased basis is order to facilitate a smooth transition and appropriate training.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 389 and 395 together.</P>
        <P>In respect of numbers, the most recent figures released show that 19 existing employees in Enterprise Ireland have indicated their willingness to transfer to Shannon. The number of applications received from within the civil and public service, including my Department, amount to 33, thus giving a total overall of 52 persons.</P>
        <P>The most immediate implementation step for Enterprise Ireland is to provide for a new headquarters building designed to meet the business needs of the organisation. Enterprise Ireland, working closely with the Office of Public Works, OPW, has identified but not yet acquired a preferred site from the submissions received by the OPW in relation to the Shannon location. The preferred site is a 13-acre site owned by Shannon Development. In addition, and in co-operation with Shannon Development and OPW, the site was valued and a feasibility study carried out. The site occupies a prime position near the centre of Shannon and is considered suitable for a major landmark building or civic structure related to the town centre.</P>
        <P>It is too early to comment definitively on a timescale or on the cost of the transfer of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s headquarters to Shannon. The factors of significance in this regard will be the acquisition of property and the level of interest in the Shannon location expressed by CAF applicants. My Department is corresponding with the Department of Finance regarding the acquisition of the preferred site.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The main purpose of the community employment, CE, programme is to provide work experience and training for the long-term unemployed and disadvantaged groups, including those with a disability, and thereby enable participants to advance successfully to employment in the open labour market by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance-develop both their technical and personal skills.</P>
        <P>In addition CE assists in the provision of a wide range of social and community services at local level which augment and support statutory service provision in these areas. The added value of this involvement with state supported dedicated service provision is the positive training and learning environment provided to the CE participant. Many CE participants through this participation go on to become qualified professional workers in selected employments such as child care and personal care assistants.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Within this context, the ring fencing and prioritisation of places, including those in health related services, has been in place for the past five years. As a result of this ring-fencing of places, CE participation levels in the Centre for Independent Living are, and will continue to be, maintained at a constant and supportive level.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It should also be noted that under changes announced by me on 10 November 2004 the three year cap for participants on community employment was raised to six years for those over 55 years of age in order to ensure the maintenance of essential community services particularly in rural areas, where it had been found that difficulties existed in finding replacement participants.</P>
        <P>The aim of CE still remains primarily an active labour market programme with the emphasis on the progression and the development of individual participants. This is optimised when CE schemes are aligned with services provided by the responsible statutory provider which in the case of persons with a disability is the Department of Health and Children.</P>

	<P>The wages and employment conditions of workers employed in the hotel and restaurant business are in most instances governed by employment regulation orders made pursuant to the provisions of the Industrial Relations Acts 1946 to 2004.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The hotels employment regulation order applies to workers employed in hotels anywhere throughout the State except the County Borough of Cork and areas known until 1 January 1994 as the County Borough of Dublin and the Borough of D&uacute;n Laoghaire.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Wages and employment conditions of workers employed in the catering industry are governed by two catering employment regulation orders, one of which covers workers employed in catering establishments in the areas known until 1 January 1994 as the County Borough of Dublin and the Borough of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, and the other employment regulation order which covers catering establishments outside that area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">None of the above orders contains specific provision for payment of a premium for work carried out on Saturdays. In relation to Sunday work, the hotels employment regulation order provides that &ldquo;work performed on Sunday, which forms part of <Col N="1455"/>the 78 hour rostered fortnight, shall be paid for at double time. The extra pay, which is additional to normal pay will be based on the appropriate rate without Board or Lodging&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The order also provides that &ldquo;when an employee works a full day on a Sunday, which is in addition to the 78 hour rostered fortnight, he or she shall receive two additional day&rsquo;s pay based on the rate without Board or Lodging and pro rata for part-days&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The catering employment regulation order covering workers employed in catering establishments in the areas known until 1 January 1994 as the County Borough of Dublin and the Borough of D&uacute;n Laoghaire provides that &ldquo;all workers rostered to work on Sundays, other than overtime, shall be paid time plus one-third for rostered work. Work done on a day on which a worker would normally be off duty, including Sunday, shall be paid for at the rate of double time except where an option to take time off in lieu is agreed between the employer and worker&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The order also provides that &ldquo;part-time and casual workers are entitled to overtime after 78 hours in any fortnightly pay period. Where part-time or casual workers work on both Sundays in a fortnight, the second Sunday will be paid at the appropriate Sunday overtime rate of double time (whether or not 78 hours have been completed)&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The catering employment regulation order which covers workers employed in catering establishments for areas other than the areas known until 1 January 1994 as the County Borough of Dublin and the Borough of Dun Laoghaire provides that &ldquo;work performed on Sunday, as part of the normal roster, shall be paid at the rate of double time&rdquo;.</P>

        <P Just="Left">The catering employment regulation order for the areas known until 1 January 1994 as the County Borough of Dublin and the Borough of D&uacute;n Laoghaire provides the normal working fortnight, before overtime, shall be 78 hours for all full-time employees aged 18 years and over, over a minimum of eight days and a maximum of ten days. Normally, staff may be rostered for a maximum of ten hours per day but this may be extended to a maximum of 12 hours with the agreement of the individual employer and employee. Any shift in excess of eight hours is subject to employees receiving a 15 minutes paid and a 30 minutes unpaid break under the order. Employees are entitled to payment in respect of all hours worked and there are no exceptions to this basic entitlement.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The catering employment regulation order for the areas other than the areas known until 1 January 1994 as the County Borough of Dublin and the Borough of D&uacute;n Laoghaire makes no specific provision in relation to length of shifts.

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Unemployment benefit is a short-term, contribution-based payment which is payable for up to 15 months, after which a person may apply for unemployment assistance, a means tested pay<Col N="1458"/>ment. Alternatively, one of a couple may receive credited contributions only, in order to maintain an insurance record while qualifying as an adult dependant on a spouse and partner&rsquo;s or on a partner&rsquo;s claim. However, there is no obligation on any person to become a qualified adult dependant on a partner&rsquo;s social welfare payment.</P>
        <P>In general a payment limitation applies where unemployment assistance is in payment to one of a married or cohabiting couple and the recipient&rsquo;s partner is also in receipt of a payment. In this case, the rate of unemployment assistance payable is the maximum amount payable if one person claimed the other as an adult dependant.</P>
        <P>Administrative individualisation is in place within the social welfare system, whereby a qualified adult dependant may opt to receive the relevant payment separately. This does not involve any changes in the rules and conditions for entitlement but comprises arrangements whereby payments, which include increases in respect of a qualified adult, are split between the parties involved. My Department has always provided for payments to be split in certain circumstances, for example, in cases of domestic difficulty where a spouse might otherwise have no other form of income.</P>
        <P>The issue of better integration of the taxation and social welfare systems has been considered on a number of occasions since the Commission on Social Welfare finalised its report in 1986 most notably by the tax welfare integration group in 1996 and in the report of the working group examining the treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent families under the tax and social welfare codes of 1999. The latter report noted that there are clear differences in the social welfare and tax codes in their treatment of different types of households, but that it could be argued that the income support and revenue generation objectives of the codes were fundamentally different.</P>

        <Quest>if arrangements have been made that persons taking up childminding under the &euro;10,000 tax exemption scheme announced in the 2006 budget could obtain cover at least at class S even though exempt from payment of the insurance levy on earnings up to &euro;10,000.</Quest>

	<P>The childminding relief was announced by the Minister for Finance in budget 2006 and will be provided for in forthcoming legislation. It will allow an individual to supervise up to three children in his or her own home, exempting all related childminding earnings up to a maximum ceiling of &euro;10,000 per annum from tax, social insurance and levy payments. If childminding income exceeds &euro;10,000, the respective <Col N="1459"/>total amount earned by the minder will be taxable &mdash; as normal &mdash; under self-assessment procedures.</P>
        <P>This new scheme for childminders is not a tax allowance but is in fact an income disregard of &euro;10,000. It automatically follows that the amount earned &mdash; once it does not exceed &euro;10,000 &mdash; is not assessable to either tax payments. Because self-employed income for social insurance purposes is primarily determined by reference to income assessable under income tax legislation, such income will not be reckonable for the purposes of making PRSI contributions without a change to social welfare legislation. It is possible, of course, that an individual contributor may opt to make a voluntary contribution to the social insurance system in order to maintain his or her existing contribution record.</P>
        <P>I will consider the question of any changes to the social welfare code as a result of this measure in the context of forthcoming legislation.</P>

	<P>My Department provides child income support in a number of ways. The principal support is child benefit, a universal payment which is neutral <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the employment status of the child&rsquo;s parents and does not contribute to poverty traps. Since 1997, the monthly rates of child benefit have increased by &euro;111.91 at the lower rate and &euro;135.48 at the higher rate, increases of 293.8% and 273.6% respectively. From April 2006, child benefit rates will be &euro;150 per month for each of the first two children and &euro;185 per month for the third and each subsequent child. Child benefit is paid to over 547,540 families in respect of approximately 1,060,740 children.</P>
        <P>A second child income support is child dependant allowance, paid in addition to weekly social welfare payments in respect of over 255,737 children at full rate and over 83,577 at half rate.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department provides cash support by way of weekly payments to families at work on low pay, through the family income supplement scheme. A number of improvements have been made to the scheme over the years, including assessment of entitlement on the basis of net rather than gross income and progressive increases in the income thresholds, making it easier for lower income households to qualify for payment. As a result, there are currently over <Col N="1460"/>17,448 families receiving a weekly FIS payment, reaching nearly 33,956 children. This is the highest number of FIS recipients in the history of the scheme.</P>
        <P>Child poverty is clearly a complex area requiring co-ordinated action across a range of Government services and income support payments. The development of income supports which can make the most effective contribution to child poverty lies within my Department&rsquo;s responsibilities and a series of budgets have increased considerably in real terms the level of resources which are going to families with children.</P>
        <P>While the range of income and other supports has made very significant contributions, a key issue arises as to whether this level of resources is best used to address poverty among those families. While the solutions to the problem of child poverty cover a wide range of measures, including income supports and services, I am committed to reviewing the role of child income supports in this regard. This includes examining the feasibility of merging the family income supplement and child dependant allowance into a second tier child income support taking account of an examination being carried out in this area by the National Economic and Social Council.</P>

	<P Just="Left">As detailed in the reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 165 of 23 November 2005 and 138 of 1 December 2005, the person concerned applied for carer&rsquo;s allowance in respect of two carers on 4 October 2005. The principal conditions for receipt of the allowance are that full-time care and attention is required and being provided and that the means test that applies are satisfied. Additionally, the requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes including carer&rsquo;s allowance with effect from 1 May 2004.</P>

The basis for the restriction contained in the new rules is the applicant&rsquo;s habitual residence. The restriction is not based on citizenship, nationality, immigration status or any other factor. The question of what is a person&rsquo;s habitual residence is decided in accordance with European Court of Justice case law, which sets out the grounds for assessing individual claims.</P><Col N="1461"/>
        <P>Each case received for a determination on the habitual residence condition is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on application of the guidelines to the particular individual circumstances of each case. Any applicant who disagrees with the decision of a deciding officer has the right to appeal to the social welfare appeals office.</P>
        <P>There has been no change in legislation relating to the habitual residence condition. A circular issued in November 2005 clarifying the position regarding the application of the habitual residence condition to supplementary welfare allowance. This was incorrectly reported in some areas of the media as a change in legislation.</P>
        <P>Having examined all the facts in the case raised by the Deputy, a deciding officer decided that the person does not satisfy the habitual residence condition on the grounds that she has not been continuously resident in the State or in the common travel area for the last two years. Furthermore, it is not clear that she intends to reside in the State permanently from now on and she has maintained substantial links abroad by retaining property in the United States of America. She was notified of this decision, the reason for it and the right to an appeal on 21 November 2005.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The award of the one-parent family payment recognises the recipient as head of a distinct family unit. Payment of a child dependant increase in respect of the same person would be inconsistent with that principle. In addition, social welfare legislation provides that where a person may qualify for more than one payment, the one that is more beneficial is put into payment. In the scenario outlined in the Deputy&rsquo;s question the one-parent family payment is more beneficial than the child dependant allowance.</P>

	<P>The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying <Col N="1462"/>condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1 May 2004. The basis for the restriction contained in the new rules is the applicant&rsquo;s habitual residence. The restriction is not based on citizenship, nationality, immigration status or any other factor. The question of what is a person&rsquo;s habitual residence is decided in accordance with European Court of Justice case law, which sets out the grounds for assessing individual claims.</P>
        <P>Each case received for a determination on the habitual residence condition is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on application of the guidelines to the particular individual circumstances of each case. A person who has supplied proof of residence in the common travel area for a period of two years or more and who intends to settle here will satisfy the habitual residence condition. The common travel area includes Ireland, Great Britain, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.</P>
        <P>The person concerned made an application for unemployment assistance in August 2005. When making his claim for unemployment assistance, he stated that he had lived in Northern Ireland for a period of four years until September 2004. His case was referred to the habitual residence unit of my Department for a determination on his habitual residence in the State. In November 2005, he was requested to submit evidence of his residence in Northern Ireland for the period from November 2003 to September 2004.</P>
        <P>As the person concerned did not provide the requested information, his application for unemployment assistance was disallowed in January 2006 because he had failed to furnish evidence that he had lived in the common travel area. Accordingly, he was notified of the deciding officer&rsquo;s decision and was advised of his right of review and appeal. It is open to him to submit the requested proof of residence and his case will then be reviewed.</P>

	<P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive payments with meeting the cost of their additional heating needs during the winter season. Fuel allowances are paid for 29 weeks from the end of September to mid-April and are not intended to meet the full cost of heating.</P>
        <P>Eligibility is subject to means. People who already qualify for means-tested pensions or allowances such as old age, non-contributory, pension, long-term unemployment assistance or one-parent family payment do not have to undergo a further means test to qualify for fuel allowance. The majority of people who receive fuel allowances qualify because they satisfy the relevant means test for their primary weekly payment.</P>
        <P>In the case of contributory pensions such as old age contributory, retirement and invalidity pensions, which are not means tested, a person may have a combined household income of up to &euro;51 per week, or savings or investments of up to &euro;46,000, over and above the maximum contributory pension rate used for reference purposes, and still qualify for fuel allowance. In this way, the fuel allowance income limits increase each season in line with the increases in this reference pension rate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The 2006 budget provided for an increase in the rate of fuel allowance of &euro;5 from &euro;9 to &euro;14, or &euro;17.90 in designated smokeless areas. Some 274,000 customers, 151,000 with basic fuel allowance and 123,000 with smokeless supplement, will benefit in 2006 at an estimated cost of &euro;125.1 million.</P>
        <P>Any changes in the means rules or other conditions of the scheme would have significant cost implications and would have to be considered in the context of the budget and in the light of the resources available to me for improvements in social welfare generally.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s insurance reform programme initiated in 2002 has been very successful in bringing down the cost and increasing the availability of motor insurance. Arising from the insurance reform programme, there has been an overall reduction in premia levels for motorists of 26.1% since April 2003. This has been brought about chiefly through the initiative of the Government by improving the functioning of the insurance market decreasing the cost of delivery of compensation and investigating the competitiveness of the market.</P>
        <P>Insurance premia have reduced for young drivers, but not as significantly as other categories of drivers. The principal reason the price of motor insurance has decreased less in the case of young drivers is the high incidence of road accidents occurring in this category. Males aged between 17 and 25 are over-represented in fatal and serious injury crashes. Unfortunately, road accident statistics indicate that young drivers are eight times more likely to be killed or seriously injured in a road traffic accident than any other sector of the driving population.</P>
        <P>Recent cost surveys carried out by the Financial Regulator show significant differences in quotes between insurance companies and it pays the motorist to shop around. Moreover, first time drivers will initially be unable to build up a no claims bonus record; something which more experienced drivers can achieve. However, after the first year, providing that the necessary conditions are met, the new driver will be able to apply the first year discount to reduce the cost of his or her policy.</P>
        <P>Under the Equal Status Acts 2000 to 2004, a person cannot be charged more solely on the basis of age unless the insurer can show that the difference in treatment is reasonable and is justified by reliance on actuarial or statistical data or other underwriting or commercial factors. Insurers base their premia on their experience of claims relating to certain demographics and user types.</P><Col N="1466"/>
        <P>EU law prevents governments from intervening with regard to premium levels or in respect of what risks insurance companies are prepared to underwrite. According to the motor insurance industry, the cost of insuring a driver who has yet to pass the driving test is substantially higher than for a driver with a full licence. Consequently I expect that the implementation of the package of measures aimed at a substantial increase in test throughput will over time reduce the cost of insurance for younger drivers. My Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance, is developing a package of measures to deal with the backlog of driving test applications.</P>
        <P>There is a personal responsibility on all who drive to drive safely at all times. The National Safety Council concludes that 86% of collisions are caused by human error. If we all take more care, accidents will reduce, as will the cost of motor insurance.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 411 and 412 together.</P>
        <P>On 15 December last, the Progressive Democrats launched a discussion document, A New Heart for Dublin. According to the document it is intended to fuel debate and it invites submissions from interested parties.</P>
        <P>In January 2005, when responsibility for ports policy resided in the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, the Minister of State with responsibility for marine affairs launched the Government&rsquo;s ports policy statement. The policy statement aims to better equip the port sector and its stakeholders to meet national and regional capacity and service needs. One of the key challenges that lies ahead is the provision of adequate in-time port capacity, particularly for unitised trade. The policy statement sets out a framework to ensure that capacity needs are identified, planned and progressed in a coordinated manner.</P><Col N="1467"/>
        <P>As an initial step in this process, the Department consulted with the commercial ports handling unitised trade, to determine their view of port capacity and how they intended to deal with the projected capacity requirement. Both Dublin Port Company and Drogheda Port Company, along with other port companies, responded in this regard with information on their project proposals.</P>
        <P>In addition, in September 2005, the Department appointed a firm of consultants expert in this field, Fisher Associates, to, <i>inter alia</i>, invite detailed project submissions from the commercial ports and evaluate those submissions. As part of this process the Department of Transport expects submissions from both Dublin Port Company and Drogheda Port Company with regard to their capacity plans.</P>
        <P>The purpose of this process is to satisfy the Government that the anticipated capacity requirement to 2014 and beyond can be efficiently and adequately met through the successful advancement and implementation by the port sector of some combination of the key projects referred to above. It is envisaged that the final report of Fisher Associates will be finalised by the second quarter of 2006.</P>
        <P>Drogheda Port Company has a well-publicised proposal to develop a new port facility at Bremore in north County Dublin. Drogheda Port Company updated my officials on the progress of this project at meetings in December 2005 and January 2006. In addition, I am informed that on Friday, 27 January 2006, Drogheda Port Company published a notice in the national and international press seeking joint venture partners in the project. The company is aware that participation in any such joint venture would require my approval, given with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>

The council has been advised that this proposal will be considered in the context of a general revision of the traffic and parking regulations. The review is being pursued initially through the preparation of a new traffic signs manual being developed at present to provide a comprehensive framework for traffic signage in the future.</P>

	<P>The Irish Aviation Authority was established under the Irish Aviation Act 1993 and given responsibility for the safety regulation of the Irish aviation industry and the provision of air traffic management services in Irish airspace. The authority exercises its safety regulation functions and service provision functions in accordance with the norms of international standards and procedures, both European, that is, European Aviation Safety Agency, EASA, Joint Aviation Authorities, JAA, Eurocontrol, and global, the International Civil Aviation Authority, ICAA. It is, furthermore, the competent authority for purposes of the EU EASA regulations.</P>
        <P>The question of resources within the authority is entirely a matter for the board. The authority has advised me that its workforce in the safety regulation area has been recently reinforced in the operations and airworthiness areas to take account of growth in the aviation industry.</P>
        <P>My responsibility in the safety functions of the authority arises under section 32 of the 1993 Act, <Col N="1470"/>which requires me, periodically, to commission an examination of the performance by the company of its functions in so far as they relate to the application and enforcement of technical and safety standards in aircraft and air navigation. The most recent examination took place in 2004 and concluded that there is a general, positive and pro-active attitude and competence vis-&agrave;-vis safety and the maintenance of a high safety level.</P>
        <P>The authority is also periodically subject to external review by EASA, JAA and other agencies such as ICAO and Eurocontrol. I understand that these reviews concluded that the Irish Aviation Authority is performing its functions satisfactorily and is appropriately resourced for its task.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 420 and 421 together.</P>
        <P>The items to be tested, the method of testing and the reasons for failure of the NCT are set out in the national car test, NCT, Manual 2004 published by my Department. Right-hand drive <Col N="1471"/>and left-hand drive vehicles are subject to the same test.</P>
        <P>An extensive range of requirements relating to the construction, equipment, lighting and use of the vehicle must be satisfied in order to use a motor vehicle on Irish roads. These requirements are set out in the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 2002, the Road Traffic (Construction and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 2003 to 2004 and the Road Traffic (Lighting of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 1996. On steering, the regulations provide that a vehicle must be equipped with a strong and efficient steering mechanism which enables the vehicle to be turned easily, quickly and with certainty and which is constructed and arranged that no overlock is possible and that the wheels will not under any circumstances foul any part of the vehicle. There is, however, no obligation for the steering wheel to be on the right-hand side of the vehicle.</P>
        <P>At European level, the regulatory framework for vehicle standards is set through a harmonised system of motor vehicle type-approval known as EU-Vehicle Type Approval, VTA. The VTA system facilitates the achievement of a single market for motor vehicles and their components through harmonised safety and environmental standards and, in that regard, standards have been specified in a series of separate EU type-approval directives including standards relating to steering equipment. The type-approval process ensures that new vehicles put on the market meet the safety and environmental standards laid down by the EU. A fundamental principle of the VTA system is that it is not open to a member state of the EU to refuse to register a new vehicle for use on its roads, on grounds relating to a particular vehicle matter, where the vehicle concerned complies with the requirements of the relevant type-approval directive for that matter.</P>
        <P>Given Single Market rules, a vehicle which is put into service in one member state is entitled to be used and/or traded in any other member state subject, of course, to its roadworthiness and compliance with other regulatory requirements, for example, VRT and motor tax. Typically, a left-hand drive European vehicle would require adjustments to be made to its headlights and mirrors for it to be used on Irish roads. While the alignment of the headlights is checked as part of the periodic roadworthiness test, it is a matter for the user of the vehicle to ensure that mirrors are correctly set.</P>
        <P>Vehicles with left-hand side steering are used in this country by nationals and non-nationals who have imported them temporarily or permanently for their own use, by operators of specialist vehicles including vehicles not manufactured with steering on the right-hand side and by business and recreational visitors. Equally importantly, there are Irish vehicle operators who must use <Col N="1472"/>their right-hand vehicles in jurisdictions where left-side steering is the norm.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Road Traffic Acts establish a range of offences that apply to all road users in the State irrespective of their nationality.</P>
        <P>Depending on the offences in respect of which an accusation is made, a person may be offered the option of the payment of a fixed charge or an on-the-spot fine. In the case of certain offences the payment of a fixed charge will result in the endorsement of penalty points on a person&rsquo;s licence record. There is, however, no requirement on any accused person to make such a payment. Where a fixed charge or an on-the-spot fine is not paid, the matter proceeds to be heard in the appropriate District Court.</P>
        <P>A conviction for the commission of a road traffic offence may result in the requirement to pay a fine, imprisonment or the imposition of penalty points or a direct driving disqualification.</P>
        <P>Where penalty points are imposed and the person does not hold a current Irish driving licence, a record of the points is created for future transfer to an Irish licence when one is issued to that person.</P>
        <P>Pursuant to regulations made under section 41 of the Road Traffic Act 1995 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can exercise the powers of effect detention, removal, storage and subsequent release or disposal in respect of any vehicle the Garda reasonably believes to be registered in the State and the Garda believes the vehicle is being used in contravention of driver insurance requirements or that motor tax has not been paid for the previous three months or longer. In addition, a Garda can exercise these powers where a person driving a vehicle refuses or fails to produce there and then a valid driving licence and the Garda is of the opinion that the person is by reason of his or her age ineligible to hold a driving licence licensing him or her to drive the vehicle.</P>
        <P>Where a vehicle is detained, removed and stored the owner of the vehicle must pay a charge for the detention, removal and storage at a rate of &euro;125 for one day and &euro;35 for each further day of storage. Where the charges remain unpaid for a period of six weeks the Garda Commissioner may instigate arrangements to dispose of the vehicle.</P>
        <P>I propose to consider in consultation with the Garda Commissioner the scope for extending the current operation of the provisions of section 41 to address issues such as the seizure of vehicles registered outside of the State or vehicles being driven by persons who do not hold current driving licences generally.</P>

	<P>Section 41 of the Road Traffic Act 1994 and the Road Traffic Act (Section 41) Regulations 1995 set out the law relating to the detention of vehicles by the Garda. Subsection (1)(<i>b</i>) states that vehicles registered in the State can be detained if a policy of insurance is not in place for the vehicle. Subsection (1)(<i>c</i>) states that vehicles registered in the State can be detained where motor tax has not been paid in respect of a continuous period of three months or more immediately prior to use. These subsections are being examined by my Department with a view to broadening their scope in a forthcoming road safety Bill so as to enable all vehicles regardless of their country of registration to be detained. All victims of uninsured driving, whether the driver of the uninsured vehicle is Irish or a non-national, are entitled to compensation through the Motor Insurer&rsquo;s Bureau of Ireland, which is funded through our motor insurance premia.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish Road Haulage Association has expressed dissatisfaction concerning the existing arrangements for the issue of special permits, particularly in connection with journeys conducted on a regular basis involving wide and long loads. The function is assigned to local authorities because they are best placed to assess the suitability of the roads in their functional areas for use by non-compliant vehicles and to determine the appropriate routes <Col N="1476"/>and itineraries to be used in the making of journeys by such vehicles. However, my Department is reviewing the special permit system with a view to streamlining the process for vehicles involved in journeys conducted on a regular basis transporting wide and long loads. In that regard, a meeting was held with the assistant Garda Commissioner, Garda national traffic bureau, in November 2005 at which the Garda agreed to act as the co-ordinating body for the issue of special permits for such operations. The implementation of such arrangements will require the making of revised regulations, work on which is under way in my Department.</P>

While the person named established 38.42 entitlements, the single payment scheme application form declared a total of 24.58 forage hectares. Payment amounting to &euro;6,788.70 in respect of the scheme issued on 20 December 2005 based on the declared forage area of 24.58 hectares included on her application form. The person named submitted an application for consideration in respect of the inheritance measure of the scheme. Following processing of this application the person named was notified that her inheritance application was successful, and the number of entitlements transferred to her was based on the number of hectares inherited. However, as the predecessor of the person named established entitlements partly on owned and leased lands, the total single payment transferred should have been divided by the number of hectares to establish the number of entitlements transferred. The amended position established by my Department is that the person named holds 24.58 entitlements with a gross single payment value of &euro;11,275.12.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 441 and 442 together.</P>
        <P>The agreement of December 2001 with the Irish Farmers Association did not contain a commitment on the part of my Department to meet costs related to restocking in years 4 to 6 following flock depopulation as a result of scrapie. However, following consideration of a technical report on possible additional costs that could arise in those years for those who restocked in year 3, I sought and received approval from the EU Commission, under state aid rules, to make additional payments to flockowners who had flocks depopulated as a result of scrapie during the period December 2001 to 15 April 2003. As the additional costs in each case would be related, <i>inter alia</i>, to the number of breeding ewes in the flocks in years 4 to 6, my Department issued <Col N="1481"/>documentation along with declaration forms to the relevant flockowners in late November last in relation to these payments for year 4. Flockowners who wish to be considered for these payments were requested to return the completed stocking declaration form together with their flock register. A number of flockowners have submitted their applications, inspections have been carried out and payments issued. Some of the flockowners have difficulty with the foregoing. While discussions are continuing with farmer representatives on this, payments must be based on relevant accounting principles and must avoid overpayment.</P>

	<P>The person named submitted a single payment application to activate his single payment entitlements on 16 May 2005. He also submitted an application to transfer his entitlements by sale to another farmer by private contract clause. The EU regulations allow farmers for whom entitlements have been established and who, before 16 May 2005, have sold their land to another farmer, to also sell the entitlements to that other farmer by inserting a clause in the sale contract to the effect that the entitlements are now also being transferred with the lands. The person concerned had established his entitlements on his own lands, which he subsequently sold without the entitlements. Therefore, he did not have lands to enable his entitlements to be transferred under the provisions of the EU regulations and my Department could not approve of the sale of entitlements without lands.</P>
        <P>Under the regulations, entitlements established for a farmer cannot be sold without land to another farmer until at least 80% have been used in one calendar year. The entitlements concerned have been activated in 2005 by the person named and are currently held to him. He may use the entitlements in 2006 by declaring one hectare of land for each entitlement under the 2006 single payment scheme and comply with the terms and conditions of the scheme. Having used at least 80% of entitlements in 2006, the entitlements may then be sold without land.</P>

	<P>Farmers&rsquo; markets represent a real growth opportunity for farmers and small-scale food producers. There are now more than 100 of these markets in operation throughout Ireland, reflecting the increased demand for fresh locally produced foods. With changing consumer preferences, there is potential for further growth in the quantity and variety of produce sold through these markets. I am very aware of the role that farmers markets perform in supplementing farm incomes, providing an alternative route to the market for small food producers and providing consumers with an alternative retail experience. They offer direct access to consumers and assist the development of local and regional speciality <Col N="1483"/>foods. In addition, there is a myriad of indirect benefits in terms of improved community spirit, increased employment and added value for tourism.</P>
        <P>Bord Bia, as part of its statutory role in promoting the development of Ireland&rsquo;s food and drink industry, is working with other State and local agencies to exploit these growing opportunities. In co-operation with Invest Northern Ireland, they have published a comprehensive information guide on the operation of the farmers markets. Bord Bia has a dedicated person in the small business department to assist both producers and individuals, and performs a vital support function for farmers markets through the provision of advice and mentoring assistance.</P>
        <P>There are a number of other ongoing initiatives. Bord Bia continues to work closely with the Office of Public Works on developing the successful &lsquo;Food at Farmleigh&rsquo; programme. The &lsquo;Farmleigh&rsquo; model is being rolled out to other OPW heritage properties around the country this year in places like Donegal, Laois, Wexford and Cork. Bord Bia has also liaised with Dublin City Council as part of the Smithfield regeneration programme and the proposed development of the fruit, vegetable and fish markets. Interested parties were invited to make submissions on the proposed regeneration to the Dublin City planner and a consultative forum, including Bord Bia, was established. This initiative will provide small food producers with direct access to the lucrative Dublin market.</P>

	<P>The person named submitted four applications in respect of a total of 49 animals under the 2004 special beef premium scheme. As animal passports were not submitted in respect of seven animals, only 42 animals were potentially eligible for payment. Following computer validation of these applications, it was found that seven animals were not recorded on the CMMS database as being in the herd of the person named on the date of application for the scheme. Under the rules of the scheme, it was appropriate that these animals be rejected, that is, not paid premium and a reduction penalty applied to any payments due in respect of the other applications. Given the level of non-compliance, no payment was due to the person named under the 2004 scheme, in accordance with the governing EU regulations.</P>
        <P>However, following a review of the circumstances of the case, and a satisfactory resolution to the registration problems, the proposed penalty will not now be applied. The applications are now being further processed with a view to payment at an early date, if otherwise in order.</P>

	<P>The Competition Authority published a preliminary report on competition in legal services in February 2005 which included a number of recommendations, addressed to the Law Society and King&rsquo;s Inns, on the supply of legal education. The report recommended that the Law Society should issue detailed criteria by 30 September 2005 pursuant to which it will licence institutions to provide professional education courses and that King&rsquo;s Inns, by the same date, should also issue detailed criteria pursuant to which it will recognise barrister-at-law degrees awarded by other educational providers and allow persons awarded such degrees entry to the barrister&rsquo;s profession.

	<P>The visa section in my Department is committed to providing a high quality service to all its customers and is making every effort to process all visa applications in as timely a manner as possible. The timeframe for processing visa applications has been reduced in recent months and study visa applications currently take approximately three weeks from the date of receipt in the visa section. This may change from time to time depending on the volumes of applications at particular times and the resources available to process them.</P>
        <P>In June 2002, my Department took the unprecedented step of seconding a number of dedicated visa officers to the Irish embassies in Moscow and Beijing. A primary objective of this initiative was to enable the provision of a better and more timely customer service by making decisions locally rather than having large numbers of visa applications sent to Dublin for decision. Following on from the success of this initiative, dedicated visa officers have also recently been seconded to the Irish Embassy in New Delhi. Significant extra resources have also been allocated to the visa office in the Department to cater for the large volume of applications.</P>

        <P>I recently approved a transfer to the Midlands Prison in Portlaoise for this prisoner. I am not prepared to authorise a transfer to either Shelton Abbey or Portlaoise Prison. As I have repeatedly stated, no level of illegal drug consumption in a prison setting is acceptable to me or to the prison authorities. It is my intention and that of the Irish Prison Service to take all necessary measures to eliminate drug misuse among prisoners. There are currently a range of measures employed in the Irish Prison Service with the aim of eliminating both the supply of and the demand for drugs within the prison system. These measures continue to be updated and reinforced and the new drugs policy for the Prison Service, which I will very shortly publish, will again outline my personal commitment to tackling this problem.</P>
        <P>Measures to curtail the supply of drugs into prisons, include video surveillance, improved visiting-searching facilities and increased vigilance by staff. Netting has been installed over the recreation yards in a number of our closed prisons, to prevent contraband material, such as drugs, being propelled over exterior walls. Future prison designs will seek to locate recreation yards away from perimeter walls as part of further efforts to frustrate the supply of illegal drugs.</P>
        <P>Measures to reduce the demand for drugs within the prison system include education, treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicted offenders. These programmes and interventions are delivered on an individual and co-ordinated basis by the psychology service, probation and welfare service, prison education service and prison officers. Particular initiatives put in place include drug free areas, drug misuse awareness programmes, support programmes and appropriate health interventions, substitution therapies, vaccination programmes and treatment for viral illnesses. When introduced, mandatory drug testing will play an important role in the overall strategy for tackling the scourge of drug use among prisoners. It will enable identification and referral of drug abusers to treatment programmes, enable enhanced focusing of resources and act as a deterrent to drug misuse.</P>
        <P>The prisoner is advised to make contact with probation and welfare service to discuss his particular needs and they will advise him on what options are appropriate to him.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that they have no intelligence which indicates that persons are carrying guns as a form of fashion accessory. As the Deputy will be aware, any person wishing to possess, carry or use a firearm must obtain a firearms certificate from a Garda superintendent and comply with specific requirements under the Firearms Acts 1925 to 2000. Any person found in possession of, carrying or using a firearm in contravention of the Firearms Acts is subject, on conviction, to a fine of up to &euro;635 or imprisonment of up to a maximum of five years or both. In this regard, I wish to inform the Deputy that, in the context of the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which is currently before the House, I propose to bring forward a wide range of amendments which will strengthen the law governing the control of firearms. Included in these proposals are measures which will introduce new offences concerning the modification of firearms such as &ldquo;sawing off&rdquo; a shotgun; increase the fines and penalties generally for offences under the Firearms Acts; and create mandatory minimum sentences, of between five and ten years, for certain firearms offences, including possession of a firearm in suspicious circumstances, possession of a firearm with criminal intent, possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property, possession of a firearm while hijacking a vehicle, and use or production of a firearm to resist arrest.</P>
        <P>I also propose providing a statutory basis for an amnesty during which firearms may be surrendered to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na before new penalties and minimum mandatory sentences are introduced. The amnesty will enable those in possession of firearms who are not in compliance with the legal requirements to regularise their position, and thus enable the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to concentrate on more serious offenders.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, Carlow is one of the 11 remaining locations nationwide which form part of the Garda CCTV programme. Following recommendations from the Garda authorities, I have approved the implementation of six new Garda CCTV systems. With the addition of these six new locations a total of 17 Garda town centre CCTV systems, including Carlow, will be implemented in the following locations: Athlone, Ballyfermot, Carlow, Castlebar, Clondalkin, Clonmel, Drogheda, Dungarvan, Ennis, Kilkenny, Kinsale, Mullingar, Portlaoise, Sligo, Tallaght, Tullamore and Waterford.</P>
        <P>As I have indicated previously, I am anxious to accelerate the implementation of this CCTV programme and reduce as far as possible the workload of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard. The answer is to outsource the installation of Garda CCTV systems to the greatest extent possible, making use not only of the technical but also of the project management expertise in the private sector.</P>
        <P>In recent months the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has conducted a thorough examination of all aspects of Garda involvement in CCTV systems. Following this review, I recently received a comprehensive and innovative proposal for the project management and the outsourced service provision of Garda CCTV systems, including Carlow, from the Garda Commissioner.</P>
        <P>The Garda authorities wish to commence the initial public procurement process and I am also anxious to proceed urgently with this comprehensive request for tender to source the best CCTV service possible for Carlow and the other 16 locations selected. This will happen in conjunction with the imminent commencement of section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which provides a legislative basis for the operation of CCTV in public places. My Department is currently in consultation with the Department of Finance with a view to proceeding as quickly as possible with the procurement process to contract the project managers and outsourced service providers for the development, installation and management of these CCTV systems.</P>
        <P>My ambition is to have a Garda CCTV system operating in Carlow and the other locations, at the earliest opportunity subject to compliance with relevant procurement legislation and procedures.</P>

The phased increase in the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this process, 1,125 Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda College during 2005. The college will induct 1,100 recruits this year and a further 1,100 in 2007, by way of intakes to the Garda College of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. This project is fully on target and will be achieved.</P>

        <P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 12 April 1999 and applied for asylum. His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>The person concerned was informed by letter dated 31 May 2001 that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him and afforded him three options in accordance with section 3(3)(<i>b</i>)(ii) of the Immigration Act 1999 as amended, namely, to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a deportation order or to submit, within 15 working days, representations to the Minister, in writing, setting out the <Col N="1495"/>reasons he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State. His case was examined under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 &mdash; prohibition of <i>refoulement.</i> On 20 February 2002, my predecessor refused temporary leave to remain and signed a deportation order in respect of him. Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring him to present himself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB, 13/14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2, on 8 March 2002 in order to make arrangements for his deportation from the State.</P>
        <P>The person concerned failed to present as required and was classified as an evader. As such he is liable to arrest and detention under section 5 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, for the purposes of ensuring his removal from the State. I urge the person concerned to come forward and present himself to the GNIB as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform&rsquo;s diversity and equality law unit spent &euro;444,379.80 on Traveller projects, schemes, grants and resources in 2000. It spent &euro;457,105.70 on such schemes in 2001, &euro;321,817.00 in 2002, &euro;137,731.26 in 2003, &euro;122,963.26 in 2004 and &euro;416,432.84 in 2005. Some &euro;651,000 has been allocated for such schemes in 2006. The Department also allocates funding to the Traveller community under a number of other programmes under its aegis.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware, responsibility for the 2006-10 national child care investment prog<Col N="1499"/>ramme has been assigned to the Department of Health and Children as part of the establishment of the Office of the Minister for Children, for which the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is currently responsible. I understand that grants totalling almost &euro;5 million have been approved to date to child care projects associated with the Traveller community under the 2000-06 equal opportunities child care programme. Some 11 grants, totalling over &euro;1.7 million in capital grant assistance, have been given to community based and not-for-profit groups; and 23 grants, totalling over &euro;2.4 million in staffing grant assistance have been given to community based and not-for-profit groups. It is anticipated that funding committed to child care projects associated with the Traveller community under the 2000-06 programme will lead to the creation of 142 new child care places and will enhance over 200 existing places. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has published Developing Childcare in Ireland, which is a comprehensive review of progress under the 2000-06 programme. The review, which details all grant approvals to the end of 2004, was circulated to all Members of the Oireachtas and posted on the Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>Under phase 1 of the equality for women measure, funding of &euro;289,193 was approved in February 2002 for a pilot project payable over a three-year period to the National Traveller Women&rsquo;s Forum and Pavee Point Travellers&rsquo; centre. The aim of the project is to develop a culturally appropriate training programme to enhance the participation of Traveller women in social partnership fora. In March 2005, under the RAPID strand of the equality for women measure, I allocated funding of &euro;495,000 to four organisations working with the Traveller community. The funding is payable over the period 1 June 2005 to 31 March 2007. Some &euro;175,000 was allocated to Galway Traveller support group to promote the participation of Traveller women in local community decision making structures. Some &euro;160,000 was allocated to the Traveller visibility group in Cork to deliver a training programme for young Traveller women which will support their access to education, training and employment. Some &euro;130,000 was allocated to the Finglas-Cabra partnership to explore issues of access and encourage consideration of education, training and employment as a progression route for Traveller women. Some &euro;30,000 was allocated to the south side Traveller action group in D&uacute;n Laoghaire to promote the participation of Traveller women in local community decision-making structures.</P>
        <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform provided grant funding for awareness raising projects undertaken by organisations working with female victims of domestic violence. In 2004, Pavee Point Traveller centre received <Col N="1500"/>funding of &euro;2,260 towards the publication of a brochure about violence against women. In 2005, &euro;4,100 was awarded to Pavee Point towards an awareness raising campaign during the United Nations 16 days of action on violence against women. The Department also funds a variety of community based projects which assist offenders on supervision from courts or on release from custody. The projects do not specifically cater for offenders from the Traveller community. I have been advised by the management of the probation and welfare service that a small proportion of those referred to such projects are from the Traveller community. However, near the end of 2005 a grant of &euro;5,000 was provided for a specific programme for Travellers in the Waterford area.</P>
        <P>A high level group of officials has been reviewing the existing mechanisms for the delivery of services to Travellers. The high level working group dealing with Traveller issues reports to the groups of senior officials on social inclusion which, in turn, reports to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion. The high level group is made up of members of the senior officials&rsquo; group and other senior public servants with responsibility for key areas of service delivery for Travellers. The high level group is intended to provide a forum for senior policy makers and service providers to meet to discuss barriers to service delivery and explore possibilities of approaching service delivery in a more integrated way. It is intended that the report of the group, which will address the full range of public service provision for Travellers, will be presented to the Government shortly.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the nationality of offenders is not necessarily known or recorded at the time of preferring a charge, or recording a conviction. Therefore, it is not possible to provide statistics on the basis of the nationality of persons who commit offences. The Transfer of Execution of Sentences Act 2005 applies to cases in which persons sentenced by an Irish court fled from this State to their state of nationality without commencing or completing their sentence. In such cases, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may, as an alternative to requesting the extradition or surrender of the person, ask the authorities in that state to enforce the Irish sentence. There are reciprocal arrangements in the cases of Irish nationals who have fled back to this State from a sentencing state prior to the com<Col N="1501"/>mencement or completion of a sentence. As the Act gives effect, <i>inter alia</i>, to Article 2 of the additional protocol to the 1983 Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, it will be necessary for the State to accede to this protocol before commencement of the Act.</P>

        <QRef>[3154/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I established the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime in March 2005, with a three-year remit, to devise a framework of supports for victims of crime into the future and to disburse funding for victim support measures. Its chairman is Mr. Jim McHugh who is a retired assistant commissioner of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Its other members are Ms Nora Owen who is a former Minister for Justice; Mr. Se&aacute;n Lowry who is a former head of the probation and welfare service; Mr. Michael Whelan of Gemini Consulting; and Ms Marian Finucane who is a broadcaster. The commission, which is independent in its decision-making, examines each case on its merits. The Missing in Ireland support service made an application to the commission in April 2005 for &euro;71,000 to staff and run a helpline for missing persons. The application was considered in detail by the commission at its meeting of 25 April 2005, when it decided to allocate &euro;25,000. I have been advised that in the course of follow-up discussions, the support service rejected the offer and advised that it would accept the full amount sought or nothing. I understand there was no further contact between the commission and the support service until November 2005, when the commission suggested to the support service that it should contact the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which had provided funding for a helpline in 2002 and 2003, with a view to furthering its application for funding.</P>
        <P>When the national missing persons helpline was established in October 2002, initial funding of &euro;65,000, to include establishment costs, was provided by the Department. The helpline, which was operated and administered by Victim Support, received further funding of &euro;45,000 in 2003, subject to the conditions that no funding beyond 2003 should be implied and that audited accounts should be provided for the Department on a calendar basis. No audited accounts have been received by the Department to date. At the end of 2003, the Department commissioned a review <Col N="1502"/>of the helpline from the department of social sciences of Dublin Institute of Technology, which found that the number of telephone calls which had been made to the helpline up to that point was approximately 100. While the Department is of the view that the service is valuable for the relatives of missing persons, perhaps it could be provided on a more cost-effective basis as an add-on to an existing service. Other than the request to the independent commission for funding, no request for funding has been made by Missing in Ireland support services to the Department. It is open to the support services to make a new application for funding to the Department, which will consider it on its merits.</P>

	<P>I presume the Deputy is referring to non-EEA spouses of Irish nationals who are deceased. Marriage to an Irish national does not grant any automatic right to enter or reside in the State, just as it does not grant an automatic right to Irish citizenship following the coming into force of the Immigration and Citizenship Act 2001, which abolished the previous system of post-nuptial citizenship. There is no special visa regime for non-EEA spouses of deceased Irish citizens. It is open to any visa required national wishing to travel to the State to submit an application for a visa for the purpose of the intended journey. Such an application will be considered on its merits. The issuing of an Irish passport is contingent on the person being an Irish citizen, which does appear not to be the case here.</P>

Consideration was given to representations received on his behalf from the Refugee Legal Service for temporary leave to remain in the State. On 10 December 2004, I refused temporary leave to remain and signed a deportation order in respect of him. Notice of the order was served by registered post requiring him to present himself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau, 13/14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2, on 20 January 2005, to make arrangements for his deportation from the State.

        <P>The person is awaiting deportation following a comprehensive examination of his asylum claim and his application to remain temporarily in the State. Late representations made on 26 January 2005 regarding his medical condition were considered but were deemed not to constitute sufficient grounds for revoking the deportation order and granting leave to remain instead. Therefore, the decision to deport remains unchanged. An application for readmission to the asylum process on behalf of the person was made by his legal representative in November 2005. A decision was taken by the Department that the new evidence presented was not such as to cause the original recommendations of the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and that of the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal to be overturned. Consequently, the readmission request was refused. The enforcement of the deportation order is now an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</P>

	<P>Strong provisions are already in place to combat anti-social and unlawful behaviour. The primary basis for the law regarding public order offences is the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, which modernised the law in this regard.</P>
        <P>I recently published legislative proposals to deal with anti-social behaviour, including provision for anti-social behaviour orders. I propose to introduce these proposals by way of Committee Stage amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which is before the House. In so far as anti-social behaviour orders for children are concerned my colleague, Deputy Brian Lenihan, Minister of State with special responsibility for children, has obtained Government approval for separate provisions in regard to children to be brought forward as Committee Stage amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, as part of a package of measures concerning juvenile justice issues.</P>
        <P>In formulating the proposals my Department has, where the need arose, consulted with relevant Departments. In this regard, discussions have taken place with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in regard to housing legislation, in so far as anti-social behaviour is concerned.</P>
        <P>I take great satisfaction in the Government&rsquo;s decision of October 2004 to approve the recruitment of 2,000 additional garda&iacute; to increase the strength of the force to 14,000. As a result there will be a combined organisational strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training of 14,000 in 2006. One thing I have already promised is that the additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties but will be put directly into frontline, operational, high visibility policing.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is now better resourced than at any time in its history. The Garda funding which I secured in the Estimates for 2006 is at an historic high of over &euro;1.29 billion, and compares to just &euro;600 million in 1997. The provision for Garda overtime in 2006 will be &euro;83.5 million &mdash; an increase of &euro;23 million on the allocation for 2005. This will greatly aid the planned deployment of a visible policing service in a flexible, effective and targeted response to criminal activity and crime prevention. The &euro;83.5 million <Col N="1507"/>in overtime will yield 2.725 million extra hours of policing by uniformed and special units throughout the State.</P>
        <P>I attach great importance to the development of a real partnership between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local authorities on matters affecting policing. My intention and that of the Oireachtas, as set out in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, is that joint policing committees and local policing fora established under them will provide arenas where the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local authorities can co-operate and work together to address local policing and other issues.</P>
        <P>I will shortly issue guidelines for the establishment and operation of the committees after consulting my colleagues, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. My view is that the best way forward is to establish a small number of joint policing committees on a pilot basis. Setting up a small number of pilot committees will give an opportunity to identify any teething problems that may arise when they are operating in practice. Any problems can then be addressed before the joint policing committees are rolled out to the remaining local authorities. I hope to be in a position to make a further announcement in this area in the near future.</P>
        <P>Last month I approved grant funding to 13 applications under the community based CCTV scheme. This initiative will allow communities to press ahead with their own local CCTV system. This scheme provides an ideal opportunity for communities to work with local garda&iacute; and their local authority with a view to improving the safety and well-being of their area. CCTV has proved extremely successful in the prevention and detection of crime and is part of a series of measures aimed at tackling street assaults and public disorder.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that they take a proactive approach to policing anti-social and public disorder issues by immediate intervention, arrest and prosecution or advice, as appropriate, under the juvenile diversion programme. Divisional juvenile liaison officers regularly visit schools, youth clubs and social services and give presentations under the education programme and highlight alternative options for regular offenders. Community garda&iacute; and the Garda schools liaison officers also visit schools and address young people on a variety of topics, including anti-social behaviour. The concept of restorative justice provides for the bringing together of offenders and victims, which can also help to highlight the impact of anti-social behaviour, and other criminal behaviour, on victims and other members of the community.</P>
        <P>Members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are frequently in contact with other Government and non-Government agencies, particularly the local auth<Col N="1508"/>orities in order to develop a multi-agency approach to addressing anti-social behaviour and public disorder and other issues by introducing by-laws regarding drinking in public places. These efforts will continue.</P>
        <P>There are 64 Garda youth diversion projects established nationwide. Garda youth diversion projects are a community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiative which seek to divert young persons from becoming involved &mdash; or further involved &mdash; in anti-social and-or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve long-term employability prospects. By doing so, the projects also contribute to improving the quality of life within communities and enhancing Garda-community relations. I am committed to the continuing development and, as resources permit, the expansion of Garda youth diversion projects. I have secured a budget of &euro;6.6 million for the projects and local drugs task force projects in 2006, which represents an increase of &euro;1.2 million for youth diversion. I intend to ensure that 100 schemes will be established nationwide before the end of 2007. I have asked the Garda Commissioner to bring forward proposals for further community based initiatives in this area in light of the additional funding.</P>
        <P>A subgroup of the RAPID programme national monitoring committee was set up in the latter part of last year tasked with examining mechanisms to improve departmental-agency support and assisting RAPID areas in their response to tackling anti-social behaviour. This subgroup, which has commenced its work, comprises my Department, the Departments of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Health and Children, Education and Science, Social and Family Affairs, and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Pobal and F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P>In so far as anti-social behaviour has a social impact, my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, informs me that under the NAP-inclusion process, people experiencing urban poverty and rural disadvantage are identified as vulnerable groups, and targets have been set to tackle social exclusion in urban and rural areas marked by disadvantage. The objective is to create viable and sustainable communities with access to employment, adequate income and services. Key targets in this area include fostering public safety and crime prevention, ensuring the basic needs of all families are met through enhanced and better co-ordinated State support services, improving access to employment, health, education and housing for rural dwellers and improved transport services to rural dwellers. Progress on these targets is ongoing.</P>
        <P>Consultation for the 2006 to 2008 NAP-inclusion process was undertaken by the office for social inclusion at the end of 2005. Under the pro<Col N="1509"/>cess 78 written submissions were received and over 500 people participated in a number of regional seminars. The issue of anti-social behaviour was discussed during the consultation process with participants agreeing that this issue affected both urban and rural areas. The input from the consultation process will inform future policy development as it will feed into the next NAP-inclusion process.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, is a matter for the Garda authorities.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength of the Garda station at Newcastle West, as at 31 December 2005, was 27, all ranks. Garda personnel assignments, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that the best possible use is made of existing Garda resources and that the best possible service is provided for the public.</P>
        <P>The Garda authorities advise that the situation with respect to Newcastle West Garda station will be kept under review and when additional personnel next becomes available, the needs of this station will be fully considered within the context of the overall needs of Garda stations throughout the country.</P>
        <P>In this regard, the timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government remains as when I announced the Government approval in October 2004 for my proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this process, 1,125 Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda College during 2005. The college will induct 1,100 recruits this year and a further 1,100 in 2007, by way of intakes to the Garda College of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. This project is fully on target and will be achieved.</P>
        <P>The Commissioner will be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. Clearly, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies, in particular, areas with a significant drugs problem and <Col N="1510"/>a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to very significantly increase the number of garda&iacute; allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. One thing I have already promised is that the additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high visibility policing. They will have a real impact.</P>

	<P>The question of introducing a road safety and driver education syllabus into schools has been examined by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, on foot of a report from a task group set up in 2000 and which included representatives of the Department of Education and Science, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the National Safety Council, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Insurance Federation, the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, Rosary College Crumlin, the CCEA Northern Ireland and the NCCA. The NCCA also commissioned a study on driver education in post-primary schools from Dr. Ray Fuller of Trinity College Dublin.</P>
        <P>The NCCA, whose role is to advise the Minister for Education and Science on curriculum and assessment issues, recommended that road safety be addressed within the context of social, personal and health education, SPHE, and that driver education, and specifically learning to drive for pupils aged 17, should not become part <Col N="1514"/>of the school curriculum. The NCCA noted that this concurred with the practice in other jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>At the start of the 2001-02 school year, the National Safety Council, with assistance from my Department, distributed copies of Staying Alive &mdash; a road safety resource for transition year and the senior cycle &mdash; to all second level schools. This pack contained a wide range of learning opportunities and activities on topics such as personal responsibility and decision-making, environmental issues and risks and rules for road users. A CD-ROM with additional material downloaded from the Internet was included in the pack along with copies of the Rules of the Road. In the preparation of the Staying Alive resources material, views were sought from a range of organisations with interests in the promotion of road safety. Prior to its issue to second level schools, the material was piloted in 20 schools and the response from teachers in those schools was very positive.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the above, I am aware that my colleague, the Minister for Transport, has very recently announced that a new high level Government road safety group is to be formed. My Department will be represented on the group.</P>

	<P>Social, personal and health education, SPHE, is part of the core curriculum for all pupils in primary schools and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools. The syllabi are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>The SPHE curriculum for primary schools offers particular opportunities, in an age-appropriate way, to foster the personal development, health and well-being of the individual child. Through SPHE, pupils are provided with opportunities to develop self-awareness and self-confidence and to explore the feelings and emotions that accompany growing and changing. Pupils identify and discuss the qualities and skills associated with friendship and learn how to treat people with dignity and respect. Their understanding of what it means to be healthy and to have a balanced lifestyle is developed and they are taught the importance of taking some responsibility for their own health. Through SPHE, pupils also learn strategies to cope with worries and difficulties, decision-making and how to resolve conflict.</P>
        <P>The SPHE curriculum for the junior cycle focuses on the holistic development of young people to enable them meet the challenges and <Col N="1515"/>opportunities presented by life in our world today. It aims to enable students to develop the skills for self-fulfilment and for living in communities; promote self-esteem and self-confidence; develop a framework for responsible decision-making; and promote physical, mental and emotional health and well-being. Four of the ten modules in the junior cycle SPHE curriculum deal specifically with the development of positive mental health. These are: belonging and integrating; self-management &mdash; a sense of purpose; communication skills; and emotional health.</P>
        <P>Students&rsquo; health and education are inextricably linked. In SPHE, health is understood as a multidimensional concept that includes not just physical well-being, but also mental, emotional, social and spiritual well-being. SPHE provides students with a unique opportunity to develop the skills and competences to learn about themselves, to care for themselves and others and to make informed decisions about their health, personal lives and social development. SPHE helps students to develop health literacy skills that do and will play an important part in improving the mental health of students.</P>

Bus &Eacute;ireann school bus drivers are provided with detailed safety instructions and guidelines outlining what to do in the event of accidents, emergencies, and breakdowns, and a booklet is also provided detailing procedures to be followed when student misbehaviour threatens the safe operation of the service.

	<P>The recruitment and appointment of teachers to fill vacancies in an individual primary school is a matter for the board of management of the school concerned. Unqualified personnel should only be employed in exceptional circumstances and when all avenues for recruiting qualified personnel have been exhausted. Boards of management of schools were advised of this in primary circular 15/05 which issued to all school authorities in May 2005.</P>
        <P>Qualifications recognised for the purposes of teaching at second level are not accepted for the purpose of recognition to teach in a permanent capacity in primary schools. At primary level, teachers are class teachers rather than subject specialists, and must be qualified to teach the range of primary school subjects to children aged four to 12 years. To obtain recognition to teach in mainstream primary schools, persons holding qualifications recognised for teaching at second level must successfully complete a recognised postgraduate primary conversion course.</P>
        <P>However, under a temporary scheme currently being operated by my Department, which was introduced some years ago to address the shortage of qualified teachers at primary level, teachers holding qualifications recognised for teaching at second level are remunerated at the trained rate of pay when they take up substitute <Col N="1521"/>or temporary positions in primary schools. Teachers holding qualifications recognised for teaching at second level are also entitled to restricted recognition to teach in special primary schools where a proportion of the pupils attending the special school are of post-primary age, that is, 12 years or older, and where second level programmes, such as the junior certificate schools programme or the leaving certificate applied programme, are provided by the school. If appointed to such posts, the teachers concerned are placed on the trained teachers&rsquo; common basic scale.</P>

	<P>Under my Department&rsquo;s higher education grant schemes, maintenance grants are available to eligible students pursuing approved undergraduate courses in other EU member states, including the United Kingdom. In general, approved courses are those pursued in a third level institution, which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds.</P>
        <P>Students attending approved courses in other EU member states are subject to the same conditions of funding as students attending approved courses in the State. The main conditions of funding relate to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment. In addition, tax relief on tuition fees is available in respect of approved courses at undergraduate and postgraduate level in other EU member states.</P>
        <P>While the current exchange rate issues with sterling are appreciated, my Department is not in a position to supplement grant aid for students pursuing courses in the United Kingdom. Moreover, such an approach could well give rise to anomalies and to claims of inequitable treatment between students studying in different countries.</P>

	<P>Since the establishment of NEPS in 1999, the number of NEPS psychologists has increased from 43 to 121 at present. Any increase in the number of psychologists in NEPS will depend on the availability of resources and must also take account of Government policy on public sector numbers. All primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through NEPS or through the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, SCPA, full details of which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>In common with many other psychological services, NEPS operates a staged model of service to schools, whereby an initial referral usually leads to a consultation and provision of advice to teachers and parents on appropriate teaching and management strategies. Progress is kept under review and only those children who fail to respond to these interventions will need to see a psychologist. This allows the psychologists to offer early appointments to children in urgent need of support and early advice to teachers in respect to those children whose needs are perhaps less pressing but who still need additional help in school.</P>
        <P>The system of assessment and provision for children with special educational needs is kept under constant review by my Department. We have introduced a general allocation model of additional resources to all primary schools for children in the &ldquo;high incidence&rdquo; category of special educational needs as set out in my Department&rsquo;s circular Sp Ed 02/05. This is expected to lead to a reduction in the number of referrals of children for psychological assessment for the purpose of accessing additional resources.</P>
        <P>In general, I expect the establishment of the National Council for Special Educational Needs, NCSE, will result in the needs of children with special needs being met with greater speed and flexibility within the system.</P>

	<P>A general review of catchment boundaries has not taken place and a nationwide review is necessary. Catchment boundaries have their origins in the establishment of free post-primary education in the late 1960s and were determined following consultation with local educational interests. For planning purposes, the country was divided into geographic districts each with several primary schools feeding into a post-primary centre with one or more post-primary schools. The intention was and continues to be that these defined districts facilitate the orderly planning of school provision and accommodation needs.</P>
        <P>Reviews of specific catchment boundaries may be carried out where appropriate. A number of reviews have been carried out over the years where, for example, a new post-primary school is established in an area where previously there was none or, conversely, where a sole provider school closes due to declining enrolment. The area development planning initiative, involving an extensive consultative process carried out by the Commission on School Accommodation, will also inform future revisions to catchment areas. An area development plan takes account of demographic changes and projects future enrolments for existing schools and new schools if required. Catchment boundary changes will be made where the implementation of the recommendations in an area development plan requires such adjustments.</P>
        <P>Catchment boundaries have provided and continue to provide a useful tool in facilitating the orderly planning of school provision and accommodation needs and the operation of the national school transport service.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The needs of the Traveller community are a high priority for me and my Department. My Department provides additional resources to enhance the education of Traveller children. In 2004-05, my Department spent over &euro;56 million on Traveller education over and above what is being provided through mainstream education. This expenditure makes special provision to enable members of the Traveller community to successfully access educational services.</P>
        <P>In summary, this provision includes 45 pre-schools for Travellers, over 500 resource teachers for Travellers in primary schools, nearly 140 whole-time equivalent posts for Travellers in post-primary schools, 40 visiting teachers for Travellers and enhanced capitation grants for Traveller pupils at primary and post-primary levels. In addition, there are 33 senior Traveller training centres located throughout the country that cater for the needs of Travellers aged 15 <Col N="1526"/>years and upwards who have left school early with no qualifications or minimal qualifications. These centres provide a programme of general education, vocational training, work experience as well as guidance, counselling, psychological services and child care services. Approximately 10% of students at these centres are from the settled community. Travellers may chose from mainstream literacy provision or they may attend Traveller specific literacy programmes, which 19 vocational education committees provide.</P>
        <P>I am currently awaiting the publication of a report that was prepared by my inspectorate. It addresses the findings of a survey of Traveller education provision. The report is based on an extensive review of the participation and inclusion of Traveller pupils in 30 primary and six post-primary schools. The report will provide recommendations that will inform policies and provide strategies to facilitate schools in enhancing the education provision for Travellers at a national level.</P>
        <P>I expect to shortly receive a report on the recommendations for a five year Traveller education strategy. This report spans the full spectrum of lifelong learning from pre-school to adult and further education. It also emphasises the important role that Traveller parents have in their own education and that of their children. The report is in the final stages of preparation. Inclusion is a core principle that has guided the development of this report.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important to note that, in 2002, the Department published Guidelines on Traveller Education in Primary Schools and Guidelines on Traveller Education in Second Level Schools. These guidelines highlight the Department&rsquo;s policy on integration, give information on Traveller culture and provide advice on responding to the educational needs of the Traveller students.</P>
        <P>In May 2005, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, published Guidelines on Intercultural Education in Primary Schools. This publication, along with the Guidelines on Traveller Education in Primary and in Second Level Schools, provides information and help to schools to increase their understanding of diversity. The NCCA is due to publish guidelines on intercultural education for post-primary schools this year.</P>
        <P>The gender equality unit in my Department is supporting Pavee Point with a research project on the development of appropriate mechanisms to monitor education access, participation and outcomes by gender for Travellers and the further education section is funding Pavee Point through the education equality initiative for a project entitled, Parents and Traveller Education. The National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education, established in 2003, aims to facilitate increasing higher education participation by a number of target groups, of which the Traveller <Col N="1527"/>community is one. The actions outlined above aim to ensure that Travellers are not disadvantaged or deprived of educational opportunities. I am constantly evaluating the most appropriate ways of ensuring that Travellers receive a quality education.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The total expenditure figures are as follows: 1999-2000 &mdash;&euro;39.56 million; 2000-01 &mdash;&euro;41.07 million; 2001-02 &mdash;&euro;44.29 million; 2002-03 &mdash;&euro;47.1 million; 2003-04 &mdash;&euro;47.55 million; and 2004-05 &mdash;&euro;56.27 million.</P>

I understand that this course of action had previously been put on hold due to the lack of such an agreement. Now that the proposed amalgamation is being supported by all concerned, the next step is for a technical assessment to be carried out on existing buildings to determine which, if any, would be suitable to act as a host for the new school. My Department will be in direct contact with the school authorities when it is in a position to schedule this assessment.</P>

	<P Just="Left">A key element of delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, the new action plan for educational inclusion is the putting in place of a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage in our primary and second level schools for the purposes of qualifying for resources, both human and financial, according to the degree of disadvantage experienced. This standardised system will replace all of the existing arrangements for targeting schools for participation in initiatives to address disadvantage.</P>
        <P>The identification process is currently being finalised and we anticipate being in a position to issue an invitation to selected schools to participate in a new integrated school support programme shortly. Existing schemes and programmes will be integrated into the school support programme on a phased basis over the implementation period.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In 2005, there were 91 active legal cases involving provision for children with special educational needs to which my Department was a party. Of these, one case progressed to hearing and judgment was given in favour of the State.</P>
        <P>In 2005, my Department spent a total of &euro;1,285,751.89 on legal costs and settlements associated with court cases relating to educational provision for children with special needs. These figures do not include the costs of the State&rsquo;s legal defence, which is borne by the Attorney General&rsquo;s office. I would stress, however, there has been significant progress made over the past number of years in respect of increasing the number of teachers and other supports in our schools that are specifically dedicated to providing education for children with special educational needs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At primary level there are approximately 5,000 teachers in our schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to under 1,500 in 1998. Indeed, one out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs. At second level, there are approximately 1,600 whole-time equivalent resource teachers in place to support pupils with special educational needs. This compares to the approximately 200 teachers who were in place in the 1997-98 school year for such pupils. Furthermore, there are approximately 6,300 whole-time equivalent special needs assistants, SNAs, in our primary and second level schools supporting children with special needs.</P>
        <P>In addition to the issue of resources at school level, the National Council for Special Education has been established. This council has approximately 100 staff, the great majority of whom are special educational needs organisers, SENOs, <Col N="1531"/>who are locally based throughout the country. The role of the SENOs is to ensure that all special educational needs in their areas are addressed in an effective manner. In particular, the SENOs are a focal point of contact for parents-guardians and schools, and process applications for resources for children with special educational needs. I am satisfied that the establishment of the council and the work of the SENOs is transforming the delivery of special educational services in this country.</P>
        <P>I am confident that, as a State, we have faced up to the issue of providing appropriate educational provision for all children with special needs and that much work has been done to ensure that the necessary resources and structures are in place. I can confirm that I will continue to prioritise the issue of special needs education and, in co-operation with the National Council for Special Education, ensure that all children with special needs are adequately resourced to enable them to meet their full potential.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Ireland has <Col N="1535"/>enjoyed considerable success in recent years in meeting targets for the recovery and recycling of packaging waste. Data from the Environmental Protection Agency show that the 25% target for 2001 set under directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste was achieved and also that, with 56% recovery of packaging waste in 2004, Ireland has exceeded the 2005 recovery target of 50% set under the directive. The comparable figure for 1998 was 14%. Under the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations 2003, as amended, all producers participating in the placing of packaging on the Irish market, must segregate the packaging waste arising on their own premises into specified waste streams and have it collected for recycling by authorised recovery operators. Major producers, those who have an annual turnover in excess of &euro;1 million and who place more than 25 tonnes of packaging on the Irish market, have additional responsibilities with regard to the recovery of packaging waste from their customers.</P>
        <P>Major producers have the option of either complying directly with their producer responsibility obligations, that is, self-compliance or alternatively, getting an exemption from those requirements by becoming a member of a packaging waste compliance scheme. Major producers, who opt to self-comply with the regulations, are required, <i>inter alia</i>, to accept from any person, free of charge, at each premises from which packaging, packaging materials or packaged products is supplied, packaging waste of a type or brand supplied by that major producer and adequate facilities must be provided by that major producer at each of the relevant premises for the acceptance, segregation and storage of such packaging waste from customers. A further obligation on self-compliers includes the placement of a sign at each entrance to each premises from which packaging, packaging materials or packaged products is supplied, informing the public that packaging waste of a type or brand supplied by that major producer will be accepted free of charge at that premises for the purposes of recovery.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Repak Limited, established by Irish industry in 1997 to promote, co-ordinate and finance the collection and recovery of packaging waste with a view to achieving Ireland&rsquo;s packaging waste recovery and recycling targets under the packaging waste directive, is the sole approved compliance scheme for the recovery of packaging waste in Ireland. Repak membership income is used to subsidise the collection of packaging waste from both the household and commercial sectors. In the household sector, subsidy is provided towards the collection of packaging waste from bring banks and civic amenity recycling centres, as well as segregated kerbside collection of packaging waste from households.</P><Col N="1536"/>
        <P>The regulations exempt major producers who are participating in the Repak scheme from having to take-back packaging waste from consumers. This exemption is the main incentive to join the collective scheme and thereby contribute to the funding of recycling activities. Removal of the exemption would be likely to undermine the scheme and, given that the existing regulatory arrangements are achieving the desired result concerning meeting the directive&rsquo;s recovery and recycling targets, such a measure is not under consideration.</P>

        <P>The report of the working group established to review the management of dog breeding establishments was submitted to me on 7 September 2005. On 20 October 2005, I announced a public consultation process on foot of the working group&rsquo;s report indicating that, in view of the <Col N="1537"/>many divergent views on the issue, I wanted to canvass public opinion more widely before taking final decisions on the matter. An advertisement inviting submissions was placed in the national newspapers on Monday 24 October 2005. The closing date for receipt of submissions was Friday 16 December 2005.</P>
        <P>The responses received are being examined in my Department at present and, as soon as this exercise is completed, I will consider further the recommendations in the report of the working group and will then make a decision as to the action to be taken.</P>

        <Quest>the directive which has been issued concerning charges for water meters in schools in view of the fact that schools are part of the community structure; his views on whether parents are already paying water charges for their own supply which would mean that they are paying water charges twice (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>In accordance with the EU water framework directive, the national water services pricing policy framework provides for the recovery by sanitary authorities of the cost of providing water services from the users of these services, with the exception of households using the services for domestic purposes. The policy framework requires full recovery of the cost of providing water services to the non-domestic sector by means of a meter based volumetric charge and the full metering of this sector by December 2006. The framework does not provide for the exemption of any classes of non-domestic users from the charging policy.</P>

	<P>My Department provides both capital and current funding to local authorities towards the provision and management of Traveller specific accommodation in addition to funding standard local authority accommodation in which Travellers are accommodated. Capital funding for Traveller specific accommodation is provided to local authorities for the construction of new Traveller specific accommodation and the refurbishment of existing Traveller specific accommodation. This funding recoups to local authorities the full cost of providing and refurbishing group housing schemes and serviced halting sites; 50% of the costs associated with the provision of caravans in emergency situations; the full cost of a special grant of &euro;3,810 payable to Travellers for the first time purchase of a house and the special grant of 10% of the cost, up to a maximum of &euro;640, to a Traveller family who are purchasing a caravan for the first time.</P>
        <P>Current funding arises in respect of the recoupment to local authorities of a percentage of the costs of managing and maintaining halting sites as well as 90% of the salaries and travelling expenses of social workers employed by local authorities and voluntary bodies concerning the accommodation of Travellers. Of this number, three are employed by voluntary bodies who work with Travellers, Crosscare, Navan Travellers Workshop, and Clarecare, and funding is also provided for the employment by the Irish Traveller Movement of an accommodation officer.</P>
        <P>The level of capital and current funding to local authorities in each of the years 2000 to 2005 by my Department is set out in the following table:</P><Col N="1539"/>

        <P FLI="0">Funding for 2006 will be published shortly in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2006.</P>
        <P>During the course of the first local authority Traveller accommodation programmes from 2000 to 2004 there was a significant improvement in the accommodation position of Travellers. During that time an additional 828 families were accommodated in standard local authority accommodation. In the same period, 398 new units of permanent Traveller specific accommodation were provided and a further 322 units of permanent Traveller specific accommodation were refurbished to modern standards. This has resulted in a reduction of over 50% in the number of families on unauthorised sites, down by 606 families from the high of 1,207 at the inception of the programme to 601.</P>
        <P>These improvements in the accommodation position of Travellers are very welcome and it is expected that this level of progress will continue under the new Traveller accommodation programmes adopted by local authorities to cover the period 2005-08. A number of steps have been taken by my Department to ensure that this happens. For the first time, local authorities were required, when adopting their new programmes, to specify annual targets for the provision of accommodation for Travellers. These targets will be closely monitored and each local authority&rsquo;s progress will be measured against them on an annual basis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the current expenditure side, a study is currently under way on the issues arising concerning the management and maintenance of Traveller specific accommodation with a view to assisting local authorities to improve their activities in this area. My Department and local authorities also take an active part in the work of the high level group on Travellers which, under the aegis of the Department of Justice Equality and Law Reform, is working to ensure that there is improved co-ordination in the delivery of all services, including accommodation, to Travellers.</P>

	<P>The Local Government Act 2001 provides that an elected <Col N="1542"/>council may authorise one or more of its members to attend a conference, seminar, training or other meeting or event held, whether within or outside the State, for the purpose of discussing, obtaining or imparting information regarding or connected with any matter that is of concern to the local authority regarding the performance of its functions and is relevant to its administrative area and to the local community. In addition, the legislation provides that any member who attends such an event should submit a summary of the proceedings to the next ordinary meeting of the local authority.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for each local authority to ensure that it complies with these requirements. Material recently supplied by city and county councils to my Department indicates that most local authorities have established reporting arrangements consistent with the above requirements.</P>

Local authorities were also advised of the need to ensure that any agreements entered into under Part V, which includes agreement on the level of profit, should constitute the best use of resources available to them for the delivery of social and affordable housing.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 551, 554, 559 and 560 together.</P>
        <P>My Department issued circular letter PD 1/06 on 25 January 2006 reminding local authorities of <Col N="1544"/>their obligations under section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 regarding taking in charge of estates. The circular letter also clearly states that the existence of a management company to maintain elements of common buildings and carry out landscaping must not impact upon the decision by the authority to take in charge roads and related infrastructure where a request to do so is made. Each local authority has been directed to establish a policy addressing certain specified issues on the taking in charge of housing estates to be agreed by the members of the authority, and reported on to those members on a regular basis and at least once annually.</P>
        <P>The circular letter also directed each local authority to submit a report to my Department detailing how each local authority is performing on taking in charge of estates. The report will contain information relating to the anticipated number of housing estates which will be taken in charge this year and how many houses will be affected; the number of housing estates that have not yet been taken in charge whose planning permission expired more than two and less than seven years ago; the number of housing estates which are finished or unfinished in line with the relevant planning permission; the action being taken to resolve the issue of unfinished estates; whether the planning authority has a stated policy in regard to taking in charge of housing estates and the average length of time it takes to take an estate in charge.</P>
        <P>With regard to management companies, most planning authorities have now responded to my Department&rsquo;s request for a report on their policies regarding the attachment of conditions relating to management companies to planning permission for various types of residential developments. The position, so far, is that the majority of planning authorities do not attach conditions to planning permission requiring management companies to be established in the case of housing estates. A number do in specified circumstances, such as where there is a shared waste water treatment plant between a number of houses.</P>
        <P>As already stated, the recent circular issued by my Department made clear that the existence of a management company does not remove the planning authority&rsquo;s statutory obligations, as set out in the 2000 Act, regarding taking an estate in charge. I am considering whether any further guidance should issue to planning authorities regarding planning conditions regarding management companies.</P>

	<P>The system concerned has been developed and is being maintained under a renewable contract with one of the companies named. My Department does not have direct contract with the other company in respect of this project. The software system is operational and is being used to collect data from some financial institutions. We are already receiving details in respect of approximately 25,000 mortgages, between applications and loans drawn down, each month.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department is analysing the data that is being supplied. It is not envisaged publishing a new house price index until further data from all financial institutions are available to support new price indices. However, this system has also been developed to provide analysis and trends on buyer profiles. The results from the data collected through this house price statistical system will be published in the Department&rsquo;s annual housing bulletin, which is due for release in the middle of 2006.</P>

	<P>Part 17 of the Local Government Act 2001 provides that qualified electors of a town having a population of at least 7,500 as ascertained at the last preceding census and not having a town council may make a proposal for the establishment of such a council. Under the relevant provisions of the Act, a proposal to establish a town council, and the timing of any such proposal, is a matter for the local community in the first instance, with a decision on such a proposal being a reserved function of the relevant county council, following a public consultation process. I am considering the steps necessary to commence the relevant provisions of the 2001 Act and I have initiated consultation with local government interests in regard to the creation of new town councils and their prospective functional responsibilities under the Act.</P>

	<P>Lough Veagh is part of Glenveagh National Park, which is managed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, of my Department. The NPWS has for some time made available two boats on Lough Veagh for renting to local anglers during the period from mid-July to end-September. A safety report on this arrangement was commissioned by an independent expert. The report concluded that <Col N="1548"/>the arrangements which operated in past years fall short of recognised best practice.</P>
        <P>Game fishing in national parks must be compatible with the wider nature conservation and management requirements of these parks. The recommendations of the safety report are being considered by my Department and any necessary decision will be taken well in advance of the commencement of the next season in mid-July.</P>
