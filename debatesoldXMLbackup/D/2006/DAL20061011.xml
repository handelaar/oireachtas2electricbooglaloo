    <Title>Leaders&rsquo; Questions. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>There seems to have been a change on the Government benches this morning.</P>
        <P>It is just over a year since I raised the PPARS project, a waste of &euro;150 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money on a dud payroll system that overpays, underpays and mispays.  It does everything but what it is supposed to do.  At the same time, the frontline situation in the health services is not what it should be.  Today&rsquo;s newspapers tell a story of a suicidal teenager on a trolley for seven days, step-down beds being as scarce as hens&rsquo; teeth and people running marathons and fundraisers for cancer care services.</P>
        <P>It appears the Government&rsquo;s taste for waste is insatiable.  Under PPARS the black hole is getting bigger.  Does the Minister for Finance know that in addition to the &euro;150 million already spent on PPARS, this year a further &euro;18 million has been sanctioned for it?  Does he know that &euro;10 million of that money is going to the consultants who issued the report on PPARS last year?  Having sanctioned this money, is the Minister confident that the Health Service Executive is capable of handling information technology projects?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The PPARS project is, as we speak, providing payments for up to 30,000 employees and dealing with the HR issues of more than 70,000 employees in the health service.  It was initiated by the health boards during the tenure of the rainbow Government.</P>
        <P>On the rolling out of the IT projects, it is clear that I have introduced value for money initiatives that have ensured that we are able to assess and process those projects in a way that is more accountable than would have been the case in this instance, although there were successes apart from this one.  I make those points because it is sometimes indicated by the Opposition that the projects are achieving nothing.</P>
        <P>On the money being spent on IT, it is clear that if we want a modern health service, we need improved IT processes to measure outcomes and <Col N="398"/>to learn for future policy formulation.  The suggestion that we should not have IT processes is null and void.</P>
        <P>The question was asked whether this money could be diverted to other areas of the health service where service pressures exist.  The Government is applying unprecedented resources to many of those areas and yesterday it was acknowledged by one of the trade union leaders that there has been a 40% improvement in accident and emergency services since the initiative was brought forward by the Minister for Health and Children and put in place by the HSE.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach says that health workers work a six hour day and take Fridays off.  It is obvious that the Minister for Finance is not informed about what is happening in the IT project systems within the Health Service Executive and that someone is not telling him.  Is he aware that despite a provision of &euro;70 million for IT projects in the HSE this year, as of 27 September, not a cent apart from the PPARS project has been sanctioned by the Department of Health and Children?</P>
        <P>While the PPARS project gets &euro;18 million extra, we need IT projects that work.  Here are three examples: a &euro;260,000 project to boost mental health services for children in the north east &mdash; no sanction, no choice, no chance; a &euro;122,000 project for IT dealing with orthodontics for patients, including children, in the north west &mdash; no sanction, no choice, no chance; a &euro;166,000 IT project dealing with vascular surgery programmes in the mid-west &mdash; no sanction, no choice, no chance.  Those are three small, patient-centred IT projects that have not been sanctioned ten months after the Minister for Finance gave his overall <i>imprimatur</i>.</P>
        <P>After 21 months, there is still no national director for IT projects within the Health Service Executive.  The HSE says it wants breathing space, after 21 months, when &euro;168 million has been spent on PPARS, but here are three small, patient-centred IT projects that are yet to be sanctioned by the Minister for Health and Children ten months into the year.  Does the Minister for Finance believe that we should operate in this way?  Is he happy that sort of project, which is patient-centred, should be left to one side?  When will he sort this out politically?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The leader of the Opposition is not up to date on the accountability issues regarding how health funding is spent.  The money has been sanctioned to the HSE and these are matters for it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Pontius Pilate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am just updating the Leader of the Opposition because if he is not up to date with procedures, people will have no choice and no chance.  The Opposition is totally backward <Col N="399"/>about the arrangements that are in place.  The HSE deals with the sanctioning of individual projects and does not require my sanction or that of the Minister for Health and Children.  We have given the global allocations. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Blame someone else.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The HSE is rightly assessing all these arrangements in relation to IT processes, some of which, as Deputies will be aware, come from the old health board system.  These are being evaluated by the former CEO of the Southern Health Board, Se&aacute;n Hurley, an eminent and competent health board official.  Mr. Hurley has been given the responsibility of doing this on behalf of the HSE, which has taken further independent IT advice to assist it in this matter.  </P>
        <P>In relation to specific projects, these matters are evaluated by the HSE and can be dealt with by it specifically.  In overall terms, the Government has increased the allocation for mental health care services by more than &euro;25 million this year.  Its record in this area far surpasses any of its predecessors.</P>
        <P>The point to be made to the Fine Gael leader is as follows.  IT processes that are necessary are being evaluated by the HSE and those done in the past will proceed.  The HSE is getting the expertise necessary to ensure that is done.  The global allocations which have been provided are greater than those given in the past because they are a fundamental driver of reform in the health service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to ask the Minister for Finance about a second botched privatisation that we have experienced in recent days.  The Minister will have heard a wide range of commentators on the mess that now confronts the Government.  He will have heard the chief economist of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s favourite bank, Friends First, state that the sale of Aer Lingus is the second botched privatisation by the Government.  What is the Government&rsquo;s strategic approach to the hostile takeover which is under way? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not have one. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>How is it that the Government has been completely taken by surprise?  How is it that we have had the Minister for Transport floundering in the fashion we have seen over recent days?  A sum of &euro;30 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money was spent on advisers, yet the Minister comes into the House, flailing around the place, making clear that it never crossed his mind that this might happen and, effectively, that he does not know what to do about it.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated: &ldquo;A monopoly is bad for business.  It is bad for this country, the customer, the travelling public and tourism interests.&rdquo;  His conclusion is exactly the position he has brought <Col N="400"/>about.  He was warned that this was a probability if the company was floated.  Maybe we anticipated that it would have been British Airways rather than Ryanair, but we are heading towards having a single private monopoly in the aviation sector here.</P>
        <P>Of all the hapless Ministers in this hapless Government, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, is the most accident prone.  Apparently Deputies were not supposed to hear the remark but I heard the T&aacute;naiste state with relief yesterday: &ldquo;We survived it.&rdquo;  What a commentary on the T&aacute;naiste.  Can Aer Lingus survive this Minister?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The IPO was a successful floating of the equity by the State.  It went well and was held up by the market as such. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Michael O&rsquo;Leary agrees. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The only thing I recall during that period was silence from the Labour Party because&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is our fault. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened in silence to what Opposition Members had to say because it would have shown up the obvious disagreement between the Fine Gael and Labour parties on the issue.  </P>
        <P>The Government is in favour of a strong and independent Aer Lingus.  Access to private equity, which has been provided for now, enables the company to proceed with a strategic plan.  Ryanair has made a proposal on what it wishes to do.  It must acquire the shareholding in the first instance and has not done so.  I understand it holds about 15% of shares as matters stand, which is a long way from&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not 15%. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Sorry, the figure has increased to 19% in the past couple of days, which is a long way away from the majority shareholding the company seeks.  There are regulatory frameworks to deal with competition and other questions and the Government is preparing to engage fully in rigorous support of the public interest.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>One would not want to rely on the Competition Authority. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>One should not draw conclusions from the fact that one company wishes to proceed in a certain way because it does not necessarily mean that will happen.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am completely taken aback by the Minister&rsquo;s apparent lack of grasp about what is happening.  The shareholding of Ryanair in Aer Lingus is not 15% but 19.2% as every school child in the country knows.  How can the Minister state with a straight face that the IPO was successful?  The Government sold off the company at a bar<Col N="401"/>gain basement price, as everybody in the country now acknowledges.  It did not see coming what has since transpired.  </P>
        <P>Why did the Government reduce its shareholding by 7%, from 35% to 28%, thus facilitating what is now under way?  What is the explanation for that move?  Apart from hiding behind the regulatory arrangements in place, what exactly is the Government&rsquo;s strategy?  What does it propose to do and what is it doing?  Does the Competition Authority have any role in this matter or is it a European competition issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte should take his time.  He is talking hot air as usual. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is awake.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow Deputy Rabbitte to continue without interruption. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Government having any discussions with the ESOT?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>These are important questions about which Deputy Rabbitte should ask his advisers. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister was caught out.  Where are his advisers now? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am amazed at the Minister&rsquo;s brass neck.  If he had worked out this privatisation on the e-voting machines he bought, he would not have made such a hames of it.  Why did he reduce the Government&rsquo;s stakeholding in Aer Lingus?  What strategy is the Government now pursuing?  Has it had discussions with the ESOT or others about preventing the proposed arrangement?  Will Ryanair not in any event have manoeuvred itself into a position in which it can stymie the future development of Aer Lingus?  What will this development do for competition in the aviation sector?  I would appreciate answers to these questions because this issue is very important for the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy obviously does not have a grasp of Stock Exchange rules if he thinks we can go off and talk to the ESOT on this matter.  We cannot do so.  Perhaps he should read up a bit on the situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should ask his expensive advisers.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The shareholding of the State is 28.3%.  A shareholding of 25.1% ensures that another company cannot acquire the 75% threshold required to force delisting.  It also means the company&rsquo;s memorandum and articles of association cannot be changed without the State&rsquo;s agreement.  Maintaining this level of shareholding was designed, among other things, to frustrate any hostile takeover attempt.  Even if another <Col N="402"/>company buys a majority share, Aer Lingus will continue to operate on an independent financial basis.  Without delisting and operational integration with Ryanair, it is hard to see how the synergies which motivate mergers could be realised.  </P>
        <P>The Government remains fully committed to competition in aviation markets and will not sell its shares in Aer Lingus.  It is vigorously opposed to the emergence of a new monopoly in Irish aviation.  An Aer Lingus-Ryanair merger is not in the best interests of competition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Ryanair proposes a takeover, not a merger.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The economy has been well served by having at least two domestic airlines providing complementary but different services to and from Ireland.  It is due to the value of having more than one domestic airline that a two airline policy was developed in the early 1990s by giving Ryanair exclusive rights on certain routes and securing the future of that company.  The Government is firmly of the view that Ireland&rsquo;s economic interests are best served by having as many airlines as possible competing vigorously and seeking to exploit all possible opportunities for new services.  It wants a strong Aer Lingus and a strong Ryanair competing with each other.  </P>
        <P>When the Ryanair offer is formally made, it will be a matter for the board of directors of the company to evaluate the offer and express an opinion to shareholders.  It has done so.  The board of directors of the company is working with advisers to ensure the position of shareholders is fully protected.  There is a question over whether jurisdiction for merger clearance rests with the European Commission or member states, including Ireland, and it is expected that jurisdiction will lie with the European Commission.</P>

    <Title>Leaders&rsquo; Questions (Resumed). </Title>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">How can the Minister, Deputy Cowen, stand here and, apparently without a hint of embarrassment, justify the debacle the Government has created with the privatisation of the national airline?  How does he have the audacity, the shamelessness to read a script that was probably prepared by Stock Exchange sharks in New York to cover or justify the massive incompetence of which this Government is guilty?  If this privatisation was a success, why are the shares now being sold at &euro;3.05 when the Government sold them for &euro;2.20?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Not only is the Minister guilty of treachery in sabotaging the future of the national airline, but he is cheating the taxpayer by allowing the grubby international financiers to take the benefit of what has been created over decades by Irish workers and the Irish people.  Why is he crying &ldquo;foul&rdquo; at Ryanair&rsquo;s attempt when he must have known from the beginning that the law of the Stock Exchange is that the shark with the biggest snout goes in for the kill, and so it has?  Did his advisers tell him this was possible and if so, why did he not take pre-emptive action?  We want a clear answer to that.  If they did not, why were they paid tens of millions of euro?</P>
        <P>Let us not make scapegoats.  The Minister for Transport who presided over this disaster on behalf of the Government also presided over the situation where the Government sits on &euro;60 million worth of useless electronic voting machines.  Some computer users in Holland recently hacked into machines like these and played cartoons on them &mdash; how appropriate.  They should be brought into the Cabinet room of the Irish Government because while its Members might be able to comprehend the intellectual abilities of Mickey Mouse, they are failing on everything else.  This is a major fiasco, following on the fiasco <Col N="404"/>that last week left 40,000 telephone subscribers of another privatised industry without a telephone service.  Will Deputy Cowen throw the 3,500 workers around the stock exchanges of the world like a sack of spuds?  Apart from squawking to international and national competition authorities, what will he do?  I demand that he take Aer Lingus back into public ownership and answer the question why he reduced the stakeholding if he knew this attack was imminent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Joe Higgins is opposed to any private investment in Irish aviation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should deal with Aer Lingus.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Under State ownership Aer Lingus and other companies have suffered job losses, so maintaining State ownership is no guarantee of job security.  This strategic plan by the board of Aer Lingus required the sale of shares so it could get access to private equity and leverage for the acquisition of planes and other equipment to develop a long-haul strategy, which can provide greater tourism numbers for Ireland and greater profits for Aer Lingus.  That is why the part privatisation took place and the IPO was made.  It was successful in its own right.  The Opposition presumes that a successful takeover of Aer Lingus by Ryanair is imminent.  That is not the position.  In relation to the retention of strategic shareholding by the Government, we are in a position to protect the strategic concerns in the national interest in respect of Aer Lingus.  We have not welcomed the proposed purchase by Ryanair of a majority stake.  There are regulatory frameworks to deal with competition and other questions.  There are many obstacles to be overcome before people can draw the conclusions that the Opposition is drawing.  We have made a strategic decision that has been successfully completed in terms of the IPO.  It is in line with the board&rsquo;s requirements to implement the strategic plan.  It provides access to funds to which the airline would not otherwise have access, to develop and build the airline and to protect jobs.  Without that investment strategy the future of Aer Lingus in terms of where it stands in the aviation market would be more precarious than would otherwise be the case.  Those are the facts and no scaremongering by Deputy Joe Higgins will change them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Those are not the facts.  The State is entitled to invest in its national airline.</P>

	<P>The Government lacks the vision and, more importantly, the commitment to <Col N="405"/>public services, State ownership of an important industry, the thousands of workers, the tens of hundreds of people in the community who depend on the airline and the millions of passengers.  This Government has contempt for State projects and for public service workers.  Witness the Taoiseach&rsquo;s disgraceful blunderbuss attack on health workers yesterday.  How do nurses feel this morning being put down and abused in that way?  The Minister for Finance has also shown us contempt.  He facilitated Fianna F&aacute;il cronies to gain land rezoning around Dublin Airport to the great detriment of aviation possibilities and airport planning.  Has he any idea of the trauma caused to Aer Lingus workers by this privatisation and the prospect of a man taking control who is not just arrogant, harsh and anti-trade union <i>&agrave; la</i> 1913, but has contempt for the workers?  Whether he takes full control or not, the Minister has allowed a cuckoo into the Aer Lingus nest.  That cuckoo will use whatever shareholding he has to drive bargains with the Government in the interest of Ryanair, to get conditions for the development of Dublin Airport and the Irish Aviation Authority to suit the profits of his shareholders.  That is the only agenda.  Whether or not he gains control, Deputy Cowen has allowed this situation to develop and is risking thousands of jobs, the communities that depend on them and the national airline when he could have chosen a different road.  The Minister must not deny that he could have invested.</P>

	<P>As Minister for Transport in a Fianna F&aacute;il-Labour coalition in the early 1990s I facilitated investment.  The investment helped us out of a crisis but did not provide the full remedy required.  It was a one-off State investment and was approved at the time by the European Commission and Commissioner van Miert on that basis.  I am aware of the rational investor principle but the issue in question is the extent to which the Government can gain access to funds of the magnitude required by Aer Lingus without putting in jeopardy its many other commitments in respect of investment in health, education and many other areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste, Deputy McDowell, stated that the Government has millions to throw away.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and whether the commercial principles that apply have brought about the level of investment required and will enable leveraging by the board for further investment in the interests of pursuing further development plans.  That was the obvious, common-sense approach and it had broad support in the House, despite <Col N="406"/>the fact that not too many people were discussing it.  The approach to which I refer also had the broad support of many members of the workforce because it dealt with legacy issues relating to pensions and other matters which would not otherwise have been dealt with had this approach not been adopted.  Let us be clear about what has been dealt with and what are the benefits that have arisen.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s conspiracy theories about the Government&rsquo;s view on the Irish aviation industry are as off the beam as his theories regarding what I did when I served as Minister for Transport.  I dealt with those matters in full before the tribunal and answered all questions.  I am confident that the outcome will be far different from that suggested by the Deputy in his conspiracy theory.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
        <P>The preliminary report of the 2006 census, carried out on Sunday, 23 April 2006, was published on 19 July 2006.  The report was compiled using headcount information compiled by each of the 4,400 enumerators based on the completed census forms for their respective enumeration areas.  The following were the highlights of the preliminary census results.</P>
        <P>The population of the State increased by 318,000 persons between 2002 and 2006 to reach the highest recorded census level since 1861.  The preliminary total for the population enumerated on census night 23 April 2006 was 4,234,925 persons, compared with 3,917,203 in April 2002, representing an increase of 8.1% in four years or 2% per annum.  On average there were 46,000 more <Col N="407"/>immigrants than emigrants annually over the 2002-06 period, compared with an annual excess of births over deaths of 33,000.</P>
        <P>Looked at from a ten-year perspective, Ireland&rsquo;s population increased at an annual average rate of 1.6% between 1996 and 2006, the largest population growth rate in the EU.  The populations of Fingal and Meath both increased by over one fifth between 2002 and 2006.  The counties of Kildare, Fingal and Meath accounted for 30% of the national increase in population.  Other Leinster counties which showed large increases were Laois, 14%, Wexford, 12.9%, Offaly,<?oasys _jy ?>10.9%, Westmeath, 10.5%, and Wicklow, 10.2%.  Apart from Fingal, there was a relatively modest increase of just 20,000 in the rest of Dublin and, as a result, the overall population grew by just 5.65%, considerably less than the 8.1% increase for the State as a whole.  The population of Leitrim grew by almost 12% between 2002 and 2006.  This followed a modest increase of 3% between 1996 and 2002, which was remarkable in that it occurred after continuous declines in population over the previous century and a half.</P>
        <P>At electoral division, ED, level, Blanchardstown-Blakestown in Fingal recorded the highest increase in intercensal population &mdash; up 7,901 to 32,305 in April 2006.  Other EDs with population increases in excess of 5,000 during 2002-06 were Navan rural in Meath, up 5,176, in Meath and Balbriggan rural in Fingal, up 5,150.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  Has he received advice from the CSO on the extent to which the figures might represent an understatement of the reality?  I refer here to the anecdotal evidence of which we are all aware regarding enumerators encountering great difficulty in effecting entry to certain housing developments and catching people when they were at home.  I was informed by one enumerator with whom I am familiar that she called back on 18 occasions to a particular development.  Has the director of the CSO provided an estimate of what might be the possible shortfall?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>The simple answer is no.  I did not receive any communication from the CSO regarding any possible underestimation of the figures.  As the Deputy is aware, the definitive counts will be delivered and announced next year.  I may have stated previously on Question Time that there were 4,400 enumerators who were employed to deliver and collect census forms.  Each was responsible for an enumeration area, EA, consisting of approximately 350 households.  I accept that new problems were encountered on this occasion in the context of gated communities, apartment complexes etc., which made matters more difficult than in the past.  The enumerators made contact with householders in the lead-up to census day, 23 April, marked the location of each house or apartment in their EAs <Col N="408"/>and left blank forms and explanatory leaflets, with instructions to complete, to each householder.  The process was definitive in nature.</P>
        <P>I have not been contacted regarding any underestimations.  As the Deputy is aware, this work is detailed and confidential in nature.  We look forward to the publication of the definitive figures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State seek information on the matter to which I refer?  I am not imputing any lack of professionalism or anything else on the part of the CSO, far from it, but I have received direct anecdotal evidence of difficulties being encountered, which did not exist previously, in terms of securing the co-operation of everyone in particular households, gaining access to some communities, contacting people who work irregular hours and enumerators being obliged to make repeated attempts to encourage people to engage with the process.</P>
        <P>When is the final report likely to be published?  Must we await its publication before we receive a breakdown of different categories such as, for example, the number of non-nationals living here etc.?  Is it now settled Government policy that, irrespective of how early the CSO makes its final report, the business of establishing a new boundaries commission to revise the constituencies is not likely to happen between now and the general election?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s final question is one for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I was just testing the Ceann Comhairle and I am glad to see that, even in the absence of the Taoiseach, he is alert.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I can make a brief comment on that matter.  On the Deputy&rsquo;s first question, however, I will ask the CSO to communicate directly with him on the anecdotal evidence in his possession regarding issues of access etc. and difficulties that may have arisen.</P>
        <P>With regard to the future work of the CSO, I understand that during next year it will issue approximately 16 publications in all.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, currently the CSO is carrying out important work relating to disability.  Two questions pertaining to disability were introduced for the 2002 census and were refined for the 2006 census.  The response to question No. 15 on the census form provided a framework for the CSO to carry out a nationwide survey on disability and the field work for the national disability survey is being carried out in September and October 2006.  The sample covers approximately 17,000 individuals and provides one example of the new kind of work being done.  The Deputy also referred to nationalities etc. and religion.  All other reports pertaining to specific <Col N="409"/>aspects of the CSO&rsquo;s work will be published up to the end of 2007.</P>
        <P>With the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s permission I wish to reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s question regarding the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the CSO.  As the Deputy is aware, the Attorney General has advised that constituencies may only be revised on the basis of the final census figures, which are expected early next year.  Constitutionally, the preliminary figures cannot be used to revise constituencies.  The Electoral Act 1997 provides for the establishment of a constituency commission upon the publication of the census report that contains the final figures.  The Act also sets out the considerations to which a commission must have regard in observing the relevant provisions of the Constitution.  The Minister intends to establish such a commission to review and report on D&aacute;il and European constituencies as soon as the relevant census report is published.  Under the Act, the commission will be required to report to the Ceann Comhairle as soon as may be, and in any event, within six months of its establishment.  The report will then be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>As the Taoiseach has stated, it is not normal practice to publish legal advice and the Minister has no plans to so do.  This is the position.  It is planned to publish the principal demographic results within one year of the census and to release all publications arising from the 2006 census before the end of 2007.  The published tables will be provided simultaneously on the CSO website.  As the Deputy is aware, the CSO has an excellent website, <i>www.cso.ie</i>, which keeps everyone updated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not go into detail on the revision of the constituencies following the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply, except to ask whether he agrees that the legality of the situation still leaves a glaring under-representation for my constituency?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a question for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister of State whether he agrees with this point because it is fairly obvious.</P>
        <P>In his reply, the Minister of State cited Fingal, which I represent, as having in effect added the population of Carlow to its population figure since 2002.  On that basis, given that they highlight that Swords is the same size as Waterford city, to what use will the figures be put?  If one considers a place like Waterford, even its most basic facilities, such as primary schools, post offices and libraries, are a great deal more plentiful than is the case for somewhere like Swords, which has a fast-growing and largely youthful population.  To what use will the unofficial figures be put?  They <Col N="410"/>are largely indicative of major failures to provide facilities within the context of a significant level of house building.  Rush, which is the same size as Kilkenny city, does not yet have a full-time Garda station.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should confine himself to the questions asked.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Garda stations have nothing to do with the reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State indicate the use to which these figures will be put, as they outline glaring inequalities in terms of the range of facilities available nationwide?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>On the first question, the figure for Dublin North is 29,996 and Dublin West is in excess of 30,000.  This is extremely relevant to the earlier discussion.  As for the use to which these figures will be put, having worked as the Minister of State with responsibility for the CSO, I am conscious &mdash; as are others &mdash; of the tremendous value these figures offer to legislators, the Government, local authorities and State bodies with regard to future planning.  The Deputy has touched on some of the vital areas, such as schools and Garda stations.  Another essential area relates to the kind of planning announced by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, regarding the Transport 21 initiative.  Its entire approach is to connect communities and the CSO has clearly shown a huge increase in population in the outlying areas of Dublin.  At the same time, a slower rate of development can be seen within the city itself.  Clear needs will be provided for by these figures.</P>
        <P>Future Governments will be obliged to take careful note of the CSO&rsquo;s reports.  It is also interesting and encouraging to see a county such as Leitrim expand its population, which tells another story.  This has huge implications for our spatial strategy and for Transport 21.  The Government has already embraced the figures reflected in the census by planning ahead, as have the social partners.  From my perspective, the CSO performs invaluable work across a wide range of areas.  It helps the Government of the day and local authorities to plan correctly for the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State mentioned that the figures for Dublin West breached the constitutional limits, in that they exceed the figure of one Member per 30,000 people.  Does he expect a significant variation between the preliminary figures and the final figures?  He should bear in mind that in 1947, the then Fianna F&aacute;il Government revised the constituencies based on the preliminary figures so a precedent exists.  I believe I heard the Director General of the CSO <Col N="411"/>mention that it did not expect significant variations between the preliminary figures and the final figures, because in this case the computer technology appears to work well.  When exactly does the Minister of State expect to publish the final figures?  I wish to draw his attention to the fact that in Dublin West, a population of more than 90,000 elects three Deputies in breach of the constitutional limits.  However, in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, a population which is not much bigger&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a matter for the Minister of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow me to finish the point.  While its population is not much bigger, it elects five Deputies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are moving well away from the question, which pertains to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>It is really important.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the area of responsibility of the Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State expect a significant variation between the preliminary and final figures and when exactly will the final figures be produced?  I understand from the CSO that its method of enumeration is now so good that the difference between the final figures and the preliminary figures could be insignificant.  In that case why can the final figures not be made available much sooner?  Is the Government delaying their publication in order to deal with the population divergence and breach of the Constitution, as shown by the preliminary figures?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>Most definitely, no one is delaying anything in this regard.  As I noted earlier, something like 16 publications are planned and promised before the end of 2007.  That is the specific commitment made by the CSO.  Hence, it has a carefully planned programme of work to undertake.  I am not in a position to comment on the differentiation between the preliminary and definitive figures.  We must await the outcome to see how it pans out.  We may speculate all we wish and I am inclined to agree with the Deputy that in the times in which we live, there may not be much of a discrepancy.  However, we must await the outcome.</P>
        <P>As legislators, we must also be directed by the Attorney General, and in this case he has advised that constituencies may only be revised on the basis of the final census figures.  This would be the advice received whether Fianna F&aacute;il or the Labour Party was in Government.  We cannot work with preliminary figures.  The Deputy referred to the actions of a previous Government.  We are advised by the Attorney General on those <Col N="412"/>lines and this is the advice to which we will adhere.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State accept, given that a change will not be made before the election, that it is likely this matter will be dealt with in court?</P>

      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I am following on from the previous question.  I asked earlier for information about what will happen with the CSO figures.  Can I point the Minister of State in the direction of the Fingal Development Board, which has drawn comparisons between the CSO figures for different areas?  The board has indicated clearly what it believes the Government&rsquo;s agenda should be if there is to be parity of facilities in Fingal.  It has argued that proper planning is necessary if the area is to enjoy the full range of facilities.  The Minister for Finance, for example&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Can I respond to Deputy Sargent, with whom I served at local authority level for some time?  The Deputy mentioned Fingal Development Board.  I would like to add to what I said earlier in that regard.  I am aware that Fingal County Council is one of the most progressive local authorities when it comes to planning for the future.  I am conscious of the tremendous work of South Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown county councils, which are using the data that is available to them from the CSO and other sources.  Surveys have been conducted on traffic movements, etc.  I reiterate that this work is invaluable to development boards like Fingal Development Board.  I warmly encourage the work of such boards.</P>

	<P>The exact information requested by the Deputy is not available.  Statistics on employment and unemployment are compiled at a regional level from the quarterly national household survey.  There are eight regions in the State &mdash; Border, midland, west, Dublin, mid-east, mid-west, south east and south west.  Sub-regional statistics of the type requested by the Deputy are not available from the quarterly national household survey.  However, the live register series gives a monthly breakdown of the number of people claiming unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit.  It also details the other registrants who are registered with the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  Figures are published for each county and each local social welfare office.  The most recent information that is available, which is for August 2006, indicates that 3,782 persons are on the live register in the Tallaght office.  The monthly live register figures for the Tallaght office from 2005 are set out in the following table:</P>

        <P FLI="0">It should be noted that the live register is not a definitive measure of unemployment as it includes part-time workers and seasonal and casual workers who are entitled to unemployment assistance or benefit.  Statistics on unemployment are measured at regional level by the quarterly national household survey.  The exact area covered by each local office is not limited to the immediate locality of the particular office.  For example, people from the Blessington area may be registered in the Tallaght local office.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to say a few words on this issue.  My question is sandwiched between two questions from my Green Party friend, Deputy Sargent.  I am sure someone will come up with a slogan <Col N="415"/>about that.  I am interested that the cl&aacute;r describes Tallaght as being in Dublin 4.  I am not sure how the people of Tallaght will react to that.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will get lots of coverage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I look forward to hearing what my neighbour, Deputy Crowe, has to say about the matter.  I would like to comment on this serious issue.  I am interested in examining the unemployment figures for the Tallaght region because this month is an opportune time to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy have anything in the nature of a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I am getting to it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is not as shy either.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I am trying to follow Deputy Sargent&rsquo;s example.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I have asked twice as many questions as Deputy O&rsquo;Connor.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Ceann Comhairle to give me half a second to do a preamble and then I will get to my questions.  I might also give the Minister of State some advice.  It is opportune to raise this issue at this time because the 16th anniversary of the opening of The Square shopping centre in Tallaght falls on 23 October next.  Those of us who live and work in Tallaght know, as the Ceann Comhairle does as a result of his many visits to the area, that everything that is happening in Tallaght today started on 23 October 1990.  Tallaght is now a superb city with many employment opportunities and all the facilities one would expect in a major urban area.</P>
        <P>We need to meet the job creation needs of Tallaght, which is the third largest centre of population in this country and has a very young population.  I would be grateful if the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, could convey the information he has given to me this morning, which will be of great interest to the people of Tallaght, to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  It is <Col N="416"/>important for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to understand that Tallaght continues to face many job creation challenges.  I hope the Minister of State will help me in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to assist the Deputy, who is famous for promoting the interests of Tallaght.  We all admire him for that.  It is clear that the employment news is good.  I have mentioned the results of the quarterly national household survey and the state of the live register.  Over 2 million people were in employment in this State in the second quarter of this year.  That figure comprises Irish people and the many immigrants who have come to these shores.  We warmly embrace the new, modern and multicultural Ireland that is developing.  I will convey Deputy O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s wishes for future investment in Tallaght to my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Martin.</P>
        <P>Reference has been made to the size of many of the new towns which are developing in the greater Dublin area.  Deputy Sargent spoke earlier about some of the towns in Fingal.  Deputy O&rsquo;Connor has always promoted the needs of Tallaght as a major town.  I will convey that message to the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State accept that the monthly decrease in the rate of unemployment can be attributed to seasonal factors?  The underlying trend is that there has been almost no change in the live register.  While the relevant unemployment figures for Tallaght and Ballyfermot fell in the month referred to by the Minister of State, the number of people on the live register is higher than it was for the same month in 2005.  Is it not clear to the Minister of State that economic growth is bypassing some key neighbourhoods in the Tallaght area?</P>
        <P>Tallaght should be an economic hub because it is so close to transport centres, such as major roads.  Over the last year, traditional industries have decided to move to cheaper locations, unfortunately.  We have seen an increase in the number of people receiving unemployment payments.  I ask the Minister of State to explain why so many people in the Tallaght area are unemployed.  Specific strategies are normally introduced in economic areas where there have been significant job losses, like those which have been experienced in Tallaght over the last year.  We have not seen the various agencies coming together in the Tallaght area, however.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy have a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>Why have we not seen a response from the various agencies?  Can the Minister of State confirm that 888 people under the age of 25 are on the live register in the Tallaght area?  I have been told that 888 is supposed to be a lucky number in China, but I do not think it is a lucky <Col N="417"/>number for the young people in the Tallaght area who are stuck on&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>There are 8,000 bicycles in Beijing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>That may be so, but we are talking about young people who are unemployed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I think the correct figure is 9 million.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it 9 million?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps people in China can get on their bikes to look for employment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>Maybe the Deputy should get on his bike.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think those bikes are available in the Tallaght area.  It is clear that the increase in unemployment is a growing worry for people in the Tallaght area.  Many young people in the area are in low-paid employment in shopping malls etc.  Many of them have short-term work in the construction industry.  Is there a strategy in this regard?  It is different from the rest of the country as shown in recent trends.  What will the Government do in this area where the figures seem to be growing?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Crowe&rsquo;s question may be more appropriate to another Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge that seasonal issues affect the live register.  It decreased from 158,200 in August to 155,300 in September which may reflect students returning to college and so on.  </P>
        <P>I have come to know Tallaght fairly well over the years as a member of the local authority and have seen, working with colleagues from my party, tremendous advances made there.  Infrastructural projects such as Luas have provided linkage with the rest of the city.  The retail and construction sectors have grown and companies like Jacob&rsquo;s are important in the area.  We all know how Tallaght has changed positively over the years and the responsibility to ensure this pace of development continues rests with us all.  There are huge links between educational opportunities and employment which should be remembered where there are pockets of need.  I will not give a long answer to this because it applies more appropriately to some of my colleagues in Government.</P>
        <P>Tallaght will always remain a priority here primarily because there are some representatives who never cease to discuss it.  Deputy Crowe&rsquo;s point is well made and will be considered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not represent Tallaght, but I represent an adjoining area and the impact of <Col N="418"/>employment issues there has become significant as Tallaght represents such a dominant area for South Dublin County Council.  The Square shopping centre, the hospital, the college and so on are important factors in the area.  Employment opportunities in Tallaght affect a wide area but my question is more general, although it has an impact on such matters.</P>
        <P>Various sources, including the Economic and Social Research Institute, have sounded a note of caution regarding the opening of the Irish labour market to citizens of the new EU accession countries, Bulgaria and Romania.  What is the Government&rsquo;s view on this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure how relevant this question is.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>We are happy that Bulgaria and Romania will join the EU on 1 January 2007.  Many of my colleagues, including the Taoiseach, have been cautious on the issue of labour market access and the Government will make its decision on this before the end of the year, after consulting with the social partners.  I note the cautious comments made by the ESRI.  The Taoiseach and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment have suggested that Ireland may seek to adopt a different approach and introduce a work permit scheme for workers from Bulgaria and Romania, although such a decision will not be made until December.  I accept the Deputy&rsquo;s points.  We have a booming economy, we warmly welcome workers from accession countries but the Government will be cautious regarding Bulgaria and Romania.</P>

        <QRef>[30653/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>The latest consumer price index, CPI, publication refers to August 2006 when the annual rate of inflation was estimated at 4.5%, compared with 4.2% in July and 2.3% in August 2005.  The current annual rates of over 4% are the highest recorded since early 2003 and are significantly higher than the average annual rates of 2.5% and 2.2% recorded in 2005 and 2004 respectively. </P>
        <P>The most notable contributing changes in the year to August 2006 were increases in housing, water, electricity, gas  and other fuels, up 16.9%, transport, up 5.2%, education, up 4.7%, restaurants and hotels, up 4.3% and health, up<?oasys _jy ?>4.1%.  Clothing and footwear fell by 3.6% and furnishings, household equipment and routine household maintenance fell by 1.2%.</P><Col N="419"/>
        <P>The annual rate of inflation for goods was 1.7% in August while the corresponding rate for services was 7%.</P>
        <P>The annual rate of inflation in August, as measured by the EU harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP, rose to 3.2% in August, up from 2.9% in July and 2.1% in August 2005.  The differences between the CPI and HICP mainly reflect the exclusion of mortgage interest costs from the latter.  Using the HICP, the overall annual rate of inflation for both Economic and Monetary Union, EMU, countries and the EU as a whole in August was 2.3%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the<b></b>Minister of State agree that mortgage costs should be included in the CPI as personal debt is so high in the country?  I recently read that, on average, every man woman and child in Ireland has personal debt of &euro;32,000.  Perhaps the Minister for Finance could update those figures for us.  It is time to seek a more realistic CPI report, given the interest rates that will affect much of the aforementioned debt.  This is in addition to an increase of 34% in gas costs and 20% in electricity.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that the Government is getting the whole picture using the CPI as it currently exists?  Can the CPI be broadened to include those real costs that affect people?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a category that covers housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels.  The CPI also covers alcoholic beverages, clothing and footwear, furnishings, health, transport, communications, recreation and culture, education, restaurants and hotels and miscellaneous goods and services.  The Minister for Social and Family Affairs has made provision to ensure that the vulnerable are helped at times like this.  There are positive signs regarding oil prices that will be factored in when the next set of statistics are released.  The CPI provides a comprehensive set of figures.  If we considered the HICP, which excludes mortgages, we would be in a favourable position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State indicated that 4.5% was the rate of inflation for August 2006 according to the CPI and he gave a breakdown of the various contributory components.  From the information available, can he say what impact, if any, the removal of the groceries order has had?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I have figures for the period January 2005 to date.  April 2006 is highlighted as the first month for which data was available following the repeal of the groceries order in March 2006.  It can be seen that prices for items affected and not affected by the groceries order increased up to May 2006.  Since then items previously covered by the groceries order have fallen in price and are now showing a modest, overall annual decrease <Col N="420"/>of 0.2%.  Items that were never covered by the groceries order have continued to display increases and now show an annual increase of 3.5%.  </P>
        <P>In answer to Deputy Curran&rsquo;s question, items previously covered by the groceries order have fallen in price for the first time since the lifting of the groceries order.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The Minister for Finance is therefore incorrect.  He made the point that Se&aacute;n Hurley has been given responsibility for implementing the ICT projects on behalf of the HSE.  Mr. Hurley retired from his role as acting director in June of this year and no replacement has been made since.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister state whether agreement has been reached on holding a debate on Aer Lingus next week?  Yesterday the Taoiseach stated there were a number of obstacles, perhaps legal obstacles, in the way of doing so.  Have they been cleared yet?</P>
        <P>Will the Minister state when the sale of alcohol Bill is expected to be published?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill will be published early next year.  I understand no agreement has been reached as yet on whether there will be a debate on Aer Lingus next week.</P>
        <P>I take Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s point on Mr. Hurley.  He was originally the person dealing with the issue.  I would not be up to date on the matter and it was additional information that I gave to the House.  If it is the case that he has been replaced, that is fine.  On the ICT projects, while there may be a debate taking place at official level, the point at issue is that the HSE is responsible for its own budget.  That is the point I was making.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to have the information correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister state when the Book of Estimates will be published?  Why did the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill fall off the schedule for today and tomorrow and when is it to be reintroduced?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It happened by fax last night.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>That the debate on troops going to the Lebanon became an issue meant the Bill has been dropped off the schedule for the moment.  That does not mean it has been withdrawn.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that this is the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s particular responsibility, will he let the House know whether the ethics legislation will be supplementary to the list we have in front of us of promised legislation, or how long will it be before it sees the light of day?  I am referring to the arrangements of the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste to have new legislation. </P>
        <P>I expected the citizens information Bill to have been published last Friday.  Given that the Minister is here, perhaps he will confirm whether it was to be published last Friday and what has happened?  Has a date been set for publication of the citizens information Bill?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed that it is intended to publish the citizens information Bill later this week, probably on Friday.  The other issue, which was agreed in principle yesterday by the Government, will be dealt with by officials of my Department.  We will work on advice from the Attorney General and publish it as soon as possible. </P>

      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>In view of the importance of developing our national resources and the recent publication of the energy discussion document, when is the minerals development Bill expected, given that it is critical and crucial?  I have another question on the point raised by Deputy Rabbitte, namely, the Tribunals of Inquiry (Amendment) Bill.  Is it possible to initiate an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the expenditure of almost &euro;60 million on an e-voting system that has now been proven&mdash;&mdash;-</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That matter does not arise on the Order of Business.  The Minister will address the first question on promised legislation. </P>

      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I appeal to Deputy Durkan.  We have had an orderly Order of Business up to this point and we would like that to continue. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Minister will initiate this, or maybe the T&aacute;naiste will do so. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>

	<P>What about the inquiry? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a few questions on the Order of Business.  For clarity on the Tribunals of <Col N="425"/>Inquiry (Amendment) Bill that was scheduled for today and tomorrow, it is unusual even if there was other more pressing business that it would not remain listed since it is likely that there is not sufficient business for tomorrow.  Just so I understand it, is it being proceeded with and, if so, when will it be introduced on Second Stage, or is it being withdrawn? </P>
        <P>Is time being made available for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to make a statement on the Gort shooting earlier this week so that he can  update the House on the exact process of inquiry, what has transpired and what information is available to him?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not aware of the intention that he should be in the House.  Obviously he is dealing with other responsibilities&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Or a Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;during the course of the next few days, so I am not aware that alternative arrangements are envisaged. </P>
        <P>On the Tribunals of inquiry (Amendment) Bill, I understand it was taken off the schedule for this week.  That does not mean it is withdrawn, and that is a matter to be taken up at the meeting of the Whips tonight.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I have three issues that I hope are relevant to the Order of Business.  In light of the whole issue surrounding gifts and charities etc., we have been waiting for many years for a charities Bill.  When will that be dealt with?  Another issue that is extremely important is the need for primary health care.  In that context when will the House discuss the medical practitioners Bill? </P>
        <P>In light of the fact that it takes 24 months to get an appointment to get on a waiting list for health care, when will the eligibility for health and personal social services Bill be discussed in the House so that we can do something about this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>On the third Bill mentioned by Deputy Crawford, the eligibility for health services Bill is expected next year.  Waiting times have been significantly reduced in many specialties as a result of many improvements. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to raise two issues on the Order of Business for response by the Minister for Finance.  The Government has indicated that it is likely to publish the national development plan for 2007 onwards in mid-November.  Are there plans for a debate in the House to review the last national development plan and to analyse whether what is being proposed for 2007 onwards is in the national interest? </P>
        <P>On the Dublin transport authority Bill, which is in section A of the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme for this session, the Secretary General of the Department of Transport at last Thursday&rsquo;s meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, indicated that this is being drafted.  She could not give a finishing time for when this to be finalised.  Will the Minister indicate why it is in section A and concede that it will not come before the House this session?  What plans, if any, has the Government for a national transport authority to have integrated transport facilities for those of us who do not represent Dublin constituencies?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>On the third matter, we have been talking about setting up a Dublin transport authority in the context of the major investment envisaged for public transport in Dublin.  This does not mean that the transport requirements of other areas will be neglected in any way.  Unprecedented investment is planned, as the Deputy knows, throughout the country in respect of <Col N="427"/>public transport, and I am glad this has the broad support of the House. </P>
        <P>On the Bill that is to come from the Department of Transport, the heads of the Bill have been passed by Government.  On how soon the Chief Parliamentary Counsel can produce the detailed Bill, that has to do with continuing matters and I cannot indicate a date.  We hoped by putting it in section A to have it for this session and that is what we should like to see happen.  Obviously, there are many priorities, however, which the parliamentary counsel has to deal with.  Members on the Opposition side who have been in government understand that such issues are all the time being evaluated by the Chief Whip in discussions with the parliamentary counsel.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>On the national development plan, indicative timelines have been set out, but no final decision has yet been taken on when it will be published.  That work is advancing and it must, obviously, be approved by Government before we decide on a publication date.  All the omens are indicative, pending approval and finalisation of the plan.  On the prospects of the outgoing plan being debated, that is a matter for the Whips to deliberate on and agree.</P>

	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the exercise by the State of the option or discretion, provided by Article 1.11 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, to notify the President of the Council that it wishes to take part in the adoption of the following proposed measure:</P>
        <P LI="2">Agreement between the European Union and the United States of America on the processing and transfer of passenger name record data by air carriers to the United States Department of Homeland Security,</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0">a copy of which proposed measure was laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 10 October 2006.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This motion, under Article 29.4.6&deg; of the Constitution, seeks the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas for Ireland to participate in an agreement between the EU and the United States on the continued use of passenger name record data.  As Deputies are all aware, in the five years since 11 September 2001 the United States has been very aware of the possibility of terrorist attacks.  The events of 11 September heightened awareness of the vulnerabilities in the area of aviation.  As part of their anti-terrorism security measures following these events, US authorities have for some time been requiring airlines on transatlantic routes to supply personal information on passengers in advance of travel.  This is commonly referred to as PNR, passenger name record, data.</P><Col N="430"/>
        <P>Identification of potentially high risk passengers through PNR data analysis provides states and aircraft operators with a capacity to improve aviation security, enhance national and border security and prevent and combat terrorist acts, related crimes and other serious crimes that are transnational in nature, including organised crime.  It protects the vital interests of passengers and the public.  PNR data helps expedite customs and immigration at airports and facilitates and safeguards legitimate passenger traffic.</P>
        <P>The European Union has been working with the US authorities to ensure the personal data of European citizens is appropriately protected in the US.  This transfer of data has been taking place within the framework of a decision by the European Commission under EU data protection legislation and undertakings given to the Commission by the US authorities limiting the use to which the data would be put to protect the rights of EU citizens while at the same time assisting the international effort against terrorism.  Following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 in the United States, the US authorities enacted legislation providing that air carriers operating flights to, from and within United States territory would have to provide them with electronic access to the data contained in their reservation and departure systems.</P>
        <P>An agreement was negotiated on behalf of the European Community by the European Commission, with the agreement of the member states, and was signed in Washington DC on 28 May 2004.  It entered into effect on the same day.  The European Parliament decided to refer this agreement to the European Court of Justice seeking its annulment.  In a judgment delivered on 30 May 2006, the Court of Justice annulled the decision of the Council of Ministers.  The court decided that there was no appropriate legal basis for the Council decision approving the conclusion of the agreement, or for the Commission decision finding that the information transferred was adequately protected by the United States.</P>
        <P>Essentially, it was the view of the court that the main objective involved was concerned with security matters and, accordingly, a first pillar legal base was incorrect.  In delivering its decision, the Court of Justice decided that the agreement should remain applicable for a period of 90 days from notification of its termination for reasons of legal certainty and, to protect persons concerned, to preserve the effect of the decision on adequacy until 30 September 2006.  The agreement therefore remained in effect and fully operational until 30 September 2006 to give the Commission and the member states time to discuss and agree a solution to the question of the legal basis for the agreement.  This, in turn, means that the position of travellers from the European Union to the United States remained unchanged until 30 September 2006.</P><Col N="431"/>
        <P>There was a slight slippage in meeting the 30 September deadline.  After lengthy negotiations, however, the EU Presidency has produced the text of the new agreement with the US and a draft Council decision.  The new agreement does not differ to any significant degree from the old agreement except that it has a different legal basis.  I stress that it offers the same safeguards and protections for EU citizens.  However, to maintain transatlantic travel, Aer Lingus, in common with other EU airlines, has continued to supply the data with the full knowledge of the intending passengers.  The 34 individual data items are available for citizens to peruse on the Internet.  Full details of the PNR undertakings of the US Department of Homeland Security are also available on the Internet.</P>
        <P>I can go further and state that there has been very little negative feedback about PNR from airline users.  In addition, I have been assured by the Office of the Attorney General that there are no data protection issues involved in continuing to supply the US authorities with this data.  In order for Ireland to take part in the agreement, the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas will be needed under Article 29.4.6&deg; of the Constitution.  In the case of some of our European partners a similar parliamentary process will not be necessary.  It is hoped the new agreement will come into force on 12 October 2006.  It is essential that Ireland joins with our European partners in participating in this agreement.</P>
        <P>I commend the motion to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael will not oppose this motion but I want to make some comments about it.  We are all a little surprised that it has come before the House but all of us have been following this issue since 11 September 2001 when the Department of Homeland Security in the United States first announced it required this type of information as part of its battle against terrorism.  One can understand the Commission&rsquo;s decision to sign up to this agreement, almost without question, given the obvious need to ensure there was no disruption to trade, tourism or the normal social intercourse between Europe and the new world for either economic or social reasons, particularly at a time when the future of air travel was threatened.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, we owe a debt of gratitude to the Parliament for referring it to the European Court of Justice because it was a considerable commitment made on behalf of us all to transfer this data to the United States and have it maintained for an indefinite period.  Agreeing to this measure was no small deed and a debt is due to the Parliament for referring it to court, which has found there was no legal basis for the Commission to sign the agreement because it related to issues of security.  Also, the protections within the United <Col N="432"/>States of the data transferred were not adequately secured.</P>
        <P>On one level, those of us in Europe regard it as a form of paranoia on the part of the United States authorities that they would require this kind of information but on another level one wondered what use the information being transmitted would be to anybody in determining whether a terrorist attack was being planned.  Notwithstanding that, the Department of Homeland Security felt strongly about it.</P>
        <P>It has made certain commitments and it is essential that those commitments are met to protect individuals regarding the processing of their personal data if they consider that the processing of the passenger name records data is not in accordance with the standards of protection promised by the Department of Homeland Security or where a competent United States authority has determined they are in breach of those standards until compliance of those standards is assured.  We can stop transferring the data in certain circumstances, for example, where there are reasonable grounds for believing the Department of Homeland Security is not taking adequate or timely steps to settle a breach of standards.  In nodding this motion through the House, so to speak &mdash; apparently only two countries have not already nodded it through their Parliaments &mdash; we must be rigorous in ensuring that whatever undertakings are given are obeyed to the letter, that information is used only for the purpose for which it is intended and that it is only passed to those who are included in the agreement.</P>
        <P>I have a number of reservations and questions and I hope the Minister of State will clarify them for me.  The US authorities currently have access to the 34 pieces of data information they require.  In other words, they can seek that information rather than Europe giving it to them automatically.  Until it is technically feasible for airlines to automatically arrange for the transfer of information, they have that access.  I am concerned, perhaps needlessly but I would like clarification, about whether they have access to other information which is not required or if it is restricted to those 34 items of information.</P>
        <P>Another of my concerns is the number of other bodies within the United States to whom this information is transferred automatically.  Do the undertakings given by the Department of Homeland Security apply equally to the other competent bodies that have a role in security in the United States?  The more bodies that receive this type of information, the more potential there is for abuse of that information.  I am anxious to know if the undertakings given by the Department of Homeland Security apply also to those bodies and the checks that are in place regarding the use to which they put that information.</P>
        <P>Another concern that I and others have expressed is the length of time the data is held.  In the new agreement, there is no deadline in <Col N="433"/>terms of the length of time the data can be held.  I understand the reason there is no agreement is because the Department of Homeland Security in the United States is anxious to keep it for a number of years to build a profile of people travelling to and from the United States.  If somebody travels to the United States and then leaves, the information should be scrapped.  Holding on to this data and effectively building a profile of all passengers coming from Europe is beyond what is necessary.  When is it expected that type of agreement will be reached in terms of the length of time the information should be held?</P>
        <P>Another concern the Minister might address is the fact that this is a one-way process.  I am not suggesting there is not a security threat.  There is a security threat worldwide.  The threats and acts of terrorism are not just directed against the United States; they occur in other parts of the world.  If the authorities in the United States consider that this information is essential to them to protect travellers, airports, planes and other targets within the United States and if the European Community agrees they need this information and consequently signs this agreement to transfer that information to them, is the information about US passengers coming here not equally important to this country?  Is there any talk of a reciprocal agreement?  Do we consider that a reciprocal agreement would be necessary and that they would transfer similar information to authorities in Europe?</P>
        <P>Fine Gael has no intention of obstructing the passing of this motion because, regardless of our concerns about the use to which this data is put, our overriding concern is to ensure there is no disruption to aviation traffic across the Atlantic.  If we want aviation traffic to continue without disruption, this is the price we must pay.  However, I stress again the importance of ensuring that whatever undertakings have been given, which are clearly laid out and are fairly minimal, although they would not inspire total confidence, as part of the agreement to protect data, are rigorously enforced and that the data flow would stop instantly if there was any breach in the use to which this data is put.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Labour Party will not oppose this motion but I want to make a number of comments about it and the manner with which it is being dealt.  At European Union level, it is difficult to understand how negotiations on this issue went to the wire and we now find ourselves in a position where there is a certain degree of urgency in passing this motion.</P>
        <P>Why has it been handled so badly in terms of providing necessary information and briefing to Opposition Members?  We were handed a briefing note at 5.30 p.m. yesterday but there was no indication of the scale of the debate today.  It would have been helpful if this was indicated to us last week even though the EU agreement had <Col N="434"/>not been finalised at that stage.  The Department should have briefed us rather than catching us unawares last night.  At this short notice, it is difficult for Members to respond and I ask the Minister of State to note this in respect of future motions or legislation.  The Department of Transport tends to rush through proposals without adequate notice to the Opposition and without allowing time for detailed consideration of what is proposed.</P>
        <P>After 11 September 2001, an agreement was reached between the EU and the US in respect of transatlantic passenger data exchange.  Last May, this was found to have an inappropriate legal basis.  The EU had to find an agreement that was legally sound and this is the purpose of today&rsquo;s motion.  We accept the need to end the legal vacuum that has existed over the past months.</P>
        <P>Substantial differences in attitudes to data protection exist between the EU and the US.  Many of these differences surfaced in negotiations in recent months, a number of which have not been resolved.  There was pressure to implement a new legal agreement before 30 September, or as soon as possible afterwards, and now many of the differences remain unresolved.  This matter must be revisited by the EU, which is why this is an interim agreement.  At EU level, this must be revisited early next year in order to reach a satisfactory agreement in mid-2007.  We should not have last-minute, rushed negotiations resulting in an agreement that is unsatisfactory.  The concerns regarding citizens&rsquo; rights have not been adequately aired or addressed in the agreement.</P>
        <P>It is important that the US authorities guarantee adequate data protection safeguards are in place.  Issues raised in negotiations must be addressed in a meaningful way and incorporated into a more permanent agreement.  This agreement contains certain safeguards, but it is not clear how they will be overseen at US, EU or national level.  Safeguards in the agreement seem acceptable and the briefing material suggests they are adequate, but it is not clear who will be responsible for monitoring the safeguards and ensuring the agreement secures those safeguards.</P>
        <P>What are the arrangements for monitoring the operation of this agreement?  At EU and national level, what aviation and data protection authorities will oversee this agreement to ensure the safeguards are implemented?  I ask the Minister of State to detail the data that can be transferred.  The agreement states that data will be available to the Department of Homeland Security, meaning the bureau of customs and border protection, US immigration and customs enforcement and the office of the secretary.  The data cannot be provided to other sections of the department, such as the citizenship and immigration services, transportation, security administration, the US secret service, the coast guard and the federal emergency management agency.  What monitor<Col N="435"/>ing system is in place to ensure the information is not transferred to another section of the Department of Homeland Security?  Assurances have been given and we hope and expect they will be honoured.</P>
        <P>The agreement refers to information that will be sealed and can only be accessed by certain bodies.  How can this be guaranteed and who will oversee it?  The agreement also allows any member state to suspend the data flow if it has concerns about inappropriate use of the data.  This is fine in theory, but what rights does a member state have in doing this?  If inappropriate data is being collected or if data is being accessed by unauthorised bodies in the US and a member state suspends the data flow, what are the implications?  Who will adjudicate if the agreement has been breached?  What recourse does the member state have or are we at the mercy of the US authorities who can dictate the conditions whereby citizens can enter the US?  This is the underlying problem because the US calls the shots on entry to the country.  The rest of us are powerless in this respect.  The EU and its individual member states fear that when concerns are raised the US authorities may refuse entry to, for example, Irish flights.  This would create chaos.  While safeguards exist in paper, I am doubtful about the level of protection they will afford, given the lack of clarity about how they will be monitored or the redress an EU state will have in the event of those safeguards or the agreement being breached.</P>
        <P>There is general agreement that we need to move towards a framework which, as far as possible, guarantees the protection of security and citizens&rsquo; fundamental rights.  There are clear and inherent difficulties in reaching such an agreement.  I again urge the Minister to use whatever powers of persuasion he has to ensure that adequate time is allowed within the EU to ensure that the two sides of this agreement are adequately addressed in negotiations for a more permanent agreement and that by the beginning of 2007, these negotiations would be under way.</P>
        <P>It is generally accepted that it is one thing to have an agreement between the EU and the US but what is definitely needed is a worldwide agreement, although it is difficult to know the basis on which this can be achieved.  Given the nature of the terrorist threat, it is wholly inadequate that an agreement on this matter is confined to the EU and the US.  We need to examine putting in place a platform for reaching this kind of wider agreement, which is essential if we are to improve and tighten up international security in respect of the threat from international terrorism.</P>
        <P>In respect of the manner in which we are dealing with this matter today, we are faced with a motion under Article 29.4.6&deg; of the Constitution which requires the approval of this agreement by <Col N="436"/>both Houses.  I accept that, procedurally, this needs to be done but if we are following this procedure, can the Minister of State explain why it is necessary?  This procedure allows another agreement to override the Irish Constitution.  From my reading of this, it is not clear why we need to override the existing protections in the Constitution.  It contains protections relating to matters such as data protection, security and the rights of individual citizens which this motion will override.  Will the Minister of State identify why we need to override the provisions of the Constitution and the specific protections within the Constitution which will now be overridden by this agreement?  This is an important point.  We do not move to override any of the protections or provisions in our Constitution easily.  The Minister of State has a serious obligation to outline to us today the precise reasons we need to do this and the precise protections in the Constitution which will be set aside to allow this agreement to be adopted.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Since 5 February 2003, the US requires in-flying airlines to provide the US authorities with electronic access to 34 items of data on passengers.  While some passenger data systems contain a limited amount of information, others contain far more extensive data, such as details of past travel, car and hotel reservations, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, residential and business addresses and credit card information.  Therefore, in respect of fundamental privacy rights versus an advancing Big Brother state, this potentially expansive agreement should not be entered into lightly or behind closed doors.  EU member states should not allow themselves to be bullied into applying an agreement which fails to guarantee the data protection rights of its citizens or, at the very least, the equivalent of the data protection rights they enjoy in their own states.</P>
        <P>In 2003 and 2004, the European Parliament passed a number of resolutions which were highly critical of the PNR agreement.  It then took a case to the European Court of Justice, ECJ, contesting both the legal basis for the agreement and its content.  Unfortunately, when the ECJ upheld the European Parliament&rsquo;s challenge last summer, it decided not to address the question of the agreement&rsquo;s content in its ruling because, on the basis of the &ldquo;legal grounds&rdquo; challenge, it determined that the agreement should be annulled anyway.  In a cynical move, the Council of the European Union, in which members of the Cabinet participate, decided last Friday to change the treaty <Col N="437"/>basis on which to permit the agreement.  This decision takes no account of the European Parliament&rsquo;s legitimate challenge to the substantive content of the agreement, which I have no doubt would have been upheld by the ECJ had it taken the time to examine it.  This is not a transport issue, rather it is a justice issue.  Shame on the governments of Europe for pretending otherwise.</P>
        <P>The US PNR requirement forms part of the so-called &ldquo;war on terror&rdquo; and one of the first casualties of this war has undoubtedly been civil liberties.  We have only to look to the rights denied prisoners in Guantanamo Bay and the programme of extraordinary rendition to be sure of this.  The proposed PNR agreement would tie the fundamental data protection and privacy rights of Irish citizens flying to the US to ever-changing and ever more regressive US laws because the agreement stipulates that the US Department of Homeland Security can process PNR data &ldquo;in accordance with applicable US laws&rdquo;.  Therefore, if the law changes in the US, the US Government can then change how it processes and stores PNR data on European citizens, the period for which this data can be held and how and who it can be passed to without renegotiation of the PNR agreement between itself and the EU.</P>
        <P>No one has stopped to consider whether the fundamental rights-infringing PNR agreement in operation so far has actually contributed to a reduction in crime.  Why did the Government not question whether the arrangement has been effective before proposing its continuation and approval to the Houses of Oireachtas?  At a seminar on the PNR to which air carriers were invited earlier this year, they were asked how many planes had been diverted or sent back to their place of origin after taking off because of PNR data on one or more passengers and how many times should these planes not have been diverted.  The companies replied that planes were diverted ten times and that on all these occasions, the alarm raised turned out to be false.</P>
        <P>Ireland can opt out of this agreement and can negotiate an agreement of its own if the need arises.  Alternatively, it can take the lead within the Council of the European Union in demanding a more acceptable agreement.  I call on the Government to amend the proposed agreement before its adoption to ensure that, at the very least, the annual joint review includes a requirement for an evaluation of the agreement covering both the detail of its operation and its effectiveness against its stated objective of &ldquo;fighting terrorism&rdquo; and that any change in US, EU or Irish data protection provisions relevant to the operation of the agreement would prompt an immediate and transparent renegotiation of the agreement requiring further approval by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a very difficult matter for the D&aacute;il to consider and has been made even <Col N="438"/>more difficult by the fact that, as Deputy Shortall and others noted, we were only informed about the issue yesterday evening.  I understand the frontline Minister was unaware of the requirement for us to pass this motion and that we are, in a sense, second last in the EU to do so.  Every EU jurisdiction has approved the agreement, with the exception of Ireland and another state.  This puts us in a very difficult position because no one would dispute or disagree with the supposed intent, namely, the provision of data to combat terrorism, such as the events that took place in London in July 2005, Madrid in March 2004 and New York in September 2001.  However, this is a balancing act as we also seek to ensure the rights and privacy of Irish and European citizens are maintained in any arrangement with another state, such as the United States in this case.  It is difficult in the available timeframe to read the details of the undertaking given by the Department of Homeland Security and establish whether those rights will be correctly protected.</P>
        <P>Our party, like our sister parties in the European Union, has significant and real concerns regarding the nature of this agreement and a breach of the principle on the right to privacy which exists within the Union.  The principle held in other European countries is that information should only be used for the purpose for which it is collected.  If we have control over data handed on to a particular agency, at least we know what its use will be and the conditions under which it will be used.</P>
        <P>Effectively, this agreement will mean handing over data to a sovereign foreign government and acceding that it has the right to pass on that information to other agencies within that state where the same data control measures may not apply.  We may not have any idea what data control measures will apply.  That sovereign state may forward the data to another sovereign state based on its assessment of need.  Our control over or understanding of the use of the information we yield and controls over its use will no longer exist.  We will hand over in trust that information to the current Administration in the United States.</P>
        <P>We could and should have sought a better agreement to protect the right to privacy, cherished and valued within the European Union.  Such an agreement should in no way be taken as a weakening of our will to fight terrorism.  That is certainly not the intent of this side of the House.  The will to fight terrorism should not override our desire under proper constraints to protect the interests of our citizens.  We could and should do better than what is set out in this motion.</P>
        <P>We are in a difficult position.  If we vote down the motion, will we be seen as fighting against the war on terrorism?  Will be seen to be on one side rather than another?  I trust any other administration would see beyond such simplistic analysis.  I trust an administration of the United States would view European legislators as standing up <Col N="439"/>for the principles, rights and freedoms it embodies and state it understands the difference of opinion and the reluctance to hand over control on the right to privacy.  It would understand a parliament standing up for the right to privacy of its citizens and having a willingness to provide information but also a desire that the material and data be used in certain ways with certain controls.</P>
        <P>When I read this undertaking from the Department of Homeland Security, I see fundamentally we have ceded control on the right to privacy.  We could justify it if it were used in a narrow context such as a war against terrorism or valid security reasons.  I do not object to that.  In reading the undertaking, I see no guarantee or understanding that will be its limit.  In yielding data which may be passed on to other governments or third parties we will step too far.  My party opposes the motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to state that I received information on this matter only approximately one hour ago.  It affords one little opportunity to research the matter and one must question the motive.  If other countries have already dealt with this, why were we left until now?  We have seen various examples of legislation rushed through the House.  In any context, rushed legislation does not make for sound legislation.  I would prefer if we had the information for a little longer.  My knowledge of PNR is that airlines run a check on passengers prior to departure and they will now have 72 hours longer to do so.</P>
        <P>The requirement of passenger names by the United States conflicts with a number of governments on privacy laws.  We have various wide-ranging agreements between the United States and the European Union.  This hits at privacy laws.  I have no doubt many people are not worried.  They are more concerned with being fit to travel to the United States.  For some people, the change from having to go to the United States Embassy for a holiday visa was an ease.  Some people were lucky enough to get multiple indefinite visas.  In that regard, it possibly does away with that application system.</P>
        <P>Many people are concerned this represents a major act of faith in the integrity of the Department of Homeland Security.  A number of issues are raised such as Guantanamo Bay.  That Department has engaged in a policy of extraordinary rendition to countries which permit torture.  A recent example is that of a Canadian citizen who was an innocent travelling through the United States.  He was picked up, sent off and tortured.  Apologies and questions on how and why this happened are now coming from all directions.  We must address these issues.  Rushing through this motion does not give us time to examine what could happen.</P>
        <P>Earlier, it was pointed out that much of this agreement hinges on United States law.  The law <Col N="440"/>of any country changes from week to week.  If the rules changes, will we be provided with an opportunity to reconsider this legislation or examine its implications?  These are difficult issues and we should have an opportunity to consider them.</P>
        <P>The anti-terrorism security measures which followed the events of September 2001 form part of the background to this.  For some time, the United States authorities have required airlines on transatlantic routes to supply personal information on passengers in advance of travel and this is commonly known as PNR.  The transfer of this data takes place within the framework of a decision by the European Commission under EU data protection legislation.  Undertakings given to the Commission by the United States authorities limit the use to which the data will be put.  This protects the rights of EU citizens while at the same time assists international efforts against terrorism.  This is the nub of the issue.  We want to protect the citizens of the EU but we are concerned about any further use to which the data could be put.  For how long will the data be stored?  Can it be stored indefinitely?  That would infringe privacy rights.</P>
        <P>We all recognise we must act to counter international terrorism in which aircraft have been used in the past.  We do not want our country to be used as a conduit.  The European Court of Justice ruled on 30 May 2006 that the legal basis for the decision was not appropriate.  We will put the onus on airlines to supply names and that is not an appropriate function for airlines.  A threat is implied to deny landing rights if one does not comply.  Effectively, that is blackmail.  We will have little choice in the matter.  These issues should be addressed and I am concerned we do not have a wide enough timeframe to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion to approve on behalf of the Oireachtas participation in an interim agreement between the EU and the US on the continued use of passenger name records data.</P>
        <P>The history of PNR data between the EU and US stems back to 11 September 2001, the beginning of the so-called &ldquo;war on terrorism&rdquo; for the United States, and the fundamental change in mindset in the American public and US policy makers on security matters generally.  I was in New York two weeks after 11 September, when the city and country was still shell-shocked by what had occurred.  The response was always going to be security obsessed, and understandably so.  Since then, led by the Department of Homeland Security, there has been a particular focus on security measures in airports and in the airline sector generally.  The resultant consequences are inconvenience for passengers coming from and going to the US and a compromise in people&rsquo;s civil liberties and, some would say, fundamental rights.</P><Col N="441"/>
        <P>While for the most part, US citizens have accepted new security measures, the non-US travelling public, travelling through or to the US, have questioned the lengths to which the US authorities are going with security concerns, particularly the collection of passenger data.  Many in the EU are uncomfortable with the US insistence on PNR data and fingerprint information before any visit to the US.  These new measures have affected Ireland more than most.  Even if we still enjoy a visa waiver programme, the volume of traffic to and from the US makes it even more relevant to Ireland, and to Britain, than to many other EU countries.</P>
        <P>Until recently the transfer of passenger data has taken place within the framework of a decision by the European Commission under EU data protection legislation and undertakings given to the Commission by the US authorities to limit the use of such data to protect the privacy rights of EU citizens while assisting in the international effort to counteract terrorism.  Serious concerns, however, were raised in the European Parliament and elsewhere at the start of the year that the agreement by the EU and US on passenger data sharing was not legally sound.  A case was taken to the European Court of Justice, which ruled on 30 May that the legal basis for the Commission decision was not appropriate and, therefore, could not stand.</P>
        <P>As a result of the sensitivities of the issue, the ECJ allowed the agreement to remain in place until 30 September to allow time for the EU and US to come up with a new agreement that would be legally sound and would serve the same purpose as the previous agreement.  In 2004 the Commission signed up to a serious commitment between the EU and US without having the competence to do so.  It is important to note that the ECJ decision had nothing to do with infringements of people&rsquo;s fundamental rights or civil liberties, even though politicians have raised those concerns on many occasions.  Instead, the legal decision was an issue of competence.</P>
        <P>The new agreement, which is an interim arrangement that only lasts until 31 July 2007, has the necessary legal basis if all EU member states sign up to it &mdash; Ireland is the second last to do so.  This is an interim agreement for a reason, namely, to allow for the negotiation of a more comprehensive and acceptable agreement for both sides.  This suggests that not everyone is happy with the agreement, as many consider it does not strike a balance between civil liberties and privacy and the need for a comprehensive agreement to counter international terrorism.</P>
        <P>The European Parliament has been at the heart of this debate and was primarily responsible for bringing the case before the European Court of Justice in May.  The European Parliament, in its hotly debated report, recommended a two-step negotiation strategy on behalf of the European Union on this issue.  The first thing it proposed <Col N="442"/>was a recognition that a new, short-term agreement to run for a set period was necessary because there was no time to negotiate a more comprehensive agreement and because of the strongly held views in America.  MEPs recommended, however, that we should seek some changes between the 2004 agreement and what we will agree in the interim.  The main recommendation was for a change in the process of allowing full and open access to all passenger data for the Department of Homeland Security in the US and a move towards a system that would mirror the &ldquo;push&rdquo; system between the EU and Canada and the EU and Australia, where passenger data information would be given to the Department of Homeland Security on request on a case by case basis.  This is the essence of the argument, whether we should require airlines to give open access to all data on all passengers, regardless of their background, or we should only agree to provide data on people the US deems to be a risk or in respect of whom it has a reason for requesting data.</P>
        <P>That recommendation is not part of the interim agreement because, I suspect, of the firmly held views on Capitol Hill and the Department of Homeland Security.  The European Parliament recognised that more time was needed to put together a more comprehensive agreement on air transportation security and sharing of passenger information.  This is not only an issue between the US and the EU.  If we are genuinely interested in a global war on terrorism, as the US calls it, or combating terrorism at a global level, as we call it in Europe, we must ensure common standards between the EU and other parts of the world.</P>
        <P>Many people who recognise the need to counter terrorism still have legitimate concerns about the use of personal information by the US Department of Homeland Security.  We must rely on what are referred to in the interim agreement as &ldquo;undertakings&rdquo; by the US.  The undertakings in this agreement, however, are exactly the same as those in the 2004 agreement.  The concerns that have been expressed in the European Parliament and national parliaments across Europe by those who are committed to the war on terrorism and who wish to co-operate with the US in every way that makes sense, on privacy and the US undertakings on the handling of passenger data, still exist.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The essence of the problem is that the United States and European Union take different approaches to this issue.  The former considers that because it has been at war with terrorism since 2001, the rules of war apply and it is willing to take more extreme measures.  The latter is uncomfortable with this position because Europeans categorise the problem as requiring the introduction of counter-terrorism measures rather than conducting a war.  For this reason, it will be difficult to negotiate the type of comprehensive agree<Col N="443"/>ment that is required by July next year.  If we do not try to achieve this objective, the difference of opinion between the two sides will remain.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity of saying a few words on this motion.  This issue requires certain assurances from the Government side.  I may be incorrect in assuming that because the agreement to which the motion refers is short term in nature, we may look forward to a proper debate before July 2007.  I seek a categoric assurance that such a debate will take place.  If we are to have a new agreement, a fundamental principle arises, namely, the need for a proactive approach to be taken to parliamentary transparency with regard to any such agreements.  One cannot enter into inter-state agreements almost on a casual basis and leave it to the citizen to seek to vindicate his or her rights by way of what is usually colloquially referred to as the invocation of civil rights.</P>
        <P>Aspects of fundamental law are involved in this issue, even with regard to the process by which this motion has been brought before the House.  The process of invoking article 1(11) of the Amsterdam treaty cannot be used without clear guarantees as to the principles of the constitutional protection available to the citizens of Ireland or without fundamental adherence to compliance with such guarantees in law as exist for the protection of privacy in the European Convention on Human Rights and other locations of fundamental legal rights.  This is an important principle and it is the reason Deputies from all sides seek a discussion of the type proposed.</P>
        <P>The issue is not whether we stand on different sides regarding the war on terror.  All parties, Independent Deputies and others in the House have declared their co-operation with the elimination of terror internationally and the elimination of drug movements and hot money associated with international crime.  From time to time, the House has debated such instruments as are relevant in this regard.</P>
        <P>Much of the problem before us could be solved if a statement was made at the beginning of discourse to Parliament and inserted in the text of the agreement giving effect to the principle that nothing that shall be agreed shall limit or shall be in contravention of any fundamental legal guarantees in relation to the rights to privacy and the rights of the citizen as are reasonable.  Either one accepts this principle or one does not.  Let us assume the Government is not willing to make such a statement, as is the current position.  Effectively, the 1995 European Union data directive has been invoked to demonstrate that the 2004 public records data transfer arrangement lacks legal certainty.  The current proposal will not provide legal certainty but will achieve compliance with process as regards the way in which <Col N="444"/>the original agreement should have been transacted in the first place.  Standing behind this, and also of fundamental importance, is the guarantee that is necessary regarding the use, abuse or scope of such information.</P>
        <P>The European Union has a constitutional relationship which is expressed in treaties with its citizens rather than in a written constitution.  It has a duty to its citizens which has been invoked more than once as a legal principle on the privacy issue.  Beyond this, legal rights which arise within the European Convention on Human Rights are also available to citizens.  Will the Minister of State indicate whether the Government proposes, in further discussion or dialogue in preparation for an agreement by July 2007, to include a preamble that anything that shall be proposed or agreed will require consent and will be in accordance with fundamental principles of international law and the conventions on the rights of the citizen?</P>
        <P>Deputy Coveney correctly mentioned that the European Parliament was concerned about this matter and adopted a reasonable position in the debate.  The Party of European Socialists has issued a statement on the transfer of passenger data in which it states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The US authorities must now apply all the data protection guarantees we are asking of them and which are inscribed in the declarations of commitment.  Ultimately, there is an urgent need to negotiate a new agreement in 2007, as proposed by the European Commission and the European Parliament, in order to determine a global and binding framework of guarantees for the protection of both security as well as citizens&rsquo; fundamental rights.  This new agreement will have to make provision for a European citizen&rsquo;s right of effective judicial redress in the event of a violation.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This point has been made by my colleague, the Labour Party spokesperson, Deputy Shortall.  Is what is being offered in the interim an adequate monitoring mechanism?  Does it provide a mechanism for judicially reviewing a breach?  How would sanctions fall?  Will the Government accuse the Opposition of being in some way soft on a measure related to the control of terror if we are not utterly compliant?  I am sure it would not go down that road as it would amount to a form of intimidation.</P>
        <P>The statement from the Party of European Socialists continues: &ldquo;The European Parliament should also be involved in this process alongside the national parliaments&rdquo;.  It is not satisfactory to regard this as a technical issue.</P>
        <P>I do not mean disrespect to the current incumbent but the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform does not have a good record on these issues.  For example, it wrote to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe suggesting in a kind of blind way that if anything <Col N="445"/>untoward was taking place in Shannon Airport as regards extraordinary rendition, the country&rsquo;s civil aviation legislation would allow any individual to take action.  It omitted to state, however, that Ireland has not taken any steps to use the powers available under the relevant legislation.  What indication is there that we would even have an inclination towards providing such protection as the citizen would want?</P>
        <P>I put it to the House that we are not at the high end of trust because considerable trust has been eroded.  A question arises, for example, regarding whether data gathered for a certain purpose would be used for any commercial purpose or any purpose which would be against the interest of the person to which it relates, for example, with regard to illness, employment, association, the right to communicate and so forth.  With whom would the passenger data be legally shared?  Will two different intelligence systems operate, one in Europe and one in the United States, with the former under the discipline and redress of international law and the latter outside the discipline of some aspects of international law because of the failure to sign conventions?  These are serious questions.</P>
        <P>On a previous occasion, I raised with the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Fahey, the marked reluctance shown by draughtspersons to insert in the preamble of many Bills a statement of principle such as that which I have outlined.  There is nothing to prevent legislation from opening with the stipulation that nothing hereunder proposed shall breach the principles of international law, conventions that have been signed and ratified with the Government, fundamental aspects of rights as guaranteed in the European conventions etc.  From that basis one could then go on to say that it is a matter that can be justiciable as to whether or not there is a breach.  One could also offer transparency, a review mechanism and a redress mechanism.  However if we are to get fairness and security it requires that both parties sign up to a transcendent set of disciplines that are beyond them.  In that way one does not put the requirements of security in extraordinary circumstances into tension with the rights of citizens.  It is insufficient to say the State shall &ldquo;make such arrangements as it technically requires&rdquo; and therefore citizens can seek afterwards to argue from the framework of civil liberties when they are infringed.  The obligation is on any government to examine it fundamentally as a matter of balance in international law and to anticipate the difficulty rather than suggest that the individual citizen must seek redress on a limited basis afterwards.</P>

	<P>With the permission of the House I intend to share time with Deputy McHugh.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="446"/>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>This agreement is about more than the sharing of airline data.  It is a fundamental disagreement between the old world and the new world.  The last five years have shown clearly the differences of opinion between both sides of the Atlantic and within countries on this side of the Atlantic.  A clear message has come from Washington &mdash; you are either with us or against us.  It is crucial that we seek the common ground in the dynamics of world reaction rather than increase the polarisation of the debate.</P>
        <P>One cannot bring peace to this world by initiating a war on terror.  One cannot bring peace to developing countries by bombing them back into the Stone Age.  One cannot bring peace by spending more on armaments than on Africa.  We are discussing kowtowing to Washington rather than allowing Europe to develop its own voice.  Ireland is at the crossroads in this and there is a significant onus on our foreign policy and our reaction to this proposal to say we should not meekly bow down to what the United States wants.  We should say it may not be appropriate to give the United States the huge amount of data it seeks.  I am concerned that we will have to give details of people&rsquo;s credit card records to the US authorities if they wish to travel there.  I worry about where this ends &mdash; criminal records, credit card details, next we will have to give information on penalty points.  We must strongly and carefully point out the difficulty in contributing to this frenzy on which the US has embarked in its war on terror.  There are many great aspects to the United States of which its can-do attitude, its dynamism and its assistance in times of need are examples.  However, when it comes to sharing the minutiae of passenger information I worry that the US is subsuming this data into an enormous expenditure on what it believes will protect its citizens.  I am not convinced.</P>
        <P>If the US were to spend even a small fraction of what has been spent on the war on terror over the last five years we could be well on our way to solving many of the problems of developing countries.  If we spent a small fraction of that money on nutrition, health, education and clean water we could achieve so much more than dropping the equivalent of millions of tonnes of TNT on Afghanistan or Iraq.  We must face up to the United States on this.  I speak as a citizen of both Ireland and the US because there has been a major polarisation in the US.  President Bush has not brought the United States in the right direction and a majority, which is no longer silent, wants to see a process of engagement with the developing world rather than pushing into this war on terror.  For these reasons, and many others, we should oppose this proposal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>This item of business has been foisted on this House with unseemly haste.  Last night was the first time we became aware of the decision to take this business today.  I regard that <Col N="447"/>as an abuse of trust between all of us in this House.  There is insufficient time to give full consideration to this measure.  Everybody in this House knows the dangers of rushing business through without giving it full attention.  We are dealing with a provision which will impact on the rights of our citizens and we cannot approve such a measure without adequate time to consider all the angles.  The genesis of this measure is in the events of 11 September 2001 and I agree that we must be vigilant.  We need co-operation between various jurisdictions and must ensure that, as far as possible, our people are secure as they travel around the world.  However we also need to ensure that the rights of our citizens are not infringed unduly.</P>
        <P>This measure arises because the European Court of Justice ruled that the legal basis for the Commission&rsquo;s decision was not appropriate and, in delivering its judgment, allowed the agreement to remain in force until September 2006 to give time for the EU and the US to come up with a new agreement which would effectively have the same outcome.  This decision will require the agreement of all member states as well as the EU Commission.  One other member remains to approve this new measure.  It is essential that we do not rush this through without full debate.  We are entitled to take our time, to debate the matter in a full, comprehensive manner because it affects the rights of our citizens.  I understand that this is an interim measure, and will lapse next May, but if that is not the case we should not entertain in any circumstances the notion of putting it through the House as it is presented or in the hasty manner in which it has been dealt with.  While the need for security is great, we also need to be rational in our approach.  We are not at war and our actions should be proportionate and reasonable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate and who posed a number of questions that I will endeavour to answer.</P>
        <P>I wish first to apologise, if it is necessary to do so, to Opposition spokespersons and Members for not having more time available to debate the motion.  As soon as it was possible to provide a briefing note,  we did so.  It is merely a case that circumstances have given rise to its being dealt with in this way.  The European Parliament brought this matter before the European Court of Justice, which found that there was no first pillar.  Afterwards the European Union and the United States entered into discussions but, in the meantime, the agreement did not lapse on 30 May when the European Court of Justice delivered its decision.  It provided, pragmatically and realistically, for a period of 90 days, which brought matters up to the end of September.  Ostensibly, <Col N="448"/>there was no major change involved.  However, as a result of the case and the dialogue that occurred on both sides, the European Union has a legal base for this but the agreement would have run out on 30 September.  That is why we are anxious that the motion be agreed to.</P>
        <P>There are concerns among Members regarding data protection and Deputy Shortall posed a number of questions.  The information that will be provided will be used for specific reasons and we do not want it to go beyond that.  If it is given to the Department of Homeland Security or subsidiary bodies, that is as far as it should go.  An undertaking has been given to the European Union that this will be the case.</P>
        <P>I wish to consider this matter from a practical point of view.  For the benefit of anyone who raised queries in respect of this matter, they should be aware that I am not suggesting that we are prepared to compromise on safety.  None of us is prepared to compromise on safety.  We must, however, consider the practicalities and the views of the people we represent.  In that context, there has been little, if any, negative feedback from airline users regarding the PNR.</P>
        <P>Both Houses have been given the opportunity to debate this matter.  It is not a case that we want to provide such an opportunity, we are obligated under Article 29.4.6&deg; of the Constitution to do so.  As already stated, the agreement runs to July of next year.  If a new agreement is concluded next year, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, and I will consult the Attorney General&rsquo;s office in the normal way and deal with any legal or constitutional implications that might arise for the Department, the Government or the Houses.</P>
        <P>It should be emphasised that the agreement relates only to access to those 34 items of information that may be requested.  There is no agreement in place which entitles the US authorities to access any information over and above the 34 items to which I refer.  I will not discuss the matter in detail because data relating to the 34 items, which include a person&rsquo;s name and address, frequent flyer information, seat number, bag tag, booking number etc., is provided.</P>
        <P>A total of 23 countries have approved the agreement and Ireland will be one of the final two to do so.  In that context, it was suggested that time should be provided for a more comprehensive debate.  I believe I represent the views of the vast majority of Members and the Irish people when I say that they are anxious that this arrangement should continue in place after 12 October.  Unanimity is required within the European Union.  We should not follow others but I am of the view that what we are doing is right, practical and in the best interests of travellers and those who we represent who want to visit the United States.</P>
        <P>I could be facetious and state that people need not provide the information requested, but if they do not do so, they will not be permitted to travel <Col N="449"/>to the United States.  In a sense, the provision of the information is voluntary but if one wishes to travel to the United States, its provision is obligatory.</P>
        <P>Provision is made in the agreement for reciprocal sharing of information but there are no concrete plans at this stage to ask the US to provide PNR data to the EU.  The United States possesses a centralised system but the EU does not and we should consider this matter in the period before the EU either abandons the agreement or enters into a new one post-July 2007.</P>
        <P>There is concern about the use to which this information may be put outside of what is required to ensure that we have safe means of travel, that there is no repeat of the attacks of 11 September 2001 or that there is no chance that what could have been another serious incident in London some months ago could come to pass.</P>
        <P>A number of undertakings were issued by the US Bureau of Customs and Border Protection on 11 May 2004.  These indicate that the United States can be considered as ensuring an adequate level of protection for PNR data concerning passenger flights to and from that country transferred from the European Union.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I am trying to do so.  The Deputy asked why no briefing was provided and I answered that.

	<P>I am answering the Deputy&rsquo;s questions, of which I took note.  I also answered the question relating to the details that will be requested.  I was asked if member states could suspend the flow of information.  If it is inappropriate, they may do so.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Who will arbitrate on that matter?</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>Another question was posed regarding the provision of adequate time for both sides in respect of the agreement and the necessity to override the Constitution.  The Office of the Attorney General was consulted on the approach we have taken and it confirmed that this is the appropriate procedure to permit Ireland to participate in the agreement.  I assure the House that between now and the conclusion of a replacement, or abandonment of the agreement, by July of next year, the various issues to which Members referred will be raised by me and-or the Minister, Deputy Cullen, in the context of our participation in discussions at the Council of Ministers in the coming months.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The European Commission report of 26 September 2006 stated that Bulgaria and Romania will be in a position to join the EU on 1 January 2007, as long as they address a number of outstanding issues.  The European Council of Foreign Ministers will decide at its meeting on 16 October whether accession should <Col N="452"/>go ahead on 1 January 2007.  The treaties of accession provide for the following transitional arrangements.  During phase 1, in 2007-08, member states may liberalise access to their labour markets or continue to require nationals of Bulgaria and Romania to hold employment permits.  Member states must notify the Commission before the end of 2008 of whether they plan to continue the restrictions for a further three years during phase 2.  During phase 3, in 2012-13, the transitional measures which restrict access should, in principle, cease to be applied.  However, in the case of a serious disturbance to its labour market or a threat thereof, a member state may continue to apply restrictions for a further two years.</P>
        <P>The Government will make a decision on access to the Irish labour market of Bulgarian and Romanian nationals before the accession date, following consultations with the social partners.  Contacts with the United Kingdom authorities have continued in recent weeks at prime ministerial and official levels.  The Employment Permits Act 2006, which was signed by the President in June, provides the legal basis for three options.  Nationals of Bulgaria and Romania who wish to participate in the Irish labour market during the first two years of transition will continue to require work permits with the current require<Col N="453"/>ment for a labour market test to establish that the positions cannot be filled from within the European economic area or will be granted work permits on foot of a job offer without a labour market test, or will be allowed to participate without any requirement for a work permit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Fine Gael believes that the Irish labour market should not be opened to Bulgarian and Romanian nationals on 1 January next.  In advance of the accession of the two countries, the Government should announce details of the transitional arrangements to be put in place for Bulgarian and Romanian citizens and restrict their access to the Irish labour market.  Will the Minister elaborate on the discussions he has had with the UK authorities?  Has he consulted any other EU member states?  What impact will their decisions have on the decision that will be taken here?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>We are examining this issue in the context of what has happened in recent years.  That Ireland has, since May 2004, experienced the most rapid inward migration of any of the 25 EU member states will inform our deliberations on the matter.  We undertook in the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, to consult the social partners.  The Secretary General of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has written to ICTU and IBEC in fulfilment of that commitment and he is awaiting a response from those organisations.  We have been in contact at official level with the UK authorities, who are actively considering this issue.  We are assessing a number of issues.  We are taking a conservative approach not only to our assessment of Ireland&rsquo;s current labour market situation but also to our analysis of the key challenge of integration.  We regard social integration as a fundamental priority objective.  In light of the significant inward migration we have experienced, all sectors of society, including all Departments and State agencies, are charged with ensuring that they provide for the fullest and most effective degree of integration.  Training and education are related issues which are critical to integration.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that approximately 260,000 personal public service numbers have been issued since May 2004.  It is estimated that approximately 177,000 people to whom those numbers were issued have taken up employment.  Some of the personal public service numbers were issued to students, people on short-term and seasonal contracts and people with more established forms of employment.  The Central Statistics Office estimates that approximately 80,000 nationals or citizens of accession states are currently in employment in Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister repeat that?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="454"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Some 80,000 people from the accession states are currently working here, according to CSO estimates.  While the capture of data relating to people coming here is quite good, as a result of the issuing of PPS numbers, some work remains to be done to create a more accurate database of information about people on the way out.  Ireland is now the fourth most favoured destination for Polish citizens, after the United States, the UK and Germany.  It is obvious that there are high levels of unemployment in Poland.</P>
        <P>Some 1,840 work permits were issued to Romanian nationals in 2005.  Just 250 of those work permits were new permits.  Some 570 work permits were issued to Bulgarian nationals in 2005, of which 50 were new permits.  The unemployment rate in Romania is 17% and the unemployment rate in Bulgaria is 11%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is probably aware of the Small Firms Association&rsquo;s recent statement, with which Fine Gael is in agreement.  The association argued that we need to consider the establishment of a State-subsidised English language instruction course to assist people who have come to this country to work but are not accustomed to the English language.  Difficulties in understanding English seem to represent a significant barrier to employment in this country at present.  We are all aware, having heard advertisements on local radio, for example, that English is now a critical requirement.  Many foreign nationals are availing of VEC English language classes which are normally offered to people with literacy difficulties.  Does the Government plan to put in place a scheme, part-funded by employers and the State, whereby English language courses would be offered to people coming to this country to help them to develop basic communication skills?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I was somewhat surprised by the recent development referred to by the Deputy.  We need to be careful about language.  The number of people in employment increased by 88,000 in 2005, which does not suggest that substantial barriers are preventing people from getting employment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>A lack of English is a significant barrier to social integration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am talking about barriers to employment.  There was a need to facilitate integration and English language training is part of that.  We fund a variety of employer and industry-led initiatives through the in-company training programme, the Skillsnet programme and the Accel programme.  The various sectors may make proposals relating to, perhaps, the Skillsnet issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>

In terms of small and medium enterprises, SMEs, there are issues relating to economies of scale and capacity.  A variety of schemes is available to companies if they wish to work with us.  We will be responsive, as will F&Aacute;S.</P>

        <asker>Mr. Quinn</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest> if he will report on the status of the proposed services directive; if this matter has been raised at a European Council of Ministers meeting since the European Parliament vote earlier in 2006; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[32166/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Subsequent to the European Parliament&rsquo;s vote last February, the Competitiveness Council adopted a Common Position on the draft directive on services in the Internal Market at its meeting on 24 July.  The text was adopted as an A item at the council with only two member states abstaining.  It was supported by Ireland.  This followed intensive discussions on the proposal at the Competitiveness Council on 29 May at which political agreement was reached. </P>
        <P>The Common Position was substantially based on the compromise text that was brokered by the European Parliament on 16 February 2006 and carried through in the amended Commission proposal of 4 April.  The Commission&rsquo;s amended proposal was supported by Ireland although we secured some technical amendments in areas of concern to us.</P>
        <P>Ireland would have preferred a more ambitious proposal, in particular the inclusion of temporary employment agencies in the scope of the proposal.  There are about 90 agencies involved in this important sector in Ireland with an annual turnover of &euro;1.3 billion.  There is a worldwide shortage of skilled people in the aviation industry as well as in the medical, financial and IT industries and the recruitment industry finds them.</P>
        <P>Ireland is the largest provider of personnel to the aviation industry worldwide but much of the business is done outside the EU because of barriers to trade within it.  This effectively means that skilled personnel that the EU needs to improve its competitiveness are frequently placed in third countries rather than the EU because of the difficulties the recruitment industry has in operating in the Internal Market.</P>
        <P>Total employment in the Irish services sector is approximately 1.3 million, compared with 912,000 in 1997.  Forf&aacute;s estimated that the original Commission proposal would have benefited Ireland to the tune of about &euro;400 million annually.  The indications are that the amended proposal would be worth about half that to Ireland.  The enterprise policy group report, the O&rsquo;Driscoll report, iden<Col N="456"/>tified the services sector as having significant potential for development in a freed-up Internal Market.  While traditional industries have been under pressure it should be noted that in the last five or six years 440,000 jobs have been created in the services sector and 150,000 in high end manufacturing.  These figures come from Forf&aacute;s following research on manufacturing and internationally traded services.</P>
        <P>The current status of the draft directive is that it is undergoing a Second Reading in the European Parliament.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland is becoming a service economy, rather than a manufacturing or primary produce economy.  What steps are the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the agencies under that Department taking to alert small and medium sized Irish companies to the potential benefits of utilising the provisions of the draft directive?  This directive is now essentially a done deal and I am told it will be completed by the end of this year.  Will the Minister indicate when it is proposed to come into effect?  Now that we know the shape of the directive, what communication has been given to the Irish services sector to maximise the potential that it will have?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Our major thrust in terms of developing enterprise in indigenous enterprise and SMEs has been to develop the services side of the equation, while supporting high end manufacturing underpinned by indigenous research and development within Irish manufacturing companies.  There is a significant drive, on the services side, to inform companies of the opportunities worldwide, not just in the European market.  We have made rapid progress and Ireland&rsquo;s share of worldwide services has increased to approximately 2.2% from about 0.5% in 1999.  </P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland is promoting investment and development in the services sector in the client companies with which it deals.  At a micro level the work of the Small Business Forum will inform some of the work of the county and city enterprise boards in terms of developing innovation.  Some reports indicate that we are lacking productivity and competitiveness in the domestic services sector.  We will try to achieve more innovation in this area through the implementation of aspects of the Small Business Forum&rsquo;s recommendations.</P>
        <P>On the European Internal Market, we are not holding our breath in terms of the impact of the new services directive.  We think it is a fairly neutered measure at best and its impact will not be fundamental.  We will seek to exploit opportunities in the Internal Market.  In the region of &euro;200 million could be added, which is significant for SMEs, but our assessment is that it may not represent the Holy Grail that might have been <Col N="457"/>originally suggested.  Commissioner McCreevy felt it was important to implement a services directive to begin the journey to a more liberalised EU market.  We have supported this outlook and will continue to provide supports in the form of trade missions, soft supports, mentoring supports and research and development supports to companies engaged in exploiting services markets worldwide.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I am surprised at the Minister&rsquo;s dismissal of the potential of the services directive beyond the &euro;200 million mentioned, which is not a lot of money at one level.  He mentioned that the focus was on the client companies of Enterprise Ireland, rather than those under the county enterprise boards which would be very small in terms of reaching beyond the county, let alone the country.</P>
        <P>I am more concerned now, given the tone of the Minister&rsquo;s reply, than I was when I tabled this question.  I sense that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is receiving advice that the services directive&rsquo;s potential has been neutered as far as Ireland is concerned and that it should not register high on the Minister&rsquo;s list of priorities.  It seems that the suggestion is that a globalised market for Irish services emanating from this country is as attractive as the EU market, if not more so.  Is this a fair interpretation of the Minister&rsquo;s viewpoint?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is fair with the exception of the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion that the services directive does not constitute a high priority.  The development of services will always be a high priority as the employment return is huge and it is the direction in which most developed countries are headed.  The Deputy is correct that the advice to me is that the services directive is not a huge step forward and this is also my assessment of it.  I welcome the opportunity to approach this issue in a calm manner as I felt the debate got out of hand last year. </P>
        <P>Ireland needs an informed debate on the positive and negative aspects of the liberalisation of world trade and the EU market.  This must include discussion of the protection of fundamental labour laws and workers&rsquo; rights while at the same time endeavouring to pave the way for our services companies.  The issue must be examined from a macro point of view with consideration given to where the economy has gone in the past eight years.</P>
        <P>Some of the barriers in Europe facing recruitment agencies are very real in terms of how some countries impose a variety of &mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Are these barriers in place at the moment or will they arise after the implementation of the services directive?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It remains to be seen whether the directive will break these barriers.  Some coun<Col N="458"/>tries impose conditions of establishment on Irish companies that would be anxious to establish bases in other EU countries and require them to deposit substantial sums of money.  I am sure those companies would be willing to speak to the Deputy and other Members.  They have found the current position quite prohibitive and regard it as a barrier to establishing in other EU countries.  I am willing to work as enthusiastically and proactively as I can to honour the spirit of the directive but it remains to be seen whether it will realise its potential.</P>

        <asker>Mr. Morgan</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest> his plans to bring corporate manslaughter legislation, based on the proposal made by the Law Reform Commission, before the Houses of the Oireachtas in view of the fact that there were 73 workplace fatalities in 2005 and 42 to date in 2006. </Quest>
        <QRef>[32165/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of corporate manslaughter was considered while drafting the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Bill, which ultimately became the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.  The Attorney General was of the opinion that there were much broader issues to be considered than those of safety, health and welfare at work.  Legislating in the relatively confined area of occupational safety and health would have omitted other sectors in which corporate manslaughter could be committed.  It was therefore decided it was inappropriate to deal with the issue of corporate killing in legislation pertaining to occupational safety, health and welfare and the regulation thereof.</P>
        <P>The Law Reform Commission accepted the view of the Office of the Attorney General that the scope of the 2005 Act was appropriately narrower than the scope of the legislation it recommended to deal with the proposed offence.  The commission also recommended that there should be individual statutory liability for managers who are culpable in the causation of death.  Section 80 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 provides for directors, managers and other similar officers of an undertaking to be prosecuted before the courts for an offence that is attributable to connivance or neglect on their part.</P>
        <P>The matter of consideration of the wider implementation of the recommendations in the report of the Law Reform Commission is one for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the context of his responsibility for the criminal law system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State consider a Bill that includes the Law Reform Com<Col N="459"/>mission&rsquo;s wording on corporate manslaughter?  Does he object to its wording or to the concept of introducing legislation to deal with corporate manslaughter?</P>
        <P>Is the Minister of State aware that 73 people died in the workplace last year and that 42 died in the workplace so far this year?  There were only 40 prosecutions and only 94% of cases were successful, amounting to fines totalling &euro;463,000 and to an average fine per prosecution of approximately &euro;10,000.  Does the Minister not accept that a wayward captain of industry or operator would consider a cost-benefit analysis in which he would weight the cost of replacing a faulty machine worth in excess of &euro;100,000, for example, against the likely fine of &euro;10,000 which would be awarded against him if he were caught?  Such a fine is a pittance in comparison with the value of some of the operations in which workers lost their lives last year.  In light of this, is it not extremely important that we move quickly to ensure a corporate manslaughter provision within the framework legislation of the State?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Morgan is correct regarding the fines this year.  However, there have been much greater fines, including those issued last year.  A fine in the order of &euro;500,000 was issued in one case.</P>
        <P>It is important to remember that the provisions of section 80 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 implements the second recommendation in the report of the Law Reform Commission.  It covers the Deputy&rsquo;s requirements adequately in the context of safety, health and welfare at work.  The Law Reform Commission accepts that the much wider responsibility pertaining to corporate manslaughter falls within the remit of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>We had a lengthy discussion on this subject, particularly during Committee Stage of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Bill 2005.  Has the Minister of State had any contact with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in this regard?  Does he regard this as part of his role in strengthening the legislation, which clearly needs to be strengthened given the 42 deaths that have occurred in the workplace this year?  Will such interdepartmental contact, if initiated, deal with corporate manslaughter legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 80 of the 2005 Act deals more than adequately with what would be required in the context of safety, health and welfare at work.  When the debate on the legislation took place in the House, the consultation paper of the Law Reform Commission was all that had been published.  The legislation came into effect in September of last year whereas the report was not published until October.  It is accepted that <Col N="460"/>section 80 deals with the second major recommendation of the commission and that it is the only element relevant to my Department in terms of safety, health and welfare at work.  The other matters that arise are clearly the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  He is clearly aware of this and no doubt we will have ideas on how progress can be made.</P>

        <Quest> further to Question No. 949 of 27 September 2006, the reason grant aid has not been returned to his Department; the steps being taken to recoup these funds; the further reason they have not been recovered to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This issue is a day-to-day operational matter for Enterprise Ireland and neither I, as Minister, nor my Department has any function in respect thereof.  Enterprise Ireland has informed me that the issue relates to a fire that took place at a plant in Rooskey, County Roscommon, in May 2002.  As a result of the fire, slaughtering and boning activities in the plant were terminated.  A cannery operation survived and continues to employ more than 80 people.</P>
        <P>The plant in Roosky received grant assistance from Enterprise Ireland.  Consistent with the agency&rsquo;s grant liability policy, contingencies exist for a limited period after payment.  In this case, most of the contingency period has expired.</P>
        <P>I understand that discussions between Enterprise Ireland and the company on any outstanding liability are continuing and that the company has not returned any grant aid to the agency to date.  I am advised that progress is being made in the negotiations, which involve complex legal issues, and that they are expected to conclude in the near future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I tabled this question because in 2003 a sudden and inexplicable decision was made by Glanbia, which was then proceeding with the development in Roosky, to do a U-turn and invest instead in Edenderry and Roscrea.  Concern was expressed at the time that influence was used to transfer the operation from Roosky.  I raised this issue with the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, the current Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, who made a commitment to a certain group that no influence would be used and that funding would not be used to transfer jobs from Roosky to Edenderry.</P>
        <P>The Minister and his predecessor said the Government was examining the position on the recoupment of money in the context of the cannery operation and other developments at the Roosky site.  In light of this, why is the Department saying it is now considering the issue not in the context of the cannery and the development <Col N="461"/>of that site but in the context of the developments in Edenderry and Roscrea, which were not supposed to be grant-aided and for which no grant aid has been furnished to date because of the transfer of jobs from Roosky thereto?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department is not doing that or saying anything about it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should look at his reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The agencies involved are statutory bodies and my Department is not involved.</P>

	<P>They are accountable to the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Enterprise Ireland is the agency involved and my Department does not get involved in the day-to-day administration of grants or the return thereof.  This is fundamentally a matter for the agency.  The House has delegated this authority to it and the other industrial development agencies.  We cannot delegate authority to the agencies while at the same time running their day-to-day operations.  I do not mean that in a derogatory way but we frequently delegate authority and then try to haul it back when an issue of concern arises relating to a constituency or a particular issue.  That said, I accept the Deputy&rsquo;s genuine commitment to and interest in securing further employment at the site in Roosky.  I understand Enterprise Ireland is also very keen to add to the development in Roosky and some of the negotiations will take on board whatever can potentially be added to the site.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>In previous replies reference was made to the significant progress on the pork development side, albeit not at the Roosky site but in Edenderry and Roscrea.  It was stated that significant investment was made by the company concerned to increase employment in the latter locations.  Neither the Deputy nor Enterprise Ireland can ignore this, bearing in mind that the Deputy&rsquo;s key focus is on the Roosky site.  The situation in that regard is somewhat complex.  There are issues which are somewhat fluid at the moment and the agency has assured me it is actively considering a range of options.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>The reality is that there is a net loss of 150 jobs between the three sites, so jobs have not been created.  Is it not the case that the Minister is answerable to the House for the actions of Enterprise Ireland and that &euro;3.4 million has been handed over through his Department by the agency to Glanbia and its predecessors at the Roosky site?  Do we not need to get answers as to why none of that money has been handed over to date, and what will be done with it as regards the development of the site in Roosky?  Are there specific plans on the table to develop that pro<Col N="462"/>ject?  There is some concern the money has been transferred to the amalgamation and the protection of the jobs in Edenderry and Roscrea is to the detriment of Roosky and that should not be used for that purpose. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has the wrong take on this.  We should never get to the stage of saying we are giving money to one side to the detriment of another.  Grant money is not allocated on that basis.  Enterprise Ireland or any agency would wisely work with all of the food companies in Ireland to add as much value as possible, within the jurisdiction.  It will continually encourage companies to do added value projects within their portfolios and supports that.  It would be wrong to suggest that because something happened in one side nothing should happen in any other.  It does not mean&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;-a transfer of one to the other.  It should not have to mean that.  I am not at liberty to discuss ongoing fluid discussions that are under way between a number of interested parties as regards the Roosky site. </P>

	<P>Are there discussions under way?  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is all I can say at this stage.  We are very well aware of the need.  All Members of the House, particularly Deputies in the constituency such as Deputy Finneran and Deputy Naughten, have raised this issue on an ongoing basis and are very keen to see development here.  The fundamental point, however, is that whereas I am accountable for Enterprise Ireland, a global sum is allocated to the agency and the Department does not get involved in second guessing or validating every grant allocation it makes to client companies.  We make inquiries following representations from Deputies, but we do not second guess every individual proposal.  There are very good reasons why we do not and why the Oireachtas does not either &mdash; and why the Oireachtas has given the agency specific powers to discharge.  There is a variety of other ways, through the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, the Committee of Public Accounts and so on, to pursue these issues as well.  Enterprise Ireland is endeavouring a developmental approach to this issue to see what may done to create more jobs in the area.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest> if there is an indication that the strong growth in company registrations indicated for the first half of 2006 is part of a trend of false contracting, whereby employees are being required to register as companies and be <Col N="463"/>employed as contractors in order for their employer to avoid many regulations, costs and duties involved in employing these people; the actions the Government is taking to end the practice of false contracting; if a survey or analysis has been undertaken by a Department or agency to investigate this practice; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[32167/06] </QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern that individuals, whose status based on the application of the standard criteria may be more appropriate to that of an employee, may seek to register as self-employed in order to abdicate and avoid their rights and obligations under employment rights legislation.  There are also, of course, tax and PRSI implications but these are matters for the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs respectively. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Irish employment rights law makes a distinction between a contract of service, which applies to an employer-employee relationship, and a contract for service that applies in the case of an independent subcontractor.  In effect, employment rights legislation does not apply to independent subcontractors with the exception of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and the Equality Act 1998.  In most cases it will be clear whether an individual is employed or self-employed.  However, the individual&rsquo;s employment status may not be clear in all cases.</P>
        <P>Where there is doubt in relation to the employment status of an individual the relevant Departments and agencies will have regard to the code of practice for determining the employment or self-employment status of individuals.  This code was drawn up and agreed in 2001 by the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Irish Business and Employers Federation.  A number of criteria are set out in the code for determining whether an individual is an employee or self-employed.  These include whether the person is under the control or direction of another, owns his or her own business, supplies labour only, receives a fixed wage, is exposed to financial risk, assumes responsibility for investment and management, supplies materials for the job, can subcontract the work, works set hours or a given number of hours per week, month etc.</P>
        <P>The criteria set out in the code are applied by this Department in making a determination in cases where an individual claims he or she is self-employed rather than an employee and, therefore, not responsible for complying with certain employment rights legislation.  In the case of difficulties in deciding on the appropriate status of an individual or group, the Revenue Commissioners or the scope section of the Department of Social and Family Affairs may, following consideration <Col N="464"/>of all the relevant facts, issue a written decision as to the status in a particular case.  Such a decision is generally accepted by other Departments and agencies provided all relevant facts were given at the time, the correct legal principles have been applied and the circumstances remain the same.  However, consensus on employment status may not be possible in all cases given the differences between the legislation across the employment rights, taxation and social welfare areas and the differing responsibilities and focuses of the enforcement agencies.</P>
        <P>A major package of measures has been agreed by the parties to Towards 2016, the new social partnership agreement, to provide for enhanced public confidence in the system of compliance.  This new compliance model seeks, among other matters, to maximise the effectiveness of the substantially increased compliance effort.  New legislation will be published next year to provide for enhanced employment rights measures including the establishment of the office of director for employment rights compliance.  The application of employment rights legislation to employees and the self-employed will be examined in the context of drawing up that legislation.  The proposed legislation will also empower the labour inspectorate to join with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners to work together in joint investigation units.  Such units will have a particular focus on the employment status of workers.</P>
        <P>Finally, I note the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, as part of its recently launched construction industry project, will be reviewing the tax status of contractors and, in particular, whether individuals currently designated as self-employed should be regarded as employees and subject to PAYE and PRSI.  I welcome this initiative.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s comprehensive reply, but I am somewhat concerned about the complacency at the top of his response, where it is suggested these are matters for the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners.  Yet he goes on to say that in Towards 2016, the social partners acting in a joined up way have recognised there is a need for co-operation between those two other actors as well as his own Department.  Would he not recognise that given the increase in enhanced building activity and the shortage of available labour, along with anecdotal comments about the displacement of Irish workers by foreign nationals, that this abuse is continuing if not intensifying?  The social partners have, in effect, recognised that a problem exists, having regard to the measures he has just outlined.  In advance of the legislation next year, for which he probably will not have responsibility when he is on this side of the House, will the Minister of State initiate now on an interim basis exactly the type of co-<Col N="465"/>operation that will be put on a statutory basis in 18 months time, since the problem is immediate? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Quinn may have misunderstood the distinction I drew between the roles of the various Departments.  The Office of the Revenue Commissioners has responsibility for taxation matters as the Department of Social and Family Affairs has for PRSI matters.  It is necessary in these instances to be clear as to who precisely has which responsibilities.  In previous discussions in the House I indicated the intention of the Department to introduce legislation to empower the particular agencies and Department to co-operate in joint investigation units, which ultimately is the only manner in which this may successfully be implemented.  All the evidence suggests that this is the case. </P>
        <P>Of course, the Deputy is correct that the construction industry is particularly successful currently and is enjoying a period of growth, which undoubtedly will not continue if he is correct in his projection as regards the outcome of the general election.  Nevertheless, there are issues here which are being dealt with in the most constructive manner possible.  The Government is fully aware of the need to change the compliance model and intends to do that in conjunction with the social partners, in the context of Towards 2016.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>May I take it that my request for co-operation on an interim basis in advance of the legislation is not being accepted by the Minister of State? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The strong advice we have received is that legislation is required in order for the joint investigation units to successfully prosecute in cases that are brought to their attention.  It would be folly for the Department to embark on attempted prosecutions in circumstances where the legislative base was not sufficiently strong enough to sustain them in the courts.</P>

        <Quest> when the IDA industrial park on the Sligo Road, Ballina, will begin operations as an industrial park, bringing much needed employment to the Ballina town and region; his views on whether infrastructure investment is urgently needed to attract industry to this employment blackspot; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[32085/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>State support for enterprise and job creation is channelled through the industrial development agencies.  IDA Ireland has statutory <Col N="466"/>responsibility for marketing Ireland, including individual areas and towns such as north Mayo and Ballina, for overseas investment.  Enterprise Ireland has responsibility for the promotion of indigenous industry, while county enterprise boards concentrate on the micro sector.  While I may give general policy directives to the agencies under the Industrial Development Acts, I am precluded from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.</P>
        <P>The management of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s property portfolio is a day-to-day operational matter for the agency and not a matter in which I or my Department have a statutory function.  IDA Ireland has assured me it is actively promoting both Ballina and the north Mayo area generally for new foreign investment.  Since January 2003, there have been five first-time site visits to Ballina.  In addition, the agency is also working with its existing base of overseas companies to encourage them to grow and expand and to further enhance the attractiveness of the county for new investment.  The agency is developing new world class business and technology parks in a number of towns throughout Mayo.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland informs me that it has had extensive discussions with Mayo County Council regarding the acquisition of the approximately 27 acre site in local authority ownership on the Sligo Road in Ballina.  The agency has completed site investigation works and has obtained planning permission for site development works to ensure that these lands are suitable for industrial purposes, prior to acquisition.  I understand that IDA Ireland is currently awaiting contract documentation and a copy of unburdened title from Mayo County Council.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland recognises the need to provide high value employment opportunities in Mayo, including Ballina, which provide sustainable long-term jobs.  The agency is working with local groups, utility providers, F&Aacute;S and other agencies to ensure that Ballina and Mayo secure the appropriate infrastructure to enable the existing companies to grow and develop and to make the area sufficiently attractive for new projects.  IDA Ireland has been deeply involved with local partners in the development of regional planning guidelines.  I am satisfied that the strategies being pursued by the development agencies, together with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to regional development, will continue to bear fruit in terms of the creation of sustainable employment for the people of Ballina and Mayo generally.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Unfortunately, it is the same reply I got from the Minister in March.  He told me then that the county council was talking to the IDA about this site.  It is a sham and a travesty.  I do not know what the Minister has been doing, but he has done nothing since I questioned him on this issue <Col N="467"/>in March.  We get the same old answers all the time.</P>
        <P>I will tell the Minister what I told him before.  At 11%, the unemployment rate in Ballina is twice the national average.  A net total of 1,000 jobs have been lost to Ballina in the past nine years.  There are more people on the live register in Ballina than in the whole county of Roscommon.  It is an unemployment blackspot and what the Minister is proposing is disgraceful.</P>
        <P>The Minister told us there have been five site visits since 2003.  Where exactly did those people visit?  There is no industrial or technology park in Ballina.  This saga has been going on for seven years.  The Minister had better get his finger out and do whatever he must to sort this out.  He is not doing his job for Ballina or north Mayo.  It is an utter disgrace.</P>
        <P>There are no road projects for Ballina to be found on the NRA website.  The N26, incorporating the Ballina-Bohola bypass, should be developed.  The Minister should tell the NRA that he wants a road into Ballina.  How can industry access Ballina without a proper road?  We do not have an industrial site.  We need one.  The IDA told me in no uncertain terms that companies want to locate where roads, railway and broadband infrastructure exists.  They want to locate in industrial and technology parks.  Where are those in Ballina?  What is the Minister doing about this aspect?  There is a &euro;3.5 billion under-spend in the national development plan.  We need balanced regional development.  How can north Mayo be competitive without essential infrastructure?  I want the Minister to give me answers and not the same old stuff again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I will give the Deputy answers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I want straight answers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2002, there were 1,976 people on the live register in Ballina.  In August 2006, there were 1,448 on the register.  In other words, 528 more people were unemployed in Ballina in 2002 than there are today.  I respectfully suggest that calling towns like Ballina unemployment blackspots does nothing to enhance the attractiveness of the town for inward investment.  It does not create the right profile or image for the town.  We need to deal in facts, and those are available in the live register and the quarterly household surveys.  They show that the unemployment rate in Ballina has decreased significantly since 2002.</P>
        <P>I am not on the county council.  I did not select the site.  I am not responsible for the complex legal difficulties that have surrounded the site.  Far too often the Deputy&rsquo;s reflex action is to blame the Government and the IDA.  I have discussed the matter with the IDA and have asked it to make a call, with the county council, as to whether it should engage or look at alternatives.  My understanding is the county council selected <Col N="468"/>this site and the IDA agreed, in good faith, to try to develop the site as an industrial park to attract jobs.  It is not good enough for people to come here and attack the Minister of the day for decisions that were taken collectively at local level many years ago.  However, there is a fundamental issue with the site that potentially involves significant litigation.  I have asked the IDA to consult with the county council and examine all the options for the provision of top class industrial park facilities for Ballina.</P>
        <P>The Deputy has been active in opposing any development of the Corrib gas field.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not so sure that the activities the Deputy has been engaged in sends out a wonderful signal to external investors who wish to invest in Mayo.  Far from trying to arrive at a reasonable solution, the quality of the engagement by the Deputy and others on this issue actually sends out a negative signal in terms of trying to attract investment.  We should always endeavour to exploit natural resources when they become available, particularly as this country has not had good experience of discovering such hydro-carbon resources &mdash; we have only had one before this.  As Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I respectfully put it to the Deputy that I am conscious of the signals the unfolding of this saga is giving externally. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is talking about an abysmal increase in employment.  The actual job loss stands at 1,394, meaning that almost 1,000 jobs net have been lost.  No matter what kind of spin the Minister puts on this, he cannot deny this net loss of 1,000 jobs to Ballina over the past nine years.  That is unsustainable.  Whether he wants to believe it or not, the Minister is responsible and must do something.  He has been doing nothing.  It is not enough for him to wash his hands and say that the county council is dealing with it.  The Minister should go down there and find a site.  I do not know where he has been bringing those industrialists to because there is no place for them to go.</P>
        <P>I am not, and never have been, against the Corrib gas field.  What I am against is the fact that Mayo is getting nothing for it.  What the country is getting from this field is abysmal.  A social service in a village would provide as many long-term jobs as the Corrib gas field.  I would love to see the gas brought ashore in a way that would mean something to the people of Mayo.  The people need that.</P>
        <P>The N26 into Ballina is disgraceful.  The N5 is disgraceful.  The road to Belmullet that one must use to reach Bellanaboy and the gas field is a dirt track.  The best road down there is the haulage road between two bogs that the Government built for Shell; it is several kilometres long.  If the <Col N="469"/>people were getting the same consideration as Shell, we would have a different country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I have always been in favour of the gas field.  I would like to see it brought ashore in a way that will benefit someone other than Shell.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not think the picketing of Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s constituency office suggested a positive outlook.</P>
        <P>The IDA will continue to market Ballina.  There are other options if a particular site is not available.  There are many examples of foreign direct investments locating either in private sector developments or in greenfield sites.</P>

        <QRef>[31934/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The manufacturing sector &mdash; both indigenous and foreign-owned &mdash; has been a key component of the economy over the past two decades and it will continue to be a significant contributor to exports, employment and economic growth in the future.  Home based enterprises play a significant part in the sector, and the Government is encouraging the development of that element of the economy. </P>
        <P>Continuing the economic success of recent years will require indigenous enterprises to overcome complex new challenges and harness a range of new opportunities.  Among those challenges are the need for improved management skills, the need to develop international marketing and sales capabilities, the need to exploit state of the art technology and business processes, and the need to forge strategic alliances and partnerships.</P>
        <P>Enterprise policy is being actively refocused towards creating conditions that will make possible a sustained shift to higher skilled, knowledge-intensive activities and in which advanced manufacturing expertise will be an important contributor to growth and employment.  To that end, in 2005, Enterprise Ireland launched Transforming Irish Industry, its strategy aimed at strengthening indigenous industry. The strategy runs from 2005 to 2008 and Enterprise Ireland <Col N="470"/>will be soon evaluating its impact as it formulates strategy for the period 2008-12.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s effort in this regard will be underpinned by the supports provided by the county and city enterprise boards.  The role of the CEBs in helping to generate a strong culture of entrepreneurship and the creation of new businesses is important in its own right as a generator of wealth and employment at local level, but its role in the development of the seed corn from which high growth indigenous enterprises can emerge is also critical.</P>
        <P>In 2005, I established the Small Business Forum.  The objectives of the forum were to examine the barriers inhibiting small businesses, that is, those with less than 50 employees, identify how those could be addressed and outline measures to assist those businesses to grow and flourish.  The forum delivered its findings in April of this year, making recommendations in the areas of reducing the burden of regulation and local authority charges; broadening access to finance; enhancing management capability; stimulating innovation; and driving the adoption of ICT.</P>
        <P>To assist industry maintain competitiveness and increase productivity, the economic development agencies are working on an ongoing basis to promote the adoption of new technology and best practice at company level.  The agencies provide mentoring and developmental supports to enhance management capabilities and build critical workforce skills in client companies; support the creation and implementation of strategies for market entry, development and growth; and provide strong supports for innovation and research and development.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s strategy is to maximise export sales through the utilisation of applied research, technology and innovation while ensuring economic development is achieved in a regionally balanced fashion.  This is reflected in changes to tax rules to encourage more research and development activity to take place here, particularly in the area of high value added and customer driven innovation.</P>
        <P>The recently concluded social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, also acknowledges the importance of the manufacturing sector with an agreement to establish a high-level manufacturing group to review the challenges facing the manufacturing sector and identify further measures to meet these challenges.  Officials in my Department are currently working on the establishment of this group and I hope to be in a position to make an announcement on the make up of the high-level group very soon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it not obvious to the Minister that we are haemorrhaging jobs because this economy is now an extremely costly one in which to do business?  The report issued yesterday by the National Competitiveness Council makes grim reading in terms of the issues regarding the <Col N="471"/>future development of the economy.  It reveals that the Government has made little progress in addressing spiralling business costs in recent years and that it will lead to a dramatic collapse in our export market unless that problem is addressed.</P>
        <P>The Minister said the Small Business Forum highlighted a number of issues, one of which concerned regulation.  Very little has been done to address that issue.  The other one concerns local authority charges.  Local authority charges have consistently increased during the term of this Government.  In fact, since 2002, the Government has introduced over 40 increased stealth taxes.  What assurance can the Minister give the House that he will prevent his colleagues from increasing those stealth charges or introducing new indirect taxes?  What practical steps does he intend to take now to address the issues regarding regulation, not some time in the future?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy referred to haemorrhaging jobs.  We created 88,000 jobs last year.  We are on course to do something similar this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>We lost 32,000 manufacturing jobs in the past six years.  If the Minister wants to use facts, that is a fact.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not interrupt the Deputy.  I have already pointed out that we did a useful exercise this year when I commissioned Forf&aacute;s to do an analysis of employment patterns and trends in both manufacturing and traded services in the past five to six years.  The result of that analysis was that approximately 150,000 jobs were created in high-end manufacturing and approximately 440 in services.  </P>
        <P>I agree there has been a net loss in manufacturing but that is not unusual in developing economies.  It is not unusual across the OECD where there has been a decline in terms of manufacturing jobs but an increase in services.  Even though there has been a decline in manufacturing jobs, there has been an increase in productivity, value added and production.  The production and value added in manufacturing continues to grow, which is a good story for Ireland.  We need to get across that message.  We should not use rhetoric that suggests manufacturing is in terminal decline; it is not.  The nature of manufacturing is changing.  That is the key issue.</P>
        <P>Two factors will lead to unemployment in manufacturing.  One is the application of technology to production and manufacturing processes, which by definition will have fewer people utilising technology, automation and so on to produce a greater number of goods.  The positive aspect about Ireland is that we are developing world class capability in innovation in manufacturing.  Dell Computers will say its Limerick plant is the world leader in terms of innovation in <Col N="472"/>manufacturing.  The people there are the people they use across the globe for the pioneering work they have done at that plant.  I was in PepsiCo in Carrigaline, Cork, recently.  That is a good example of high-end manufacturing at its best.  That plant is a reference site worldwide for Pepsi in terms of quality.  The winning of the Amgen contract and the Wyeth plant in Grange Castle are other examples that we are doing well.</P>
        <P>There has been an increase in employment in manufacturing in pharmaceuticals, biopharma and medical devices.  We have experienced a decline in textiles, office machinery and equipment, electrical machinery and computers, pulp paper and recorded media &mdash; radio, television and communication equipment.  Those five sectors have experienced the largest number of job losses in the past five years but the trends are very similar to those in developed economies across the OECD.  That is the reason we are driving the research and development agenda, both for indigenous enterprise and foreign direct investment.  The number of research and development projects we won in the past two years has been significant, which ultimately will embed those companies in Ireland for the long haul, particularly in key areas such as medical devices, pharmaceuticals and biopharma.  If we are in at the drug discovery level or the development of new devices, the opportunity to manufacture those given regulatory regimes is greatly enhanced.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the House to take an informed view about what is happening in manufacturing.  I am not saying there are no cost pressures or challenges because they exist.  I have appealed to local authorities in that regard because many of them have the facility to levy development charges.  They should use caution in the manner in which they levy charges, particularly on indigenous enterprise and foreign direct investment.  There was a time in Ireland when county councils were queuing up to get inward investment into their counties and cities.  They must take that on board when they are setting their commercial rate and development levies on industrial development.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should talk to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in that regard.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Minister that there is high-end manufacturing here but the majority of that, and the examples the Minister gave, are in the foreign direct investment coming to this country.  We must develop our indigenous companies.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke about research and development.  I will give the Minister one figure regarding this country&rsquo;s research and development capacity.  We are a primary producer.  We are not like the majority of other European countries.  We export the vast majority of our food, yet 4% of the Government&rsquo;s total research and development budget has consistently gone <Col N="473"/>towards that area over the past few years.  It is only now, nine years into the term of this Government, that the penny is dropping in that regard.  Rather than talk around the issue, what will the Minister do in practical terms to deal with the issues of regulation, the need for investment in research and development and the stealth charges his Government has introduced?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>On indigenous manufacturing, 87% of manufacturing units in Ireland are Irish-owned.  Approximately 60% of those employ fewer than 20 people.  The indigenous sector would be characterised by a large number of smaller firms.  Those enterprises employ approximately 113,000 people, which is a significant number in indigenous manufacturing.  We are keen to support that, as is Enterprise Ireland through its new productivity grant and research and development support.  Enterprise Ireland has been very supportive of the food industry.  I have presided over a number of initiatives with Enterprise Ireland involving Glanbia, Dairygold, Kepak and Cuisine de France.  All have invested substantially in research and development to produce value added products.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The health enhancing food sector offers major potential for the Irish food industry.  The research and development strategy, which I co-ordinated in the Cabinet sub-committee on science and technology, identified the agricultural and food agribusiness as key sectors for research and development.  There has been much research and development in that sector through agencies such as Teagasc which worked with a variety of universities on centres for science, engineering and technology under Science Foundation Ireland.  The food industry is a key indigenous industry that can add higher value jobs.  My Department will work with the industry to make that a reality.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The labour inspectorate undertook an investigation of allegations made in this House on 8 February 2005 regarding compliance by Gama Construction Ireland Limited with certain employment rights provisions.</P>
        <P>A report on the investigation was prepared and circulated to relevant parties, including Gama Construction Ireland Limited.  The outcome of an interlocutory hearing on a judicial review brought subsequently by Gama Construction Ireland Lim<Col N="474"/>ited with regard to the investigation and inspector&rsquo;s report was that the Department was restrained from publishing the inspector&rsquo;s report but permitted to forward the document to relevant prosecutorial bodies.  Accordingly, a copy of the inspector&rsquo;s report was sent to the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Revenue Commissioners, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Competition Authority, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Garda Commissioner.</P>
        <P>The inspector&rsquo;s report was quashed in the judgment on 23 June 2005 that followed the full High Court hearing of the case.  That decision is being appealed to the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court may be in a position to hear this case early next year.  I am unable to elaborate any further on the content of the inspector&rsquo;s report or offer any observations on the actions, including prosecutions, that the prosecutorial bodies mentioned above may be considering.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our main concern was to ensure that all Turkish workers would have access to the money that had been transferred to their bank accounts in Finansbank in Amsterdam.  In this regard, following meetings with senior management from Gama International and Gama Construction Ireland Limited, and contacts with the president of Finansbank, SIPTU and Deputy Joe Higgins, I am satisfied that a substantial number of Turkish workers who were in Ireland around last April received value for the funds that had been transferred to their personal bank accounts in Finansbank.  The Department has tried but ultimately failed to verify whether all Gama Construction Ireland Limited workers received value for these transfers.  I am not in a position to assure the Deputy that all Gama Construction Ireland Limited workers in Ireland, both past and present, have received value for the amounts that were transferred into their personal accounts in Finansbank.  However, my Department estimates that the Gama Construction Ireland Limited workers have benefited to the extent of &euro;20 million as a result of the investigation.  The labour inspectorate&rsquo;s inquiries into compliance by Gama Construction Ireland Limited are continuing.</P>

	<P>I do not know how many companies like Gama Construction Ireland Limited are operating here but there is more than one.  What lessons have the Department and the inspectors learned from the quashing of the inspector&rsquo;s report?  The Supreme Court must follow its own path, over which the Department has no control.  The Minister has control over the reasons the report was quashed and whether other reports will be written in such a way as to avoid the legal hazard that emerged from the High Court decision.</P>
        <P>How does the Department feel about the actions taken by the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor in encouraging companies from third countries such <Col N="475"/>as Turkey into the Irish market?  Without wishing to prejudice the outcome of the case, it appears that this company entered into a very unusual contractual arrangement for payment with workers from the home country.  Do we not have an obligation to ensure that any worker in our construction sector or any other sector is treated equally?  Should lessons be learned by the Department in respect of the manner in which Gama Construction Ireland Limited entered the Irish economy?  Is the Minister concerned by the continuing presence of Gama Construction Ireland Limited and the way in which it behaves?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Regarding the legal issues that arose about the Department&rsquo;s capacity to publish the report of the labour inspectorate, it is my intention to deal with that legal deficiency in the legislative framework for employment rights compliance.  A new compliance Bill will result from our commitments to the latest social partnership agreement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that the outcome of the quashing?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  As the report was adjudged to be <i>ultra vires</i>, pending adjudication by the Supreme Court, there was a legal deficiency.  We are amending the legislation to grant broader powers to the Minister on these issues.</P>
        <P>We issue work permits to employers in good faith.  One must trust that people will honour the decision and behave accordingly.  We are not satisfied with the information received from Gama Construction Ireland Limited.  I am not satisfied with the long process in which we have been engaged, ensuring that Gama Construction Ireland Limited understood our way of dealing with matters.  Early in our discussions, I realised that Gama Construction Ireland Limited was unaware of our labour relations machinery, such as the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court.</P>
        <P>We have learned lessons from this episode.  The advent of EU accession states moves the goalposts significantly.  There is no longer a requirement to employ a large number of workers from any one company.  Any company that wishes to locate in Ireland should seek to recruit from Ireland or the EU labour market.  In 1999 we faced major skills shortages and there was an inflationary spiral in the construction sector.  At that time, it was a reasonable proposition that companies would bring workers to Ireland to work on projects here as long as the companies obeyed the rules.  One of the key results of our experience with Gama Construction Ireland Limited and a number of other experiences is the deliberation on the new social partnership agreement and the raft of legislation that will emanate from that.  The inspectorate will expand to include 90 inspectors, the new compliance Bill will be <Col N="476"/>published and a new compliance office will be created.</P>

	<P>The voluntary protection programme is an initiative in workplace safety which has its origins in an EU-USA meeting on safety in the workplace and was introduced to Ireland in 2004 as a joint pilot initiative between the Health and Safety Authority and the Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland.  Since the pilot initiative was established, four companies have achieved the star safety rating that is the initial goal for the participating companies. </P>
        <P>The outcome of the pilot initiative is currently being evaluated by the board of the Health and Safety Authority, which is statutorily responsible for the enforcement of health and safety legislation in Ireland.  I have not made any commitment to recognise the voluntary protection programme in workplaces in Ireland.  This would be a matter for the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>All workplaces should be models of good practice and leadership in terms of management but that is not the case.  Does the Minister of State accept this is not the case partially because the inspectorate is inadequate?  Until we get there, surely recognising schemes like voluntary protection programmes would encourage employers to move towards providing a better environment and better work practices.  This initiative, which the Health and Safety Authority has rightly taken on, should be recognised by the Department.  Does the Minister of State agree that such recognition would encourage greater safety in workplaces?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of initiatives have been undertaken by the Health and Safety Authority in conjunction with various sectors in respect of employment and health and safety in the workplace.  We must bear in mind that this project is a pilot project and has not yet been evaluated by the board of the Health and Safety Authority.  In the first instance, it appears sensible to conduct this evaluation and see what it comes up with.  </P>
        <P>It is also important to remember that this scheme is an attempt to reward exceptional standards, rather than mere compliance.  In general, the principle is one which is very worthy and of which we would be supportive.  However, in the interim we should await the evaluation by the board of the Health and Safety Authority before further action is taken.</P>

	<P>Official statistics are not available in respect of the gender of persons who are directors of registered companies.  I am aware that recently introduced legislation in Norway imposes gender balance requirements for State-owned companies and publicly quoted companies but that private limited companies are not covered by these requirements.  I have no proposals at present to introduce a gender balance requirement into Irish company law.  Responsibility for gender equality matters generally is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government is committed to achieving a minimum 40% representation of women on State boards.  I understand from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that female membership on State boards increased from 32% in December 2004 to 34% in December 2005.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State recognise that perhaps it is time we began obtaining the official statistics from the Companies Registration Office?  It should not be too difficult to do so.  Software is now available which can read the gender of a particular name of a director fairly easily.  Notwithstanding that departmental responsibility for the matter rests with another Department, there is such a thing as overall collective responsibility.  In the implementation of Government policy, where this is a desired objective, the Minister of State might consider undertaking an initiative with the Department of the Taoiseach, the Central Statistics Office and, in particular, the Companies Registration Office, which I understand is within the remit of his Department, to seek out these statistics.  </P><Col N="478"/>
        <P>The minimum 40% target for the representation of women on State boards and bodies has been reversed by the two Governments of which the Minister of State has been a supporter since 1997.  The figures have gone backwards.  The main culprit in disturbing the gender balance was not the current Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment but his predecessor.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has committed in the programme for Government and Sustaining Progress to achieving a minimum of 40% representation of women on State boards.  In July 2002, all Ministers were asked to review the gender balance composition of the State boards and committees under the aegis of their Departments and to take measures to redress gender balances.  On 26 January 2005, the Government decided that all nominating bodies should be required to put forward male and female candidates for appointments to State boards for which they are the nominating authority.  All Ministers were requested to put in place the necessary procedures to implement the Government decision.  </P>
        <P>Following these decisions, female membership on State boards increased from 22% in December 2004 to 34% at the end of September 2005, reflecting the upward curve in female participation in State boards since June 2002, when the figure was 29%.  A total of 38% of appointments to State boards made during 2005 were women, compared with 33% in 2004 so one can say that the situation is moving towards the 40% target.  I will raise with the Companies Registration Office the suggestion by Deputy Quinn that it check each annual return to see the percentage of male and female members on boards.</P>

        <P LI="1">That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the despatch, pursuant to section 2 of the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1960, as applied by the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006, of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, established on 19 March 1978 under UN Security Council Resolutions 425 (1978) and 426 (1978) and in accordance with its additional enhanced mandate as set out in UN Security Council Resolution 1701 (2006) of 11 August 2006.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I thank the House for agreeing to take this motion at short notice.  I propose to introduce the motion and provide some brief information on the reason the Government decided to respond positively to the United Nations and provide a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL.</P>
        <P>On 3 October 2006, the Government authorised me, as Minister for Defence, to despatch a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for a period of one year for service with the UNIFIL, which was established on 19 March 1978 under UN Security Council Resolutions 425 (1978) and 426 (1978) in accordance with its enhanced-additional mandate as set out in UN Security Council Resolution 1701 (2006) of 11 August 2006.  It also authorised me to move a resolution in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approving the despatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with UNIFIL in accordance with its enhanced-additional mandate as set out in UN Security Council Resolution 1701 (2006) of 11 August 2006; to make appropriate budgetary provision in consultation with the Minister for Finance to fund the contingent; and to make preparations for the selection, training and equipping of a further contingent of the Permanent Defence Force to provide for the possibility of Ireland&rsquo;s continuing participation in UNIFIL beyond the one-year period, provided that the Security Council renews the mandate of UNIFIL and subject to any further decisions which the Government may take as to continued participation in the force.</P>
        <P>Pursuant to this authority, this motion has been placed on the Order Paper for D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  In commending the motion to the House, I will briefly outline the Defence Force&rsquo;s participation in UNIFIL to date and the background to <Col N="480"/>Ireland&rsquo;s response to the United Nations to provide a contingent.</P>
        <P>UNIFIL was originally established in March 1978, following the invasion of Lebanon by Israel, with a mandate &ldquo;to confirm the withdrawal of Israeli Forces, to restore international peace and security and to assist the Government of Lebanon in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the area&rdquo;.  The Secretary General of the United Nations concluded that, as of 16 June 2000, Israel had withdrawn its forces from Lebanon in accordance with Resolution 425 (1978), thus partially fulfilling UNIFIL&rsquo;s original mandate.  Since then, UNIFIL has continued to operate in southern Lebanon.</P>
        <P>The mission continued to focus on the remaining part of its mandate, namely, the restoration of peace and security in the region through observing, monitoring and reporting on developments in its area of operation, liaising with the parties with a view to correcting violations along the line of withdrawal, the so-called &ldquo;blue line&rdquo;, and preventing the escalation of incidents.</P>
        <P>On 12 July 2006, the Hizbollah militia launched a raid into Israel, killing a number of soldiers and abducting two.  Israel&rsquo;s military response against Hizbollah rapidly escalated into a ground attack across the border into southern Lebanon, air strikes on targets throughout Lebanon, including Hizbollah controlled areas of south Beirut, and the destruction of transport and energy infrastructure.  Israeli towns and cities were subject to large-scale attack by Hizbollah rockets.  More than 1,000 Lebanese civilians are estimated to have been killed and hundreds of thousands of people on both sides of the border were forced to flee the conflict zone.</P>
        <P>In response to the crisis, the United Nations Security Council decided, under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, to extend the mandate of UNIFIL to the end of August 2007 and increase its troop strength from approximately 2,000 to a maximum of 15,000.  In addition to carrying out its original mandate under Security Council Resolutions 425 and 426, UNIFIL will also monitor the cessation of hostilities and accompany and support the Lebanese armed forces as they deploy throughout the south of Lebanon.  It will also help to ensure humanitarian access to civilian populations and the voluntary and safe return of displaced persons.  The nature of the expanded UNIFIL mandate is such that its role will be considerably more robust than it was prior to the adoption of Resolution 1701, while still operating under Chapter VI of the UN Charter.</P>
        <P>The ceasefire, which took effect on 14 August 2006, has been holding well with only a small number of incidents reported in the days immediately following the official cessation of hostilities.  The final withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon was more or less completed on the night of 30 September 2006, in accordance with a <Col N="481"/>general agreement that Israel would leave southern Lebanon by the end of September and once UNIFIL reached 5,000 troops.  Israeli troops are still present in the town of Ghajar, which straddles the border.  It is hoped the withdrawal of all Israeli troops from the Lebanese portion of Ghajar can be confirmed in the coming days.</P>
        <P>The first phase in the three-stage deployment of UNIFIL II was successfully completed with the deployment of approximately 5,000 international troops in southern Lebanon alongside units of the Lebanese army.  Full deployment is on course for early November, when UNIFIL will have a strength of 15,000 personnel deployed.</P>
        <P>Ireland has participated in UNIFIL since 1978.  Between May 1978 and November 2001, the Defence Forces had an infantry battalion with an approximate strength of 540 personnel in Lebanon, together with approximately 100 personnel in UNIFIL headquarters and the force mobile reserve.  The battalion&rsquo;s main duty was to provide a presence in the area by operating patrols and checkpoints and manning observation posts.  The presence of the Irish battalion in south Lebanon undoubtedly helped to restore a certain normality to the area, as evidenced by the increase in population and economic activity in the region over the course of its deployment.  Following the withdrawal of the Irish battalion in November 2001, a small number of Defence Forces personnel continued to serve at the force headquarters in Naqoura.  Five personnel are deployed at the force headquarters.</P>
        <P>The Government has monitored the situation following the ceasefire of 14 August with a view to determining how best Ireland might contribute to the expanded UNIFIL II mission.  As Deputies will appreciate, given our other existing commitments, the Defence Forces have limited resources to contribute to this mission.  Against this background, an option was identified whereby Ireland might partner Finnish troops and provide a protection detail to a planned Finnish engineering company.  The Defence Forces have operated alongside Finnish troops in various UN missions and are familiar with Finnish operations.  In addition, Finland is also one of the participants in the Nordic battle group.</P>
        <P>Detailed discussions have taken place between the Defence Forces and their Finnish counterparts, including a joint reconnaissance mission to Lebanon.  A Defence Forces team also travelled to Finland to finalise details of a possible joint contribution.  The plan envisages the deployment of a Finnish engineering unit with an Irish protection detail in the eastern sector area of Lebanon.</P>
        <P>It is planned to deploy a contingent of approximately 150 personnel as part of the joint Finnish-Irish unit.  The existing five Defence Forces personnel will continue to be deployed at the UNIFIL force headquarters.  At the request of the United Nations, it is also proposed the Irish officer deployed as senior liaison officer in <Col N="482"/>UNIFIL HQ will take up a new appointment at a co-ordination and planning cell to be established within UNIFIL in Beirut.  This will ensure effective interaction with the Lebanese authorities.</P>
        <P>The Finnish-Irish engineering unit will carry out tasks in support of UNIFIL and humanitarian work, such as dealing with unexploded ordnance clearance.  While the Irish element will be tasked primarily for reconnaissance, security and protection duties associated with the engineering works, it will also be available to undertake other tasks at the request of the UNIFIL force commander.  These could include protection details, escorts and security duties within their area of operations.</P>
        <P>The main portion of deployment to UNIFIL is planned for 30 and 31 October 2006.  Initial deployment will be for one year, subject to renewal of the mandate and a satisfactory review of the mission at that time.  In line with standing policy that the duration of any deployment should be set at the outset of a mission, it is considered that Defence Forces involvement in UNIFIL should not exceed a maximum of two to three years in duration.</P>
        <P>Following the reconnaissance mission and consultation with our Finnish colleagues, UNIFIL and other parties, it is assessed no direct threat to UNIFIL personnel exists.  That said, the uncertain and volatile situation means incidents, misunderstandings or wider political developments all have the potential to impact negatively on the peacekeeping operation, while the large quantity of cluster-bomblets and other unexploded ordnance also present a risk.</P>
        <P>However, the ceasefire seems to be holding well and the Defence Forces have assessed the overall threat as low within a volatile situation, an estimation not dissimilar to that encountered by Irish personnel on other peace support missions.  Given the Defence Forces equipment, training and experience, the Chief of Staff has advised me the mission is within the capability of Defence Forces personnel and they can play a meaningful role.</P>
        <P>While D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann previously approved the despatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with UNIFIL under UN Security Council Resolutions 425 and 426, the Attorney General has advised a further D&aacute;il resolution is now required given the expanded role of UNIFIL under UN Security Council Resolution 1701.  Hence this resolution before the House.</P>
        <P>It is estimated the additional cost to the Defence Vote in transportation, start-up and sustainment costs and overseas allowances will amount to approximately &euro;10.2 million over the initial 12-month period to 31 October 2007.  As UNIFIL is a UN-led operation, certain troop and equipment costs incurred by Ireland will be reimbursed.  It is estimated that UN reimbursement of costs to the Exchequer will amount to approxi<Col N="483"/>mately &euro;3 million over a 12-month period.  The net additional cost to the Defence Vote will, therefore, amount to approximately &euro;3.8 million in 2006 and &euro;3.4 million in 2007.</P>
        <P>We return to Lebanon in unfortunate circumstances and against the backdrop of massive destruction of infrastructure and the communities whom we served for more than 23 years from 1978 to 2001.  However, I am confident the Defence Forces will have a real and substantive role in supporting the rebuilding of Lebanon and we will play that role with the same courage, fortitude and commitment as heretofore.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>

	<P>Fine Gael supports this motion and the deployment of a contingent of the Defence Forces to Lebanon on service with the United Nations interim force.  Ireland has a long and distinguished record of service both with the UN and in Lebanon and we should play a role in underpinning stability and supporting the ceasefire in the region.</P>
        <P>Originally, UNIFIL was created by the UN Security Council in 1978 with a mandate to confirm Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, restore international peace and security and assist the Lebanese Government in restoring its effective authority in the region.  Following the extreme crisis earlier this year, the role of UNIFIL has been enhanced and the force will now also monitor the cessation of hostilities, and accompany and support the Lebanese armed forces as they deploy throughout the south of Lebanon.</P>
        <P>The force will also extend humanitarian assistance to the civilian population and assist in the return of displaced persons.  Hand-in-hand with the revised mandate of UNIFIL II, the maximum troop strength will be increased from 2,000 to 15,000.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">The Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces has recommended the deployment of a contingent of approximately 150 personnel as part of a joint Finnish-Irish unit.  Given the turmoil and loss of life in the region in recent months, the primary responsibility of this UN force must be to focus on delivering stability and protecting the ceasefire.  The issue of the disarmament of Hizbollah and other militias has already been the subject of UN resolutions and should remain the responsibility of the Lebanese Government.</P>
        <P>While Fine Gael supports the involvement of members of the Defence Forces in this expanded UN force, the safety of any Irish personnel who may serve in Lebanon is of paramount importance.  It is for this reason that I have repeatedly <Col N="484"/>called for an expanded remit for the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights in this matter.  A cross-section of informed personnel, including relevant ambassadors, members of the Defence Forces and United Nations personnel, should be invited to appear before the committee to discuss and debate the security situation in Lebanon and the challenges that our troops will face when deployed to the region.  Given these undoubted challenges, a forensic analysis of all components of the mission should be required and this could be facilitated through the committee.</P>
        <P>It is also of concern to me that we must ensure that the UNIFIL force in Lebanon is respected absolutely by all sides in the conflict.  This force must command the support of both the Israeli and Lebanese Governments, and their co-operation will be crucial to the success of the revised mandate of this UN force.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition, given the recent bombing raids in the region, there is a heightened risk from unexploded ordnance to Defence Forces personnel on this mission.  I would like assurances about the equipment and training which will be made available to members of the Defence Forces who are sent on this mission when dealing with this threat.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no doubt that the conflict over the summer was disastrous.  No one questions the right of Israel to defend itself, indeed the despicable attacks by Hizbollah against Israeli citizens have seriously undermined stability in the region, as has the inability of the Lebanese Government to deal with that internal threat.  Attacks against Israeli centres like Haifa cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely and cannot be expected to go without response from Israel.  Having served with the Defence Forces in Lebanon as part of Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the UN, however, I have seen at first hand the tactics of the Israeli military when dealing with any threat to its border with Lebanon.  Whenever this border is threatened, the standard Israeli response is to use an extremely high level of force, effectively terrorising the civilian population.</P>
        <P>As on other occasions, the Israeli response over the summer months brought with it an unacceptably high degree of civilian casualty and humanitarian hardship.  I recently spoke to a retired colonel who visited Lebanon with Amnesty International and towns and villages he had known were completely flattened and he came across children living in bombed out buildings.  Conditions were terrible, he told me.  The Israeli strikes against Lebanon have punished the civilian population, undoing much of the vital economic development and rebuilding work that the Lebanese have been engaged in following years of internal and external instability.</P>
        <P>It remains a point of some considerable and deep sadness that large sections of Beirut, particularly southern parts of the city, formerly referred <Col N="485"/>to as the Paris of the Middle East in testament to its beauty, should once again be reduced to rubble.  The citizens of that city had been engaged in much rebuilding work in recent years.  This work was near completion at the start of this year but they now face the prospect of starting all over again.</P>
        <P>The 1975-91 civil war seriously damaged Lebanon&rsquo;s economic infrastructure, cut national output by half and all but ended Lebanon&rsquo;s position as a Middle-East banking hub.  The more recent peace had enabled the Government to restore control in Beirut once again, to begin collecting taxes and regain access to key port and Government facilities.  However, the recent targeting of Lebanese sites by Israel has undone much of this work and a serious economic downturn will be the inevitable consequence. This can only add further to instability in the region.</P>
        <P>This is an unusual conflict because there is no dispute over territory.  A country is carrying out retribution on a neighbouring civil population it would argue harbours a terrorist group that is attacking its territory.  Much of the debate in this country involved people who were definitive in their views but there is right and wrong on both sides.  There is no simple solution.  At the start there was a call for the UN to go in but it is difficult for that organisation as currently constituted, or NATO or any other force, to enter a conflict when the protagonists do not have any desire for it to come in.</P>
        <P>I am critical of how the western world stood back, waiting for a signal from Israel that it had inflicted enough damage and terrorised the population enough before a resolution could be put in place.  If that signal had not been given by the Israelis, would the conflict still be continuing?  The west lost its moral authority, if it had any in the first place, in this case because of the delay in its reaction.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Once the ceasefire was achieved, we should have taken more of a lead.  We hung back until the second tranche before we would commit when we should have declared a willingness to commit if the conditions were in place.  Those in place today are fine and we are prepared to support them but every overseas mission has the potential to be dangerous.  It is vital that the Minister for Foreign Affairs brings in the Israeli and Iranian ambassadors and the representatives of Syria and Lebanon and outlines to them our role in Lebanon and makes it clear to them that we will not accept targeting of UN positions.  In the past, Syrian and Iranian-backed terrorist groups and the Israeli state have been reckless about the safety of UN personnel.  Four members of UNIFIL were killed in this conflict, an inexcusable fact, and we must point the finger at the Israelis, although Hizbollah would have used the shelter of this UN position to carry out its attack, similar to Saddam Hussein&rsquo;s regime in Baghdad <Col N="486"/>using the cover of the civilian population to launch attacks.  There are two sides to this.</P>
        <P>We are working with the Finnish, a welcome development.  If the EU battle group had been in place we would have been able to go in faster and to operate more efficiently when we got on the ground.  It is a perfect example of the concept behind EU battle groups.</P>
        <P>We may have a humanitarian role.  The first UNIFIL deployment kept the peace to a degree but civil society was never improved and it is important when we send people overseas that we look at adding a humanitarian or civilian affairs aspect to the mission to restore civilian administration.  Civil administration is non-existent in southern Lebanon at the moment.</P>
        <P>This commitment will place a strain on our resources and I ask the Minister to speed up the concept of the reserve serving overseas, particularly in specialist areas.  There may be difficulties with employment law but we must improve this, particularly with increased commitments under the EU battle groups.</P>
        <P>I also ask the Minister to examine the concept of extending the retirement age for officers.  Officers at commandant rank must exit the Defence Forces at 56 having gained much expertise.  The cut-off point should be 60, particularly when we are looking at increasing the age of people in the public service.  There is a difficulty getting volunteers, particularly in the officer corps, to travel overseas and by increasing the retirement age, it would free up many people.</P>
        <P>When the mission ends in Liberia, will we increase our contribution to UNIFIL II or will we go on to another mission?  It is great to see our peacekeeping forces going to Lebanon and the UN taking a stand, albeit months after it should have gone.  I think of the people of Darfur who are being terrorised by the Government of Sudan and a terrorist organisation, the Janjaweed militia, while we, in the west, stand idly by.  This shows the United Nations is frequently ineffective.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Timmins for sharing time.  I am pleased to support the Government&rsquo;s proposal to deploy troops to Lebanon as part of UNIFIL II.  I have been accused of taking a somewhat gung-ho approach to this issue in encouraging the Government to make the decision it has confirmed in the Chamber today.  That is not the case.  I am aware the commitment to deploy troops is a serious one and that Ireland has experienced tragedy in Lebanon where 48 Irish servicemen lost their lives.  I pay tribute to them.</P>
        <P>We should not lose sight of the fact that this deployment offers an opportunity to play a small but valuable part in perhaps the most important European Union led United Nations mission of our time.  People were horrified over the summer to see close coverage of a war which flattened <Col N="487"/>Lebanon.  Ireland has an opportunity to play a role trying to ensure we build peace in a region about which we know something.  It is not often the Secretary General specifically calls on the European Union to offer leadership for a mission.  He also asked countries with experience in Lebanon to show courage and make a contribution of troops to the mission.  While it would have been helpful if the Government had made a commitment to deploy troops before now, this decision is nevertheless welcome and has my strong support.</P>
        <P>I am fortunate to have been involved in the debate on UNIFIL II in the European Parliament, during which many MEPs posed the same questions.  Will our troops be safe in Lebanon?  Will they be asked to disarm Hizbollah on the ground?  If this had been the case, it would have given rise to serious concerns but most of these concerns have been allayed.  Those listening who share them should note the responsibility of disarming Hizbollah lies with Lebanese forces.  This responsibility, which must be fulfilled, forms part of the UN resolution underpinning the UNIFIL II mission.  Irish troops and forces from other EU and non-EU member states who make up the 15,000 strong contingent must support the Lebanese army in this difficult task.</P>
        <P>Many other jobs, for example, de-mining, must be done on the ground.  Disgracefully, the Israelis, particularly in the final few days of the conflict, used cluster bombs to savage effect.  Unfortunately, as people returned to their villages, largely consisting of rubble, they had to face the dangers of thousands of unexploded small munitions from cluster bombs.</P>
        <P>Both sides are to blame for the conflict of the summer.  The UNIFIL mission, with Ireland supporting a large European Union force, can make a valuable contribution towards building lasting peace and stability in a region which is crying out for both.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the proposed deployment of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon.  The recent conflict caused major international difficulties over the summer and gripped Ireland and other countries owing to the slaughter of civilians and destruction of infrastructure that took place in Lebanon. </P>
        <P>Once again the Middle East is a major theatre of conflict.  In the past, the Palestinian question was the central issue.  Now the conflict is considerably broader with the murderous wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the threat of nuclear conflict in Iran.  Islamic fundamentalism has been given a new momentum and has developed a global character and context.  No part of the world is free from this new targeting.  The spectacular attacks on the Twin Towers on 11 September <Col N="488"/>2001 in New York, the London metro, Madrid railway and Bali holiday resort as well as other smaller and failed attacks have made the world a more dangerous place.  The current President of the United States has contributed in no small way to this serious development.</P>
        <P>The previous secular regime in Palestine under the Fatah leadership of Yasser Arafat which campaigned for a Palestinian state while recognising Israel&rsquo;s right to statehood has been superseded by the newly elected and more fundamental Hamas organisation, which does not recognise Israel as having any right of existence in the Middle East.  The streets of Gaza now regularly experience bloody and bitter conflicts between Fatah and Hamas armed supporters.  The turmoil is intense and conflict can spark off very easily in such highly charged circumstances.</P>
        <P>Thus it was that the recent conflict began in Lebanon.  On 12 July a number of Israeli soldiers on border duty were killed and two were abducted by Hizbollah.  Israel retaliated not by negotiation or diplomacy but by immediate invasion of Lebanon, a sovereign state which had not been privy to Hizbollah activity and had not sanctioned or approved of it.  On the contrary, the Lebanese Government strongly disapproved of Hizbollah activity.  The indiscriminate bombardment of the civilian population, particularly the massacre of women and children at Qana following a similar massacre in the same place in 1996, was an outrageous breach of the Geneva Convention.  The targeting and destruction of infrastructure was also deliberate.  The propelling of tens of thousands of cluster bombs by the Israeli army in the days before the ceasefire was a calculated decision to leave death and destruction behind when it withdrew and make reconstruction of the infrastructure and tillage of the land a slow and dangerous process.</P>
        <P>Eventually, a cessation of hostilities was agreed and the United Nations Security Council decided under UN Resolution 1701 of 11 August 2006 to increase the existing 2,000 UN troops in Lebanon to 15,000.  Under the resolution, the UN would monitor the cessation of hostilities, accompany Lebanese forces as they deployed in southern Lebanon and on the border with Israel, assist with the provision of humanitarian aid, the safe return of displaced persons and the reconstruction of the country and work towards a permanent ceasefire.</P>
        <P>As the Minister indicated in his briefing note earlier this week:</P>
        <P LI="1">The nature of the UNIFIL mandate is such that the role of UNIFIL is to be considerably more robust than that of its predecessor while still operating under Chapter VI of the UN Charter (peacekeeping operations mounted under Chapter VI are of the traditional peace keeping type seen heretofore in UNIFIL, where the UN acts as a monitoring, patrolling <Col N="489"/>and observing force after peace has been established).</P>
        <P FLI="0">Ireland&rsquo;s participation in Lebanon was continuous from UNIFIL&rsquo;s establishment in 1978 until 2001.  This makes it the longest continuous UN mission in which we have participated.  With an infantry battalion of approximately 540 soldiers in Lebanon throughout the mission, thousands of Irish soldiers experienced military service in Lebanon and many paid the ultimate sacrifice giving their lives in the cause of peace in the Middle East.</P>
        <P>When the President of Lebanon and UN Secretary General Kofi Annan both strongly requested Irish participation in the new United Nations force it was always likely that Ireland, with its vast experience and track record in Lebanon, would be willing to answer the call and set in motion the triple lock mechanism to do so.  Considering our neutral status as a country, our oft demonstrated support for the anti-war campaign in the Middle East, numerous calls inside and outside the Oireachtas for a ceasefire in Lebanon during the conflict and the establishment of a UN peacekeeping mission, it would be little short of churlish and perverse of us to do other than respond positively.</P>
        <P>What is more pertinent to the Irish situation today is not that we are responding positively but that we must determine and clarify the role Irish troops will play in Lebanon.  From the Minister&rsquo;s remarks, it appears that they will play a supporting role to Finnish troops who will be tasked with undertaking engineering works in the eastern sector of Lebanon.  The Irish troops will undertake security, protection and escort duties for approximately 250 Finnish soldiers in an engineering unit.  Considering the length of time Irish troops have participated in Lebanon, the experience and expertise they have accumulated in that period and the relationships that have been built with the Lebanese people it seems incredible that a more central role could not have been found for them.  Anyone who remembers the television interview with the Lebanese Prime Minister following the cessation of hostilities when the proposal was made for the United Nations to establish a peacekeeping force will remember his heart-felt call for Irish troops to be part of the force, saying they would be very welcome in Lebanon.  Surely there is a role for them that would allow their strengths, talents and experience to be employed more meaningfully than as bodyguards for other troops.  Surely there are humanitarian tasks to be performed, village reconstruction to be aided and overseen, displaced persons to be accommodated, communities to be assisted and communications networks to be maintained.  All of these tasks are more suited to Irish troops given their relevant experience in Lebanon.</P>
        <P>The Minister is concerned that incidents and misunderstandings have the potential to impact <Col N="490"/>negatively on the peacekeeping operation.  That is all the more reason those with experience on the ground for over a quarter of a century should be more usefully and directly employed.  I do not know whether it is too late, as they are due to leave at the end of the month, to widen the role of the Irish contingent.  If it is not, the Minister should revisit the matter.  I know the initial deployment is for one year, subject to renewal of the mandate and a satisfactory review of the mission after 12 months.  If the Minister cannot broaden the remit of the Irish troops now, he should report to the House after the first year of the mission.  He should present us with a report and an assessment of the role played by the Irish troops with proposals for its widening where feasible and appropriate.</P>
        <P>Although the situation has been described as volatile, the risk is low and the ceasefire, contrary to expectations, has held well.  In that context, Irish troops can more easily be deployed in Lebanon without great concerns for their safety, such as might have been expected a month ago.  During the summer the Ministers for Defence and Foreign Affairs expressed concern about the instability which they gave as a reason they were delaying the deployment of Irish troops until phase two.  The situation has been stabilised.  Therefore, it would be easier to revisit the question of a wider and more flexible deployment of Irish troops in the coming months.  Perhaps the Minister can come back to the House after the first review, or perhaps he can today specify an area of humanitarian involvement and direct contact with the Lebanese people in which the talents and experience of the Irish troops could be used to the maximum.  Although it is one of the key issues, we have heard no word about this from the Minister.  One of the key reasons the Irish troops are so welcome in the Lebanon is their talents, experience and expertise, as well as their ability to build good relations with the people.</P>
        <P>I welcome this debate and hope there will be no division in the House on the issue.  It is part of our role and commitment to the United Nations and against war, wherever it may be, as well as our neutral status that we participate wherever there is instability and threats to peace and wherever the United Nations asks us to do so.</P>

	<P>Ba mhaith liom mo chuid ama a roinnt leis na Teachta&iacute; Gormley, Finian McGrath agus Joe Higgins.</P>
        <P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo agus go bhfuil an Rialtas s&aacute;sta an r&uacute;n seo a phl&eacute; sa Teach inni&uacute;.

Ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo sa choiste, &aacute;it ina mbeadh n&iacute;os m&oacute; ama againn na ceisteanna seo a ch&iacute;oradh i gceart agus baint go mion leis na sonra&iacute; at&aacute; i gceist.  Caithfimid d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; os &aacute;r <Col N="491"/>gcomhair agus is trua nach bhfuil ach 65 n&oacute;im&eacute;id againn.</P>
        <P>According to the Irish United Nations Veterans Association, since 1958 the Defence Forces have provided 70,000 soldiers for tours of duty overseas in 40 countries.  Some 85 members of the Defence Forces have died overseas and many more have been injured.  It is always important that overseas missions are fully scrutinised before the deployment of Irish soldiers.  It is particularly important in the case of UNIFIL, given the threat posed to the personnel by Israel which last summer demonstrated again its willingness to kill United Nations personnel with impunity.  Last July Israeli shelling resulted in the deaths of four UN observers despite the fact that UN peacekeepers had warned Israeli soldiers ten times to stop the shelling.  This is not the first time Israel has shown absolute disregard for the lives of UN staff.  In 2002 Israeli occupying forces in the West Bank killed UN Relief and Works Agency project manager Mr. Iain Hook.  The direct threat posed by Israel to members serving with UNIFIL must be recognised and the Minister has not done this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Sinn F&eacute;in had hoped the resolution extending the UNIFIL mission would provide for deployment on both sides of the border and give UNIFIL a mandate to monitor Israeli activities.  Unfortunately and foolishly, the mandate does not extend to this.  The mission is in south Lebanon alone.  However, given that the Lebanese are supportive of the UN mission, Sinn F&eacute;in also supports it but we are concerned about some aspects of the expanded mandate.  The Department of Defence briefing notes state the role of UNIFIL is to to be &ldquo;considerably more robust&rdquo; but claims that it still operates under Chapter VI of the UN Charter.  Chapter VI covers traditional peacekeeping tasks such as monitoring, patrolling and observing.  However, according to a senior US State Department official, the resolution expanding UNIFIL&rsquo;s role has all the characteristics of a Chapter VII resolution.  It walks, talks and acts like a Chapter VII resolution.  Chapter VII allows for enforcement by military means.  The Minister must clarify whether the more robust role of UNIFIL II strays into the arena of Chapter VII.  Although he addressed some of these issues, I would like him to go further in ensuring we are not straying into the arena of Chapter VII.</P>
        <P>While Ireland has a proud record of involvement in peacekeeping missions overseas, including Lebanon, where Irish members have been stationed since 1978, it is important to remember that there have been mistakes and we should avoid repeating them.  During the years there have been reports of discrimination or differential treatment by UNIFIL of Muslims versus Christians.  Some former members informed me that at times the Israeli-backed Christian militias <Col N="492"/>were given a free run in UNIFIL-patrolled areas, while some members of the Muslim population were treated poorly.  I hope that will not be the case on this occasion.  I am aware that it was not the case in most of the regions in which Irish soldiers served in the past and I understand they were quite good in ensuring that discrimination did not occur.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Defence must monitor the operations of the new UNIFIL force to ensure that it operates at all times in a manner above reproach.  This is particularly important in light of the new, robust UNIFIL mandate to which the Minister referred.  We must be vigilant in respect of attempts to co-opt the UNIFIL force into serving the ends of interested countries and their foreign policies and we must ensure that such corruption of the mission is not allowed to happen.  Given the nature of the mandate, I ask the Minister to make a commitment that the House will return to this issue in six months to discuss how UNIFIL ll is progressing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is only right and proper that the House should have the opportunity to debate the deployment of 150 Irish troops to Lebanon.  I said yesterday that the Government might have been reluctant to debate this matter in the House because, strictly speaking, it is not a Chapter VII mission, although Condoleezza Rice has said that, for all intents and purposes, it is such a mission.  Like Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, I ask that the Minister clarify the position.  Lebanon did not want it to be a Chapter VII mission but it seems that the United States has managed to manoeuvre matters in such a way that it may become such a mission.</P>
        <P>This mission carries certain risks and could easily turn out to be our most dangerous to date.  The Minister outlined some of the dangers involved.  It is at times such as this that the families of those brave men and women who will serve in Lebanon ought to be foremost in our minds.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Green Party has supported every mission that has come before the House as part of the triple lock mechanism.  We will also be supporting this mission, but with certain reservations.  We have already lost 44 personnel in previous missions in Lebanon and members of our armed forces will be entering the field in very volatile circumstances.  There is great resentment and hatred towards Israel in Lebanon following the former&rsquo;s attacks.  Those attacks were in total breach of international law, a fact the Minister did not mention.  He ought to clearly state that this was, in fact, the case.  The Lebanese justifiably feel that the international community sat back and allowed their beautiful country to be destroyed.  They have little trust in the western powers led by Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair.</P>
        <P>On the other hand, Israel realises that its attack was entirely counterproductive, that it increased the popularity of Hizbollah and that it radicalised <Col N="493"/>Lebanese youth.  It would now like to broaden the conflict and have Europeans become involved in its war against terrorism.  That is why Israel wants an international presence in Lebanon.</P>
        <P>If the peacekeepers are too closely identified with Israel and are seen as a proxy force of occupation, the mission could go disastrously wrong.  I remind the Minister of comments made by the speaker of the Lebanese Parliament, Nabi Berri, in <i>The Guardian</i> today to the effect that Hizbollah will resume its military campaign unless Israel withdraws from the disputed Shebaa farms area and other pockets of territory occupied during the summer&rsquo;s 34-day war.  We ought to pay heed to what Mr. Berri said in the article, namely:</P>
        <P LI="1">The UNIFIL presence will not hinder Hizbullah&rsquo;s defensive operations.  The resistance doesn&rsquo;t need to fly its flags high to operate.  It&rsquo;s a guerrilla movement, it operates among the people.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Most interestingly &mdash; this is quite sinister &mdash; Mr. Berri also expressed concern that UN forces could be involved in gathering information that could fall into the hands of Israel&rsquo;s intelligence agency Mossad.</P>
        <P>The Minister can clearly see that there are inherent dangers with this mission and that we ought to bear them in mind.  It is important that the force should liaise closely at all times with the Lebanese Government and its army.  Despite what Condoleezza Rice says, it is not a Chapter VII mission.  It cannot be about disarming Hizbollah &mdash; I see the Minister nodding, perhaps in agreement with me &mdash; because that could be quite counterproductive.  Having emerged victorious from the war, the members of Hizbollah will be in no mood to be seen as losers by being forced to disarm.</P>
        <P>The question arises as to how long the mission will last.  Will it be open-ended?  When one considers the resolution, it appears that the length of the mission is indefinite.  That matter must be examined because as long as the vacuum exists and there is no movement towards a lasting settlement, the risk increases substantially.  We need a lasting settlement and all the parties, including Syria and Iran, to come to the negotiating table in order to consider the issues of the Shebaa farms, Gaza and the West Bank.  If that is not done and a such a settlement is not arrived at, there could be another outbreak of hostilities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this important motion regarding the deployment of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with UNIFIL.  I support the deployment, and I do not say that lightly.  We all have family and friends in the Defence Forces and we all know the serious consequences of the proposal before the House.  It is not easy but it is essential if we are to make a considerable contribution to resolving the <Col N="494"/>situation in the Middle East, particularly as it relates to Lebanon and Palestine.  Ireland needs to be in a position to act as an honest broker and create space for a peaceful resolution of the horrific conflict in the region.</P>
        <P>Let us take time to remember all of those who were slaughtered during the summer.  The nightmare that cost over 1,000 lives in a few weeks was a disgrace and those in Britain and America who either sat on the fence or acted as cheerleaders for the slaughter of innocent civilians should be challenged.  As far as I am concerned, Bush and Blair have blood on their hands.  There is no getting away from that.  This is somewhat rich when Bush and Blair lecture us on violence and ways of ending the Irish conflict.  Did it ever dawn on them and their colonial friends that they are also a huge part of the problem?  Colonialism or imperialism, whether in the 1700s, 1800s or 2006, never works.</P>
        <P>My loyalty in this debate is to Ireland, in the first instance, and to the United Nations.  Major reforms of the United Nations are needed in order to ensure that it is owned and run by the people and not just a few major powers that have no respect for the rule of international law.  Such law should be based on respect for each other and a deep sense of respect for human rights regardless of whether one lives in Chechnya, Palestine or south Armagh.</P>
        <P>On the subject of human rights, I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the wonderful and brave journalist, Anna Politkovskaya, who was murdered in recent days in Russia by dark forces that are opposed to truth, justice and human rights.  To her family and friends, I offer our deepest sympathy.  Her work, like that of Pat Finucane in this country, will never be forgotten.</P>
        <P>It is important to acknowledge the major contribution of Irish troops to United Nations missions in the past.  I commend them and thank them for their dedication, service and commitment.  From a political perspective, I am concerned that some politicians want to change that independence and integrity by slowly sucking us into military alliances.  I reject such behaviour and stress the need for caution and wise decision-making.  We should retain our independence and neutrality and we will thereby continue to enjoy the respect of the rest of the world.</P>
        <P>I wish our troops well and ask them to act in a caring, professional and impartial manner.  They must remember that not only are they representing the Irish people, they are also serving the interests of peace, justice and respect for human rights.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The United Nations has no credibility as a champion for the people of Lebanon.  Resolution 1701 blatantly understates the criminal slaughter of more than 1,000 Lebanese civilians by the Israeli armed forces.  The barbaric destruction of huge swathes of infra<Col N="495"/>structure in Lebanon and the massacre of the innocents was carried out using armaments, aeroplanes and bombs supplied to Israel by two of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, namely the United States and Britain.  Germany has just given Israel three nuclear-powered submarines in the wake of the slaughter.  This is the body to which the Government and others now look to resolve the problems of the people of Lebanon.</P>
        <P>Many well-meaning people in Ireland, including ordinary Irish soldiers, believe that United Nations troops will help to bring peace to the Lebanon.  Unfortunately, they will be disappointed.  Members should consider the disaster that recently befell the Timorese people when, under the very eyes of the United Nations forces, that country split apart.  In reality, the terms of this deployment are dictated to the United Nations on Israel&rsquo;s behalf by the United States.  Irish soldiers risk being caught in a murderous conflict between the Israel Defence Forces, IDF, and the Hizbollah.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If the United Nations considers a buffer zone to be necessary in southern Lebanon &mdash; in reality it is to protect the IDF &mdash; why does it not maintain a buffer zone in the south of Israel to protect the long-suffering Palestinian people of Gaza, who are now corralled and slaughtered weekly, in what is the greatest concentration camp in the world?  The solution to this crisis is not more United Nations forces.  It lies in the hands of the working people and peasants of the Lebanon, the Palestinian people and the Israeli working class.  It does not lie in the hands of the United Nations imperial powers, the Israeli ruling class, the inept Lebanese Government or any such force.  Moreover, it does not lie in the hands of Hizbollah either, which is a right-wing fundamentalist force.</P>
        <P>On the basis of a democratic and socialist Middle East, in which its resources are used for the benefit of the people of the region, the peoples can come together, work out a peace solution and live in peace.  This is the way forward rather than another short-term United Nations so-called solution, which will undoubtedly end in failure.  As a Socialist Party Deputy, I am the only Member to oppose this motion.  Unfortunately, under the rules of the House, this means there will be no division.  However, I believe this opposition will be vindicated by future events.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all Members for their contributions and for recognising the importance of the contribution of Ireland and the Defence Forces to international peace and security.  I am particularly grateful for the kind words and compliments from Members regarding the manner in which the Defence Forces have discharged such missions.  This debate reflects the high regard in which the Defence Forces are held as peacekeepers and the <Col N="496"/>warm regard which the people have for the Defence Forces.  This is recognition of the important role they play in the community they serve, both here and abroad.</P>
        <P>I will respond to some points raised by Members.  Deputy Timmins rightly sought assurances regarding the equipment and training the troops will receive before going to Lebanon and I am happy to provide such assurances.  The Deputy also referred to the enormity of the physical damage, a point with which I concur.  Approximately 30,000 buildings have been destroyed and as estimates of the damage come to between &euro;3 billion and &euro;6 billion, an enormous rebuilding job remains to be done.  Deputy Timmins also asked whether, on the conclusion of the mission to Liberia next year, the troops involved will be redeployed to UNIFIL II with the same mandate or with a different role.  I cannot say at present.  It will depend on both circumstances in the Lebanon and on demands on our resources elsewhere in the world at that time.</P>
        <P>Deputy Coveney referred to the possibility of our troops being asked to disarm Hizbollah.  As he rightly noted, this will not happen.  The disarmament of Hizbollah is the clear responsibility of the Lebanese Government and the United Nations has expressed the view that such disarmament can only take place within the context of an overall political settlement.</P>
        <P>Deputy Costello questioned the Irish troops&rsquo; role overseas.  As I noted, the two major outstanding problems &mdash; apart from the volatility of the situation &mdash; are the destruction of property and infrastructure and the quantity of unexploded ordnance.  The most recent estimate suggests that 350,000 unexploded pieces of ordnance remain in part of Lebanon, which is quite scary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>This refers to the cluster bombs that were used in the last days of the war.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, this refers to cluster bombs, cluster bomblets etc.</P>
        <P>I will explain the purpose of the Irish-Finnish contingent.  The Finnish contingent consists of engineers who will rebuild the infrastructure.  Any ordinary use of language would describe that activity as being humanitarian.  In addition, the Finns will clear unexploded ordnance in their area of operations.  Essentially, the Finnish contingent is an engineering unit and it will require protection.  The Finns will need troops to perform reconnaissance and to check out the safety of an area.</P>
        <P>At present, 677 troops are serving abroad.  As the maximum to which we are committed is 850 troops, not much capacity remains.  We did not have sufficient capacity to put together a full Irish contingent.  We examined how we could contribute usefully and this is what we came up with.  The Finns are delighted with it and the United Nations stated that it fits in perfectly with its <Col N="497"/>plans and it will be a successful mission.  The work the Irish troops will perform there is both real and valuable.  In addition to the work they will undertake with the Finns, the Irish contingent will remain as an asset of the overall force commander in the Lebanon.  He will be able to call upon the Irish troops to perform any other task he may wish to assign to them.  I refer to tasks such as escort duties, patrolling etc., within their area of operations.</P>
        <P>Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh and other Members referred to the possible danger to our troops.  When taking such a decision, all Ministers for Defence, of whatever political persuasion, are always conscious of the danger to the troops.  I agree with Deputy Gormley that this mission has the potential to be extremely dangerous.  However, both the Liberian and Kosovan missions were extremely dangerous initially.  From my perspective, this mission is not necessarily any more dangerous.  However, it must be monitored as it progresses.</P>
        <P>We have trained and equipped the troops to the maximum degree possible to try to ensure their safety.  Moreover, our troops have considerable experience in peacekeeping operations and peace enforcement operations.</P>
        <P>As to whether the mission falls under Chapter VI or Chapter VII, it is a Chapter VI mission and is described as such.  In general, Chapter VI missions occur when a ceasefire is in place, which is the case at present.  Basically, Chapter VI missions consist of monitoring to ensure that no one tries to break a ceasefire, that there are no arms transactions etc. and there is no training of illegal militias etc.  It simply consists of keeping an eye on the situation.  In Chapter VII missions, people must engage in what is called peace enforcement.  They are obliged to use force to compel people to separate from each other, or to get in between opposing armies.</P>
        <P>This is a Chapter VI mission.  A ceasefire has taken effect and, essentially, this will be a monitoring operation.  However, at some stage, I presume the Lebanese Government must discharge its obligation to disarm Hizbollah.  In that case, UNIFIL II will play a supporting role and will support the Lebanese army and Government.  The resolution contains wording to the effect that they are entitled to use all force to ensure that no one interferes with the discharge of their mandate.  While this might have a Chapter VII ring to it, it is really a Chapter VI mission.</P>
        <P>Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh also asked whether I would return to the House in six months time to discuss progress.  Such matters are always kept under regular review anyway.  If a debate is needed, or if the situation changes materially during the coming months, I expect the Whips will facilitate a debate in the House on the matter.  In any event, the Government will be obliged to act.</P>
        <P>Deputy Gormley referred to the activities of the Israeli army.  There is currently a United <Col N="498"/>Nations investigation into the use by the Israeli army of cluster bombs and I anxiously await its outcome.  Deputy Joe Higgins voiced his opposition to the mission.  He envisages the solution in terms of the working classes of Lebanon, Palestine and Israel all coming together.  Although that may be great, while we wait for the working classes to do so, we must go in to secure the situation, which is the purpose of this proposal.  I commend the proposal to the House.</P>

	<P>Recommittal is necessary in respect of amendment No. 1 as it does not arise from Committee Stage proceedings.  As amendment No. 1 is consequential on amendments Nos. 3 and 20, amendments Nos. 1, 3 and 20 may be discussed together, by agreement.</P>
        <P el="5">Bill recommitted in respect of amendment No. 1.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 5, line 31, after &ldquo;1999&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, TO AMEND THE HARBOURS ACT 1996&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Amendments Nos. 1, 3 and 20 were referred to in the instruction to committee motion.  I want to refer to the motion before proceeding with these amendments.  The House has agreed to consider the amendments together.  The amendments aim to provide that port companies and harbour authorities will enjoy immunity from being pursued for the recovery of damages in respect of injury to persons, damage to property or other loss alleged to have been caused by a failure to perform, or to comply with, any of their functions with regard to the licensing or storage of petroleum spirit under the Dangerous Substances Act 1972.</P>
        <P>Harbour authorities or port companies are charged with the granting of licences under section 21 of the 1972 Act, which provides that &ldquo;no person shall have petroleum-spirit in his possession or under his control except in a store licensed by the proper local or harbour authority&rdquo;.  Prior to the enactment of the Harbours Act 1996, harbours were under the control of harbour authorities under the Harbours Acts.  The <Col N="499"/>1996 Act facilitated the establishment of ten commercial State port companies which, since 1996, have continued to issue licences under the 1972 Act on the basis that section 83(1) of the 1996 Act allows for references to a &ldquo;harbour authority&rdquo; in the 1972 Act to be construed as references to a &ldquo;port company&rdquo; established under the 1996 Act.</P>
        <P>The Irish Ports Association, which represents the views of the State commercial ports, has expressed concern to the Department for some time about the position of port companies and harbour authorities under the licensing provisions of the Dangerous Substances Act 1972 in respect of the storage of petroleum spirit.  In summary, the Irish Ports Association contends that unlike local authorities, fire authorities and other licensing authorities, port companies cannot under existing legislation avail of any immunity from suit for their licensing responsibilities under the 1972 Act.</P>
        <P>I consider that this provision would give port companies and harbour authorities the same immunity that is enjoyed by other licensing authorities in respect of the type of proceedings which have been outlined.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which has responsibility for dangerous substances, has been consulted.  It has confirmed that it has no objection to the nature of the Department of Transport&rsquo;s proposed legislative amendment, which I have outlined.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I have absolutely no problem with these amendments.  This seems like a sensible provision to include in the legislation.  It is probably a result of an oversight that it is not in the Bill as it stands.  It does not seem right that a harbour authority should be open to being sued just because it is the licensing authority.  It is as if the Environmental Protection Agency could be sued for mismanagement at a waste licensing facility.  I have no problem with this measure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I take a slightly different view of the matter.  I am not sure of the justification for exempting port companies from liability.  It is not as if they are separate companies, based somewhere in the city centre, which just give out licences.  The port companies are responsible for the operation and safe maintenance of the ports within their remit.  I am not sure why they should be exempted.  Surely they should be legally responsible for operating the ports safely and ensuring that dangerous substances &mdash; petrol, in this case &mdash; are stored in an adequate manner.  I do not see any justification for giving them the kind of immunity that is provided for in these amendments.  The port companies have been compared to the Environmental Protection Agency or the Health and Safety Authority, but they offer somewhat different services.  They are not just licensing authorities &mdash; they also operate <Col N="500"/>the ports.  For that reason, they should have a clear legal responsibility to ensure that their operations are conducted safely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to add to Deputy Shortall&rsquo;s comments because I agree with her.  It seems strange that in many of the dealings we have had with port companies, they have taken an independent stance.  One would almost get the sense that they are private companies, operating completely separate from any Government direction.  They seem to wish to stand on their own two feet, compared to other private operators.  In such circumstances, I question whether they should be given separate protection in this manner.  I agree with Deputy Shortall&rsquo;s remarks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>These amendments do not represent a major departure.  When fire authorities and local authorities issue licences, the licensees have this responsibility.  This legislation allows for port authorities to issue licences.  If they are issuing licences to third parties, why should they have this responsibility for insurance purposes?  It is basically the same set of circumstances.  The Department of Transport has no difficulty with this proposal.  Similarly, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has no objection to the nature of this proposal.  As things stand, the chief executive of a port company is responsible in circumstances like those which have been mentioned.  The measure under discussion will ensure that the port companies will have immunity from suit.  We are not ring-fencing this proposal in a manner that ensures it applies to port companies only.  Other companies which issue licences, such as local authorities and fire services, do not have legal responsibility of this nature.  It is precisely the same principle.</P>
     
      </Speaker>
       <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think it is precisely the same.  The Fire Service is a particular emergency service.  It would not make sense to leave members of the Fire Service open to being sued in the event of a fire not being extinguished properly.  In this case we are discussing commercial entities with responsibility, in addition to a licensing role, for operation of the ports.  They should have a responsibility to operate those ports safely.  I accept theproposal put forward by the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Gallagher, in subsection (<i>c</i>) of his amendment regarding individual members of boards of port companies.  I see no reason the port company, as a commercial entity, should receive the immunity proposed by the Minister of State.  </P>
        <P>Any port company will have many responsibilities relating to the safe and commercially sound operation of the port under its authority.  What happens if a port company is negligent in the storage of dangerous substances, does not ensure adequate fire safety or allows petrol to be stored in unsuitable conditions and serious damage <Col N="501"/>ensues?  If this is a result of negligence then surely that commercial entity should bear legal responsibility for rectifying the damage done and should be capable of being sued when other people&rsquo;s property is damaged or where life is lost.  I cannot see any justification for what the Minister of State proposes and I oppose this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree that if such companies license themselves to store dangerous substances then they should bear responsibility.  However, why should this be the case if they are licensing third parties?  Surely the House will agree that a third party storing material in an area controlled by the port authority should bear such responsibility.  When the port company gives a third party a licence to store dangerous substances, with stringent conditions attached, the licensee should bear responsibility.  When the port company itself is storing the substances it must bear responsibility.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The companies are providing the facilities as operators of the port.  They are on the companies&rsquo; property.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>It is different if a company is storing the material for its own purposes, rather than hosting a third party.  The licensee should not be exonerated.</P>

        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(2) This Act comes into operation immediately on its passing into law.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The purpose of this Bill is to implement a European directive and once the Bill is agreed in both Houses of the Oireachtas there does not appear to be any reason it would be delayed.  This amendment seeks to ensure that when the Bill is passed it becomes effective immediately once signed by the President.  The Minister of State said on Committee Stage that this will happen automatically, but I am not clear that this is the case.  If it does happen automatically there cannot be any objection to including it in the Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Mitchell has presented the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I said on Committee Stage that I would reflect on this point, however section 2 is a standard provision that enables the Minister, by order, to commence the provisions of the Act.  I have difficulty with the proposed amendment and it does not add anything to the Bill.  Without the provision for commencement an Act automatically comes into operation immediately, which is what Deputies Mitchell and Ryan are proposing.  It is important that the Minister has discretion in this Bill because the commencement of different provisions may be varied to dovetail with international measures as they come into force.  If we consider international conventions, whether the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships&rsquo; Ballast Water or one of many others, it may not be possible to have all of the provisions become effective simultaneously.  There are different international instruments that do not enter into force on the same date and it is important, therefore, that the Minister sign an order.  If we did not have this incorporated into the Bill we would be complying with all of the instruments at once when, in fact, they could be varied.  I have no difficulty with this amendment in principle but the matter is greatly complicated by the many international conventions that do not come into force at the same time.  If they came into force at the same time I would not have difficulty with the amendment.  I ask the House to consider the predicament this amendment presents.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This amendment is an extension of the definition of the convention.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 7(2), referred to by Deputy Mitchell, states that the text is appended.

        <P FLI="0">We were also in disagreement on this on Committee Stage.  It seems to be taken that a declaration by the Minister that a country is a party to the convention is <i>de facto</i> evidence of that fact.  I understand from communicating with the Department on Committee Stage that this is in reference to legal proceedings and should be made clear in the Bill.  In the absence of this additional clause the Minister would, in theory, have the power to declare countries that were not party to the convention to be so, simply because he declared them so.  I believe the Minister of States disagrees with me.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his courtesy in dealing with the Bill and his staff for drafting it.  I was not involved in the Second Stage debate and came to the Bill late but I realise its importance and welcome it.  Given the growth in world trade and shipping generally, it is becoming increasingly important to protect our marine environment and ensure the safety of our ports.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I thank the Minister of State for his contribution and accepting a number of amendments on Committee Stage.  I dealt with the Bill for the Labour Party on Second Stage and it has had an amazing history in the House.  The major criticism we must <Col N="505"/>make is that it takes so long to add very important international legislation such as the MARPOL and Bunker conventions to the Irish legislative stock.  I hope the Bill will be made law in 2006 after its lengthy passage through the Houses.  It is good to see that the Minister of State, after his many travails in the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, is still dealing with matters concerning the marine in the Department of Transport.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, welcome the passage of the Bill and, given its long sojourn in the Houses, hope it can be brought into force very quickly.  I regret I was not able to resubmit some of the amendments I had tabled on Committee Stage.  Committee Stage took place so long ago that I cannot remember what procedural or other mistake I made such that I could not proceed to table my amendments on Report Stage.  As the basic intent of the Bill is supported by all parties in the House, I, therefore, welcome its implementation and function in managing our affairs on the seas and in our ports.</P>

        <P LI="2" FLI="0" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />the heroin drugs crisis that continues to cause appalling human misery in Ireland today;</P>
       <P LI="2" FLI="0" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />the spiralling drug related crime and feuding drug gangs that are a cause of great fear and concern in many communities;</P>
     <P LI="2" FLI="0" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />the huge wealth involved in the drug trade exploited by a small number of major crime gangs;</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />the increasing numbers of young people in disadvantaged areas being attracted into drug crime by the lavish lifestyles enjoyed by relatively minor drug dealers from within their own communities;</P><Col N="506"/>
      <P LI="2" FLI="0" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />the unprecedented seizures of heroin in recent months, notably a consignment with a street value of &euro;7 million seized in Ratoath, County Meath, and a further consignment worth &euro;10 million intercepted in Belgium <i>en route</i> to a private Irish airfield via private jet;</P>
    <P LI="2" FLI="0" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />the fact that the latter consignment was almost twice the value of all drugs seized during the whole of 2005 at Dublin Airport;</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />the fact that drug seizures account for on average a mere 10% of drug availability;</P>
      <P LI="2" FLI="0" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />the scale of the potential risk to society in this State posed by the trafficking of such vast amounts of heroin; and</P>

     <P LI="2" FLI="0" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />to provide the Garda with sufficient funding to continue running Operation Airwaves which, until its cancellation, monitored the movements of small aircraft at a number of the country&rsquo;s private airfields and led to the seizures of quantities of drugs;</P>

      <P LI="2" FLI="0" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />to respond to the lack of customs cover in 27 private airfields in the State and particularly to the situation at Weston Aerodrome brought to his attention in D&aacute;il Questions in December of last year, February of this year, and again in September of this year; and</P>
       <P LI="2" FLI="0" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />to show regard for basic security measures at Weston Aerodrome where there were only 16 customs inspections during 2005;</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0" el="5">calls on the Government:</P>
       <P LI="2" FLI="0" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />to acknowledge the grave error it has made and continues to make in failing to provide adequate Customs and Garda cover at private airfields which allowed drug traffickers to import large drug consignments into this State;</P><Col N="507"/>

       <P LI="2" FLI="0" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />to initiate immediate reform of the Customs and Excise function of the Revenue Commissioners supported by any necessary budgetary increase to fill this serious gap in customs cover;</P>
       <P LI="2" FLI="0" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />to request the Criminal Assets Bureau to investigate all those connected with the major heroin seizure referred to;</P>
      <P LI="2" FLI="0" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />to expand the Criminal Assets Bureau to include regionalised structures to ensure that middle ranking drug traffickers are targeted at local level throughout the State;</P>

        <P el="5">Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">To delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="is2p0" />&ldquo;&mdash;<Miles com="is0p6" /><Miles com="ix" />recognises that the global problem of drug misuse which is experienced in Ireland must continue to be tackled in an integrated manner across the different pillar headings of the national drugs strategy through a co-operative partnership approach involving the statutory, community and voluntary treatment sectors;</P>
         <P LI="2" FLI="0" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />wholeheartedly supports the Government in its ongoing implementation of the strategy;</P>
         <P LI="2" FLI="0" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />acknowledges the significant ongoing work being done under the four pillars of the national strategy &mdash; supply reduction, prevention, treatment and <Col N="508"/>research &mdash; and the decision to include a fifth pillar of rehabilitation to further focus initiatives in that area;</P>
       <P LI="2" FLI="0" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />notes that the key finding of the mid-term review of the national drugs strategy in 2005 was that the current aims and objectives of the strategy are fundamentally sound and that progress was being made across the four pillars of the strategy;</P>
      <P LI="2" FLI="0" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />welcomes the significant increase in funding provided this year to the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs for drugs initiatives;</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />supports the Government&rsquo;s top policing priority for 2006 to continue to target organised crime, including drug trafficking, and the gun culture with which it is associated;</P>
       <P LI="2" FLI="0" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />acknowledges the continued operational successes of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs authorities in meeting and exceeding the drug supply reduction targets set in the national drugs strategy;</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />welcomes the record high level of finances being provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this year&rsquo;s budget which enables the Garda authorities to implement targeted, intelligence driven and high intensity operations against organised crime, with a special focus on drug crime;</P>
      <P LI="2" FLI="0" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />commends the success of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s anti-crime measures such as Operation Anvil, Operation Clean Street, Operation Encounter, Operation Nightcap and Operation Marigold and supports the implementation of such ongoing measures targeted towards the prevention and detection of crime such as gangland murders, organised crime, drug trafficking and other criminal activity which gives rise to serious community concern;</P>
         <P LI="2" FLI="0" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />commends the record levels of Garda personnel strength now available to Garda management which will permit the deployment of extra resources to be targeted at areas of concern;</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />applauds the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau in continuing to achieve considerable success in depriving persons engaged in criminal activity from retaining the proceeds of their crime through its highly effective co-ordinated multi-agency, <Col N="509"/>multi-disciplinary and partnership approach;</P>
      <P LI="2" FLI="0" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />supports the comprehensive strategy of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in place to deal with the threat of organised crime, including drug trafficking;</P>
       <P LI="2" FLI="0" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />acknowledges that the Government&rsquo;s legislative package for tackling serious and organised crime, including drug trafficking, is already viewed as being one of the toughest in Europe and welcomes the introduction of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 which provides a package of further anti-crime measures which will help enhance the powers of the Garda in the investigation and prosecution of offences;</P>
       <P LI="2" FLI="0" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />notes that the Customs and Excise Service is continuously engaged in the analysis and evaluation of drug seizure trends, routes and smuggling risks, international trends and best practice;</P>
       <P LI="2" FLI="0" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />notes that the monitoring of licensed aerodromes in the State by the Revenue Commissioners is currently in line with international standards and that, in light of the recent seizure in Belgium of 50 kg of heroin which is believed to have been destined for Weston Aerodrome, the Revenue Commissioners are reviewing the risks attached to the operation of all 27 licensed aerodromes in the State; and</P>
       <P LI="2" FLI="0" el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />notes that the Revenue Commissioners have commenced a review of the approval conditions of licensed aerodromes.&rdquo;</P>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to focus on the drug supply reduction aspect of this debate.  As my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Noel Ahern, pointed out yesterday evening, drugs law enforcement is one of the pillar headings of the Government&rsquo;s drug policy framework, namely, the national drugs strategy.  I reiterate the point that the Government&rsquo;s top policing priority continues to be the targeting of organised crime, including drug trafficking and the gun culture with which it is associated.  In order to assist in its consideration of such matters, I wish to provide the House with more detail regarding the measures and strategies that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the customs service of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners already have in place in tackling these activities.  More<Col N="510"/>over, I wish to respond to a number of matters which have already been raised concerning the Government&rsquo;s drug law enforcement efforts during this debate.</P>
        <P>Given its nature, tackling drug trafficking demands local, national and international responses and is primarily intelligence led.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na invokes a number of broad strategic responses to address the issue.  These include identifying, targeting and dismantling national and international drug trafficking networks that supply and distribute illegal drugs within this State; conducting intelligence-driven operations focusing on all aspects of the illicit drugs trade, including commodity, logistics, distribution and financing; working with other national and international law enforcement agencies on joint actions designed to reduce the availability of drugs and the proceeds derived from the drugs trade; and working in partnership with statutory, community and voluntary groups to reduce both the supply and demand for drugs in society.</P>
        <P>Best practice in customs administration worldwide shows that the development of information and intelligence is critical to the detection of drug smuggling.  This has become very important in Ireland since the completion of the Single Market in 1993, which is based on the free movement of goods and people within the Community.  People travelling within the European Union have the right to free movement and Revenue has no power to stop them except on the basis of a suspicion that is normally grounded in specific intelligence.</P>
        <P>The Customs service liaises on an ongoing basis with other national and international enforcement services such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with which there are in place a formal memorandum of understanding and protocols to facilitate joint operations, the Naval Service, the Air Corps and foreign customs and police services.  It takes part regularly in European, bilateral and national surveillance operations focused on specific drug smuggling methodologies, including general aviation.  Some operations of this nature have been directed specifically at light aircraft and helicopter movements.</P>
        <P>The Customs service also shares and receives information and intelligence on drug smuggling from a number of international bodies, including the World Customs Organisation, the United Nations Drug Control Programme, Interpol, the Council of Europe, Europol and the United Kingdom&rsquo;s Serious Organised Crime Agency.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; Customs service is continually engaged in the analysis and evaluation of seizure trends, routes and smuggling risks and consequential resource deployment.  All Customs operations are risk focused and staff are deployed to combat areas of greatest risk.  Revenue constantly reviews staffing levels and structures to ensure that resources are matched to risk.  Previously, it was noted that tackling <Col N="511"/>organised crime and drug trafficking is achieved primarily through the use of specialist units and targeted intelligence-led operations and I wish to highlight some of the results of such measures.</P>
        <P>Since November 2005, with the establishment of the organised crime unit in conjunction with the Garda national drugs unit and local garda&iacute;, Operations Anvil and Oak have targeted criminals involved in the trafficking of drugs to prevent the resultant feuds which can arise between them.  Since November 2005, significant drug seizures have been made as a result of these operations including 30 kg of heroin, 35 kg of cocaine and 1.4 tonnes of cannabis resin, with an approximate cumulative street value of &euro;20.5 million.  In addition, quantities of arms and cash have been recovered by the Garda through this work.  This has led to the arrest of 41 persons and a further 26 are before the courts at present.  These ongoing operations will continue dismantling a number of drug trafficking networks in the State and will continue to be implemented by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, backed up by the provision of the requisite level of resources by the Government.</P>
        <P>As for the issue raised regarding huge levels of wealth being generated and flaunted by organised criminals involved in the drugs trade, such individuals&rsquo; activities are characteristically driven by pure greed and are carried out with a total lack of regard for the effects of their drug dealing on the well-being of the people and communities in which they operate.  The Garda will continue to pursue vigorously any such wealth accrued by identified drug trafficking criminals, either through the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 or through the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau under the statutory remit of that agency.</P>
        <P>In order to enhance the effectiveness of this strategy on a nationwide basis, since 2004 an initiative has been developed by the Criminal Assets Bureau in conjunction with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, in which one member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from every Garda division will undergo training as a profiler in respect of criminal assets.  At present, a divisional criminal assets profiler has been appointed in each of the 25 Garda divisions and a full complement of divisional profilers is being maintained.  The appointment of additional profilers will be kept under review, depending on the threats posed.</P>
        <P>The benefits of such ongoing law enforcement efforts, which are often carried out in a dangerous and threatening environment, are demonstrated by the continued high level of drug seizures made by both the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs authorities, as well as their continued success in bringing serious drug traffickers to book and putting them out of business.  Both agencies should be acknowledged and warmly commended in this debate for so doing.</P><Col N="512"/>
        <P>No one on the Government side is na&iuml;ve regarding this issue and we acknowledge fully that tackling the problem of drug trafficking remains an ongoing challenge to be faced with vigilance.  However, it is one that the Government, in conjunction with its law enforcement agencies, will continue to tackle as a priority under one of the main pillar headings of its overall national drugs strategy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Ardagh.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>While I should not say this, I would be as happy to be in Lansdowne Road cheering on my neighbour, Robbie Keane, as he leads out the Irish team.  My best wishes go to them.</P>
        <P>However, the House is concerned with a serious debate this evening.  I notice that my colleagues, Deputies Catherine Murphy and Healy, are present.  I compliment the Independent group for tabling this motion and providing Members with an opportunity to discuss this matter.  I listened carefully to what Deputy Murphy said last night.  In her fine contribution, she made reference to recent events at Weston Aerodrome.  It is important for us to spend a minute or two dwelling on that issue.</P>
        <P>It is clear that the smashing of a major drug smuggling ring some weeks ago by the Garda and their colleagues in Belgium and Holland shut down a significant drugs channel into Dublin.  It is important that we acknowledge the work of the Garda not only in that operation but in general.  Security at Weston Aerodrome should be on a par with the procedures at Dublin Airport and other major airports.  I strongly believe that international flights into Weston Aerodrome should face the same level of security as similar flights into any other airport.  The operators of that airfield should conduct a review to ensure that is the case.  I know I have the support of many of my colleagues in saying that.</P>
        <P>It is important to acknowledge that life is becoming more difficult for drug gangs at every level.  I refer to those who deal in drugs on the streets of Dublin, those who try to bring drugs through our ports and airports and those who meet international drug smugglers in other countries.  Garda surveillance and intelligence gathering is scoring major victories in the ongoing war on crime and drugs, and it is important to acknowledge that.</P>
        <P>I do not want to talk about my constituency or my community in a negative way, obviously.  It is important we support those who are fighting drugs in all our communities.  Tallaght is no different in that regard.  While I am talking about the justice element, I express my support for the drugs units in all our towns.  I live in Tallaght, <Col N="513"/>work in Tallaght and represent Tallaght within my constituency along with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan.  It is important to mention that the drugs unit in Tallaght is worthy of our strong support.  When the country was talking about other matters last week, I tried to focus on making the point that Tallaght, the third largest centre of population in the country, needs more garda&iacute; and a new Garda station.  The west Tallaght area could also benefit from the location of a Garda station there.  I support the proposal to develop such a facility.  I ask the Minister of State to convey to the T&aacute;naiste my belief that Tallaght needs more garda&iacute; on the streets.  The drugs unit based in Tallaght Garda station also needs to be beefed up so it can continue the good work it is doing in conjunction with the general police force.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I acknowledge publicly the tireless efforts of the many organisations in all our communities which are doing so much to combat the drugs problem.  I am not sensitive about saying that Tallaght has led the way in community endeavour.  Many groups have done a tremendous job in that regard.  The Tallaght Rehabilitation Project, for example, hit the headlines last week following its recent move to Kiltalown House, an historic building in west Tallaght.  I know I am not supposed to mention the President, but I would like to inform the House that President McAleese joined the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, Deputy Crowe and me at the official opening last week.  It was good to hear the President speaking so positively about the work of that initiative.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also want to mention briefly some of the other organisations in my community, including the Brookfield addiction response programme, the St. Dominic community response programme, the St. Aengus community response programme and JADD.</P>
        <P>The SWAN network, a family support group that operates in the Springfield estate where I live, aims to provide practical support to families which are under stress due to substance use issues within the family setting.  The network uses a professional and holistic approach in a confidential, respectful and non-judgmental environment.  It offers a tremendous service to the local and wider community in Tallaght.  I have highlighted the SWAN network specifically among all the other groups in my constituency, with which my colleagues will be familiar, because it tends to be ignored when decisions are being made about funding and support.  It is often not clear where the network should go in search of funding.  Many people have reminded the Tallaght drugs task force that organisations like the SWAN network should get more help than they are getting.  My predecessor as Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy in the constituency, Chris Flood, who was chairman of the task force for some time, would be keen for me to express my support for that viewpoint and I <Col N="514"/>am happy to do so.  Perhaps the Minister of State will convey my concerns in that regard to the Ministers.  I am anxious to ensure that resources continue to be made available to all the groups in my community.  I have singled out the SWAN network because it falls between the various stools to some degree.</P>
        <P>We need to support those who are afflicted by drug abuse.  It is important to help the families of drug users and addicts to understand that their relatives can be helped and looked after.  Those of us who have the privilege of representing communities &mdash; Tallaght is no worse than any other community &mdash; should support the ongoing work to which I have referred.</P>
        <P>I want to speak briefly about the challenges which are being faced by many organisations which deal with people who are afflicted by drugs.  A number of worrying trends are evident, such as the illegal trade of prescription drugs, including sleeping tablets and other products.  The Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, is much better acquainted with this problem than I am.  Many prescription drugs are being made available legally before being sold on illegally.  Many people in our communities have identified that this is becoming quite a problem and needs to be dealt with.  There is some illegal trade in methadone, which is made available to wean people off heroin.  The Minister of State should tell the Ministers that there is a need for stricter policing of methadone clinics.  I have been told that it is quite easy to buy tablets on the open market throughout the Dublin region.  We need to examine this area and take some action.</P>
        <P>When dealing with drug addiction and rehabilitation, it is important to focus on the key issue of education and to offer support to addicts and their families.  That is why I expressed my support for the organisations in my community and elsewhere which are doing their best to help those who need assistance.  It is important we continue to offer such support.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge, in fairness to the Department, that a great deal of public money has been made available to support many projects and to meet the needs of many estates in my constituency.  I will not list all the projects again.  I compliment the Minister of State in that regard.  My colleague Mick Billane, a former Fianna F&aacute;il councillor, has often made the point that it is much better to spend money on community facilities, community endeavour and doing things for young people in the community than to help to create the circumstances in which we have to visit those young people in various institutions, as we often have to do.  It is a simple message &mdash; it may even be a coy soundbite &mdash; but it is important for us to continue to follow it.  My community is not the only one which is linked to this trade.</P>
        <P>Deputies should use the opportunity presented by this debate to send a clear signal that the D&aacute;il supports those who are involved in the fight <Col N="515"/>against drugs.  While drugs and drug dealing is not just a law and order issue, as I said earlier, it is first and foremost a law and order issue.  I am glad the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights, Deputy Ardagh, is present to hear me saying that.  We must continue to view it as a law and order issue in the first instance.  I have been told the situation has not radically deteriorated in my community or anywhere else.  At the same time, clear challenges need to be confronted.  I have already argued that more garda&iacute; are needed in major population centres to deal with these issues.  We need to continue to focus on the other side of the argument by helping organisations working with drug addicts to build up their resources.  We have to ensure that good programmes are available and give as much support as possible to young people who need to be encouraged to avoid the dangers posed by drugs.</P>
        <P>This is a very important debate.  It is good that we are having it and that we are taking the opportunity, on what I hope will be a good night for Ireland, to support those who are involved in the fight against drugs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh"><NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy O&rsquo;Connor for allowing me to share time.  I represent the constituency of Dublin South-Central which takes in some of the most deprived areas in Dublin, including Fatima Mansions, Dolphin House, Merchant&rsquo;s Quay and St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate.  The devastation caused over the years by drug and alcohol abuse to personal, family and community life is all too evident in these areas.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">The way the State interacts with such communities largely dictates the approach of wider society and the relative success in solving these problems.  In the cases of Fatima and St. Michael&rsquo;s House money invested recently and the work of the local community have improved the areas and helped the regeneration of flats.  It is possible that this will be replicated in Dolphin House and St. Teresa&rsquo;s Gardens.  Local drugs task forces have been engaged in the challenge also.</P>
        <P>Ten years ago, when I began in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, the situation was deplorable.  Things have improved, but not sufficiently.  Drug use is often seen as a problem that impacts on individuals, communities and society but not on families.  It is estimated that there are 15,000 heroin users in Ireland and that means 15,000 families are blighted by addiction.  Not only is it a life of addiction but it brings total marginalisation and poverty.</P>
        <P>This relates only to heroin.  I recently read statistics on the quantity of drugs seized by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from 2000 to 2005.  Heroin seized rose from 23.9 kg to 32.28 kg over those six years.  That represents an increase of only 35%.  I say &ldquo;only&rdquo; because it is small relative to the amount of cocaine seized in recent years.  In 2000 18 kg of <Col N="516"/>cocaine was seized and in 2001 it was 5.3 kg.  By 2004 this had risen to 167.3 kg and by 2005 it reached 229.38 kg.  This is an increase of 1,174%.  Those of us representing marginalised areas are aware of the availability of cocaine and how it has substituted for heroin to a large extent.  However, the use of cocaine is not a problem confined to marginalised areas.  It badly affects people in all strata of society.  It leads to health and addiction problems that result in the type of marginalisation and poverty that many people in the inner city and other deprived areas have experienced.</P>
        <P>I congratulate Kerry Life Education Limited which carried out an excellent seminar, Getting a Grip 2006, in Killarney last Friday.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, attended and raised the problem of over-the-counter drugs in addition to hard drugs.  Such drugs are often seen as headache tablets and the like but are used to such an extent that they have an effect on people&rsquo;s mental and physical health.  Deputy Lynch mentioned prescribed drugs and many people taking such drugs are consequently suffering greatly.</P>
        <P>Many of those at the seminar raised the issue of alcohol.  In Ireland we do not pay as much attention to addiction to the drug that is alcohol as in other countries.  There is a great need to consider the recommendations of the strategic task force on alcohol which issued its second report in September 2004.  If the price of a drug is increased demand for that drug is affected.  With the upcoming budget in mind, we must consider increasing the price of alcoholic beverages to have a substantial effect on demand, particularly among young people.  We must examine the manner in which we, as parents and role models, behave in terms of alcohol so that, in future, young people can change how alcohol is approached.</P>
        <P>Regarding poverty, the State must continue to put significant funds into the local drugs task forces, the youth facilities services programme and the various emerging funds such as the premises initiatives.  Merchant&rsquo;s Quay Ireland has provided some important statistics.  Over 75% of drug users in treatment left school before they were 16 years old.  This presents a challenge to ensure such children return to the education system, not necessarily through the standard schooling process but through special schools and through the endeavour of many hard pressed community workers.  The children may be reluctant to return to the education system and the task of bringing them on stream is difficult and trying.  I commend the people working with these children.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some 74% of all drug users are unemployed.  The link between poverty, social exclusion and drug use has been recognised both in Ireland and abroad.  The problem of drug use is particularly prevalent in areas with high levels of poverty, long-term unemployment, poor or insecure hous<Col N="517"/>ing, early school leaving and crime and urban neglect.  I often examine the statistics detailing where children who go to university have come from.  Very few from Dublin 8, Dublin 10 and Dublin 12 go on to University College Dublin.  Thankfully, there are post-leaving certificate courses which can act as a stepping stone.  Ultimately, these children do not go on to third level education because people living at such addresses do not receive the requisite amount or type of education to come through.</P>
        <P>There is still much work to be done on the drugs issue.  The Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Noel Ahern, last night, and the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, tonight, clarified what their respective Departments are doing to deal with this issue.  Overall, there is a huge job to do and we are only getting started.  We must continue to work hard to try to have a substantial effect in the forthcoming years.  Combating drugs is a major battle and we can never say it has been won.</P>

	<P>Ba mhaith liom na Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la Neamhsple&aacute;cha a mholadh as ucht an r&uacute;n caoithi&uacute;il seo a chur &oacute;s comhair na D&aacute;la agus an seans a thabhairt d&uacute;inn g&eacute;irch&eacute;im na ndruga&iacute; a phl&eacute;.  I commend the Independent Deputies on bringing this very timely motion before the House.  It affords us the opportunity to debate this major crisis, which is causing very serious nationwide disruption and concern.  The Labour Party will support the motion during the vote this evening.</P>
        <P>The motion states the D&aacute;il notes &ldquo;the health implications for drug users and other vulnerable young people and the collateral damage caused to families and communities&rdquo;.  Collateral damage caused to families and communities relates to road safety, among other issues.  This requires urgent attention but is largely overlooked.  I recently asked the Minister for Transport in parliamentary questions for his proposals to introduce a breathalyser system to test drivers for illegal drugs and also for the evidence he has regarding the extent of impairment of drivers arising from the presence of illegal drugs in their systems.  He informed me that the Road Traffic Acts provide that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may, where he or she believes a person in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place is under the influence of a drug or drugs to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of that vehicle, require that person to go to a Garda station and further require him or her to submit a blood or urine sample which would then be subject to analysis by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.</P><Col N="518"/>
        <P>The Minister also replied that, of 569 specimens tested in 2004 for the presence of a drug or drugs, 354 tested positive and 215 were found to be negative for the presence of a drug or drugs.  These tests were carried out by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, which continues to analyse blood and urine specimens for the presence of a drug or drugs.  Unfortunately the Minister informed me there is no feasible basis for the introduction of a scheme of preliminary roadside testing for drugs at present.  He did point out, however, that screening devices based on oral fluid specimens are being developed for the purpose of carrying out roadside drug testing.  He also outlined that the Medical Bureau of Road Safety is keeping abreast of developments in this area but that these testing devices are in the prototype stage.</P>
        <P>In a study carried out by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, it was indicated that 15.5% of tested drivers were positive for one or more drugs, that of the drivers who were under the limit for alcohol, 33.1% were positive for one or more drugs, and that of the drivers with very low or zero levels of alcohol, 67.9% were positive for drugs.  This is an astonishing result.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State should note that there is an urgent need to address this area properly.  If, for example, a garda finds a person smoking cannabis or taking some other illegal drug in a mechanically propelled vehicle, the garda can charge that person with a crime.  If that charge is upheld by the courts, a further conviction can follow, that is, of committing a crime while in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle.</P>
        <P>A second conviction can lead to a driving ban.  However, if a garda stops a person who has drugs in his or her system, that garda must effectively rely on the legislation which predates the introduction of the breathalyser to test for drunk driving.  There is a need to introduce limits for illegal drugs and for poly-drug intake to make our roads safer.  Doing so would also identify those who are using illegal drugs.  It is not good enough that if a garda apprehends a person on suspicion of being in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place and of being under the influence of a drug or drugs to such an extent as being incapable of having proper control of that vehicle, he or she must proceed on the basis of his or her visual assessment of the situation.  The garda can require the person to go to a Garda station and further require him or her to submit to a blood test or provide a urine sample, which would then be analysed.</P>
        <P>The statistics I have quoted are based on a two-year research programme on drug analysis of blood and urine samples in 2001 and 2002, and also on testing in 2004.  There is abundant evidence that circumstances pertaining to the use of illegal drugs have gotten a great deal worse since then.  Impairment must be proven when somebody is apprehended while in charge of a mech<Col N="519"/>anical vehicle in a public place and in this regard tests involving legal limits are obviously required.  Appropriate legal measures need to be introduced urgently to deal with this appalling threat to public safety.</P>
        <P>In early July, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs published a report entitled &ldquo;What everyone should know about Cannabis&rdquo;.  Cannabis is the most widely used illegal drug in western societies.  In the past, its use was regarded as less serious than the use of other drugs and, in some quarters, was regarded as harmless.  However, the findings of the committee suggest this is far from the reality.  Over one third of Irish schoolchildren have tried cannabis by the age of 16 and 9% of Irish 16 year olds use cannabis at least three times per month, with as many girls as boys now using it.  About one in ten is dependent on it, which amounts to 28,000 current users of cannabis.  Surveys indicate that the majority of Irish people do not want cannabis legalised and a substantial minority of past and current cannabis users do not wish to see it legalised either.</P>
        <P>There is now compelling evidence that cannabis abuse can result in the development of psychotic illness in later life.  Prolonged exposure to cannabis can induce changes to neurotransmitter pathways in vulnerable people, which can result in serious illness, such as schizophrenia in some and cognitive impairment in others.</P>
        <P>In recent years it has become clear that the human brain continues to develop during adolescence and it appears that cannabis use during this developmental phase, when brain architecture relating to some higher functions is being fine-tuned, is most likely to result in long-term impairment.  It is reliably estimated that there are some 300,000 users of cannabis in the State and in view of the consequences for their mental and physical health, the joint committee recommends that a national strategy be drawn up with the aim of reversing the exponential rise in cannabis use over the past decade.  Particular emphasis must be paid to young women of childbearing age and to their children, as well as to young people in general given their vulnerability to mental health problems.</P>
        <P>There needs to be further neurobiological and clinical research to examine the long-term cognitive impairment effects associated with heavy cannabis use, particularly those impairments relating to heavy use in adolescence and to prenatal exposure.  The physical effects of cannabis use and the health risks are greater than those for conventional tobacco because cannabis smoke contains more carcinogens and has a higher tar content.  The cannabis trade in Ireland is worth an estimated &euro;375 million and is the largest component of the vile drugs trade.  The committee was united in expressing the view that greater resources be devoted to criminal investigation <Col N="520"/>and that there should be more proactive pursuit of those who gain from it financially, as is the case with class A drugs.</P>
        <P>Awareness of the risk of cannabis use needs to be raised through public information campaigns focused particularly on young people and their parents and we need to understand that cannabis is primarily a health issue.  Cannabis is as socially unacceptable as cocaine or heroin and the drug barons who profit from it should be pursued with the full rigour of the law.  The so-called leisure use of cocaine is a new departure which must give rise to the gravest concern.  Too many of those cocaine users do not appear to connect its purchase with very violent criminals who are the major beneficiaries of this wicked trade.  It is incumbent on all of us, in particular the Government, to use every possible means to get this message across.</P>
        <P>There is crack cocaine in north inner city Dublin.  At least 80% of crack cocaine users develop an addiction, usually within a fortnight of their first smoke, while 7% of cocaine users become addicts in approximately 18 months.  The high risk associated with cocaine is unparalleled.  I understand the affects of crack cocaine can last for 40 to 50 seconds and never exceeds a few minutes.  The high from cocaine lasts for half an hour and that from heroin for three to four hours.  Crack cocaine is a particularly lethal and awful drug.  There is plenty of cocaine in the country and the establishment of so-called cocaine factories is not particularly difficult.  It is imperative that the spread of crack cocaine is prevented and eliminated, where it is already available.</P>
        <P>The Government needs to demonstrate a much greater sense of purpose and effectiveness to come to terms with the drugs crisis, which is a problem in every town and village.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment the Independent Deputies for putting together this very important and relevant motion on the drugs crisis.  Irrespective of anything the Minister of State with responsibility for drugs strategy said last night, or what the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform says on a regular basis, the situation has continued to deteriorate over the years.  It has not been improving at all.  More drugs are seized, more sectors of the community are experiencing drug use, more people are using drugs and more new drugs than ever before are coming on the market. </P>
        <P>The use of the Liffey boardwalk in Dublin for drug pushing during the summer highlighted the extent of the problem in just one area.  In a three-month period the Garda arrested over 400 people on the boardwalk under the Misuse of Drugs Act.  That provides a pin picture of the situation.</P>
        <P>The quantity of drugs seized in recent months is greater than at any time in the history of the State.  Clearly, the drug barons are stocking up well for Christmas.  A consignment of heroin <Col N="521"/>worth &euro;7 million was seized in Ratoath, County Meath last month.  A consignment worth &euro;10 million was intercepted in Belgium <i>en route</i> by private jet to a private airfield, Weston Aerodrome this month.  A consignment of at least &euro;10 million was seized yesterday in Northern Ireland and it is widely believed it was intended for this jurisdiction.  When it is considered that only 5% to 10% of all drugs imported into this country are seized by the Garda and Customs and Excise, it is clear the illegal drug market in Ireland is worth well in excess of &euro;1 billion.</P>
        <P>When it is further considered that there are an estimated 15,000 drug addicts in the country and that an estimated 75% of inmates in Mountjoy Prison are there for drug-related offences &mdash; as Governor Lonergan tells us on a regular basis &mdash; we have some idea of the amount of crime being committed to feed addictions, the cost to the taxpayer and the human cost to victims against whom crimes are perpetrated.</P>
        <P>The opportunity to tackle the heroin problem, which the motion specifically deals with, existed for about 15 years, from 1979 until 1993-94.  It was confined to the capital up to about 1994 and remained a Dublin problem, almost exclusively, for 15 years.  A window of opportunity existed, while local disadvantaged communities got little help from the authorities and attempted to fight back.  With the failure to address the issue in the capital, the virtual immunity from prosecution of the drug barons and the increasing wealth being generated from the illegal drugs trade, the problem spread rapidly throughout the provinces in the mid-1990s, as the Celtic tiger began to appear.  The arrogance of the drug barons culminated in the murder of Ms Veronica Guerin in 1996.  While they were then targeted by the Garda drug units and the Criminal Assets Bureau and had to flee the jurisdiction, they were still able to direct their activities from Spain and the Netherlands.  They have continued to prosper since they left and have established networks throughout the country.  This means that every drug which comes into the country can be distributed in every province.  Moreover, they have become exceedingly dangerous.  Gangland feuds and turf wars are the order of the day.  The Minister tells us, of course, that he is well in control of the situation &mdash; the dying sting of the wasp.  A couple of years ago he had it all under of control, but it is still the order of the day.  Weapons are now being imported with drug consignments and dissident and redundant paramilitaries from the Northern Ireland conflict are using their skills increasingly as enforcers in the illegal drugs trade in this jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>The drugs trade is effectively out of the control of the authorities.  They have an uphill battle to try to control it.  There is little interest or leadership at Government level, only lip service and sound bites from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  None of the pillars of the national drugs strategy is being effectively <Col N="522"/>implemented.  These are supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research.  Likewise, the new pillar that has recently been added to the strategy, namely, rehabilitation, is starved of resources.  A whole new approach is required if our young people are to be protected from the scourge of drugs and our citizens and communities from drug-related crime.</P>
        <P>We need to restate and reaffirm the strategy already in existence and we must fund its five pillars with the necessary resources and personnel to carry out the programme and to assist, in particular, the local drugs task forces.  We must build up our communities, which are still blighted despite a decade of the Celtic tiger, and which provide lucrative markets for drug pushers.  The revitalising of areas by planning, investment and development programmes &mdash; RAPID &mdash; must be reactivated and revamped.  This programme promised an injection of &euro;2 billion from the national development plan to target blighted and disadvantaged communities, to provide child care services, after-school support, leisure facilities, employment opportunities for young people leaving school and so on.  That was in 2002, before the election.  As the Minister of State well knows, it never materialised and now it has degenerated into the odd drip hand-out of dormant funds here and there from the slush funds of various Ministers, in particular the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, and the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern.</P>
        <P>Not only must we be tough on the causes of drug addiction, we must be tough on the pushers of drugs.  The moneys seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau must be reinvested in the blighted communities from which they have been extracted.  The addicts, whose lives have been wasted and the victims on whom criminal acts have been perpetrated, should see their areas benefit from the drug barons&rsquo; ill-gotten gains that have been seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau.  Finally, Garda drug units must develop a much more sophisticated approach to controlling the supply of drugs.  They must map out their areas of responsibility, target and monitor the dealers and their networks, be ready to swoop when a consignment arrives and be sufficiently knowledgeable to target and prevent the importation of such consignments.  A 10% success rate is not enough.  Community policing is an essential element; it is the eyes and ears of the police force.  It is imperative that a meaningful structure of community policing is immediately established.  The treatment by the Garda authorities of community policing as the Cinderella of the police force must be radically changed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>Sinn F&eacute;in tabled a comprehensive motion on this subject in May and I welcome the opportunity to speak about the issue of drugs in Ireland.  When we turn on our television sets we see the problem of drug abuse in soap operas and films.  One can see the problems with drugs outside one&rsquo;s own door in many areas.  I would argue that one could find drugs being taken in every pub in Dublin.  I would be surprised if there was even one nightclub in Dublin where one could not find drugs.</P>
        <P>We must decide whether there is simply a difficulty or a crisis.  I believe it is a crisis and one that is worsening.  Deputy Ardagh alluded to the fact that there has been a 35% increase in heroin seizures.  Cocaine seizures have grown by 1,600% in the past six years.  While I welcome these seizures, the country is awash with drugs and only a certain section is being detected.  Others have spoken of the role of the CAB and the garda&iacute; and I am supportive of their work, but I do not remember the last time the CAB moved on a drug dealer in my area.  Perhaps they have done so but I am not aware of it.  It is not happening enough.  Many gangs have been operating in my area for the past ten to 15 years.  The garda&iacute; know who they are &mdash; I know who they are &mdash; and they are causing misery and death in my area.</P>
        <P>I was told today about a young addict who has abscesses on many of his veins and, in desperation, he is injecting into his groin.  What can any elected representative say to that young person to help get him off drugs?  We must be able to tell addicts that programmes and facilities are available to them should they want to come off drugs in the morning.  The problem is that it may take up to 12 months to get treatment &mdash; it is even longer in some areas.  We cannot tell young people seeking help that facilities are available to them.</P>
        <P>What does one say to a father or mother whose son or daughter has died of an overdose?  I do not know how many such funerals I have attended.  The son of friends of mine died on a toilet bowl with a needle injected into his arm.  What can one say to that family?  One has to look them in the eye and tell them one is trying one&rsquo;s best to ensure it does not happen to any other child.  The only way to do this is by waking up to the crisis that exists.  I am not trying to score points for the Opposition when I say that a crisis exists.  One only has to talk to people to recognise that.  It is in our faces every day.</P>
        <P>I have seen many talented, energetic, intelligent and bright young people turned into living wrecks.  I have grown up with people who have <Col N="524"/>died from drug abuse.  People are seeking leadership on this.  It is not a party political matter.  We should acknowledge the crisis and provide the facilities.  A Minister from the Limerick area addressed this debate earlier.  Why is methadone not available for addicts in the Limerick area?  Why must addicts from Limerick, Cork and Arklow come to Dublin for services?  How can a person seeking to move beyond his or her addiction gain employment if his or her treatment entails travelling to Dublin for methadone, counselling or other treatment?</P>
        <P>A recent &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; broadcast showed problem areas around the country where local representatives said they agreed with helping addicts but not in their backyard.  There is a responsibility on all public representative, particularly TDs, to support services in local areas.  This means standing up to bigots living in the area and those people who are living in cloud cuckoo land and do not realise the crisis that exists.</P>
        <P>It also means supporting needle exchange programmes.  Many people have difficulty with this notion.  I mentioned a young person who was injecting into his groin.  One can only imagine the effect that a lack of clean needles will eventually have on him.  The importance of offering clean needles is that addicts are being brought into centres where they can avail of services.  These people are at risk from diseases like hepatitis C, AIDS, HIV etc.  Hopefully they will accept help.</P>
        <P>If an addict is seeking help it should be available.  It is not currently available and that is why I am calling for more services to be put in place.  It is not as if this is a poor country that does not have the resources.  I cannot understand why we are not doing this.  Many areas have community facilities with available space but we are not using them.  It seems that there are difficulties between the HSE and the local communities as to who will be in charge.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Addicts&rsquo; families need support too.  The voluntary drug treatment element needs to be worked on.  The fifth pillar is rehabilitation.  This is essential in bringing addicts into employment and living their lives to the fullest extent.  We need to support addicts as much as possible.  Unfortunately, this pillar has fallen down.  My party has been associated with trying to combat the drugs problem.  We do not have all the answers, but many of us live in areas that are affected by it.  I am in daily contact with families seeking help and I need to be confident enough to tell those families that help is available for them.</P>
     
        <P>Addicts who inject cocaine inject more often than those who inject heroin.  Many of them inject the same points in their legs, arms, groin or neck, which causes major problems.</P>
        <P>The cocaine abuse problem is getting worse.  It affects all stratas of society but, unfortunately, the communities that suffered the worst heroin problem are now experiencing the cocaine problem.  We are dealing with abuse of cocaine, heroin and <Col N="525"/>benzodiazepines.  People talked about the legal drugs including sleeping drugs, cough medicines and hashish.  The country is awash with those drugs.  Young Irish people and older people appear to take more drugs than their counterparts in any other European nation.  That is a worrying development.  In the past people talked about the Irish fondness for alcohol but we appear to have a fondness for other drugs also.  We must wake up to this crisis and support those people looking for help.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the previous speaker that there is a crisis.  The misuse of drugs in society is a challenge but this Government is not giving the issue the treatment and attention it deserves.  Drug use is a challenge to Fianna F&aacute;il but, more important, it is a major challenge to the ideology of the Progressive Democrats because the State must intervene.  It is not about regulations; it is about strong intervention from the State to tackle the drugs problem.  It is also about providing the rehabilitation, programmes and policing that are required and about making a substantial long-term investment in the communities in which drugs are used.  That includes the socially excluded and disadvantaged areas and those parts of Dublin in particular where there is a very high prevalence of drug use.</P>
        <P>The current drugs programmes cost approximately &euro;40 million per year.  We are spending more than that on the advertising of alcohol.  If this Government is to get real about the drugs problem, one of the first actions it could take would be to ban the advertising of alcohol, and not just in certain areas, because there is an obvious link between the advertising of alcohol and people taking their first faltering steps towards a lifetime of addiction.  In particular, I would single out the association between alcohol advertising and sport because as we know, the main killer drugs are alcohol and cigarettes and unless we seriously tackle those two issues we are not doing enough about the drugs problem.  I want the Government to take the initiative and ban alcohol advertising.  It should also put health warnings on alcohol products.</P>
        <P>On the problem of heroin, as the motion suggests we need stronger community policing, better supervision of the ports in and out of Ireland and additional funding to ensure we have the resources to tackle this problem but we also must reflect the changing patterns throughout Europe and the world.  For example, we must allow for the provision of clean needles in our prisons.  We must assure prisoners who are at very high risk of contracting HIV that the needles they use will be clean.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is putting his head in the sand on that issue.  A carefully constructed report in which the Irish Penal Reform Trust was involved stated clearly that we should make avail<Col N="526"/>able clean needles and injecting rooms in our jails.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State with responsibility for this area should be someone with more clout rather than a Minister who must deal with the housing issue one day and the drugs issue the next day.  The Minister of State with responsibility for the drugs issue must get real.  His latest plan to provide a bus to bring drug users from the centre of Dublin to the docklands is ridiculous.  Does he expect that heavy drug users will line up at a bus stop waiting for the shuttle bus to bring them to a relocated Merchant&rsquo;s Quay project in the docklands?  The Minister of State insults the office he holds by making such ridiculous suggestions.  I understand where the Minister is coming from.  He wants to address the problem of drug dealing and drug use in the centre of our city but what he must do is address the social inequality, the lack of decent housing, decent sports facilities, open space, parental care and family support.  All those supports must be put in place; this cannot happen through the trickle of funding that has come into these areas over the past five or ten years.  It is about a determined effort to address the inequality and the disadvantage in those areas, whether it be in Dublin, D&uacute;n Laoghaire or the towns and cities throughout the country.</P>
        <P>The Green Party supports the motion before the House.  We believe the issue of drug abuse must receive greater attention from the Government.  It should not be a shared portfolio for the Minister of State.  We must also re-evaluate our controls over alcohol, which is one of the main killer drugs in society today.</P>

	<P>I want to conclude the Government&rsquo;s contribution to what was a welcome debate last evening and this evening in the House.  Reference was made by Deputy Cuffe to the amount of money being spent by the Government in tackling this problem.  It is interesting to note that in 2005, the estimate we have of expenditure directly related to dealing with drug abuse was &euro;194 million.  That expenditure spans the national drugs strategy unit, the Department of Health and Children, the Health Service Executive, F&Aacute;S, the Department of Education and Science, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Irish Prison Service, the Garda S&iacute;ochana and Customs and Excise.  They are indicative figures but they relate to services that are directly attributable to dealing with the drugs issue.  That estimated figure of &euro;194 million does not take account of the mainstream services provided to help tackle the issue and neither does it disentangle the funding that is available for the wider community in the context of communities afflicted by the drugs menace.  That is a substan<Col N="527"/>tial investment and it is directly targeted.  That is apart from the various Government social programmes in broad terms in health, education, housing and justice.  </P>
        <P>It is important that we note this at the outset because it is clear from this debate that the problem of drug misuse is one which is of serious concern to every Member of this House.  It leaves very destructive consequences in its wake and serious harm is inflicted on many individuals who experience drug addiction.  There is also the pain and despair felt by members of a person&rsquo;s family and his or her friends when they see a life being ruined in such a way.  In a wider sense, communities can be devastated by multiple addiction where addiction is at its most prevalent.  The drugs problem in Ireland is no longer confined in that sense because it is clear from the development in regard to cocaine that it is a habit indulged in in every sector of the community and in every social class.</P>
        <P>The threat posed to our society by the ruthless criminal elements who trade in drugs and the levels of violence they perpetrate to protect their trade is a disturbing element of the problem.  It is fair to say that if we examine criminal statistics today in a broad way and contrast them with the criminal statistics of, say, two or three decades ago, we can see the extent to which criminal activity in the State is built around and derives from the drugs problem.</P>
        <P>The problem concerns us all and, despite the political differences in this House, it must be addressed.  We share a common stake in doing so and the Government is grateful to the Deputies who proposed the motion.  A number of speakers have stressed the Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackling illegal drugs under the National Drug Strategy, 2001-08.  There is a strong conviction that the only way to make progress is by working in an integrated partnership involving all players from statutory agencies, voluntary treatment providers and those representing the community who are familiar with the problems involved.</P>
        <P>The Government believes this problem can be addressed under the headings of drug prevention and education, drug supply reduction and treatment, rehabilitation and research.  This debate has demonstrated some of the progress made over the first five years of the strategy.  Important improvements have been made, providing treatment services and attracting more drug users into treatment provision.  The recent publications of the results of the ROSIE study, referred to by the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Noel Ahern, highlights the positive benefits of such treatment.</P>
        <P>We have heard of the high levels of drug seizures by law enforcement agencies and significant successes in dismantling trafficking networks.  This is a challenge, given the scale of drug traf<Col N="528"/>ficking worldwide.  Progress has been made in the drugs education and preventative area through community and school efforts.  Other initiatives, such as the young people&rsquo;s facilities programme, seek to prevent people from starting on the drug misuse pathway.  Personnel numbers in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have increased, enhancing the enforcement response, especially in areas of drug misuse.</P>
        <P>Members have heard of the valuable contribution made by those who work with local and regional drug task forces on a considerable number of community-led projects that are integral to our approach.  I salute the work of task forces and local projects in communities all over Ireland.  The Government has allocated resources across a range of Departments and agencies.  A significant increase was made in the drugs initiatives head at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</P>
        <P>The Government is aware that difficulties remain.  Progress is not always made at the speed Members would like but significant progress has been made across pillar headings due to the dedicated efforts of many people.  The Government is resolutely committed to the national drugs strategy and I ask the House to support the Government amendment.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I applaud Deputy Catherine Murphy who promoted this topic for the Independent Deputies&rsquo; Private Members&rsquo; business this week.  She focused on the appalling vista of the prospect of Weston Aerodrome being used for the importation of drugs into this country.  The recent seizure of 50 kg of heroin in Belgium, apparently destined for Weston Aerodrome, illustrates the criminal neglect of security at private airfields in this country by successive Governments.  Some 27 licensed aerodromes in the State have a hit and miss customs presence.</P>
        <P>In 2005, only 16 customs inspections took place at Weston Aerodrome, an average of one every three and a quarter weeks.  One can see the potential to use the aerodrome for the illegal importation of drugs or other items into this country.  It is inexcusable for the Government or the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to allow this situation to continue, where criminals have the opportunity to bring in killer drugs to this country.</P>
        <P>The Government claims to be fighting a serious battle, an empty claim given that a main route of supply &mdash; such as that at Weston Aerodrome &mdash; is left unguarded and open for use by all and sundry.  It is folly for a Government fighting a war against drugs to ignore the route of supply.  The supply line should be the first area examined.  If there is no supply, there is no problem and if supply is minimised, the problem is reduced.  Access <Col N="529"/>points to this country must be fully secured and a customs arrangement must be made at access points such as Weston Aerodrome.</P>
        <P>Ireland has many grand plans, strategies and policies in place to deal with drug abuse.  These make the right statements and press the right buttons, but do what do they do?  For example, the first strategic aim of the national drugs strategy is to reduce the availability of illicit drugs.  The Government shows its commitment to reducing availability of illicit drugs by leaving 27 private airfields without security or customs.  Drug traffickers can waltz into this country with suitcases packed with drugs.  The scale and boldness of the operation foiled in Belgium indicates that this was not a maiden run.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a major problem in Ireland and is getting worse.  I fail to understand the lack of urgency and commitment to tackling the drugs problem in Ireland.  Colleagues have referred to the 27 private airfields with no customs presence, indicative of the attitude we take to the drugs problem.  That situation was brought to the attention of the authorities when Deputy Catherine Murphy placed the matter on the agenda in this House last year and again this year.  Some &euro;10 million worth of drugs was intercepted on its way to the airfield.  The total amount confiscated is no more than 10% of what is trafficked into the country.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, stated that we should get real in a press statement during the week.  That slogan should apply to this problem.  I was always taught, and believe, that prevention is better than cure.  Public representatives, RAPID organisations and local authorities in south Tipperary have been seeking services and manpower to address this problem before it gets out of hand.  During this debate, we have heard about areas where the drug problem is out of control.  Thankfully, this is not yet the case in Clonmel and south Tipperary.  We seek services and manpower to address this problem, but unfortunately we have had no response.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, the Minister stated that the young persons facilities fund would not be extended to the town of Clonmel because the problem was not serious enough.  Four drug-related murders have been committed in the area in the past three years.  The emphasis should be on prevention in areas where the problem is at a low level.  Every part of the country has a drug problem to some degree but we must provide facilities, youth services, community garda&iacute; and regionalised CAB facilities to deal with minor drug dealers.  These middle-ranking drug dealers are setting an example to other young people and dragging young people, particularly those from disadvantaged areas, into the drugs trade.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate this evening.  We, as Indepen<Col N="530"/>dents, have an abundance of topical issues to discuss.  We have discussed health issues, laws on gifts and drugs gateways.  This topic was raised because we were astonished to learn that an aircraft could land and passengers and cargo go completely unchecked at an airport in Dublin.  It was astonishing to hear the owner of the airport state that the matter had nothing to do with him and to claim that the aeroplane should be checked in its country of departure.  This excuse is not good enough.  It is akin to saying that a customs service is not needed here if it operates in other countries.  I do not know how anyone could come up with such an incredible response.</P>
        <P>A person can effectively hire an aeroplane, fly to another country, come back and take whatever he or she wishes, knowing that his or her cargo will not be checked on the way back.  It is akin to the situation on Border roads years ago where there were approved and unapproved crossings.  Quite a number of these airports are now akin to the unapproved crossings.  A person can bring something in with the high likelihood that he or she will get away with it.  If there are customs on the ground, I have no doubt that people with mobile phones can warn those flying not to land until customs have left.  People used to talk about &ldquo;doing the roads for guys&rdquo; in times past and the same concept applies here.</P>
        <P>One thinks about the potential damage that drugs worth &euro;10 million can do to society.  The supply and increasing use of drugs are responsible for our increasing crime rate, including murder and other violent crimes, and antisocial behaviour.  Our response to the drugs problem and the ways in which they enter the country is completely inadequate.  Someone put it to me recently that if a restaurant was considered unhygienic, environmental health officials would put tape around it and close it to the public.  I cannot see why the airport in question has not been closed down and both it and its aircraft subjected to forensic examination to discover how many aeroplanes have been used on these drug runs.  At the very least, an investigation into those who have rented out these aeroplanes and those who have been on drug trips should be carried out.  There is no doubt that nobody would chance taking drugs worth &euro;10 million on his or her first run into the country.  Those involved believe it is a safe route and that it is only a matter of gathering cash and taking it in.</P>
        <P>If drugs are being imported, I have no doubt that arms and people without proper documentation could also be imported in this fashion.  It looks like money is the attraction and there are many ways of making it through the drugs route.  A full examination of Weston Aerodrome should be carried out.  It should be closed down and checked out, as indeed should a large number of other airports.  Their records should be examined to discover those who are hiring these aeroplanes.  The man who flew the aeroplane in question had <Col N="531"/>previously been imprisoned in England for drugs offences.  Yet he was able to work in an airport and hold a pilot&rsquo;s licence, which is unacceptable.  We need to take action in this area.  We learned that this individual was very wealthy and had large reserves of cash, despite the fact that he only worked as a doorman.</P>
        <?oasys _dc14- ?><P>We are possibly accepting credit for the drugs worth &euro;10 million seized in Belgium and the drugs worth &euro;10 million seized in Northern Ireland.  However, these drugs were not seized in this country.  The figures for 2003 show that 3% of the drugs were apprehended coming into the country and I believe this figure is inflated.  A person has, effectively, a 97% or 98% chance of freely importing drugs into this country.  Our response is completely inadequate.  We charge people who abuse drugs when we should be trying to discover how these drugs were supplied to them.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the Independent Deputies on drawing attention to very important issues in respect of the dangerous drug situation in this country and, particularly, for emphasising the ongoing and devastating consequences of heroin addiction, particularly in working class communities.  The motion also notes the failure of the Government to formulate an effective strategy in respect of dangerous drugs.</P>
        <P>The political and business establishment is guilty of monumental hypocrisy in respect of the drugs situation.  We hear the ritual condemnation of drugs deemed to be illegal and of those who import and distribute them and devastate communities, particularly those who import heroin or crack cocaine and foist them on communities in whose destruction they are instrumental.  These people must be condemned and driven out.  I salute those people, particularly working-class people, who democratically rose up in response to the destruction of their communities to condemnation from certain pillars of the establishment.</P>
        <P>However, among those who are foremost in condemning illegal drugs are people who benefit from the massive industries built around very dangerous drugs which happen to be legal, particularly nicotine and ethyl alcohol.  It is beyond belief that the State still permits the deployment of millions of euro each year to portray alcohol as <Col N="532"/>a sexy, social and beneficial drug without which people could not possibly live when its abuse destroys thousands of lives each year, disables many people physically and socially and contributes to devastating behaviour, leaving some people tragically dead or injured as a result of the violence caused by the misuse of alcohol.  However, the pillars of the alcohol and nicotine establishment are feted in Irish society and are among its elite.  They are shamefully allowed to sponsor major sports events.  It is incredible that the All-Ireland Gaelic football and hurling championships are named after alcohol companies.  Similarly, soccer leagues and leagues in other sports are named after alcohol products when we see what the misuse of these products does.</P>
        <P>I am not a prohibitionist.  Hopefully, most of us use drugs sensibly and they play a very useful role in our lives.  However, I am convinced that the advertising of these drugs should be prohibited.  We need a wide-ranging and honest debate on prohibitionism, which is the only main policy of this Government, the US Governments and those in other states with regard to drugs like heroin, because it is not successful.  It is not sustainable to criminalise a whole swathe of people, particularly young people in this State who use cannabis.  It is extremely dangerous to put cannabis on the same footing as heroin, as the law and the Government do, so that the penalties are the same and those who criminally ruin communities with heroin are also those who interface with young people when they go to buy cannabis.  We need an honest and balanced debate on whether, for example, cannabis can be regulated to take it out of the hands of the gangsters.  We do not want to inflict another new scourge on society by any means.  It is true that cannabis, like alcohol and nicotine, has dangerous side effects.  However, alcohol and nicotine are still pushed heavily by very wealthy pillars of our establishment.</P>
        <P>It is criminal that Weston Aerodrome can be used, as Deputy Catherine Murphy has outlined, apparently at will for potentially massive heroin consignments.  It is the working class communities of west Dublin, the inner city and other areas which will suffer in that situation.</P>

	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas den Cheann Comhairle as cead a thabhairt dom an cheist seo a ard&uacute; ar an Athl&oacute; agus gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas den Aire Fiontar, Trad&aacute;la agus Fosta&iacute;ochta as bheith <Col N="534"/>anseo, c&eacute; nach Aire Dl&iacute; agus Cirt, Comhionnanais agus Athch&oacute;irithe Dl&iacute; &eacute; go f&oacute;ill.  I regret, however, that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not here because this highlights a chronic issue that arises in the policing of our country, particularly in Fingal in north County Dublin.</P>
        <P>I attended the joint policing committee meeting on 22 September and was surprised to find that even though there are three Garda divisions in that area, the law determines that only two Garda divisions are allowed membership of the committee.  That makes a mockery of any idea of <Col N="535"/>inclusivity or community involvement.  When such legislation is allowed it shows a lack of connection with reality.</P>
        <P>The Louth-Meath division, which takes up a huge part of north County Dublin, from Blakes Cross to the Dublin-Meath border, is effectively disenfranchised even though it is allowed to attend as an observer at the joint policing committee.  The CSO figures for the towns disenfranchised by this measure show they include Balbriggan, which has a full-time Garda station, as well it might because it is larger than Clonmel.  Skerries is in the area but has no full-time station although it is larger than Tullamore.  Rush is in the same area and it is as large as Kilkenny city according to the CSO figures, while Lusk is the same size as Athlone.  If towns such as Athlone, Kilkenny and Tullamore did not have full-time Garda stations there would be considerable outrage, if not civil disobedience.  It seems, however, that the Government accepts that Fingal can muddle along in that way.</P>
        <P>If one talks to garda&iacute; dealing with this situation daily, their frustration is clear.  There is a dedicated scene of crime unit in Dublin, which attends burglaries and such offences, with examiners trained in taking fingerprints and lifting fibres.  In the Louth-Meath division in north County Dublin there is no such unit, no drugs task force and no task force to deal with areas where extra garda&iacute; are needed.</P>
        <P>A fire brigade approach is taken to Garda resources in the area.  In Balbriggan, which is the size of Clonmel, there are 32 garda&iacute;, some of whom are off sick, hardly a surprise given the pressure they are under, and one is suspended.  The reality is that there are far fewer than 32.  There are ten garda&iacute; in Skerries, an area that lost its community garda because it cannot afford such a luxury.  Rush has a part-time station with one sergeant and five garda&iacute;, Lusk has one sergeant and three garda&iacute; and Garristown has one sergeant and two garda&iacute;.  These towns are the same size as Athlone, Kilkenny and Tullamore.  This is a pathetic level of policing for towns in an area of this size that is growing so fast.  Since the previous census, its population has increased by the equivalent of the population of Carlow.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to ensure the Government and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform fully understand that the north County Dublin area needs additional garda&iacute; and reorganisation.  The area should be part of the Dublin metropolitan area, a view shared by many garda&iacute; in Garda Headquarters in the Phoenix Park.  Such a measure would reflect a similar change in the United Kingdom where the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 ensured police boundaries are aligned with the 25 London boroughs.  Similar changes are under way in other European countries.</P>
        <P>Garda&iacute; currently have different copies of by-laws in different areas because county boundaries are not aligned.  I ask that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform take seriously the <Col N="536"/>timebomb developing in north County Dublin as a result of the failure of Garda resources to keep pace with an increasing population.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am deputising for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who, as Deputies will be aware, is engaged in important work elsewhere.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and assure him the T&aacute;naiste and I share his interest in joint policing committees.  The genesis of the committees is the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the most significant legislation affecting the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since the force was established in the 1920s.  It provides the legal basis for a whole range of new bodies, including the joint policing committees.</P>
        <P>The fundamental idea behind the committees is that the policing of our society and the communities which make it up cannot take place in a vacuum in which the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na decides how policing is to be carried out without any input of views from society and communities.  Not only is it democratically desirable that the community makes such an input but policing of our increasingly complex and diverse society also requires such an input if it is to be more effective.  At the same time it is important it is a two way process.  While community input will make policing more effective, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can also make a valuable input into the many areas of a local authority&rsquo;s activities which impact on policing and combating crime and anti-social behaviour.</P>
        <P>This is the approach of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act and the joint policing committees for which it provides.  The committees provide a forum in which both sides can consult, discuss and make recommendations on matters affecting the policing of the local authority area.  It sets out four ways in particular in which this can be done.</P>
        <P>First, the committee will monitor two broad areas.  The first of these is the levels and patterns of crime, disorder and anti-social behaviour in the area.  This will include patterns and levels of misuse of alcohol and drugs, the source of all too much anti-social behaviour and crime.  The second area is the broader issue of the factors underlying and contributing to crime, disorder and anti-social behaviour.</P>
        <P>The second function of the committee, which follows directly from the first, will be to advise the local authority and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on how they might best perform their functions, having regard to the need to do everything feasible to improve community safety and quality of life, and to prevent crime, disorder and anti-social behaviour within the area.</P>
        <P>Third, the committee will arrange and host public meetings periodically on matters affecting the policing of the local authority area.  Fourth, the committee will establish, in consultation with the local Garda superintendent, as it considers necessary within specific neighbourhoods of the local authority area, local policing forums to dis<Col N="537"/>cuss and make recommendations to the committee on matters affecting the neighbourhood.</P>
        <P>The joint policing committee must be established in accordance with guidelines issued by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, after consulting the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  In view of the innovative nature of the committees and the number which will be established, the Minister decided, following consultation with his colleagues, the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, to pilot the committees in 22 local authority areas for a limited period.</P>
        <P>When the Minister issued the guidelines for these pilot committees in June 2006 he was anxious to strike the right balance between inclusiveness and effectiveness in the size and composition of the committees.  With regard to membership of the committees by local authority members, the guidelines provide either for all local authority members to be members of a committee or for representation of each political grouping on the local authority, depending on the size of the local authority.</P>
        <P>The guidelines for Fingal County Council provide that in Fingal there will be one joint policing committee.  The membership will consist of, among others, two Garda officers nominated by the Commissioner, accompanied by such Garda officers as they deem appropriate.  In addition, the guidelines provide that a non-member may be invited to attend a meeting of the committee and speak if considered appropriate by the committee or sub-committee to a particular agenda item.  This will allow for garda&iacute; other than those nominated by the Commissioner to attend meetings of the joint policing committee and discuss issues raised by members.  This facility will also apply, for example, to representatives of statutory agencies where the committee or sub-committee considers that their particular expertise is required.</P>
        <P>The pilot phase will end in mid-2007, after which there will be a time limited review of the guidelines in the light of the experience of the pilot committees.  As part of that review, the provisions regarding the composition of the committees will be considered.</P>

	<P>As the next two matters are similar they will be taken together.  Deputies Collins and Neville each have five minutes. </P>
      </Speaker><Col N="538"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins"><NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter.  This important issue relates to the constituency of Limerick West.  Yesterday, we received news of yet another loss of jobs in County Limerick when Microtherm Limited in Bruff announced it was to close with immediate effect.  Management informed the staff of 46 of this decision yesterday.  The closure of the company will have major detrimental economic consequences for the wider community as an estimated wage bill of &euro;1.5 million will vanish.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, for his presence.  As he will be aware, we had problems in Kantoher and a provisional liquidator was appointed to Castlemahon Poultry Products Limited two weeks ago.</P>
        <P>Microtherm Limited, which has operated in Bruff since 1976, is by far the single largest employer in the town.  Its dedicated workforce has competed in the highly competitive electronic component manufacturing industry for more than 30 years.  Due to an increasing cost base, however, it now finds itself unable to match cheap foreign competitors.  The workforce, which is predominately local to Bruff, comprises in many instances a husband and wife working together.  We are just a few weeks from Christmas and many of those affected have young families and mortgages to pay.  Replacement industries are needed in County Limerick.</P>
        <P>Today, I accompanied a delegation from Castlemahon Poultry Products Limited to a meeting attended by the Minister, Deputy Martin, and his Ministers of State, Deputies Killeen and Brendan Smith.  I thank them for agreeing to the meeting.  As the Minister learned during his discussions with representatives of the workers at the plant and their trade union official, the company is experiencing serious problems.  If the recommendation the provisional liquidator is obliged to submit to the court by 23 October is not good, it is clear what will happen.</P>
        <P>Last week, a delegation of growers and suppliers of Castlemahon Poultry Products met the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  It was anxious to determine if it could raise sufficient capital to try to continue operations at the company.  The liquidator informed us that while two groups had shown an interest, no definite decisions had been made.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for arranging a meeting between the group in question and Shannon Development.  I understand &euro;10,000 has been provided to the group to carry out a feasibility study.</P>
        <P>Given the events which have unfolded in Microtherm Limited and Castlemahon Poultry Products Limited, I call on the Minister to further instruct the relevant State agencies to address the underlying concerns in the food processing and electronics manufacturing industries, namely, rising costs and cheap foreign imports.</P><Col N="539"/>
        <P>For many years, Shannon Development has been to the fore in promoting industrial development and jobs in the mid-west region.  As this function will soon transfer to the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, these organisations must step up to the mark and deliver much-needed replacement industries.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to raise the important and upsetting matter of the loss of 46 jobs in Bruff, at a cost to the community and, in particular, the employees of Microtherm Limited, of &euro;1.5 million per annum.  The news that the company has closed is a major blow to Bruff and staff at the plant who find themselves without employment with very little notice.  It is particularly devastating given that it is the town&rsquo;s biggest employer and has been a mainstay of employment for more than 30 years.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">In fact, 30 years ago, in 1976, the former Minister and MEP, Mr. Tom O&rsquo;Donnell, was instrumental in bringing this industry to Bruff.  From discussions I have had with the IDA today, I understand it is almost impossible to compile a rescue package, as the production of the thermostats has moved to cheap labour areas in the Far East.  Many of its customer base manufacturers have also moved to cheap labour markets.  It is important that the State agencies, the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development, with the support of Ballyhoura F&aacute;ilte, ensure that a replacement industry is identified for the plant as soon as possible.  A creditors&rsquo; meeting will take place in the next ten days and the company, which is legally independent of the parent German company, will be liquidated.</P>
<?oasys _cl10.5- ?>
        <P>The State agencies must immediately open a dialogue on the future of the plant and ensure that it continues as a place of employment for the people of Bruff.  The loss of the jobs in Bruff is difficult for the people directly concerned.  It has created unanticipated financial pressures coming up to Christmas.  While it was evident for some time that there were difficulties, it is not possible to be psychologically or financially prepared for the blow of redundancy.  Just over 20 years ago, I was made redundant on statutory redundancy, so I know the trauma a person goes through.  Everything must be done by the Minister and his State agencies to help the employees to obtain replacement employment.  There will be an urgent requirement for the training agencies to introduce programmes to prepare those made redundant for future employment, involving reskilling for many of them.</P>
        <P>Coming on top of the announcement of the difficulties in Castlemahon Poultry Products, this is the second severe blow to employment in my constituency, Limerick West.  The Government has dismally failed to create employment in the constituency.  It is time the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to pay attention to the devastation of the losses that have occurred in the last month.  I understand the <Col N="540"/>Minister met the representatives of the Castlemahon employees today.  As we speak, the breeding hens there are being gassed and the cycle of production has ceased.</P>
        <P>I impress on the Minister the need to ensure that a replacement industry goes in there.  I know some people have approached the Minister, Shannon Development and others.  I accept that Shannon Development is doing a feasibility study.  I ask that the Minister try to ensure that the skills in Castlemahon are not lost to the area or to the poultry industry and that those who have little opportunity for other jobs in the area continue to work in the field some of them have known for many decades.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also ask that the Minister, in his contacts with Northern Ireland, seek that the O&rsquo;Kane organisation honour the redundancy arrangement it made in previous negotiations with the people who are made redundant.  I ask the Minister to contact the German parent company of Microtherm and ensure that it will at least treat the 46 people who are to be made redundant in Bruff decently.  That is all I ask, that the employees of Castlemahon and Bruff are treated decently.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Collins and Deputy Neville for raising this important matter.  Like the Deputies, I was disappointed to hear about the situation at the company in question.  I am conscious of the effect the job losses will have on the workers involved and their families as well as the community in the surrounding area.  This is distressing news for those who will lose their jobs.  I assure the people concerned that the relevant State agencies will provide every support they can.  The priority will be to find alternative employment for those involved at the earliest opportunity.  As Deputy Collins knows, we discussed the redundancy situation today with the workers at Castlemahon.  Given what happened 15 months ago, it is unsatisfactory that they are being offered only statutory redundancy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately, the situation is a voluntary engagement between employer and employee, but we will pursue that issue in so far as we can with the employer, as we undertook today in our meetings with the workers&rsquo; representatives.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies know, Microtherm was established in Ireland in 1975 and employs 46 people in Bruff, County Limerick, where it manufactures thermostats for the white goods market.  Unfortunately, the manufacture of thermostats is now uneconomic in Ireland as the sale price no longer covers the production cost.  Over the past few years, I understand that the company&rsquo;s head office had been supplying orders to keep its Irish operation in production.  This has been erratic, with orders varying from month to month resulting in the entire work force working part-time or full-time as the need arose to fill orders.  However, the owners have concluded that the operation at Bruff is insolvent and a creditors&rsquo; meeting is being called.  I understand that the <Col N="541"/>creditors&rsquo; meeting is scheduled for 23 October 2006 and at that stage a liquidator is likely to be appointed.  The general manager called a meeting of all staff yesterday morning.  I understand he had no alternative but to cease production and close down the plant.</P>
        <P>The role of the industrial training agency, F&Aacute;S, will now be particularly important for the workers.  The company has already been requested to discuss the opportunities of operative retraining with its staff with a view to following up with F&Aacute;S.  We have been doing this well in recent redundancies.  F&Aacute;S has gone in early to provide one-to-one training programmes for the workers and to see if it can locate alternative employment for the workers through its wider job contact capacity.</P>
        <P>The most recent live register figures, for September 2006, were released by the Central Statistics Office last week.  The figure for County Limerick is 7,205, which is down significantly on last month&rsquo;s figure of 8,253.  It is important to give the overall backdrop.  Although it is no consolation to the workers involved, it shows a general buoyancy in employment in County Limerick.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>It is no consolation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>A central goal for the industrial development agencies is the achievement of balanced regional development.  The attractiveness of Limerick lies in its position as a regional gateway, with the critical mass and infrastructure necessary to attract mobile investment to the region.  Both the Government and the agencies recognise the need to provide high-volume employment opportunities in Limerick that provide sustainable, long-term jobs.  The strategies adopted have proved successful to date despite a competitive and ever changing global economy.  There is a churn going on in the economy in jobs which are at risk of loss to low-cost locations.  We are losing out in some respects there but are gaining jobs in other sectors of the economy.</P>
        <P>While it is disappointing to see job losses at any time, fortunately Limerick has a strong base of foreign direct investment jobs.  The most recent figures available, for December 2005, show that there were 38 overseas companies employing over 8,500 people in permanent jobs and a further 1,500 in temporary and contract employment.  Most of these 10,000 jobs are in the city environs but as a result of the job losses in the company concerned, I am confident that the State development agencies will strengthen their marketing and promotion efforts in the region and make every effort to secure alternative employment for the area.  This will be done in partnership with other key players to maximise the flow of potential investors for the area and to convert these into investment and job opportunities.</P>
        <P>We will work with groups that emerge and wish to try to develop alternative or similar industries.  Shannon Development and Enterprise Ireland will work with companies to see if we can grow jobs again on the indigenous front as well as trying to attract foreign direct investment in and get <Col N="542"/>new activities for existing foreign direct investment companies in the area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this subject and that my constituency colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, has chosen to respond on behalf of the Government.  The loss of the 172 jobs in Roches Stores in Wilton is regretted by all in the area.  All public representatives are anxious to pursue a common approach in seeking some remediation of the situation that has arisen.</P>
        <P>I raise this issue on the basis that the loss of 172 jobs at any time is regrettable but there always seems to be more media attention and political reaction and concern when a similar number of jobs are lost in an industrial concern.  Given, however, that our economy is now based 70% on services and retail, this is a significant loss of jobs for the people concerned.  I am interested to hear what action the Minister has taken to date and what measures he believes can be applied towards securing alternative employment for the people involved.</P>
        <P>The Minister and I are aware that there are commercial concerns at play here which fall outside the scope of normal political debate and reaction.  I would like to believe that incidents of this kind could be avoided in the future if consideration is given to legislation in the relevant area.  For example, in the area of the transfer of employment, there is strong legislation in place that is designed to protect the rights of the employee.  I would argue that said legislation could be reconsidered in the context of the transfer of responsibilities from one company to a potential replacement company that could assume responsibility for the employment rights of any group of employees.  It could also be reconsidered in the context of local authorities reassessing rates, service charges or, in the case of a commercial concern, rents.  As the Minister is aware, the issue of rents is very much at the heart of this matter.  What I am suggesting might not provide a ready solution to the predicament faced by the workers at Wilton.  However, we must avoid the circumstances that have arisen and ensure that there is no recurrence.</P>
        <P>It is regrettable that a commercial institution such as Roches Stores is moving on and replacing its shops with other businesses.  However, the company has managed to do so successfully with its flagship store in Patrick Street and others throughout the country.  Questions remain as to why this has not happened at the Wilton shopping centre.  We must take a collective approach to this matter to ensure that an immediate solution can be found.</P>
        <P>I offer these proposals by way of suggestion.  The Minister, who has expressed much concern regarding this matter, shares the frustration of many in the constituency that matters have been allowed to develop to this extent, that a solution was not found before last Friday and that redundancy notices were issued to the workers in recent days.  I would like to believe, however, that he remains as optimistic as I am that the potential exists for a resolution to this matter.  If he is able <Col N="543"/>to offer that glimmer of hope and comfort in his reply, the 172 people concerned would be grateful.</P>
        <P>It must be remembered that those involved are mainly women &mdash; there are some men involved &mdash; whose rates of pay are average.  In some circumstances, these individuals&rsquo; length of service has been considerable and they have been extremely loyal to the company.  Some of the people working with the company and hoping to transfer to another have developed relationships, the common goals of which are dependent on employment and success with whatever companies they work for in the future.</P>
        <P>From a human perspective, I will be interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s reply.  I hope that not only will he indicate how he, the Government and his Department can respond but also how those of us who are also involved in representing the constituency, at national and local level, can react in a collective sense to help resolve this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Boyle for raising this issue and I accept his absolute commitment, and that of all public representatives in the city of Cork, in respect of it.  As the Deputy is aware, the issue of the retail workers in question and their jobs concerns the transfer of a lease.  The parties involved have been unable to reach agreement on the matter.</P>
        <P>On Thursday and Friday last, we met the workers at Wilton.  I contacted the majority owner of the centre and representatives of Marks and Spencer and Roches Stores on Friday.  However, by late on Friday all our efforts had come to nothing.  There was some indication at lunchtime on Friday that something might happen but, in the end, the issue could not be resolved.</P>
        <P>At the weekend, I met the owner at his request.  He gave his perspective and stated that he would be willing to do everything possible to bring about a resolution.  I made an appeal on Friday and again on Saturday to both sides to enter negotiations and, in that context, I offered my services and those of the Lord Mayor of Cork as mediators.  Telephone contact was again made with the two key players on Monday and I am of the opinion that Roches Stores would have provided a window of opportunity and a space to facilitate a resolution of the issue.  There was engagement between the two sides on Monday, with correspondence being exchanged and offers and counter-offers being made.  By late on Monday night, even though matters had moved on somewhat, the gap remained significant.  However, at that point and throughout yesterday, I felt that the gap would not be closed.  I am more pessimistic now than I was on Monday.</P><Col N="544"/>
        <P>I have been conscious of the need not to raise the expectations of the workers for a second time.  We met them on Friday and witnessed the roller-coaster of emotions on which they rode throughout the day.  Both parties are anxious that the negotiations should take place away from the glare of the media spotlight.</P>
        <P>Fundamentally, this issue revolves around the terms of a lease and that is why 172 workers are losing their jobs.  That is not acceptable and I am deeply unhappy about it.  In other areas throughout the country, the transfer of employees to other companies was effected in a way that did not give rise to angst and disagreement.</P>
        <P>I take this opportunity, afforded to me by Deputy Boyle&rsquo;s raising of this matter, to again call on all sides in the dispute to make one further effort to resolve their differences.  My overriding concern, like that of the Deputy, is the protection of all 172 jobs that are at stake.  I reiterate that I and the Lord Mayor of Cork, who represents the city and its citizens, are prepared to act as mediators in this process.  I have kept the Lord Mayor informed of developments as they happened.</P>
        <P>The remainder of my script relates to the general situation pertaining to industry in Cork, the role of the industrial agencies there, the employment opportunities on offer and the successes of recent times.  However, I do not believe the Deputy needs to be reminded of all that in the context of this issue.  In fundamental terms, this matter comes down to a dispute regarding the amount of rent and square footage involved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Minister considered looking at the transfer of employment legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>There are areas that could be considered in terms of the transfer of undertakings etc., but this matter would not really be suitable in that regard.  I would argue that Roches Stores made a good effort to transfer staff but that effort came unstuck in respect of the workers at Wilton.  The matter was not closed off and not everything was tidied up prior to the cessation of trading at Roches Stores, which is probably what gave rise to difficulties in this instance.</P>
        <P>I will consider what the Deputy suggests because a number of issues arise in respect of this case.  The situation is unsatisfactory from the perspective of the workers.  Both parties have indicated their understanding of that fact to me and stated that they appreciate the position in which the workers find themselves.  If the overriding concern of those involved is the welfare of the workers and their retaining their jobs, this matter should be resolved.  That is my challenge to the parties concerned.  This important matter involves 172 people and their families, and a resolution should be found.</P>

	<P>The reasons for companies to relocate activities from Ireland are many and varied, and include relocation to be closer to customers or other competitive considerations. I believe that firms must be free to allocate resources and production to where the returns are highest. It is not in our interest to obstruct what is in the best interest of competitive enterprises. Our best response to the realities of globalisation is to ensure that Ireland remains attractive for investment and enterprise growth.</P>
        <P>Our employment record indicates that the effects of job relocation has not been significant.  In the last eight years we have added over 523,000 people to our workforce, an unprecedented growth of 35%.  We now have over two million people working in Ireland.  It is clear that the rate of job relocations is far exceeded by new job creation, often higher up the value-chain and usually accompanied by better-paid high-skilled employment.  Indeed, maintaining low-wage jobs at any cost, irrespective of globalisation trends, might serve to keep incomes low and depress standards of living.</P>
        <P>As our economy has matured, we have tailored our FDI incentives to match our strengths.  Low wage costs are no longer a major enticement, but <Col N="546"/>have been replaced by other attractions, including a benign tax and regulatory environment, better-educated workforce, an improving infrastructure and a commitment to world-class standards of research, development and innovation.  Maintaining and improving upon these standards is vital to sustaining Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness.  The IMD World Competitiveness Scoreboard ranked us as the world&rsquo;s 11th most competitive economy in 2006, up one place on last year&rsquo;s position.</P>
        <P>The Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation, launched in June, demonstrates this Government&rsquo;s commitment to continuing the transformation of the economy and continue to create high-value jobs that will mitigate the effects of any job relocation.</P>
        <P>The agencies under my Department are working to maintain Ireland attractiveness to foreign investment while assisting indigenous industry.  In 2005, the IDA supported over 50 R&amp;D projects related to business investment to the value of over &euro;275 million, a record both in number and value for the agency.  Enterprise Ireland has introduced a Productivity Improvement Fund for indigenous enterprises to improve levels of productivity through technology acquisition or labour force training.  In 2005 Enterprise Ireland helped 515 client companies invest over &euro;100,000 each in meaningful R&amp;D, with 33 companies investing over &euro;2 million in research and development.  With this and other assistance, Enterprise Ireland is making significant progress in helping Irish enterprises improve their export performance, with growth of 7% in 2005 and 15% in exports to Asia.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 17, 57 and 66 together.</P>
        <P>I should point out at the outset that return and recovery of grant aid are day-to-day operational matters for Enterprise Ireland and that neither I, as Minister, nor my Department have any function in relation to these matters.</P>
        <P>I understand that discussions between Enterprise Ireland and the company concerning grant aid to the plant at Rooskey, Co. Roscommon are continuing and that to date, the company has not returned any grant aid to Enterprise Ireland.    I am advised that progress is being made in the negotiations, which include complex legal issues and that they are expected to conclude in the near future.</P>
        <P>With regard to alternative employment on the company&rsquo;s Rooskey site, Enterprise Ireland is trying to stimulate further investment there.  However, discussions are at an early stage in terms of future investment and have yet to be fully developed.  These discussions are likely to take several months to develop.</P>
        <P>Grant aid amounting to &euro;469,560 was approved for the company&rsquo;s plant at Edenderry, Co Offaly between the period June, 2002 and September, 2006. The grant amount paid to date with respect to this is &euro;159,866.  The grant aid consisted of two separate Research and Development projects <Col N="548"/>relating to new product and new process development.  The aid was provided under Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s  Research and Technology Innovation scheme.</P>
        <P>No grant aid has been provided for the company&rsquo;s plant at Roscrea, Co. Tipperary since June, 2002.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The main bodies operating under the auspices of my Department which are concerned with consumer protection are the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and the Interim National Consumer Agency. In so far as the ODCA is concerned, its remit includes a specific statutory role in relation to enforcing price display orders. These orders essentially relate to the manner that prices are indicated on products and also in relation to the manner in which prices are displayed in certain retail outlets such as licensed premises, catering establishments, garages etc.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Director that her Office regularly conducts price display surveys, including on the occasion of major sporting and cultural events, to ensure that retailers are complying with their obligations to display their prices under the relevant Regulations. With regard to the Ryder Cup, the Director&rsquo;s Office conducted surveys of licensed premises and catering establishments in areas surrounding where the event took place. Initial inspections were carried out by the inspectors from the Director&rsquo;s Office between 20th &amp; 25th July with follow up visits taking place on the 11th &amp; 12th September 2006.</P>
        <P>The results of the initial inspections of licensed premises revealed that out of 46 premises visited, 21 (45.6%) had their price lists displayed as required by the relevant Regulations while breaches of the Drinks Price Display Order were recorded in 25 (54.4%) premises.  However, when Inspectors revisited 45 premises on 11th &amp; 12th September, compliance with the requirements of the Price Display Order had increased to 93% (42). Breaches in relation to the non-display of the required price lists were recorded in 3 (7%) premises.  The Director&rsquo;s Office is currently considering the possibility of initiating prosecutions against those retailers who were found to be in breach of their obligations to display their prices.</P>
        <P>With regard to restaurants and other catering establishments, the Director has advised that of the total of 56 catering establishments initially visited, 45 (80.4%) had their prices displayed as <Col N="549"/>required under the relevant Regulations, while 11 (19.6%) did not.  On the second inspection, all 53 premises revisited had their price lists displayed as required.</P>
        <P>The Director&rsquo;s Office also follows up any complaints it receives from consumers in relation to pricing and prices. The Director has advised that in relation to the Ryder Cup her Office only received one complaint to-date regarding ticket pricing and a further complaint in relation to the price charged for tea and sandwiches.</P>
        <P>In relation to the other significant area where price concerns were raised, namely possible increases in the price of hotel accommodation, I am advised by the Department of Tourism that under the Tourist Traffic Acts every hotel in Ireland is required at the beginning of each year to register their minimum and maximum room and breakfast rates with F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s register records these rates and all hoteliers are obliged to display the rates in each hotel room. F&aacute;ilte Ireland has advised that it did receive a total of 5 complaints regarding overcharging for accommodation in the weeks leading up to the Ryder Cup and since. These complaints are being investigated by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and appropriate action will be taken if they are found to be justified.</P>
        <P>The Department of Tourism advised that it received one complaint itself which, upon investigation, found that the rate concerned had been registered with F&aacute;ilte Ireland at the beginning of the year and so the hotelier concerned had done nothing illegal.</P>
        <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs has advised that her Office will continue to actively enforce the price display laws to ensure that retailers display the price of goods so that consumers can make an informed choice before deciding whether or not to spend their money on such goods. In this regard, my Department recently increased significantly the fines for traders who breach their obligations with regard to displaying their prices.</P>
        <P>The new National Consumer Agency, when it is formally established early next year, in addition to continuing this enforcement function will also have additional statutory functions in areas such as consumer information, advocacy, education and awareness etc. In this regard the Interim National Consumer Agency has since the beginning of the year engaged in high profile media campaigns to highlight awareness of consumer rights. These campaigns continued throughout the period of the Ryder Cup.</P>
        <P>I am confident, therefore, that the continued activities of these bodies will help to ensure that consumers receive the appropriate information to enable them to get the best possible value for money for the goods and services that they buy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Commercialisation Fund, established in 2003, is operated by Enterprise Ireland.  In the first instance, the Board of the agency is responsible for decisions on grants awarded and for monitoring the success of the Fund.</P>
        <P>The number of project approvals under the Fund were 73 in 2003, 92 in 2004 and 141 in 2005.  The corresponding funding approved was &euro;14.6m, &euro;14.8m and &euro;22.5m, respectively, for each of the three years.</P>
        <P>The Commercialisation Fund is based on a competitive call for proposals and supports research projects which are intended to develop products with commercial value to a point where they can be taken up by companies. Since 2003, participation of research groups in the programme has expanded consistently, from five Universities in 2003 to sixteen institutions in 2005, including many Institutes of Technology and some hospital-based researchers. Each project supports 3-5 research associates who are trained in relevant techniques and many of whom subsequently move into industry.</P>
        <P>Each project supported by the Fund takes between 2 and 3 years to complete, and it is therefore difficult at this stage to draw definitive conclusions as regards impacts. The outcomes of the fund will be monitored by the new Technology Ireland structure which my Department is putting in place to implement the enterprise-related aspects of the Government&rsquo;s new Strategy on Science Technology and Innovation.</P>
        <P>Prior to the establishment of the Commercialisation Fund, Enterprise Ireland supported 3rd level based research which, while not directly comparable and less clearly focussed on commercialisation, had the potential to lead to similar impacts.  The impact of these earlier research projects in the period since 2003 amounts to approximately 60 licences and 22 spin off companies.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The basic criteria under which the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) have been operating since their inception in 1993, and under which funding is available, is based primarily on factors such as the sector of the economy in which an enterprise is operating or intends to operate and the size or proposed size of the enterprise. CEBs can assist, through either financial or non-financial means, in the establishment and/or development of new and existing enterprises from individuals/sole traders, companies and community groups subject to certain eligibility criteria such as that the enterprise must be in the commercial sphere and must not employ more than 10 people. Priority is given to <Col N="552"/>enterprises in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors which over time may develop into strong export entities.</P>
        <P>A fundamental review of the role and functions of the CEBs in the development of micro-enterprises was conducted during 2003/2004 by Fitzpatricks and Associates, Economic Consultants. This review largely endorsed the activities and operations of the CEBs but recommended that, in providing assistance to micro-enterprises, CEBs should focus more on economic, rather than social or local development, objectives; that there should be a renewed focus on the core enterprise mission; that the issues of potential deadweight, displacement and duplication should be more systematically and rigorously addressed and that there should be a move away from direct grant aid to repayable finance as well as a greater provision of soft supports as an alternative to grant aid.</P>
        <P>The recent Report of the Small Business Forum, which I set up to examine in broad terms the current environment for conducting small business in Ireland, has since endorsed the key recommendations of the Fitzpatricks Report in relation to the future focus of CEB assistance.</P>
        <P>My Department is working with the CEBs in relation to the continued implementation of the Fitzpatricks recommendations in an appropriate manner and in order to determine how best the CEBs can re-focus their supports in line with the recommendations of both Reports in order to ensure that the eligibility criteria remain fully relevant to current market conditions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Companies Registration Office is the repository for all companies registered in Ireland.  There are currently 168,817 companies on the Register with a total directorship of 434,617.  The Register does not indicate the percentage of registered companies having a female chief executive or chairperson.</P>
        <P>The 2005 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor indicated that there is a healthy interest among Irish women in developing their own businesses and that many Irish women are actively pursuing this option.  However, it is still true that there is a large differential between the numbers of male and female entrepreneurs.  As regards my own Department&rsquo;s responsibilities, the report recommended that targeted assistance be provided to female entrepreneurs and this recommendation is being pursued through Enterprise Ireland and the County Enterprise Boards.</P>
        <P>Policy in the area of gender equality generally is being developed through the current formulation of the National Women&rsquo;s Strategy to which the Government is committed under social partnership.  The draft Strategy is being developed under the direction of an Inter-Departmental Committee by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>The draft Strategy, which is nearing completion, will be a wide ranging document setting out the Government&rsquo;s Strategy under three key themes to foster socio-economic opportunity, enhance well-being and engage women in active citizenship.  The Strategy will have a ten year lifespan and will include the promotion of the active participation and advancement of women in the <Col N="554"/>work place and in economic and political decision-making.</P>
        <P>The Strategy will build on the key contribution which strong employment equality legislation has made in tackling the difficulties women have experienced in gaining advancement in the work place.  In particular, improved provisions in relation to maternity leave, parental leave, adoptive leave, the national minimum wage and part-time employment have made it easier for women to combine employment and family life.  The work of the National Framework Committees on Work/Life Balance and on Equal Opportunities at the Level of the Enterprise are also important contributors in this area.</P>
        <P>The training programmes to which the Deputy refers may offer some guidance on how to encourage greater participation by potential female senior executives and this will be considered as part of the implementation of the Strategy.</P>
        <P>Other programmes to further the participation and advancement of women in the workforce have included:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />F&Aacute;S has prepared a positive action programme to increase the range of job opportunities open to women, including work to encourage women to enter apprenticeships and the development of new apprenticeships in areas that are more attractive to women.</P>

	<P el="0">The promotion of Tralee and the North Kerry area for new investment and jobs is an operational matter for IDA Ireland and Shannon Development as part of their statutory responsibilities and not a matter in which I have a direct function. While I may give general policy directives to the Agencies I am precluded from giving directives relating to individual undertakings or to give preference to one area over another.</P>
        <P>I did have the opportunity to visit Kerry this year, and I had a constructive engagement with local representatives and business leaders regarding the development and investment needs of the area. I look forward to availing of the opportunity of visiting Kerry again and including Tralee on my itinerary, to discuss any specific difficulties or challenges that may exist locally.  The precise timing of such a visit will of course be subject to other diary and Parliamentary commitments.</P>
        <P>At the end of 2005, there were 1,888 people in permanent employment in eighteen IDA assisted companies in the County.  I note from the Live Register for September 2006 that the number of people on the Register in the Tralee area was 2,942.  The figure for September 2005 was 2,820.</P>
        <P>The Kerry Technology Park (KTP) is a Shannon Development initiative in co-operation with the Institute of Technology Tralee and in partnership with IDA Ireland, Tralee Urban District Council, Kerry County Council, and the private sector.  There were 16 companies operating from the Park at the end of 2005, employing 220 people &ndash; an increase of 55 over 2004. This increase was spread across a number of companies, all of which operate in the knowledge based business sector, which is a positive outturn for the Tralee based technology park.</P>
        <P>Shannon Development has recently approved a significant support package for two Kerry-based indigenous companies. This support will lead to increased research and development activity in both companies and will generate an additional 43 jobs at Kerry Technology Park over the next five years.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by the development agencies, together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development will bear fruit in terms of additional sustainable investment and jobs for the people of Tralee and the wider Kerry area.</P>

	<P>The July 2006 report which I commissioned from Forf&aacute;s on the changing nature of the Irish manufacturing sector  illustrates the complex performance of this  sector in recent years. While CSO data indicates that both manufacturing output and merchandise export levels increased significantly between 2000 and 2005 (by 28.2% and 31.8% in volume terms respectively), the total number of persons employed in manufacturing in Ireland declined by approximately 31,000 over the same period.  This trend suggests that strong productivity improvements have been achieved over the past 5/6 years in the Irish manufacturing sector.</P>
        <P>Amongst other factors contributing to the decline in manufacturing employment in Ireland in recent years is the offshoring of lower value-added functions which is a reality of modern global manufacturing. This can occur because of increasing cost competitiveness in other locations or because firms need to gain more efficient access to vital markets. Productivity gains achieved through offshoring represent an opportunity to develop higher end manufacturing and related activities domestically, such as R&amp;D, marketing and sales functions.</P>
        <P>To put the decline in manufacturing employment in context, however, since 1997 over half a million new jobs have been created in Ireland. The losses in manufacturing have been more than offset by job creation in services where employment increased by over 400,000.  Some 100,000 jobs were created in financial services and other business services while employment  in the construction sector grew by 130,000.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that the latest CSO release on Industrial Employment (30 June 2006) indicated an increase of 2,400 in the numbers employed in manufacturing in the quarter ending March 2006 relative to the same period in 2005. The outlook for the sector remains positive &ndash;the NCB Purchasing Managers Index rose from 50.7 in June  2005 to 55.4 in June 2006 indicating  further expected growth.</P>
        <P>These trends in Irish manufacturing are in line with the gradual process of structural change that characterises economic development. Over the last two decades there has been a structural shift in the economic composition of developed economies. In the OECD countries, this has resulted in a decrease in the numbers employed in manufacturing with a concurrent rise in the number of jobs in services. This decline is not unique to the developed economies and is in fact a global phenomenon. ILO and UNIDO employment estimates show that manufacturing employment in some key non-OECD countries has also declined in these countries.</P><Col N="557"/>
        <P>I am clear and support strongly the important role played by the Irish manufacturing sector. It is an important and integral part of the economy which provides inputs to other sectors of the economy and satisfies a broad range of final and intermediate demands.</P>
        <P>High value manufacturing, in particular, is a key driver of innovation and technological advance. It increases opportunities for attracting and imbedding R&amp;D activities, collaboration with the higher education sector and stimulating networks. In this context the enterprise development agencies will continue to pursue strategies to foster enterprise creation and assist existing companies with  the transition to higher value, knowledge based activities that will provide long term sustainable employment for the future.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 160 and 178 together.</P>
        <P>I am aware that food prices have been fluctuating during the course of 2006. For example, recent CSO figures show that the prices of products previously covered by the Groceries Order fell by 0.5% in the five-month period from April to August.  This is in contrast with a 0.3% increase in prices, for the same products, in the five-month period before the abolition of the Order.</P>
        <P>However, while we are seeing a downward trend in some grocery prices, the Consumer Price Index also shows an increase in the price of fresh meat and fish, products which were not covered by the Groceries Order.</P>
        <P>The Order was in place for 18 years and, in that time, it fundamentally altered the structure and composition of the grocery trade. It was abolished primarily because it allowed wholesalers and suppliers to determine minimum retail prices charged to consumers, thereby seriously constraining competition in the market.</P>
        <P>I have always maintained that we should not expect to see fundamental changes in the sector <Col N="558"/>in the short term following the abolition of the Order.  This is because there are many factors which impact on prices of groceries in our shops. The lack of competition caused by the Groceries Order was only one such factor. Other factors include production costs, labour costs, interest rates, overheads, international exchange rates and so on.</P>
        <P>Having said that, the implementation by one multiple of reductions in the price of thousands of products previously covered by the Order appears to have had a positive impact on competition in the market with other significant players adopting competitive pricing strategies. So while I believe that consumers are seeing some early benefits with these price reductions, I expect that the real benefits will only be felt over time as price competition increases at retail level.</P>

	<P>I propose to takes Questions Nos. 29 and 69 together.</P>
        <P>International indicators of competitiveness are produced by a number of international organisations. Many of these are based on a combination of survey and statistical data and they give us  broad pointers to competitiveness and where we stand vis a vis other countries. In 2004 the World Economic Forum placed Ireland 26th in its international competitiveness league a rise of four places on the previous year. We were 30th in 2003.   Subsequent changes to its ranking methodology places Ireland in 21st position out of 125 economies in 2006, the same position as in 2005.  This is a significant achievement given that some of our competitors slipped in their ranking.</P>
        <P>What is important, however, is the trend in competitiveness over time and in this regard we are making steady progress. The IMD which also compiles an international competitiveness ranking positioned Ireland as the 11th. most competitive economy in 2006, up one place since 2005.  In relation to rankings provided by the World Bank, I note that Ireland is ranked as the 10th. easiest place in which to do business, while the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor ranks Ireland as the best place in the EU for entrepreneurship.</P>
        <P>Competitiveness has many dimensions. As the National Competitiveness Council  points out, we cannot excel in every indicator and nor should we try.  What counts ultimately is our ability to grow our economy, create jobs for our citizens, improved  prosperity and general quality of life. We have done this successfully  over the past 15 years.</P>

        <P>The amount of money received in up-front request fees for each year between 2003 and 2005 was &euro;285, &euro;585 and &euro;750 respectively.  Up-front fees did not apply in 2002, so no such fees were collected in that year.  The amount of up-front fees collected in the first 9 months of 2006 was &euro;495.</P>
        <P>The amount of money received in respect of search (information retrieval) fees between 2002 and 2005 was &euro;892.76, &euro;616.91, &euro;241.50 and &euro;429.50 respectively.  The amount of money received in respect of search fees in the first 9 months of 2006 was &euro;370.92.</P>
        <P>The percentage of requests coming from journalists in each of the years between 2002 and 2005 was 38%, 35%, 34% and 45% respectively.  The percentage of requests coming from journalists in the first 9 months of 2006 was 24%.</P>
        <P>The percentage of retrieval fees that were charged to journalists rather than members of the public between 2002 and 2005 was 58.5%, 68%, 39.8%, and 84%.  The equivalent figure for the first 9 months of 2006 is 19.3%.</P>
        <P>The percentage of requests from journalists for which a search fee was charged between 2002 and 2005 was 14.2%, 22.6%, 19.0%, and 20.5% respectively.  The equivalent figure for the first 9 months of 2006 is 26.6%.</P>
        <P>The percentage of requests from members of the public for which a search fee was charged between 2002 and 2005 was 5.1%, 6.3%, 13.5% and 6.9%.  The equivalent figure for the first 9 months of 2006 is 28.5%.  Members of the public would not be considered to include staff members of the Department or Members of the Oireachtas, each of whom account for a small number of requests.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that there is no obligation under the Freedom of Information Act for requesters to identify themselves as journalists or to give any other reason for making a request.</P>
        <P>In addition, it should be noted that the Freedom of Information Act obliges decision makers (save in a few limited circumstances) to charge search and retrieval fees where significant search and retrieval of records is involved.  The decision to charge a search fee is therefore not a discretionary one, and arises from the scope of a request.</P>

The Government strongly supports a balanced and ambitious WTO agreement, one which takes into account the interests of all the participants, developing and developed countries, farmers and industrialists. A well-regulated global trading environment, with a strong WTO, is in everybody&rsquo;s interests and a small open economy like Ireland has much to gain from a well-ordered rules-based world trading system.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 179 together.</P>
        <P>Ireland is not a party to the UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of all Migrant Workers and Members of their Families, which was adopted by the UN General Assembly in December 1990.  Nor has Ireland ratified this Convention. No other Member States of the European Union have signed or ratified this Convention either.</P>
        <P>This Convention is a complex cross-cutting one, which has been examined by several Government Departments.  I understand that before Ireland could consider ratifying it there would need to be significant changes across a wide range of existing legislation, including employment, social welfare, education, taxation and electoral law.</P>
        <P>Many of the issues addressed by the Convention would have a European Union dimension and this would also complicate any proposed ratification by Ireland of it, if our European partners were to continue to refrain from ratification, as they seem likely to do.  In this context there are no plans to ratify this Convention.</P>
        <P>But this does not signify that I am not committed to many of the ideals and aspirations which the Convention tried to further.  In particular, I am fully committed to the prevention of exploitation of migrant workers and to ensuring that all workers benefit from the full range of our employment rights protections.</P>
        <P>In this respect I would point out that this range of protections has been added to by the Employment Permits Act 2006, which was signed by the President on 23rd June 2006.  It provides a number of new important protections for migrant workers including:</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 88 and 166 together.</P>
        <P>The Business Regulation Forum was established by me in November 2005 and has met nine times to date. Its Terms of Reference are to advise the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on any changes necessary to ensure that existing or proposed regulations, impacting on business, meet the criteria set out in the White Paper &ldquo;Regulating Better&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Forum has initiated a number of actions, as follows, designed to give &ldquo;hard intelligence&rdquo; about regulations affecting the business sector, the perceptions of the sector and the burdens imposed:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />The Forum is examining 40 submissions that it received in response to a public call.</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />A consultant has been contracted to map the main regulations that impinge on six selected companies.</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />A pilot study has been commissioned to measure the administrative cost to business of providing the annual return to the Companies Registration Office and of legislation regarding labelling.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I understand that the Forum intends to issue a Report to me before the end of 2006 based on their consideration of the activities outlined above.</P>
        <P>In addition to the work of the Business Regulation Forum my Department, as well as other relevant Departments and Agencies, is following up on the recommendations of the Small Business <Col N="564"/>Forum, which included measures to address the administrative burden on small business.  In this regard legislation is currently before the Oireachtas, to raise the audit exemption thresholds applying to small companies in respect to turnover and balance sheet to &euro;7.3m and &euro;3.65m. respectively. The existing thresholds are &euro;1.5 and &euro;1.9 million respectively.  This will remove the compulsory annual audit costs from the very large number of companies qualifying from the enhanced exemption level.</P>
        <P>The Company Law Review Group (CLRG) has almost finalised its work on the preparation of the General Scheme of the Heads of the Companies Consolidation and Reform Bill and I understand that it expects to report on its recommendations shortly.  The Bill will introduce a greatly simplified legal framework for corporate activity.</P>

	<P>Neither my Department nor the bodies under its aegis have primary responsibility for the delivery of English language instruction. My Department does not have any plans to provide subsidies towards English language instruction.</P>
        <P>However, as part of its responsibilities for training, F&Aacute;S is currently in the process of developing training materials to assist migrant workers who have language difficulties. This material will be in the form of two generic courses of ninety hours in duration, pitched at two levels. F&Aacute;S is also in the process of developing English Language courses for three specific work disciplines (Construction, Security and Hospitality). All of these courses, if completed satisfactorily, will lead to a FETAC Special Purpose Award.</P>
        <P>Through the F&Aacute;S &lsquo;Skills for Work programme&rsquo;, which aims to provide for the basic education needs of workers in low skilled employment, a technical English programme (Steps to Safety) is provided in order to improve communication, especially regarding the safety of workers in the workplace.High value manufacturing, in particular, is a key driver of innovation and technological advance. It increases opportunities for attracting and imbedding R&amp;D activities, collaboration with the higher education sector and stimulating networks. In this context the enterprise development agencies will continue to pursue strategies to foster enterprise creation and assist existing companies with  the transition to higher value, knowledge based activities that will <Col N="565"/>provide long term sustainable employment for the future.</P>

	<P>Finding alternative employment for the workers in question is a priority for the State Development agencies and, last week, myself and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources met with a representative group from Ballivor, including some former workers, and outlined ongoing developments and stressed the priority efforts being made in Ballivor.</P>
        <P>The Industrial Training agency F&Aacute;S has briefed all staff on the range of services available to them and many of them continue to participate in the various programmes run by the agency.  Since the announcement of the job losses, Enterprise Ireland has participated at a number of meetings with the company concerned, outlining the various types of assistance that are available. In conjunction with Meath County Enterprise Board, Enterprise Ireland is participating in a series of workshops, which started in July 2006.  These workshops concern Ideas Generation and how to Start Your Own Business.  These courses are on going.</P>
        <P>A major financial services project which will provide 700 jobs over 5 years was recently announced for Navan and this will be of significant benefit to County Meath as a whole.  Notwithstanding this, IDA Ireland continues to promote Ballivor as a priority location within the County and is actively promoting the facility in question for new investment.  To date, three potential investors have been introduced to the management of the existing facility.  I am aware that the State Development agencies have strengthened their marketing efforts in County Meath, in partnership with local interests, in order to increase job opportunities for Ballivor and the surrounding area.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37, 55, 86 and 97 together.</P>
        <P>The existing staff complement of the Labour Inspectorate of the Department comprises 31 Inspectors and some 7 administrative support staff.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies will be aware, the Social Partnership Agreement &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo; sets out a number of commitments with regard to employment standards and compliance including a commitment to establish an Office of the Director for Employment Rights Compliance (ODERC). This Office, which will also assume the functions of the Labour Inspectorate, will be established through the enactment of primary legislation, to be published next year, and will be led by a Director at senior management level.  While the Office will retain a presence in Dublin there will be a regionalised structure with the headquarters earmarked for location in Carlow.  No specific budget has been allocated to date for the ODERC.  Negotiations with the Department of Finance in this regard are proceeding in the context of the 2007 Estimates process with a view to finalising a budget allocation in time for publication of the Pre-Budget Estimates in November this year.</P>
        <P>The number of Labour Inspectors under this Office will be progressively increased from 31 to 90 by end-2007, as part of the initiative provided in &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo; to increase the staffing resources of the Employment Rights Bodies generally.  In addition to the Labour Inspectorate the new Office will also have responsibility for the provision of employment rights information and for prosecutions. It will be provided with legal, accounting and other administrative support to ensure its effective functioning.</P><Col N="567"/>
        <P>I am pleased to say that the position of Director of the ODERC has been advertised by the Public Appointments Service.  The closing date for applications is 26 October. The selection process for this competition may include the shortlisting of candidates, a preliminary interview and a competitive interview.</P>
        <P>The Legal Advisor and Accountant positions within the ODERC will be advertised this week by the Public Appointments Service while arrangements in respect of the filling of other senior management positions within the ODERC are proceeding in the context of the Decentralisation Central Applications Facility.</P>
        <P>My Department is in consultation with the Department of Finance in relation to the filling of some 60 new Labour Inspector positions.  No difficulties in relation to the proposed filling of these positions have been encountered and I expect that the necessary competitions to fill these positions will be progressed satisfactorily.</P>

	<P>Section 80 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005 provides for   individual responsibility by directors, managers or other similar officers of an undertaking.  It provides that they be held responsible before the courts for any act that may constitute an offence under the 2005 Act or other relevant statutory provisions which may be attributable to connivance or neglect or was authorised or consented to by them.  This statutory provision meets the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission on corporate killing in so far as occupational safety, health and welfare is concerned.</P>
        <P>However, in so far as the recommendations of the Commission refer to the wider area than occupational safety, health and welfare, this matter was referred to the Office of the Attorney General at the time of the drafting of the Bill which was enacted as the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005.  The Attorney General was of the opinion that there were much broader issues then safety, health and welfare at work relating to the overall criminal justice system which needed to be considered, as legislating in the relatively confined area of occupational safety and health would omit other sectors where such an offence could be committed.  Therefore it was decided that it was not appropriate to deal with the wider issue of corporate killing in legislation <Col N="568"/>which was providing for the law and regulation of occupational safety, health and welfare.</P>
        <P>The Law Reform Commission accepted the Attorney General&rsquo;s office view that the scope of the 2005 Act was narrower than the proposed offence recommended by it in its report.</P>
        <P>The matter of consideration of the wider effect of the recommendations in the report of the Law Reform Commission is one for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the context of his main responsibilities for the criminal law system.</P>

	<P>On 31 August, 2006, I announced the creation of 1,000 jobs by the company in question to support its international development.  Up to 700 of these jobs will be located at a new facility in Navan, Co. Meath and the remainder will be created at the company&rsquo;s existing Irish operations in Cavan and Blanchardstown.</P>
        <P>The overall investment is being supported by Enterprise Ireland and is line with the agency&rsquo;s mission to assist the growth of innovative Irish business that can achieve significant scale globally.  The details of the funding support approved are commercially sensitive.  However, <Col N="569"/>actual payments will only be made as the company implements its investment and jobs are created.  The agency will, of course, make the details of such payments available through its Annual Report as they occur.</P>
        <P>The nature of this type of investment and its size will provide continuing benefits well into the future both to the local communities, the broader region and at a national level.  Many of the benefits will be very tangible in nature.  For example, the creation of new jobs will lead to enhanced employment opportunities for local people that will have positive implications both economically and socially.  Additional resources will result for the Exchequer in terms of increased income tax and corporation tax takes.  The jobs created and a fall in unemployment in the particular locality may also lead to a saving in social welfare provisions.</P>
        <P>Other benefits are more intangible.  These can be critical for the local economy and include sub-supply opportunities for firms in the immediate locality.  In essence the investment will have a multiplier effect providing for a thriving and diverse local enterprise base that directly and indirectly supports the projects.  Such projects can also act as an incentive for other companies to establish in the regions concerned.</P>
        <P>The benefits accruing could potentially be self generating for many years and ensure long-term sustainable economic development.  Enterprise Ireland undertakes a comprehensive appraisal of projects from companies that seek funding.  Over time, the return to the State for the investment in the project will be a combination of a number of items including income tax, corporation tax and spend in the economy that subsequently accrue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 100 together.</P>
        <P>I have provided funding of more than &euro;30m to the County and City Enterprise Boards this year.  This represents an increase of nearly 8% on the allocation provided in 2005. In addition to the Exchequer funding provided, the CEBs have an increasing flow of funds available to them from repayments of refundable grants provided in earl<Col N="570"/>ier years.  It is estimated that some &euro;3m has been available to the CEBs in 2006 from this source.</P>
        <P>I believe that the level of funding available to the CEBs is adequate and appropriate at this time and that it enables all CEBs to fulfil their function and their remit in maximizing entrepreneurial development in the micro-enterprise sector throughout the country. The CEBs play an extremely important role in the development of indigenous enterprise in Ireland and it is my intention that an appropriate level of financial support for all CEBs will continue to be made available.  I am confident that the level of funding available is sufficient to enable any CEB support any good quality projects that may present.</P>
        <P>In determining the allocations for individual CEBs, my Department adopts a systematic approach to ensure the maximum degree of objectivity and equity of treatment.  This approach involves the provision of funding on the basis of a standard initial allocation to each CEB as well as an additional allocation that is determined mainly by population but which also takes account of issues such as local unemployment trends, capacity to spend, existing commitments and regional spread.  Furthermore, my Department works closely with the CEBs throughout the year to ensure that the available funding is utilised to the maximum extent possible.  This can involve funds being reallocated from Boards that are not in a position to spend their full allocations to Boards that have a demand for additional funding. This exercise is taking place at present as Boards are now in a better position to determine actual requirements to year-end.</P>

	<P>I understand that a report under the provisions of section 56 of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001 has been provided by the liquidator of the company concerned to the Director of Corporate Enforcement. The issue of what further action arising from the report is a matter for the Director. </P>
        <P>With regard to the matter of monies owed to the employees of this company, the Employment Rights Section of my Department have referred this case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal <Col N="571"/>under Section 9(3) of the Protection of Employees (Employers&rsquo; Insolvency) Act 1984 for a decision on the matter.</P>
        <P>The Insolvency Payments Section of my Department has received applications from the liquidator of the company in early May on behalf of approximately 150 employees for payment of arrears of wages and other entitlements from the Social Insurance Fund under the Insolvency Payments Scheme.   However the circumstances of the liquidation gave rise to a doubt as to whether the debts due to the employees are payable under the Scheme, or whether a transfer of undertakings within the meaning of the European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003 has taken place, in which case those debts might have been transferred to and be payable by their new employer. The Redundancy Section has claims from 21 employees for redundancy payments, and these are also being held pending the decision of the Tribunal.</P>
        <P>The case was referred to the Employment Appeals Tribunal on the 29th June 2006 for a decision and the hearing is scheduled for 14th December 2006.</P>
        <P>I understand that the matter first came to the attention of my Department in May 2006. Business failure is an unfortunate fact of life. However, the changes introduced in Irish company law, Part 5 of the 2001 Act in particular, are intended to address problems and issues connected with business failure, including what has been referred to as the &ldquo;phoenix syndrome&rdquo;.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43, 76 and 84 together.</P>
        <P>The EU Commission&rsquo;s report of 26 September 2006 stated that Bulgaria and Romania will be in a position to join the EU on 1st January 2007, provided that these countries address a number of outstanding issues.  The Council of EU Foreign Ministers will decide at their meeting on 16 October whether accession should go ahead on 1st January 2007.</P>
        <P>The Treaties of Accession provide for transitional arrangements as follows:</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />Phase 1:  2007-2008 	Member States shall apply national measures for the 2 years following accession, which means that they may decide to liberalise access to their labour market or continue to require nationals of Bulgaria and Romania to hold employment permits.</P>
     <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />Phase 2:  2009-2011 	Member States must notify the Commission before end 2008 whether they plan to continue any restrictions for a further 3 years or not.</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash66" />Phase 3:  2012-2013 	In principle, transitional measures restricting access should cease to be applied at the end of the Phase 2 (31 December, 2011) but a Member State, in cases of serious disturbances of its labour market or threat thereof and having notified the Commission, may continue to apply restrictions for a further 2 years.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Government will make a decision with regard to access to the Irish labour market of nationals of Bulgaria and Romania before the date of Accession, after consultations with the Social Partners.  Contacts with the United Kingdom on the issue are continuing.</P>
        <P>May I remind Deputies that the Employment Permits Act 2006, which was signed by the President in June 2006, provides the legal basis for three options.  These options are that nationals of Bulgaria and Romania who wish to participate in the Irish labour market during the first two years of transition:</P>
        <P LI="1">(i) continue to require work permits with the current requirement for a labour market test to establish that the positions cannot be filled from within the European Economic Area, or</P>
         <P LI="1">(ii) be granted work permits on foot of a job offer without a labour market test, or</P><Col N="573"/>
       <P LI="1">(iii) be allowed to participate without any requirement for a work permit.</P>
<?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P FLI="0">Issues to be considered when making the decision will include the circumstances of the Irish, Bulgarian and Romanian labour markets.  Other issues to be considered include other Member States intentions &mdash; and in particular those of the United Kingdom, foreign relations issues, social welfare entitlements, the integration of migrants and the views of the Social Partners.</P>
        <P>The Common Travel Area does not affect the issue of labour market participation but rather relates to the free movement of persons for purposes other than employment, such as tourism.</P>
        <P>In relation to the National Economic and Social Council Report entitled &ldquo;Migration Policy&rdquo; and my role in relation to economic migration policy I would point out that I made a detailed statement to this House on the scope and direction of the new economic migration arrangements for labour market participation by workers from outside the European Economic Area during my opening address on the Second Stage of the Employment Permits Act 2006 on 12th October 2005. These arragements will comprise:</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />a Green Card for occupations where there are skills shortages, which will be for a restricted list of occupations in the annual salary range from &euro;30,000 to &euro;60,000 and for a more extensive list of occupations in the annual salary range above &euro;60,000;</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />for other occupations work permits will only be granted where it can be demonstrated, following a rigorous labour market test, that suitable employees are not available within the EEA;</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />the grant and issue in all cases of the employment permit or Green Card to the employee;</P>
   <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />a re-established Intra-Company transfer scheme for temporary transnational management transfers.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I expect to have these new arrangements fully operational by 2007.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s Strategy for STI 2006-13 was launched by the Taoiseach and myself on 18 June this year, together with my Ministerial colleagues from the Departments of Finance, Health, Education and Agriculture, indicative of the whole of government approach to STI issues which underpins this Strategy.</P><Col N="574"/>
        <P>The Strategy is a product of the work of the eight-member Interdepartmental Committee on STI, chaired by my Department, which receives its policy direction from the Cabinet Subcommittee on STI, which I chair.</P>
        <P>On 26 July, I addressed over a hundred key stakeholders and gave them a detailed presentation on the Strategy, which was followed by a wide-ranging discussion of the challenges ahead. The Strategy has been widely welcomed by those involved in the STI arena.</P>
        <P>In terms of implementation, the central policy and oversight roles of the Cabinet Subcommittee and IDC are being maintained. In addition, the Strategy set out a range of new implementation mechanisms, chief among which are Technology Ireland and the Higher Education Research Group. Technology Ireland, which is led by my own Department, has been established and brings together the Department&rsquo;s agencies responsible for research and commercialisation, namely; Enterprise Ireland, Industrial Development Agency, Science Foundation Ireland and Forf&aacute;s. Technology Ireland is now taking forward key initiatives proposed in the Strategy including the streamlining of enterprises research grant supports and development of a call for proposals for Competence Centres. In addition, the competition to select a new Chief Scientific Advisor is well underway and will be concluded in November.</P>
        <P>The Higher Education Research Group, which is being established by my colleague the Minister for Education &amp; Science, will include the Departments and agencies responsible for research funding in the HE sector.  Arrangements are also being put in place to ensure regular interaction between these two groups and the public sector research performers, to ensure coherence and a concerted delivery of the Strategy&rsquo;s objectives.</P>
        <P>As was stated at the launch of the Strategy by my colleague the Minister for Finance, the initial &euro;192m euro resources necessary to implement the Strategy immediately (amounting to &euro;192m &mdash; &euro;66m in 2007 &amp; &euro;126m in 2008), has already been committed and will be provided for in the Estimates and adjusted Capital Envelopes. This additional funding will be used exclusively to implement key elements of the Strategy. The distribution of the further resources required will be decided by Government in the context of the NDP, of which the Strategy will be a core component.</P>

	<P>The Report of the Expert Advisory <Col N="575"/>Group on Workplace Bullying was launched and published by me on the 17th August 2005 and it follows on from a 2001 Report by the Taskforce on the Prevention of Workplace Bullying. The recommendations of the 2001 Taskforce were implemented.</P>
        <P>One of the recommendations in the 2005 Report of the Expert Advisory Group was  that a follow up survey on workplace bullying, similar to that commissioned for the 2001 report, be conducted as soon as practicable to establish a baseline from which the effectiveness of the new structures and processes would be measured.  The Department has commissioned the ESRI to carry out this survey.</P>
        <P>I have already given a commitment to publish the results of the survey and to bring the results to Government along with the Report and the views of the Social Partners and other interested parties. The Government will then decide on how best to implement the Report&rsquo;s Recommendations.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, I have asked the Health and Safety Authority to update the 2002 Code of Practice on Workplace Bullying (one of the recommendations of the 2001 Report) and bring it in line with the 2005 Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>In relation to the 172 jobs in question, I would like the parties concerned to renew their negotiations in order to reach an agreement which would prevent the loss of the jobs.  I have spoken on a ongoing basis to both sides in an effort to facilitate a resolution of the issue.</P>
        <P>The Industrial Development agencies are continuing to promote Cork for employment opportunities.  The strategy of IDA Ireland to create employment in Cork is to progress the development of a knowledge economy, so that the City can compete both nationally and internationally for foreign direct investment.  The agency is also working with its existing client base to expand their presence in Cork as well as providing modern property solutions with supporting infrastructure in the area.  New investment announcements made this year include Amgen, Citco, Netgear, Pepsi and Amazon, and AIB/Bank of New York.  There were also a number of job announcements for the City and County at the end of last year.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland is also actively involved in assisting its client companies to grow and expand their businesses.  So far this year, Enterprise <Col N="576"/>Ireland has made payments in excess of &euro;5 million to its client companies in County Cork.  Since the beginning of 2005 to date, Enterprise Ireland has made payments of over &euro;13 million to its client companies in the County.  This investment (which included Rubicon Centre C.I.T, Websites and National Software Centre) was primarily to support new business employment, as well as research and development, capital investment and staff training.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the Industrial Development agencies, including the County Enterprise Board, will continue to bring sustainable investment and job opportunities to the Cork region in the foreseeable future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The recent rise in prices for manufacturing industry imported inputs is partly caused by increasing oil prices. The increasing price of oil, of course, must be paid for by manufacturers the world over, so this does not place Ireland at a particular competitiveness disadvantage.</P>
        <P>The issue of cost competitiveness and the health of manufacturing depends on a much wider array of issues, from the availability of suitable skills to the impact of higher wage costs. The difficulties being faced by some manufacturing sectors in Ireland is mainly due to shifting patterns of international comparative advantage and the process of structural change, with capital and labour resources tied up in declining firms and industries being allocated to other &lsquo;higher value-added&rsquo; activities more suited to the new, higher cost, Irish operating environment.</P>
        <P>The Irish manufacturing sector has been a key component of the Irish economy over the last two decades and it will continue to be a significant contributor to exports, employment and economic growth in the future.</P>
        <P>To assist industry to maintain competitiveness and increase productivity, the economic development agencies are working on an ongoing basis, to promote the adoption of new technology and best practice at company level.  The agencies aim to support sustainable, high value added enterprise in Ireland through the provision of mentoring and developmental supports, the enhancement of management capabilities and critical workforce skills in client companies, support for the creation and implementation of strategies for market entry, development and growth, and strong supports for innovation and for research and development.</P>

	<P>The Construction Federation Operatives Pension Scheme (generally referred to as CFOPS) has been established on foot of a Registered Employment Agreement for the Construction Industry. The terms of the agreement apply to a range of categories of workers in the industry.</P>
        <P>The Construction Industry Monitoring Agency was formed in 1989 under an agreement between the employers and Trade Unions in the Construction Industry. The main objectives of the Agency are to address the dual issues of non-compliance with the terms of the Registered Employment Agreement governing pensions and sick pay and the black economy within the Industry.</P>
        <P>Enforcement of compliance with the CFOPS is a matter primarily for the Labour Court. In pursuing the matter the Labour Court can be assisted by the Labour Inspectorate. Acting on specific information from the Court, the employment records of an employer will be examined by an <Col N="578"/>Inspector and any relevant information gathered is communicated back to the Court subsequently.</P>
        <P>The Social Partnership Agreement &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo; sets out a number of commitments with regard to employment standards and compliance, including a commitment to establish an Office of the Director of Employment Rights Compliance (ODERC) and to effect greater co-ordination between organisations concerned with employment rights compliance, with a view to realising the considerable potential for synergy that exists in this area. The ODERC will develop an ongoing structured dialogue with all parties to the agreement, so that building on close co-operation, a comprehensive and responsive system of compliance and enforcement can be developed. It will be open to the parties to the agreement to provide for this dialogue in memoranda of understanding to be agreed bilaterally with the new Office. Officials of my Department are in the process of preparing legislation to implement the commitments contained in &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>As Minister for Trade and Commerce, I fully support the basic thrust of an approach to Economic Partnership Agreements which ensures that the needs and concerns of developing countries and in particular least developed countries are taken adequately into consideration during the substantive phase of EPA negotiations.</P>
        <P>As regards the formal review, based on Article 37.4 of the Cotonou Agreement, the intention is that this joint review by both EU and ACP should assess the progress made and means needed to conclude the negotiations in time. It was never the intention that the joint assessment should interfere with, or takeover from, the time needed to conduct the substance of the EPA negotiations.</P>
        <P>The EPA will remove tariffs on EU goods and make trade between the EU and ACP easier for both imports and exports of goods and services. This will happen very gradually and with enough flexibility to protect sensitive industry and safeguard mechanisms to account for unforeseen problems. The EU has no offensive interests here. Its aim in the negotiation is sustainable development of ACP countries and regions. The liberalisation process will be carefully managed with transition periods and coverage that is com<Col N="579"/>patible with social and economic constraints while also ensuring legal certainty under WTO rules.</P>
        <P>Regarding alternative trade agreements, the Commission and EU Member States do not believe that there is a legally feasible alternative that offers anywhere near the same benefits as EPAs. The strength of EPAs is in the links between support for reform and trade policy, through the interaction between and the co-ordination of, new trade rules (including in relation to encouraging investment), regional integration, development assistance, and trade liberalisation. Alternatives were discussed extensively in the Cotonou negotiations and despite recent discussion there is no new proposal emerging. Nevertheless, Member States and the Commission will keep an open mind and will examine all proposals made by the ACP.</P>

	<P>In the last year the Oireachtas has enacted the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 which updates and amends the provisions of previous legislation.  The Act is a result of the first major review of occupational health and safety since the 1980s which, inter alia, led to the setting-up of the Health and Safety Authority. The Act provides a modern legal framework to guarantee best international practice in regard to health and safety in the Irish workplace.</P>
        <P>The primary focus in the Act is on prevention.  It provides also for significantly increased fines and penalties to deter the minority who breach health and safety laws.</P>
        <P>The administration and enforcement of occupational safety and health legislation, including the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and related Regulations, is a day to day matter for the Health and Safety Authority.  In this regard, the Authority has a range of enforcement measures available to it, to use as it deems appropriate and necessary, in accordance with the provisions of the 2005 Act.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the updated, modern and comprehensive legislative base that I established through the 2005 Act and the wide range of Regulations made under it, including so far this year Work at Height, Noise, Vibration, Asbestos and Construction, as well as a number of Regulations under EU Directives, sets a sound foundation for implementing occupational safety, health and welfare standards. I am also confident that the Health and Safety Authority, through its <Col N="580"/>targeted, prioritised and broadly based Programmes of Work, is applying the best approach to securing sustained improvements in workplace safety, health and welfare standards.</P>

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s offices are spread over 8 separate buildings, none of which have cafeterias or restaurants.  My Department has only a medium sized canteen in Davitt House and a very small canteen in Kildare Street.  The tea, coffee, sugar and other products served in those two canteens are not confined to Fair Trade products.  However, I can confirm that both canteens have introduced Fair Trade products for sale or are in the process of doing so.  I have again asked that consideration be given to the enhanced sale of Fair Trade tea, coffee, sugar and other products in my Department&rsquo;s two small canteens.</P>
        <P>As regards the agencies under the control of my Department, you may wish to know that last June my Department wrote to all of the agencies involved drawing attention to this issue and asking, on my behalf, that consideration be given to the enhanced sale of Fair Trade products in the canteens, cafeterias or restaurants of those agencies.</P>
        <P>The replies received by my Department indicate support for this initiative and the majority of the agencies involved have indicated that they have introduced Fair Trade tea, coffee, sugar and other products for sale or are in the process of doing so.</P>
        <P>As regards the setting of a target date for the use of only Fair Trade tea, coffee, sugar and other products by my Department and its agencies, I feel that it would not be appropriate to impose such an obligation on the proprietors involved and that the correct course of action is to encourage those proprietors to promote the enhanced sale of Fair Trade tea, coffee, sugar and other products in the canteens etc. which they operate on behalf of my Department and its agencies.</P>

	<P>I attended the EU Competitiveness Council meeting which took place on 25th September 2006. The Council held a formal debate on four key issues, namely: Innovation policy and competitiveness, nominal quantities for pre-packed products, Consumer Policy Action Programme 2007-2013 and development of the single market policy.</P>
        <P>In relation to each of the items discussed, the following decisions and conclusions were reached:</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Innovation policy and competitiveness:</i></P>
        <P>The debate was informed by the recent Commission Communication which proposed ten priority actions in the context of a broad-based innovation policy strategy covering both the technological and non-technological aspects of innovation and research.  The Council welcomed the Finnish Presidency&rsquo;s emphasis on innovation as a key policy area to be developed.  Ministers discussed the ten point action plan and agreed with the need to adopt a global perspective when developing innovation policy and with the role of innovation in delivering the growth and jobs agenda. The Finnish Presidency will aim for conclusions on innovation policy at the December Competitiveness Council.  A lunchtime discussion also took place with Commissioner Kroes in relation to state aid for innovation.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Nominal quantities for pre-packed products:</i></P>
        <P>The Council reached a political agreement on laying down nominal quantities for pre-packed products at EU level.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Consumer Policy Action Programme 2007-2013:</i></P>
        <P>The Council reached political agreement on an amended proposal establishing a Programme of Community action in the field of consumer policy for the period 2007-2013. The Programme contains two main objectives:</P>
        <P LI="1">(a) To ensure a high level of consumer protection, notably through improved evidence, better consultation and better representation of consumers&rsquo; interests and</P>
         <P LI="1">(b) To ensure the effective application of consumer protection rules notably through enforcement cooperation, information, education and redress.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Development of the single market policy</i></P>
        <P>The Council held an orientation debate on the development of the Single Market policy on the basis of a set of questions prepared by the Presidency. The Council also took note of the information provided by Commissioner McCreevy on the preparation of the Commission&rsquo;s review of its <Col N="582"/>policy for the Internal Market and on the Internal Market Scoreboard No. 15 from July 2006.</P>
        <P>The Commission recently conducted a wide-ranging consultation on the state of the Internal Market and directions for the future. This consultation resulted in a number of recommendations covering subjects such as fostering market dynamism and innovation, better regulation, better implementation and enforcement, taking better account of the global context and investing more in information and communication.</P>
        <P>The Council also adopted common positions without debate on a draft Decision establishing the 7th research framework programme (FP7) 2007-2013 and on the Programme &ldquo;Europe for Citizens 2007-2013&rdquo; and on a draft Regulation on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations (&ldquo;Rome 11&rdquo;).  It also adopted a Decision approving the conclusion of an international agreement for implementing the ITER fusion energy project.</P>
        <P>The Council also took note of information provided by the Presidency and the Commission on:</P>
        <P LI="1">(a) Progress on the 7th Framework Programme for research, its Rules for Participation and its Specific Programmes;</P>
      <P LI="1">(b) The 2005 implementation report on retaining and attracting researchers to the European Research Area.</P>
       <P LI="1">(c) 6th Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference on Industry. Rhodes (21/22 September 2006)</P>
       <P LI="1">(d) Communication from the Commission on &ldquo;halting the loss of biodiversity by 2010 and beyond &mdash; sustaining ecosystem services for human well-being&rdquo;</P>
       <P LI="1">(e) State of implementation of the Consumer Protection Co-operation Regulation (EC 2006/2004)</P>
<P LI="1">(f) Preparatory work on the meeting of the National Lisbon Coordinators to be held in Lisbon on 5/6 October 2006</P>
        <P FLI="0">Overall, I believe that the Council has usefully drawn together the range of policy instruments and actions which can contribute to a more competitive and innovative EU.  I welcome the focus being placed on innovation and the removal of barriers which can impede innovation such as burdensome or unnecessary rules.</P>
        <P>At the next Competitiveness Council meeting, which is scheduled to take place in Brussels on the 4th and 5th December, 2006, the Finnish Presidency intends to continue the debate on the priority themes of innovation and competitiveness, the external aspects of competitiveness and better regulation.  I particularly look forward to further action in relation to the non-technological aspects of innovation which will be discussed at future meetings of the Council.</P>

	<P>This question relates to the day-to-day work of the Competition Authority.  The Authority is an independent statutory agency responsible for the enforcement of competition law in the State.  Its mandate and functions are set out in the Competition Act 2002 as amended and, accordingly, I have no direct functional responsibility in the matter.</P>
        <P>Section 42 of the 2002 Act provides that the Authority shall publish an annual report of its activities within two months of the end of each financial year. The Authority&rsquo;s Annual Report for 2005 was published and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in February 2006.</P>
        <P>In addition, under Section 38(2) of the Competition Act, the Authority&rsquo;s Chairperson is obliged to appear, whenever required, before the Committee of Public Accounts in relation to the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s annual report on the Competition Authority&rsquo;s audited accounts.  The Chairperson is also required, under Section 38(4), to attend before any other committee of the Oireachtas as required.</P>
        <P>The Authority, through the Director of Public Prosecutions, has secured a number of criminal convictions for breaches of competition law so far this year.  These are the first criminal convictions on indictment for competition law offences in Ireland and in Europe.  While I am aware, from media reports, that a number of further criminal cases are pending, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on matters which are currently before the courts.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 81 together.</P><Col N="584"/>
        <P>While there has been some deterioration recently in export performance, most notably in April and June of this year, the pattern has been that exports have tended to rebound in subsequent months, and I would not therefore regard the present situation as one of crisis or slowdown.  In fact, when you look at the longer term, it can be seen that the value of our exports increased by 3% for the first six months of 2006, relative to the same period in 2005.  A comparison of 2005 export figures with those for 2004 shows that exports increased by 5% in value terms year on year.  That positive situation was also evident in 2004 where exports increased by 3% in value terms relative to 2003.</P>
        <P>Overall, therefore, the value of Irish exports continues to increase incrementally year on year, and, while it is unlikely that yearly increases in export volumes will regain the levels of increase characteristic of the late 1990&rsquo;s, prior to the dot com slump and the tragic events of September 11th, I believe that as the worst of the global economic recession eases, Irish exporters are well placed to take advantage of an upturn in the European and wider Global economies.</P>
        <P>Irish Government policy has been, for a number of years, to fully exploit our membership of the European Union by diversifying into EU export markets, and also to focus on new opportunities in the US and further afield.   From a position of 75% of Irish exports going to the UK in 1960, we have now reached a point where the EU now accounts for 62% of our exports with only 18% of exports going to the UK.  Since last year, the US has replaced the UK as our leading export market and now accounts for 20% of Irish exports.  Of equal importance is the continuous transformation of both indigenous and foreign direct investment enterprises from low end manufacturing to the production of high value added goods and services such as software, telecommunications and pharmaceuticals resulting in new export opportunities to highly developed economies in the EU, the US and Japan.</P>
        <P>The Irish Government is strongly supportive of Irish exporting firms seeking to increase their level of exports on world markets, and it does so in a number of ways:  my Department through its agency, Enterprise Ireland, is active both domestically at the developmental level and through promotional activities carried out from a range of locations abroad, in assisting Irish indigenous companies to find new markets for their products and to increase their existing level of market share.</P>
        <P>In this, Enterprise Ireland is ably assisted by our Irish Embassies abroad whose staff work closely with the agency in facilitating the development of export markets for Irish exporting companies.  Close coordination is also maintained with other export promotion organizations, such as An Bord Bia, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and non-<Col N="585"/>governmental bodies such as, the Irish Exporters Association and the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland.  In addition, both myself, and my colleague, Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Miche&aacute;l Martin, T.D., have been active in leading trade missions, in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland, to the new member states and Asia, with a view to increasing our share of exports by Irish companies to these countries.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.2- ?>
        <P>While the focus of our efforts has in recent years been towards developing new markets in Northern Europe and the USA and, consequently, reducing our dependence on the UK export market, we have also begun to explore the potential for increasing our exports to Asia and the Far East.  In that context An Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, last year launched the second phase of the Asia Strategy, 2005-2009, following his successful visit to China.  The Asia Strategy contains a number of export oriented targets and objectives, which is overseen by a committee representative of public and private sector interests, with a view to exploiting fully the potential for Irish companies to develop new markets in Asia over the coming years.</P>
        <P>My Department and its agencies will continue to work with other organisations engaged in export promotion, with a view to increasing the overall level of Irish exports in existing markets and in creating new markets for Irish exporting firms.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>While I am unclear of the source of the Deputy&rsquo;s data, I would point out that the value of Ireland&rsquo;s merchandise exports to the European Union has remained broadly the same in 2001 and 2005 &ndash; at some &euro;57b (CSO data). This is notwithstanding the fact that Ireland&rsquo;s export levels reached record levels in 2001/2002. The exceptional figures in 2000-2002 were also distorted by what is referred to as the VAT Carousel Fraud. The general world recession following the dot com bubble burst and 9/11 resulted in a reduction of exports in 2003. However exports have been rising steadily since then, up 3% in 2004 and a further 5% in 2005 (with at a more modest increase of 1.2% within Europe between 2003 and 2005). Our biggest single market is now of course the USA.</P>
        <P>While data on services is somewhat less robust, Forfas estimates that Irish services exports to the Eurozone in the period of 1999 &ndash; 2004 rose by <Col N="586"/>212% to reach a value of &euro;14.1b while those to the UK, Sweden and Denmark rose by 136% over the same period to reach a value of &euro;11.8b (Forfas International Trade and Investment Report 2005).  Overall therefore, Ireland&rsquo;s export performance with and within Europe remains strong.</P>
        <P>A further factor which may be influencing the Deputy&rsquo;s figures is the fact that the Union expanded by 10 member states in 2004 with whom we would not historically have had a large volume of trade. As exports from the new Member States would be an additional factor in the 2005 totals, this naturally would affect Ireland&rsquo;s percentage share of the new, larger, EU total level of exports from 25 countries as opposed to 15.</P>

        <Quest> the measures he intends to take to protect consumers and businesses from spiralling inflation; if adjustments in the budget allocations within his Department or its agencies are necessary in view of the prediction at the time of budget 2006 of average annual inflation of 2.7% compared to the expected situation of 5% by end of 2006; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The 2.7 per cent Consumer Price Index inflation forecast for 2006 was calculated on Budget day by the Department of Finance using the technical assumption of unchanged interest rates. Since that time the European Central Bank has raised interest rates four times by a quarter point on each occasion. Interest rate increases have a major impact on CPI inflation but are outside of the control of the Government. CPI inflation has averaged 3.8 per cent in the first eight months of the year. The Department of Finance will be publishing new forecasts in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>All developed economies face rising costs at some point in their supply chain and Ireland is no exception. Our best response to the realities of globalisation is to ensure that Ireland remains attractive for investment and enterprise growth. While the costs faced by business in some areas here may be relatively higher than other economies, the challenge is to maintain our competitiveness in areas such as skills, education, knowledge infrastructure and the quality generally of our workforce. In an international context, competitiveness, the ability to profitably and successfully trade against world competitors in the face of globalisation pressures while creating attractive investment and employment opportunities are the real benchmarks of a successful economy.</P>
        <P>This Government is taking concrete steps to control Irish inflation.  The wage element recently agreed in Towards 2016 will provide certainty and <Col N="587"/>contribute to redressing the wage element of inflationary pressures.  Also in the new Social Partnership agreement is a commitment to reactivating the Anti-Inflation Group, which will allow the social partners to cooperate and coordinate efforts in combating inflation.</P>
        <P>Finally, I have no plans to alter either the Department&rsquo;s budget for 2006 nor the budgets of any of the agencies or bodies under its aegis on the basis of inflation.</P>

        <P FLI="0">In relation to Council Directive 2001/86/EC, the Commission issued a Letter of Formal Notice on 13 December 2004 and a Reasoned Opinion on 18 October 2005. The Commission issued proceedings on 31 July 2006 under Article 226 of the EC Treaty for failure to transpose this Directive into Irish law.  In that regard, draft Regulations were sent to the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office for settling on 28 September 2006.  It is intended to have the Regulations completed by the end of December 2006.</P>
        <P>The Commission made application to the European Court of Justice on 15th April 2005 against Ireland under Article 226 of the EC Treaty for incorrect transposition of Directive 92/100/EC (Rental and Lending rights in the field of Intellectual Property). The drafting of amending legislation is currently taking place in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  It is proposed to publish the legislation in early 2007.</P>
        <P>Due to the collective efforts of my officials over the past few months in addressing transposition issues, my Department has successfully transposed 18 Directives (and partially transposed one Directive) since January of this year.  In addition to Directive 2001/86/EC, it is intended that Directives 2003/58/EC, 2003/72/EC and 2004/22/EC will be transposed during the current D&aacute;il session. It is my intention to continue to make transposition of EU Directives an ongoing priority in my Department.</P>

	<P>At this stage it is difficult to arrive at any definite conclusions about the current numbers of people with disabilities who are in the labour force.</P>
        <P>The results for the 2006 Census, and the associated national disability survey, will, when published, provide definitive information of the level of progress that is being achieved in increasing the numbers of disabled workers who are now actually engaged in the labour market.</P>
        <P>Data from the 2002 Census showed there were about 43,000 people with disabilities of working age who were in employment, and approximately 130,000 who were unemployed and economically inactive.</P>
        <P>More recent data published by the CSO in two QNHS special disability surveys (which are not <Col N="591"/>directly comparable with the 2002 Census) indicate that between 2002 and 2004 the numbers of people in employment remained broadly the same at about 110, 000, while the numbers who were unemployed and economically inactive rose from 165, 000 to about 190, 000.</P>
        <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is committed to addressing the needs of those with disabilities and furthering the policy of mainstreaming services to help them play a full and active part in Irish society. The Sectoral Plan of the Department under the Disability Act, 2005 outlines its key initiatives in promoting equality of opportunity for disabled people on the open labour market, including through its Comprehensive Employment Strategy for people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>This Strategy proposes to further enhance the effectiveness of employment and vocational training programmes for disabled people and to further develop supports to open labour market employment for them.</P>
        <P>The Sectoral Plan represents a clear step forward in working to improve  access to employment for disabled people, and a comprehensive outline of this Department&rsquo;s commitment in that regard.</P>

        <P>EU nationals can enter employment in the State without requiring advance permission.  The only requirement for entry into the labour market is the need to arrange a personal public service or PPS number for social insurance purposes.

      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63, 172 and 173 together.</P>
        <P>While there has been some deterioration in export performance recently, most notably in April and June of this year, the pattern has been that exports have tended to rebound in subsequent months, and have remained competitive in a difficult global trading environment.  Looking at the situation over the longer term, it can be seen that the value of our exports has increased by 3% for the first six months of 2006, relative to the same period in 2005.  A comparison of 2005 export figures with those for 2004 shows that exports increased by 5% in value terms year on year, and that positive situation was also evident in 2004 where exports increased by 3% in value terms relative to 2003.</P>
        <P>It is clear, however, that Irish companies, especially companies in more traditional sectors, face continuing challenges to remain competitive in international markets. Input prices continue to pose particular competitive difficulties especially given high energy prices. To this end the recent declines in oil prices from the heights reached in <Col N="593"/>July 2006 are welcome.  Lower costs prevalent in the newly acceded member states, increased costs domestically, the continued growth of Asian economies, and the relative strength of the Euro relative to other global currencies are just some of the conditions that Irish companies have had to face. These conditions are likely to continue to pose a challenge to Irish exporters.</P>
        <P>Irish companies are working very hard to maintain and win new market share despite these difficulties. Enterprise Ireland, as the agency with responsibility for the development of manufacturing and internationally traded services companies, is acutely aware of the significant challenges and indeed opportunities that have emerged as a result of globalisation and increased global competition, and works with client companies to help them grow and develop on world markets.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland recognises that its client companies operate in a very different environment from that of even a decade ago. They are no longer confined to selling into English speaking markets or markets largely chosen on the basis of geographic proximity and convenience. Irish companies now operate in a broad range of culturally diverse markets. Building and maintaining strong growth in an ever more competitive and interconnected world requires creativity and imagination. Creative ideas, new and better ways of working, innovative products and services, and improved ways of marketing and delivering goods globally will be the drivers of future success.  In short, these factors will ensure high-value, knowledge intensive activities that will support high-value added jobs and prosperity.  To underpin their potential, Irish companies&rsquo; must display a unique mix of ingenuity, ambition and business strengths.</P>
        <P>In tandem with this, Irish Government policy has been, for a number of years, to fully exploit our membership of the European Union by diversifying into EU export markets, and also to focus on new opportunities in the US and further afield.   From a position of 75% of Irish exports going to the UK in 1960, we have now reached a point where the EU now accounts for 62% of our exports with only 18% of exports going to the UK.  Since last year, the US has replaced the UK as our leading export market and now accounts for 20% of Irish exports.  Of equal importance is the continuous transformation of both indigenous and foreign direct investment enterprises from low end manufacturing to the production of<?oasys _jy ?>high value added goods and services such as <?oasys _dc28- ?>software, telecommunications and pharmaceuticals<?oasys _dc0- ?> resulting in new export opportunities to highly developed economies in the EU, the US and Japan.</P>
        <P>Other export destinations, which offer new opportunities in the future, are the ten newly acceded members of the EU, and Asia.  In addition, both myself, and my colleague, Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Miche&aacute;l <Col N="594"/>Martin, T.D., have been active in leading trade missions, in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland, to the new member states and Asia, with a view to increasing our share of exports by Irish companies to these countries.</P>
        <P>Last year, the Taoiseach launched the second phase of the Asia Strategy which is designed to increase Irish exports to the main economies of Asia, such as China, Japan and India, over the next five years.  Within the context of the Asia Strategy, it is envisaged that agencies, such as Enterprise Ireland, An Bord Bia, Tourism Ireland and organisations engaged in the education sector, will be combining closely to exploit and increase Irish exporting opportunities in this area over the lifetime of the Asia Strategy, which is scheduled to run until 2009.</P>

	<P>The new Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2006 will come into effect on Monday 6th November 2006.  The Health &amp; Safety Authority has committed to carrying out over 7,000 inspections in the construction sector this year.  On Monday last, 9th October, the Authority commenced a series of seminars and workshops aimed at getting the industry up-to-speed with the Regulations before the commencement date. These activities form part of the Authority&rsquo;s programme of work for 2006 and are catered for in its overall grant.  Enforcement and advocacy are core functions of the Authority.</P>
        <P>The proposals for the new Regulations came from the Construction Advisory Committee which operates under the auspices of the Authority and which includes representatives of the employee unions and employer organisations. The unions and employers are also represented on the Board of the Authority which considered the Regulations at length and approved them.</P>
        <P>As part of the wider consultation process the Authority made a draft of the Regulations available on its website for 6 weeks, beginning in October 2005. An extensive range of responses were received and reviewed by both the Executive and the Board of the Authority. The Authority&rsquo;s staff and officials at the Department also met representatives of professional bodies in the construction sector and consulted widely with them on the proposals for the Regulations.  I met with any who sought meetings.</P>

	<P>The Internal Market Section is part of the Market Access Unit of my Department. Its staff complement is an Assistant Principal Officer, a Higher Executive Officer, an Executive Officer and a Clerical Officer. The cost of the Section is met from within the administrative budget of the Department.</P><Col N="596"/>
        <P>The role of the Section is to co-ordinate and negotiate Ireland&rsquo;s approach to certain aspects of the EU&rsquo;s Internal Market, with particular reference to the importance of the acquis communitaire being applied correctly, transparently and in a timely fashion.</P>
        <P>During the first half of the year, the Section was heavily engaged in the ongoing discussions on the draft Services Directive. This involved discussions with other Departments and with stakeholders, including the social partners, as well as discussions at EU level within the framework of the Council. The Competitiveness Council reached political agreement on the draft Directive on 29th May and adopted a Common Position on it on 24th July, largely on the basis of the revised Commission proposal of 4th April. The second reading of the draft Directive is now underway in the European Parliament. There will be further consultations with Departments and stakeholders, as necessary.</P>
        <P>The Irish SOLVIT Centre is based in the Internal Market Section. SOLVIT is a network launched by the European Commission in 2002 to solve problems that EU citizens or businesses are experiencing with the public administrations of EU Member States. (There is a SOLVIT Centre in each EU and EEA Member State.) These problems are associated with a denial of their Internal Market rights due to EU measures not being applied correctly.</P>
        <P>So far this year, the SOLVIT Centre has dealt with over 80 cases and queries from citizens (including citizens of other Member States and third country nationals with ties to EU nationals) and businesses, involving social welfare issues, insurance issues, pension rights, taxation issues, issues relating to motor vehicles, professionals wishing to register in this or another Member State, the rules applying to products sold on the market of another Member State and the right of third country nationals with ties to EU nationals to live here.</P>
        <P>The Centre attended the Spring SOLVIT Workshop in Brussels and the Summer SOLVIT Workshop in Oslo, and will host the Winter SOLVIT 2006 Workshop in Dublin in November.</P>
        <P>The Section co-ordinates Ireland&rsquo;s input to the European Commission&rsquo;s Internal Market Information (IMI) System. This is a new Commission initiative designed to create real time links between internal market officials in Member States to enable them to exchange the necessary information to ensure that EU Directives with co-operation/mutual assistance provisions are properly implemented.</P>
        <P>The Section prepared Ireland&rsquo;s submission to the European Commission in response to the Commission&rsquo;s public consultation in April on the future of the Single Market. (The submission is available on the Commission&rsquo;s website at <i>http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/strategy/ index_en.htm</i>.) The Commission is undertaking <Col N="597"/>a general review of the Single Market for submission to the June 2007 meeting of the European Council. Internal Market Section will continue to co-ordinate Ireland&rsquo;s position on this issue in consultation with other Departments and stakeholders, as appropriate.</P>
        <P>The Section is one of a number of Sections in this Department and others that monitors Ireland&rsquo;s rate of transposition of Internal Market Directives with particular reference to the Internal Market Scoreboard, which is published each summer.</P>
        <P>The Section is the National Contact Point for Ireland for the European Commission&rsquo;s Technical Assistance and Information Exchange (TAIEX) Office. TAIEX provides assistance to new Member States and Candidate States on issues relating to the transposition and application of the acquis communitaire.</P>
        <P>The Section is the National Contact Point for Ireland for Regulation 2679/98 on the functioning of the internal market in relation to the free movement of goods among the Member States. Under the Regulation, where an obstacle occurs (for example, an industrial dispute affecting the free movement of goods along a major road network or through a port or airport), the relevant Member State must inform the Commission and all other Member States and must respond as soon as possible to a request from the Commission or from another Member State as to what action it proposes to take to deal with the obstacle.</P>

        <P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland.  Under the Industrial <Col N="598"/>Development Acts I am precluded from giving directives to the Agency regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.</P>
        <P>Last year 32% of Greenfield FDI projects approved were for the BMW region and the attached tabular statement sets out the percentage of greenfield FDI projects which have been approved for the BMW Region in each of the five years from 2001 to 2005.</P>
        <P>One of the key objectives of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy under the current National Development Programme 2000-2006, has been to encourage more balanced regional development.  To support and enhance the promotion of the BMW region, the Agency has substantially increased its land portfolio in the region and upgraded the scale, resources and management responsibility of its regional offices.</P>
        <P>The Agency also believes its policy of working closely with a wide range of other organisations at local and regional levels such as Local Authorities, utility providers, educational institutes, and private developers to enhance the attractiveness of individual areas for new greenfield investments or expansion projects will continue to deliver results in terms of additional sustainable investment and jobs for the people of the BMW region.</P>
        <P>Ultimately decisions regarding where to locate are taken by the investors and IDA Ireland can only advise and market the attractions of potential sites.</P>

That agency has arranged a meeting with the company for today, 11 October 2006 and the full range of FAS services are being offered at the meeting.</P><Col N="599"/>
        <P>On 3 October 2006, my colleague the Minister for Agriculture and Food, accompanied by Enterprise Ireland, met with a group representing the producers that supply live chickens to the company and I understand that various scenarios in regard to the operation were discussed.  Shannon Development also met with this group on 9 October 2006.  I will be meeting with Castlemahon representatives this evening.</P>
        <P>Shannon Development has moved quickly to assist with efforts to minimise the effect of the closure on West Limerick.  The agency will continue to identify opportunities to assist those effected and has held a meeting of the West Limerick Action Group, a local Group chaired by Shannon Development comprising key local groups in the area.  Shannon Development, together with representatives from County Limerick CEB and West Limerick Resources Ltd., has met with public representatives in the area to discuss how the agency can support those effected by the closure.  As well as these particular initiatives, the agency will be staying in close contact with the Newcastle West Chamber of Commerce.</P>
        <P>A central goal for the Industrial Development agencies is the achievement of balanced regional development.  The attractiveness of Limerick lies in its position as a regional gateway, with a critical mass and infrastructure necessary to attract mobile investment to the region.  Both the Government and the agencies recognise the need to provide high volume employment opportunities in Limerick that provide sustainable jobs.  The most recent example in Limerick was the announcement by Northern Trust Corporation to create 300 high quality jobs in the financial services sector.  Another example is Vistakon, which recently announced its intentions to expand its Limerick operations and create some 120 jobs in high-end manufacturing.</P>
        <P>Both the Government and the agencies recognise the need to provide high volume employment opportunities in Limerick that provide sustainable jobs.  I am confident that the State Development agencies, in partnership with other key players, will strengthen their marketing and promotion efforts in the region and will make every effort to secure alternative employment for the area.</P>

	<P>I can confirm that I received a request for a meeting with representatives of the European Parliament&rsquo;s Temporary Committee of Enquiry into the Crisis of the Equitable Life Assurance Company for their visit here of 6th October 2006.  A response to this request issued through the Irish Permanent Representative to the European Union on the 19th September 2006.</P>
        <P>The response conveyed my regrets that, because of prior commitments, I was unavailable to meet with the delegation on Friday 6th October, and that while I would be happy to provide any assistance which I can to the Committee, I could not see how I could be of any assistance to the Committee&rsquo;s enquiries having regard to the position outlined below.</P>
        <P>The response advised that on foot of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2003, prudential supervision of the insurance sector and the services provided moved in its totality from the Department and Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment to the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, now known as the Financial Regulator.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the response to the Committee noted that the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2003 which was commenced in May 2003 provided inter alia for a &ldquo;live&rdquo; handover of issues and for the speedy handover by the Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment, to the Financial Regulator and the Minister for Finance of all records relating to the performance or exercise of functions or powers in the insurance sector.  This would have included all those relating to Equitable Life.</P>
        <P>The Committee was advised that the most appropriate body to assist the Committee with its enquiries is now the Financial Regulator.  I understand that on foot of this advice, the Committee contacted the Financial Regulator and met with officials from that body on Friday 6th October last.</P>

	<P>On 26 April 2006, the Labour Court made a recommendation regarding redundancy terms for Irish Sugar workers at the Mallow plant.  The recommendation provided that redundancy should be 5 weeks&rsquo; pay per year of service, <Col N="601"/>where a week&rsquo;s pay would be defined as actual finishing salary, excluding overtime, plus statutory redundancy entitlement, plus a bonus payment for an orderly wind-down.  However, I understand that the company and the trade unions could not agree on the method of calculating finishing salary. The Court issued two clarifications, but these failed to resolve the dispute.</P>
        <P>The National Implementation Body has worked with the parties concerned on an agreed procedure to resolve the issue in dispute.</P>
        <P>The Labour Court has invited the parties to return to the Court with a view to resolving the dispute. However, I understand that the company has rejected the Court&rsquo;s invitation. I very much regret the decision taken by the company in this regard.</P>
        <P>While responsibility for the settlement of a dispute rests, ultimately, with the parties themselves, I would urge the company to reconsider its decision not to attend the Labour Court for talks. The experience and expertise of the Labour Court, in my view, offer the best avenue for resolving the issue under dispute.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The price of energy  affects the cost structure of all sectors of the economy, both domestic consumers and businesses alike.  Global energy markets have seen sustained increases in price levels for the past two years.  No consumer, whether industrial, commercial or personal is immune from the impact of higher oil, gas and electricity prices as a result of price changes on international markets.  With 80% of our natural gas requirements currently being imported, we are all price takers in the market. However, the Irish economy has proved resilient with growth of 4.7% in GDP in 2005 with continued expansion of many sectors including those that are energy intensive (for example, pharmaceuticals, food and drink, construction and so forth). Despite elevated energy prices over the past couple of years there is no indication that high prices are having a marked impact on economic growth or employment. </P>
        <P>Energy costs are predominantly a global issue, as they are driven primarily by oil prices.  The development agencies under my Department are monitoring the issue of energy costs and the impact of such costs on the overall competitiveness of companies.</P><Col N="602"/>
        <P>My colleague the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, who has primary responsibility in this area, has just published an Energy Green Paper which addresses key policy options for energy management.  A two month consultation period is underway.  Following this period a range of issues affecting energy and oil dependency will be set out in a White Paper.</P>
        <P>The Oireachtas is currently examining the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which will bring about an all island energy market.  This will have a positive influence on energy costs to users.  In addition, Sustainable Energy Ireland continues to vigorously promote and advise on energy efficiency through a range of programmes over the last number of years and is eager to provide its energy conservation and efficiency services to the SME sector.</P>

	<P>The mechanisms for implementation of the new social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, are broadly the same as applied under Sustaining Progress.  The steering group representing Government and each of the social partner pillars will be reconvened to take overall responsibility for the management of the implementation of the ten-year framework agreement as it applies to the wider non-pay issues.  As heretofore, there will be quarterly meetings of the social partner pillars and an annual meeting of the parties with the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Finance.  It has also been agreed that a formal review will be undertaken during 2008. </P>
        <P>The question of the procedures to be followed in relation to pay negotiations for the period after the current agreement expires has not yet been considered.</P>
        <P>Work has already begun in this Department in relation to the wide range of commitments that <Col N="604"/>fall within the Department&rsquo;s remit. In particular, work on the preparation of the necessary legislation to give effect to the comprehensive package of measures contained in the agreement on employment standards is being progressed as a matter of urgency.  In addition, the process of recruiting the Director of the Office of the Director of Employment Rights Compliance, to be established under the aegis of my Department, got under way in recent days.</P>
        <P>Substantial additional resources, both financial and human, will be made available to the Department for the delivery of the commitments under Towards 2016.

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>State support for enterprise and job creation is channelled through IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the County Development Boards.  While I may give general policy directives to the agencies under the Industrial Development Acts, I am precluded from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland have assured me they are actively promoting both Ballina and the North Mayo area generally for new foreign investment.  Since January 2003 there have been five first time site visits to Ballina.  In addition, the Agency is also working with its existing base of overseas companies to encourage them to grow and expand.  In order to further enhance the attractiveness of the county for new investment the Agency is developing new world class Business and Technology Parks in a number of towns throughout Mayo.</P>
        <P>The overall aim of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy is to transform Irish companies into market focused and innovation driven businesses; to increase their exports, sales and employment.  The Agency has approved funding support of over &euro;6.4 million and paid around &euro;3.6 million to companies in County Mayo in the period from 2003 to date.  Of this, client companies in the North Mayo area have been approved funding of over &euro;1.2m.  Enterprise Ireland has worked in close co-operation with Mayo County Council in the development of the Broadband Metropolitan <Col N="605"/>Area Networks in Ballina and Kiltimagh.  Both of these are now completed.  The construction of new MANs, are proposed for the towns of Claremorris, Knock and Ballinrobe.</P>
        <P>In January this year I announced the extension of the Enterprise Ireland Community Enterprise Centre Scheme which will provide &euro;7m of Capital funding for the period 2006-2008. Working in partnership with the local community, Enterprise Ireland has approved support for a total of 10 Community Enterprise Centres in County Mayo &mdash; including Kiltimagh, which was successful in obtaining approval for &euro;300,000 for an expansion to its existing centre.</P>
        <P>During 2005 Mayo County Enterprise Board (CEB) approved a total of &euro;437,965 to 23 projects and paid out &euro;301,239 in grant assistance, which resulted in the creation of 53 net new jobs in CEB assisted companies throughout the County.  Five of the 23 projects which received grant approval in 2005 were in the Ballina area and accounted for &euro;82,400 or 19% of the total grant approvals in Mayo in 2005 and, to-date, a total of &euro;28,579 has been paid out by Mayo CEB.</P>
        <P>Mayo County Enterprise Boards 2006 Programme budget is, at over &euro;900,000, 12.9% higher than allocation provided for in 2005.  This increase is enabling Mayo CEB to fulfil its function and remit in encouraging entrepreneurial development in the micro-enterprise sector throughout the County.</P>
        <P>The most recent Quarterly National Household Survey published by the Central Statistics Office in September shows that the national unemployment rate is 4.3%.  The equivalent rate for the West region, which includes Ballina, is slightly lower at 4.2%.  The Survey does not provide a breakdown of data for specific towns.</P>
        <P>While the Live Register figures published by the CSO provide data for specific areas such as Ballina, it is important to note that it is designed to produce data on numbers claiming unemployment assistance and benefit and also includes part-time, seasonal and casual workers who would be entitled to such State supports.  In August 2005 there were 1,605 people on the live register in Ballina.  The most recent data available is for August 2006 and indicates that this number had fallen to 1,448.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the policies being pursued by the agencies under the remit of my Department, together with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to regional development, will continue to bear fruit in terms of the creation of sustainable employment for the people of Ballina and Mayo generally.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Social Partnership Agreement &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo; sets out a number of commitments with regard to employment standards and compliance including a commitment to establish an Office of the Director of Employment Rights Compliance (ODERC).  The Office, which will assume the functions of the Labour Inspectorate and Employment Rights Information and Prosecution units of the Department, will be established through the enactment of primary legislation and will be led by a Director at senior management level. </P>
        <P>The legislation establishing the ODERC, which will be published in 2007, will provide, among other matters, that certain existing primary and secondary employment rights legislation administered or enforced by the Department will, from a specified date and subject to such amendments as may be necessary to implement commitments under Towards 2016, be enforced by the ODERC.</P>
        <P>That legislation will also introduce a number of new requirements of relevance to the ODERC.  Existing arrangements in relation to the investigation by Labour Inspectors or authorised persons of particular employments in relation to employment rights and compliance will be strengthened.  Provision will be made for investigations at the request of the Minister or on the ODERC&rsquo;s own initiative and for direct engagement by ODERC with the employer with a view to effecting timely resolution of cases. It is also proposed to provide for the publication of the outcome of investigations where this is in the public interest.</P>
        <P>The revised arrangements will also provide that, in certain cases, the ODERC may take cases to the Courts with a view to securing convictions by way of prosecutions for summary or indictable offences, notwithstanding any redress actions that may be taken.  Where the employer fails to make good the amounts of money which are owed to the employee under employment rights legislation redress will be obtained via the Rights Commissioner Service.</P>
        <P>Provision will also be made for improved record keeping in order to protect workers&rsquo; employment rights and to ensure consistency between statutory employment records and record keeping requirements for employers in relation to, for example, taxation and social welfare.  Employers will have clear responsibilities in relation to the maintenance and production of up-to-date statutory records. Failure to do so will be a criminal offence subject to summary or indictable proceedings.  Where redress proceedings in relation to non payment of statutory <Col N="607"/>entitlements are being taken to the Rights Commissioners, Employment Appeals Tribunal, Labour Court or Court of Law, the onus of producing evidence of payments made or deductions from pay and hours worked will rest with the employer.</P>
        <P>Statutory protection will be provided to an employee who, in good faith, has made a complaint to an appropriate authority, including to ODERC, against his or her employer under any employment rights provision and who is subsequently dismissed or otherwise penalised arising from the complaint.</P>
        <P>In addition, the existing monitoring and inspection activity in relation to compliance in the electrical contracting sector will be strengthened by amending legislation to support new organisational arrangements while the ODERC will be empowered to join with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners to work together in the Joint Investigation Units.</P>
        <P>Finally, the successful implementation of the new system of employment rights compliance sets challenging targets for us all; the Government, employers, employees and the Social Partners alike.

	<P>My Department has been making good progress in the relocation of the required 250 posts to Carlow under the Government&rsquo;s Decentralisation Programme.  </P>
        <P>The number of posts in Business Units decentralising to Carlow, as at 10th October, is 280.  Having regard to the agreed staffing transfer protocols governing decentralisation, my Department has approached all General Service staff who expressed a first preference before 7th September 2004, that is, &ldquo;Priority Applications&rdquo; for relocation to Carlow through the Central Application Facility.</P>
        <P>Officials in my Department have analysed the &ldquo;Two to Ten&rdquo; priority applicants &mdash;  those who before the 7th September 2004 deadline iden<Col N="608"/>tified Carlow as their 2nd or subsequent choice.  In addition, given that there still remains a deficit in some grades, my Department has assessed the post September 2004 CAF applicants, in line with Department of Finance policy.</P>
        <P>My Department currently has 104 Carlow-bound applicants assigned within the Department, with a further 78 Carlow-bound applicants yet to be assigned to the Department.  None of the required 250 staff have been decentralised to date.  It is hoped to have all decentralising posts filled in sufficient time to ensure that staff are adequately trained in advance of the move to Carlow.</P>
        <P>With regard to the property side of the Department&rsquo;s move, the Office of Public Works completed the purchase of a site in Carlow town centre late last year.  On 31st May 2006, the OPW commenced the tendering process by seeking expressions of interest from developers in relation to the design, build, finance and maintenance of new office accommodation and car parking for the Department in Carlow.</P>
        <P>On completion of this stage, a short-list of developers will be drawn up from whom tenders will be invited.  Following the tender evaluation process the preferred tenderer will be requested to seek suitable planning permission.  On obtaining this, the OPW will formally award the contract and construction will commence.</P>
        <P>The OPW expect construction to begin late in 2007 and the construction phase may take up to 24 months.</P>
        <P>In order to accommodate staff who wish to move earlier than the projected building completion date, officials of my Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance and the OPW, as well as decentralising staff and Business Units, are progressing an earlier move to Carlow, subject to securing high quality temporary accommodation.  I expect this option to allow for the movement of approximately 80 decentralising staff to Carlow during the second quarter of 2007, on a voluntary basis.</P>

	<P>Ireland opposed the proposal by the European Commission for a Council Regulation <Col N="609"/>imposing definitive anti-dumping duties on footwear from China and Vietnam.  Ireland was of the view that the imposition of measures was not in the Community interest.  In particular Ireland expressed concerns that the action proposed would result in price increases in footwear, particularly in children&rsquo;s shoes.  The European Commission and other Member States were fully aware at all stages of consideration of the proposed imposition of anti-dumping duties that the proposed measures were unacceptable to Ireland. </P>
        <P>In accordance with the European Union&rsquo;s basic anti-dumping regulations and rules, a proposal of this nature which is submitted to Council is adopted unless a simple majority reject it.  At the Council of Ministers on 5th October, Ireland voted against the proposal.  In the event, the proposal was adopted by Council in the absence of a simple majority of Member States opposed to the measures proposed by the European Commission.</P>

	<P>Four of the Agencies under the aegis of my Department are due to decentralise as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">F&Aacute;S is to move 383 posts to Birr, Co. Offaly; Enterprise Ireland is to move 292 posts to Shannon; The Health and Safety Authority is to move 110 posts to Thomastown, Co. Kilkenny, and The National Standards Authority of Ireland is to move 132 posts to Arklow, Co. Wicklow.</P>
        <P FLI="0">My Department continues to provide advice and support to each of the four Agencies in progressing their decentralisation programmes and there is a dedicated Agency Decentralisation Committee to drive the process forward.  In addition, I am satisfied that each Agency is fully engaged in the process and taking all of the relevant steps to advance their decentralisation plans.</P>
        <P>In outlining the current Agency position on decentralisation, it must be remembered that <Col N="610"/>CAF data is based on &ldquo;priority first preference&rdquo; applications.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>F&Aacute;S.</i></P>
        <P>Under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme, F&Aacute;S is due to transfer its head office including some 383 posts to Birr, County Offaly.   To date, two of these posts have decentralised.  To date, a total of 102 FAS staff have expressed an interest in relocating to Birr, broken down as follows:</P>
       <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />26 FAS staff have volunteered to move (outside of CAF)</P>

     <P LI="1" FLI="0"><Miles com="bull66" />36 Promoted staff have signed contracts with the relocation clause, however following industrial action these cases will be examined by the parties in due course.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I understand that the number of applications received from within the civil and public service, amounts to 67, thus giving an overall total of 169 persons.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Enterprise Ireland.</i></P>
        <P>The Government has decided that the Headquarters of Enterprise Ireland, including some 292 posts, will relocate to Shannon as part of the Decentralisation programme.  To date none of these posts have relocated to Shannon.</P>
        <P>The Central Applications Facility indicates that 19 Enterprise Ireland staff have applied for decentralisation to Enterprise Ireland in Shannon.  Of these, 15 are based in Dublin and 4 are based outside Dublin. I understand that the number of applications received from within the civil and public service, including my Department, amounts to 33, thus giving a total overall of 52 persons.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Health and Safety Authority.</i></P>
        <P>The Health and Safety Authority is to move 110 posts to Thomastown, Co. Kilkenny.  To date a total of 62 people (11 HSA staff, 41 Civil Servants, 10 Public Servants) have expressed an interest in transferring to Thomastown.  The Authority has been advised by OPW that as the site procurement is in the final stages, the current timeline for availability for occupancy is late 2008.</P>
        <P>In advance of decentralising to Thomastown, in August 2006 the Authority established an interim office in Kilkenny city.  Twelve staff, including staff recruited for the REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals) strategy, have recently relocated to that office in advance of moving to Thomastown.  In addition, future staff, who will be recruited for the REACH strategy, will also be based in <Col N="611"/>Thomastown.  All staff that move in the interim to the Kilkenny office will transfer to Thomastown when the premises there are completed.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>NSAI.</i></P>
        <P>The National Standards Authority of Ireland, with a total of 132 staff, is to be relocated to Arklow.  To date none of these posts have relocated to Arklow.  The latest available CAF figures show a total of 107 first preference priority applications for Arklow from the wider public sector subject to the decentralisation programme.  The number of staff in NSAI who have, to date, applied for decentralisation is 11. The number required to be decentralised is 132.</P>

	<P>The World Bank research entitled, &lsquo;Doing Business, Benchmarking Business Regulations&rsquo; is one of several benchmarking  reports by international organisations.  The WEF, IMD, and the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor also benchmark our performance in many of these areas.  These are  useful tools for identifying broad trends nationally and internationally.  I note the World Bank ranks Ireland tenth among 175 economies in terms of ease of doing business.  In addition, the World Economic Forum data ranks us 4th in the OECD in terms of business regulation, a position we have sustained for several years.</P>
        <P>The National Competitiveness Council&rsquo;s Annual Report, published on 10 October, shows that the level of business regulation is perceived as low in Ireland.  Also, in terms of starting a business, there are a relatively low number of procedural requirements in Ireland.  The NCC Report also notes that Irish labour market regulations are not perceived to have a significant impact on business activity.</P>
        <P>The specific World Bank report index referred to by the Deputy appears to  perceive the protection of employees such as statutory redundancy entitlements and unfair dismissals legislation as a <Col N="612"/>&lsquo;negative&rsquo;.  However, in a broader view, such as that articulated by the National Economic and Social Council, social policy and economic prosperity are seen as complementary rather than mutually exclusive in a successful economy.</P>
        <P>In terms of influence on investment, the figures speak for themselves. The NCC Report published yesterday records that Ireland continues to attract a large number of greenfield investments from abroad. When adjusted for population the number of greenfield projects is considerably higher in Ireland than the OECD average.  Ireland ranks second only to Singapore in the benchmarked countries.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware that the Irish merchandise exports decreased by 12% in value terms in April of this year, relative to March.  The decrease was mainly due to a fall in exports of goods, for example, chemicals, medical and pharmaceuticals, manufactured goods and computers, to some of our main trading partners such as Great Britain, Belgium, France, Germany, the US and Japan. </P>
        <P>While any decrease in trade figures is disappointing., it is important to bear in mind, however, that a month on month comparison of figures does not provide a sufficient basis for analysis with regard to establishing a particular trend.  Because of the cyclical nature of exporting, and also the dominance of multinational companies in the Irish exporting sector, who often vary their exporting patterns for strategic reasons, one cannot attribute too much significance to a month on month comparison of figures.  In fact, figures released by the CSO for May 2006, show that subsequently exports increased by 17% relative to April 2006, but fell back again in June only to recover again in July, increasing by 5%.</P>
        <P>A more reliable indicator of Ireland&rsquo;s trading position is to look at a longer period of perhaps six months, or a year on year comparison.  In that context, figures published by the CSO, in September, for the first six months of the year, showed an increase of 3% relative to the same period in 2005. Full year comparisons between 2005 and 2004, show that the value of exports increased by over 5%.  This follows an increase of 3% overall for exports in 2004 when compared with 2003.  I am confident that when the end of year figures are available for 2006, the figures will <Col N="613"/>attest to the fact that Irish exports are continuing to increase year on year, and that Irish exporters are performing well in a difficult global trading environment.</P>

        <Quest> his views on the statement by a person (details supplied) who has said a slowdown in the US economy could result in up to 90,000 job losses by 2010 here; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Over the past four years, the labour force has grown by 267,400 and employment by 253,100.  The latest ESRI quarterly economic commentary has forecast that employment is to grow by a further 71,000 in 2007.  It is of interest to note that the worst-case scenario by the ESRI of 90,000 Irish job losses over the next 4 years is a similar figure to the 87,800 jobs our economy has created just in the past 12 months.  </P>
        <P>As a small open economy Ireland is vulnerable to any downturn in the global economy.  While economic developments in the United States will always impact on our economy, it is difficult to predict the precise effect with any degree of accuracy.  Competitiveness remains a key objective and although the Irish economy is noted for its openness, it is also remarkably robust.  When the so-called &lsquo;dot com bubble&rsquo; burst in the early years of this decade, Ireland was well placed to maintain one of the highest growth rates in Europe and one of the most impressive rates of employment growth in the OECD.  In those years (2001-2003), our GNP growth still ranged between 2.8% and 5.5% per annum and unemployment annual average stayed below 5%.</P>
        <P>Ireland has become a more open and outward looking country that is capable of leveraging trade globalisation for its own purposes.  A key objective of enterprise policy is to encourage the establishment and growth of new companies in high-tech sectors such as biotechnology, nanotechnology, photonics, digital media and functional foods.  Associated with this has been the emergence of some dynamic indigenous companies, principally in the high tech sectors that are competing in global markets.  In addition, strenuous efforts are being made to get foreign owned companies more embedded in the Irish economy, with as many functions as is practicable being carried out here, giving a more permanent base to these enterprises.</P>
        <P>There is now a greater balance in our trading pattern.  The destination of exports has been dramatically transformed, with the European Union now accounting for over 60% of the total and the USA accounting for about 20%.  Efforts to explore new markets are ongoing with new <Col N="614"/>opportunities for Irish companies materialising in distant markets.</P>
        <P>The educational and training levels attained within the labour force has resulted in the availability of an adaptable and flexible workforce.  This is essential for both employees and companies in order to meet the skills changes required in market conditions that are constantly changing.  Continuing and increased investment in human capital is part of current policy to assist in maintaining and improving our economic success.</P>

Significant progress was made in 2005 by Enterprise Ireland against these targets, as reported in its 2005 Annual Report.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland continues to implement the strategy set out in &lsquo;Transforming Irish Industry 2005-2007&rsquo; and will report on progress against specific targets in the 2006 Annual Report.  In terms of 2006 activities, Enterprise Ireland has approved &euro;112.5 million to client companies. This funding has been for specific company and enterprise development projects including investment in commercialisation of research, applied and collaborative R&amp;D, productivity improvement projects, training and management development and export development.</P>
        <P>In 2006 to date, Enterprise Ireland has been involved in a number of high profile activities. These include the launch of a new &euro;175 million round of Seed and Venture Capital funds; the approval of &euro;7 million for 24 Community Enterprise Centres, and the provision of an Enterprise Ireland fund of &euro;30 million to strengthen university technology transfer offices. Also, 94 companies have been approved funding under Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Productivity Improvement Fund launched in May, 2005.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland is implementing a number of recommendations arising out of the Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) report &lsquo;Ahead of the Curve&rsquo;, and the subsequent Government Action Plan.  The actions include the implementation of a &euro;2.5 million Industry Led Networks pilot. The first call for proposals took place on March 3rd <Col N="617"/>2006 and resulted in the approval of facilitation funding for 17 Networks to assist in the development of a collaborative project. Full project funding for two networks was also approved, one of which is a North-South collaboration. The second call closed on July 28th and applications are currently being assessed.</P>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>Another outcome from the implementation of the ESG recommendations, through the Government Action Plan, is Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s International Selling Programme, which commenced on 10th February, 2006. This innovative programme is designed to assist exporting companies to develop international sales strategies.  Some 32 participants, representing 30 companies from across all sectors, are enrolled on this course.</P>
        <P>This year Enterprise Ireland was also involved in the design of a fund for the Dairy Sector which was announced by my colleague Ms Mary Coughlan T.D. Minister for Agriculture and Food. Enterprise Ireland will administer the Fund which is designed to improve efficiency in the sector, and to act as a catalyst for the development of the dairy industry in Ireland. The investment will include some &euro;100 million of Government grant assistance.</P>
        <P>A number of trade missions were also organised and managed by Enterprise Ireland in 2006, ensuring that Irish companies continue to seek out and secure new export sales in existing and emerging markets throughout the world. To date, trade events have included trade missions to South Africa, Australia, India, China, Japan and the Ukraine.</P>

	<P>The dedicated budget for F&Aacute;S programmes for people with disabilities during 2005 totalled &euro;62.317 million.  The actual expenditure of this budget amounted to &euro;56.737 million, representing an underspend of &euro;5.58 million.  The principal underspend occurred in the budget for the Wage Subsidy Scheme, due to its later than expected introduction in 2005.  The Wage Subsidy Scheme is being actively promoted by F&Aacute;S and its impact will be reviewed in the near future by the Department of Enterprise Trade &amp; Employment.</P><Col N="618"/>

        <P FLI="0">Considerable efforts have been made to increase public awareness through the IBEC/ICTU Workway Programme, co-sponsorship of the Ability Awards, the Three Sixty TV series, the F&Aacute;S Ability in the Workplace campaign, and related activities.  Efforts are being reinforced to further improve the take up of funding that has been dedicated to improving the position of those with disabilities in the labour market.  These include the provision of bridging programmes to facilitate progress between rehabilitative and open training programmes; the progressive removal of remaining financial and benefit disincentives and the evaluation and assessment of the relevance and impacts of existing training and progression systems.</P>
        <P>Between 2002 and 2005, F&Aacute;S has realised over 29,000 placements of people with disabilities in open labour market employment, training and employment programmes. Since 2002 the F&Aacute;S budget for vocational training and employment for people with disabilities has increased from &euro;54 million to a total of almost &euro;75 million in 2006, &euro;67 million of which relates to vocational training and employment services.</P>
        <P>The Sectoral Plan recently published by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in the context of the Disability Act, 2005 will set the agenda for future work.  The Plan provides for a Comprehensive Employment Strategy for people with disabilities.  The Sectoral Plan represents a clear step forward in working to improve  access to employment for people with disabilities, and a comprehensive outline of this Department&rsquo;s commitment in that regard.</P>

	<P>The proposal for a Council Framework Decision on combating racism and xenophobia was presented by the Commission in November 2001. From the outset, Ireland took a positive approach to the negotiations on the proposal. The primary Irish objective in the negotiations was to ensure that our constitutional guarantee of freedom of expression was not compromised.</P>
        <P>Following extensive discussions, in April 2003 the then Presidency conceded that it was unable to obtain final agreement on the proposal. In preparation for the Irish Presidency in 2004, I visited the Capitals of Member States for an exchange of views with Justice and Interior Ministers on many issues relevant to our Presidency, including whether there was any realistic chance that agreement could be reached on this Framework Decision.</P>
        <P>As it was clear to me that positions had not changed, and it was unlikely that they would change in the timeframe of the Irish Presidency, I reluctantly concluded that attempting to initiate further discussions at that stage would divert resources which would be better concentrated on issues where there was a possibility of agreement. A subsequent attempt to obtain agreement on the proposal also failed. I now have reason to believe that discussions on the Framework Decision may recommence in the near future.</P>
        <P>I hope that any forthcoming discussions will be successful with all Member States being in a position to agree a final text. At that time I will seek the approval of the Government and the Houses of the Oireachtas to it.</P>

        <P FLI="0">It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas.  These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, adminis<Col N="631"/>trative functions and other operational policing needs.  Garda management state that such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</P>
        <P>I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target.  This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year.  The first three groups of newly attested Garda&iacute; under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March, June and September of this year and the fourth such group will become fully attested members of the Force later this year.</P>
        <P>Further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested Garda&iacute; will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete.  The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources.</P>

	<P el="0">As the Deputy is aware, Clondalkin is one of 17 areas set to receive a Garda CCTV system under the Garda CCTV Programme. The Garda authorities are currently finalising a detailed Request for Tender (RFT) for the outsourced service provision of 17 Garda CCTV systems in the following towns: Athlone, Ballyfermot, Carlow, Castlebar, Clondalkin, Clonmel, Drogheda, Dungarvan, Ennis, Kilkenny, Kinsale, Mullingar, Portlaoise, Sligo, Tallaght, Tullamore and Waterford.  The locations above are listed in alphabetical order.</P>
        <P>As I have indicated previously, I am anxious to accelerate the implementation of this CCTV programme and reduce as far as possible the workload of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard.

        <P>Garda Management and my Department are currently in consultation with the Department of Finance with a view to proceeding as quickly as possible with the procurement process to contract outsourced service providers for the development, installation and management of these CCTV systems, including Clondalkin.  This is now the subject of a &ldquo;peer review&rdquo; process organised by the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>Following the successful conclusion of this review it is intended to issue the Request for Tender.  I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the proposed CCTV system for Clondalkin will consist of 13 cameras, as follows:</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the person concerned contacted their local Garda Station at 5.00 am approximately on 23 July, 2006 reporting an attempted break-in to a house in their area. At the time the Garda patrol car in the area was busy dealing with a violent incident that required back-up. A patrol car from another Garda District was requested to attend to the matter and arrived at the scene at 5.40 am approximately. A search of the area for any sighting of the person as described did not produce a result.</P>
        <P>The issues raised by the Deputy on behalf of the person concerned have been addressed by the local Policing Forum. In addition, a Garda Sergeant from the Neighbourhood Policing Unit called to the person concerned to explain the situation in detail.</P>

	<P>The Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 offers comprehensive protection to persons having hatred incited against them on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origin, membership of the travelling community or sexual orientation.</P>
        <P>Public incitement to hatred, on any of the above grounds, is a criminal offence under section 2 and section 3 of the 1989 Act in terms of material, written or oral, which is threatening, abusive or insulting. The hatred can be incited through, for example, the publication or distri<Col N="638"/>bution or display of written material or the use of words or behaviour in any place other than inside a private residence where such written material, words or behaviour are threatening, abusive or insulting and are intended or are likely to stir up hatred. It is open to any person to bring an alleged breach of the provisions of the Act to the notice of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>The provisions of other Acts such as the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 and the Criminal Damage Act 1991 can also be used to protect persons and their property against attack, including racist attack.</P>
        <P>In the context of a review of the legislation in my Department, I am monitoring the number of racist incidents, those that end up in the courts, the legislation under which persons are being charged and the outcome of proceedings in the courts.  A thorough appreciation of the above is essential in deciding what, if any, criminal legis<Col N="639"/>lation is required that could offer further protection to persons who are the victims of race crimes.  To assist me in the matter the Steering Group of the National Action Plan Against Racism is also assessing the effectiveness of the current legislation and for that purpose arranged for research to be conducted into racism and the criminal law.  That assessment and research is being undertaken at present.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the fact that most of the case workers in the Office of the Ombudsman dealing with complaints against local authorities and particularly with planning application complaints, have a two day qualification in planning law and do not have a third level qualification in planning; his views on same in view of the nature of the work involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The role of the Office of Ombudsman is to investigate complaints about the administrative actions of Government Departments, the Health Service Executive, local authorities and An Post. In order to discharge these functions the Office seeks to recruit staff with experience of, and expertise in, the various sectors covered by its remit, including the functions administered by the local government sector.</P>
        <P>It is important to distinguish between the qualifications required for the discharge of professional functions in local authorities and the expertise and qualifications required in the Ombudsman&rsquo;s Office to investigate administrative actions and procedures. In this regard I would point out that the staff of the Ombudsman have no role in relation to the making of planning <Col N="648"/>decisions, and that the avenue of appeal from such decisions is to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</P>
        <P>Given the broad range of issues dealt with by local authorities, it would not be possible or practical, and as already indicated it is not necessary, to have all the Ombudsman&rsquo;s Office staff qualified academically in all of the fields of local authority activity. However, training provided for Ombudsman staff dealing with complaints against local authorities includes a training course in planning law run by Trinity College, Dublin. All case workers assigned permanently to the examination/ investigation of local authority complaints have taken this course and are up to speed with the relevant aspects of planning legislation as it relates to planning administration and planning enforcement.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Ombudsman&rsquo;s Office that they seek to ensure that staff have an appropriate mix of the competencies relevant to their work, from good investigation skills to relevant technical knowledge and experience or expertise in the complaint subject matter, and that given the role of the Office in relation to planning matters, they are satisfied that current arrangements with regard to staff training are appropriate.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the fact that many people, particularly older people who have retired, may be unfairly discriminated against in respect of availing of Government pension incentives; if retired people and pensioners can avail of the incentive; if he will allow retired people to avail of the initiative where SSIA has already matured over three months ago; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[32289/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Pensions Incentive Tax Credits scheme was introduced by me to encourage SSIA holders, particularly those on low incomes, to continue the savings habit and to commence or improve their pension arrangements. I have not imposed any new age restrictions in relation to this incentive. There is no bar on retired persons availing of the scheme within normal pension rules.</P>
        <P>However, some publicity has been given recently to the possibility that SSIA holders who are already retired might transfer matured SSIA funds into a savings product, claim the Pensions Incentive Tax Credit and withdraw the topped-up amount immediately.</P>
        <P>This is not the purpose for which the incentive was introduced. Accordingly, I announced in a <Col N="650"/>press release on 29 September last that I will introduce legislation at the earliest appropriate opportunity to ensure that, with effect from 29 September 2006, individuals who avail of the Pensions Incentive Tax Credits only to withdraw the funds immediately or within 1 year will not get the benefit of the incentive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I should also explain that the 3 month limit for re-investment of SSIA funds into an approved pension product is being extended for SSIA accounts maturing in May and June 2006 in order to give potential investors and pension administrators more time to make the necessary arrangements. For SSIAs maturing in May and June, the time period for making the necessary investment and availing of the incentive has been extended to 31 October 2006. SSIA holders whose accounts matured in any month from July 2006 also have time to make the necessary arrangements and avail of the incentive.</P>

        <Quest> if there is an impediment under EU rules of zero rating VAT on domestic utility bills; and the implications for revenue if such an action were to be taken. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The position is that the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. Under the Sixth VAT Directive Member States may retain the zero rates on goods and services, which have been in place since 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to other goods and services. It is therefore not possible to apply a zero VAT rate to the provision of domestic utilities including electricity, gas and telecommunications. Furthermore, under EU law, it is not possible to reduce the VAT rate for a particular category of customer as the rate of VAT that applies to a particular good or service is determined by the nature of the good or service, and not by the category of customer. Consequently, it is not possible to reduce the VAT rates applicable to domestic utilities alone.</P>
        <P>Finally, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the information to be furnished on VAT returns does not require the yield from particular categories of consumer to be identified.</P>

        <Quest> the medical basis for the Irish cervical screening programme&rsquo;s recommendation that smear tests be carried out every five years; her views on whether it is advisable to recommend more frequent smear tests in view of the unusually high rates of cervical cancer here, in line with other countries such as Canada, where a two to three year interval is recommended, or the US, where an annual test is recommended. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish Cervical Screening Programme (ICSP) was established following the Report of the Department of Health Cervical Screening Committee, 1996, with a pilot development in the Mid-West in October 2000.  Under the Programme, cervical screening is currently offered, free of charge, to approximately 74,000 women in the 25 to 60 age group, at five year intervals.</P>
        <P>The optimal screening interval is one that provides the most favourable ratio between degree of disease control and cost of screening.  In 2004 the International Agency for Cancer Research and the World Health Organisation recommended a screening interval of 3 years in younger women (25-45 years).  Thereafter 5 yearly screening is adequate for women who have no history of abnormality.  This is a recommendation of the Expert Report on the ICSP in July 2004 which is informing my Department&rsquo;s planning of the national roll-out by 2008.</P>
        <P>I will shortly establish a National Cancer Screening Service to amalgamate BreastCheck and the ICSP to deliver both programmes nationally.  This will maximise the expertise in both programmes, ensure improved efficiency and develop a single governance model for cancer screening.</P>

	<P>Responsibility for monitoring the security of Ireland&rsquo;s natural gas supply lies with the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER). Under the Gas (Interim) Regulation Act 2002, the CER is required to prepare an annual Gas Capacity Statement, which provides a 7-year rolling forecast of capacity, flows and customer demand on Ireland&rsquo;s natural gas system. The forecast also assesses, for a range of possible scenarios, whether projected supplies of gas from indigenous sources, imports and storage, are sufficient to meet forecast demand. </P>
        <P>One of the main conclusions of the 2006 Gas Capacity Statement, which was published by the CER in July 2006 and covers the period 2006-13, is that the existing Irish gas transmission system is sufficient to cope with reasonable expectations of demand, both on the peak and on the minimum day under most conditions for the period of this Statement.</P>
        <P>The Corrib field, when it is developed, will bring significant volumes of gas into the Irish system, enhancing the security of Irish gas supplies until 2018. Given the uncertainties about oil and gas supplies and security of our energy supply into the future, this project is of vital national importance. Any slippage on delivery of Corrib gas would leave Ireland&rsquo;s economy more vulnerable to fluctuations in international energy prices with the consequential impact, which this would have on continued competitiveness. Delivery of Corrib gas also has the potential to bring significant benefits to North West Mayo and the region as a whole.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), the independent regulator. </P>
        <P>However, it has been clear for some time that the sector has failed to invest at the level necessary to keep pace with the demand for broadband. My Department&rsquo;s regional broadband programme is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high-speed open access broadband networks, in association with the local and regional authorities, in the major towns and cities. These Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs. The networks offer towns opportunities to attract inward investment in advanced technology and knowledge based enterprises.</P>
        <P>Twenty-seven MANs have been completed under the first phase and are currently being managed by ENet, the Management Services Entity, including one in Carlow town. The second phase extends the programme to over 90 towns with a population of 1,500 and above that do not have a satisfactory broadband offering from the private sector, including Tullow and Bagenalstown in Co. Carlow.</P>
        <P>A joint industry/Government fund of &euro;18 million has been established for the Broadband for Schools Programme to resource the provision of high speed broadband connectivity to all primary and post primary schools in the country by end Autumn 2006, at no cost to the schools themselves.  A total of 95% of schools have broadband installed to date; the aim is to complete the outstanding schools in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>However, there are some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity. I am currently examining options to address the delivery of broadband services to these areas and I hope to be in a position to bring proposals to Government shortly.</P>
        <P>There are a number of platforms for delivery of broadband and service providers are now offering broadband by wireless, satellite, fibre or standard telephone cable in all areas of the country. My Department operates a dedicated website, <i>www.broadband.gov.ie </i>where potential broadband customers can ascertain the availability of services in their area. I understand that DSL and Satellite are available in Coppenagh, County Carlow.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As I indicated to the House, most recently on 29 June 2006, the case for ratification of this Convention has been examined by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which has lead responsibility on the issue.</P>
        <P>As previously indicated, the rights of migrant workers and their families are already protected under existing national legislation and under the Irish Constitution, as well as under EU law. In addition, the rights of migrant workers and their families are also addressed by Ireland&rsquo;s commitments under international human rights instruments to which the State is already a party. These international instruments include, for example, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.</P>
        <P>The Convention referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question was adopted by the UN General Assembly in December 1990, and it entered into force on 1 July 2003, following ratification by the requisite number of States (20). The Convention has been open for signature and ratification since December 1990. However, to date only 34 States have ratified it. No European Union Member State has as yet signed or ratified the Convention, nor has any indicated an intention to do so.</P>
        <P>The position essentially is that, in order for Ireland to ratify the Convention, significant changes would have to be made across a wide range of existing legislation, including legislation addressing employment, social welfare provision, education, taxation and electoral law. These changes would also have implications for our EU <Col N="662"/>commitments. The operation of the Common Travel Area between Ireland and the UK might also possibly be affected.</P>
        <P>There are no plans at present to sign or ratify the Convention. However as with all outstanding ratifications of international human rights instruments, the position regarding the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of all Migrant Workers and Members of their Families will be kept under review.</P>

Judge Cory was appointed to undertake this investigation by the British and Irish Governments on 28 May 2002. The terms of reference of the investigation were to: </P>
        <P>review all the relevant papers in each case, including the records of earlier investigations;</P>
        <P>interview anyone Judge Cory thought could assist in his examination;</P>
        <P>establish the facts so far as practicable and subject to the law of the respective jurisdictions;</P>

        <P>submit reports as soon as practicable, including in circumstance where there was not sufficient basis to establish the facts in a particular case; the reports to include any recommendation(s) for further action, including, if considered necessary, the holding of a public inquiry.</P>
        <P>Judge Cory was also requested to hear the views of the victims&rsquo; families and to keep them informed of progress, if that was their wish.  Judge Cory submitted his final reports to the two Governments on 7 October 2003.</P>
        <P>The costs of the inquiry were shared between the two Governments. It was agreed that there would be a 50:50 split for the following items: sal<Col N="663"/>aries of the judge and assistants, travel and allowances. In addition, each Government directly covered the costs that arose in its jurisdiction such as legal advice, secretarial support, accommodation and travel. Some costs were also paid in respect of legal representation for the families.</P>

	<P>Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a temporary basis.  CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and by assisting them to develop both their technical and personal skills.  There are currently 22,300 CE participants including CE supervisors on this programme.</P>
        <P>CE as an active labour market programme has the emphasis on progression into employment.  The programme is managed to this end with primary regard to the needs of participants and the community.    In addition, this programme with its focus on the needs of disadvantaged persons, <Col N="665"/>forms a major response by F&Aacute;S to tackling the social exclusion of such groups as Persons with a Disability, Lone Parents, Persons Long-term Unemployed and Drug Misusers with a view to their re-integration into the labour market.  Any diminution in the budget allocated to Community Employment would have the consequence of reducing the level of labour market service available to these groups.</P>

	<P>Responsibility for the development of property solutions for enterprise promotion in the Mid West Region lies with Shannon Development. IDA Ireland is the national agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland and its regions (including Co. Limerick), while Shannon Development is responsible for indigenous industry in the Mid-West region and FDI in the Shannon Free Zone.</P>
        <P>Both Shannon Development and IDA Ireland work closely together in the development, promotion and marketing of tailored property solutions throughout the Mid West, including the Shannon Development-owned land bank of 228 acres at Askeaton.  The location has been identified as an important site from a business and employment perspective for both Co. Limerick and the wider Region, in the Planning and Land Use Transportation Study, the Mid-West Regional Planning Guidelines and the Limerick County Development Plan.</P>
        <P>Typical FDI projects which IDA Ireland seeks to win are in advanced higher-value manufacturing and services activities (often containing an R&amp;D element) requiring high-level skills, infrastructure and advanced business services. The Askeaton site is being actively marketed through IDA Ireland&rsquo;s network of overseas offices as a solution for utility intensive projects.</P>
        <P>Ultimately decisions regarding where to locate an FDI project are taken by potential investors based on the ability of locations to support their business needs. In this context the Askeaton site is nationally significant given its proximity to Foynes and Limerick Ports, to urban clusters in Limerick City and Askeaton, railhead access on the Foynes-Limerick route and its site boundary <Col N="666"/>with the N69 providing direct access to southern ports such as Cork and Rosslare. The completion of the Southern Ring Road and the proposed Limerick Tunnel will furthermore enable direct road access to Shannon Airport for passenger and freight services and will facilitate access to the West and East Coasts including Dublin Port.</P>

The work of InterTrade Ireland is an example of the practical benefits accruing from North/South cooperation under the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
        <P>Minister Eagle and I reviewed progress on the comprehensive study, which was announced earlier this year by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland under the auspices of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. The remit of the study is to identify areas for further co-operation in the development of the all-island economy and provides an unprecedented opportunity to identify and take forward new initiatives. The study is expected to be completed shortly. Arising from a progress report submitted to the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference on 25 July there has been agreement to enhance co-operation in the areas of trade promotion, labour market skills forecasting, international collaboration in science and technology, and business development through knowledge exchange.</P>
        <P>At our meeting Minister Eagle and I gave our full commitment to the North West Gateway Initiative, which will provide a strategic action plan to further develop the North West region of the island of Ireland.

        <P>In so far as the recommendations relating to my area are concerned, these are being vigorously pursued by my Department and the most urgent of them are already on their way to implementation.  For example, the recommendation from the Forum to increase the turnover threshold above which businesses are required to be audited from &euro;1.5 million to the EU limit of &euro;7.3 million, has been taken on board and provision to give effect to it has been included in the new Companies  Bill which is currently before the Oireachtas.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 168, 169 and 175 together.</P><Col N="670"/>
        <P>The reasons for companies to relocate activities from Ireland are many and varied, and include relocation to be closer to customers or other competitive considerations. I believe that firms must be free to allocate resources and production to where the returns are highest. It is not in our interest to obstruct what is in the best interest of competitive enterprises. Our best response to the realities of globalisation is to ensure that Ireland remains attractive for investment and enterprise growth.  Recent announcements by PepsiCo in Cork, TopChem Pharmaceuticals in Sligo and<b> </b>Northern Trust in Limerick demonstrate we continue to possess the skilled intellectual capital to support advanced FDI.  Our recent employment performance does not indicate a trend of job relocations, with over 87,000 new jobs created in the past twelve months &mdash; a growth of 4.7% in a labour force which has now exceeded two million people.</P>
        <P>The Government is very conscious of the need to control costs in order to maintain competitiveness.  As part of the new Social Partnership agreement, Towards 2016, we are reactivating the Anti-Inflation Group, to examine methods of easing inflationary pressures.  Indeed, the moderate wage increases agreed in Towards 2016 will contribute to the easing of inflationary pressure.  Forf&aacute;s, under the aegis of my Department, have published research such as the Statement on Prices and Costs, and are due to publish further work in this area over the coming weeks.</P>

	<P>Each of the enterprise development agencies, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the County Enterprise Boards has a role to play in the promotion of investment and job creation in the country.</P>
        <P>For a number of years now IDA Ireland has been very successful in marketing Ireland to overseas investors and we continue to win a disproportionately high share of  mobile global investments.  The level of FDI in Ireland, relative to the size of the economy, is one of the highest in the world. Today, over 1,000 overseas companies have substantial international operations in Ireland. These include many of the leading companies in information technology and communications, life sciences, international services, engineering and financial services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At the end of 2005 there were over 132,000 people employed IDA assisted companies. The <Col N="671"/>challenge for IDA Ireland is to sustain, embed and grow this investment. In responding to this challenge, IDA Ireland is focusing on the development of its employment base into high technology, high value added and high skill functions, including not only high-end manufacturing, but also areas such as high-end services and research and development.</P>
        <P>Ireland has re-invented its attractions for inward investment over the past seven years, recognising changes in global conditions and in our own circumstances. Now Ireland is distinguished by the quality of our national capabilities as much as by the efficiency of our performance. Investors comment on the nimbleness and coherence with which change is achieved in Ireland, and we have a global reputation as a location for advanced manufacturing, sophisticated business services and, increasingly, for leading research and innovation. Each of these areas will be of critical importance to our continuing success.</P>
        <P>In order to support this success in attracting high quality FDI IDA Ireland has adopted a series of interlinked programmes of work, addressing issues such as competitiveness, the development of niche markets where we can be world leaders and networking with third level and research institutions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Obviously, we can not rely solely on inward investment in terms of future job creation requirements. Indeed, the indigenous sector is very important in this regard.  Enterprise Ireland supported companies made a significant contribution to the Irish economy in 2005, spending over &euro;16 billion on payroll and Irish sourced goods and service and achieved &euro;1.275 billion in new international exports in that year. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s work in assisting indigenous companies to grow and compete in international markets will remain a key focus of our enterprise development policy.</P>
<?oasys _cl11- ?>
        <P>The thirty-five City and County Enterprise Boards approved a total of &euro;12.5m in grant aid to micro-enterprise businesses in respect of nearly 1,000 projects during 2005.  Over 30,000 net jobs have been created in CEB assisted enterprises from 1993 to end 2005.   Some 2,000 net new jobs were created and over 17,000 people participated on CEB training programmes throughout 2005. These management development and training programmes can contribute indirectly to an overall strong national economic performance by providing entrepreneurs with the skills to develop the growth potential and competitiveness of their individual enterprises.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the policies and strategies being pursued by the enterprise development agencies are the most appropriate ones to attract and grow investment in the country and that these will, in turn, help to grow quality employment into the future.</P>

	<P>My colleague the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Mr. Noel Dempsey T.D., has policy responsibility for energy related matters, including the alternative fuel industry.</P>
        <P>The Government is firmly committed to the development of bio-energy generally in Ireland and a number of initiatives are already in place to promote the biofuels sector.  To this end, a Ministerial Bio-Energy Task Force was set up in July 2006. The Task Force, of which I am a member, is chaired by my colleague, Minister Noel Dempsey. The primary objective of the Task Force is to draw up a cohesive national bio-energy strategy by the end of the year, which will set targets for deployment of bio-energy, identify priority areas for development and the necessary support measures to encourage supply and demand. This strategy will also take account of EU developments, and the views of key stakeholders under the Energy Green Paper consultation process.</P>
        <P Just="Left">From an enterprise development perspective, Enterprise Ireland offers both feasibility and research and development support to clients operating in this sector.  I am currently considering how my Department and agencies can further contribute to the stimulation and development of a viable alternative fuels industry and this will be addressed as part of the national bio-energy strategy currently being formulated by the Ministerial Task Force.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland can no longer compete long-term in commoditised markets against low cost economies. This is demonstrated by the decline in the number of firms and persons employed in the Textiles, Leather and Electrical machinery sectors over the past five years. Competitiveness in commoditised, low value added sectors such as these is largely based on low-wage and non-wage costs. The rising cost environment in Ireland since 2000 has put Ireland at a signifi<Col N="673"/>cant competitive disadvantage for these types of manufacturing activities.</P>
        <P>However, Irish manufacturers engaged in specialised, sophisticated, high technology and value added activities, and/or operating in non-commoditised markets (e.g. the medical technologies and chemicals sectors) can continue to compete successfully on international markets going forward. These sectors require specialised skilled staff, specialised technologies and flexible operations, and other factors which are not readily available in many low cost economies, such as <?oasys _dc28- ?>modern Intellectual Property (IP) protection laws, a business friendly regulatory environment, etc.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
        <P>The issue of cost competitiveness and the health of manufacturing depends on a  wide array of issues, from the availability of suitable skills to the impact of higher wage costs. The difficulties being faced by some manufacturing sectors in Ireland is mainly due to shifting patterns of international comparative advantage and the process of structural change, with capital and labour resources tied up in declining firms and industries being allocated to other &lsquo;higher value-added&rsquo; activities more suited to the new, higher cost, Irish operating environment.</P>
        <P>The Irish manufacturing sector has been a key component of the Irish economy over the last two decades and it will continue to be a significant contributor to exports, employment and economic growth in the future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To assist industry to maintain competitiveness and increase productivity, the economic development agencies are working on an ongoing basis to promote the adoption of new technology and best practice at company level.  The agencies aim to support sustainable, high value added enterprise in Ireland through the provision of mentoring and developmental supports, the enhancement of management capabilities and critical workforce skills in client companies, support for the creation and implementation of strategies for market entry, development and growth, and strong supports for innovation and for research and development.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The table sets out the position in relation to job gains and job losses, in relation to full-time manufacturing jobs, in agency assisted firms in Co. Kildare over the period 2001-2005. Over the past 5 years, IDA Ireland&rsquo;s focused strategy for Kildare has been to promote the <Col N="674"/>county as part of an integrated East Region with access to a population base of 1.5 million people. IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for County Kildare is to: progress the development of a knowledge economy; encourage increased co-operation between foreign direct investment companies and third level institutions in the county; work with the existing client base in the county to expand its presence; provide modern property solutions with supporting infrastructure; work with Local Authorities and relevant infrastructure providers to influence the delivery of appropriate infrastructure to the county for example the new Millennium Park, Naas which is comprised of 3 modern 40,000 sq.ft. advance office buildings, which are available for marketing to inward investors.</P>
        <P>Kildare has in recent years attracted some world class manufacturing companies such as Intel, Braun Oral B and Hewlett Packard.  IDA is also working to attract the International Services, Software, Financial Services and Pharmaceuticals sectors and in recent months IFS (a financial services firm) has established a facility in the Millennium Park, Naas.  To support this strategy IDA Ireland is working closely with educational institutions in the County, in developing the skill sets necessary to attract high value added employment to the county.  IDA is also working with F&Aacute;S to provide guidance in developing the skill sets needed by those already in the workforce who are interested in upskilling.</P>
        <P>In terms of job creation, Enterprise Ireland activity is focussed on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs in manufacturing and internationally traded services companies who are setting up new High Potential Start-Up Companies, the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies and in enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at a national and regional level through supporting research in companies and third level institutions.  Since the beginning of 2003, E I has approved over &euro;12m in support to companies in Kildare to help them grow their sales and exports and improve innovation and new product development in order that they can compete on world markets.</P>
        <P Just="Left">New companies &mdash; now leaders in the consumer products market &mdash; have been established and have created new employment. The consumer foods sector in particular, has shown rapid growth over the last number of years, reflecting significant changes in eating habits and an increase in demand for convenience foods. The announcement in January 2005 by Green Isle Foods of a major &euro;22.6 million expansion investment in the county, supported by Enterprise Ireland, is well under way and is expected to lead to the creation of 130 new jobs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The announcement in  May 2006 of a  &euro;28m investment by Dawn Farm Foods Ltd. in Naas, Co. Kildare  and supported by EI,  relates to the development of a State-of-the-Art meat science innovation centre together with significant investment in research and development and additional <Col N="675"/>capital investment. Overall, 100 new jobs will be created, increasing employment in Dawn Farm Foods to 580 by 2011.  In addition, the number of dedicated research and development personnel in the company will double from 15 to 30. In <Col N="676"/>addition to providing direct financial assistance, Kildare CEB also provides indirect assistance such as advice, mentoring and a broad range of training programmes for prospective entrants or established participants in the micro-enterprise sector.</P>

	<P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland and its regions. The marketing of individual areas, including Waterford, for new or expansion FDI <Col N="676"/>investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the Agency.  While I may give general policy directives to the Agency, I am precluded under the Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.</P>
        <P>As the Gateway location for the South-East Region, IDA Ireland is seeking to develop Waterford City as a first-class location for overseas investment and is working closely with a wide range of local bodies to develop the necessary infrastructure, skills availability and support services capable of attracting investment into Waterford and the entire region.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As part of this strategy, IDA Ireland aims to provide world class property solutions of scale in the Waterford City area and to develop property solutions in the county town of Dungarvan, with appropriate supporting infrastructure in both cases.  Recent years have seen the development of the 70 acre Waterford Business and Technology Park, the Dungarvan Business Park as well as the large scale 136 acre Greenfield site in Belview, which is specifically targeted for larger scale utility intensive overseas investments. A further 50 acre site adjacent to the Genzyme facility on the Kilmeaden road in Waterford City is also available for Greenfield investment.</P>
        <P>In parallel with developments on the property solutions side, IDA Ireland continues to work closely with third level educational institutes in the region so that the skill sets necessary to attract high value-added employment to the county are being developed. The Agency is of the view that Waterford Institute of Technology will play an ever-increasing role in the attraction and maintenance of overseas companies in the county. In addition, IDA maintains a close relationship with F&Aacute;S so that the requirements of industry, particularly in the area of training and upskilling, are being met.</P><Col N="677"/>

	<P Just="Left">In so far as the question relates to company law inquiries, I would refer the Deputy to the tables below which set out summary details of all company law investigations, for which my Department has had responsibility, since 1997.</P>
        <P>Sixteen investigations into company law matters were initiated by my predecessor in the period since 1997.  In three cases, the High Court <Col N="678"/>appointed, on an application by the Minister, inspectors under section 8 of the Companies Act 1990. The Inspectors appointed to Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited presented their Report to the High Court on 10 June 2002. The Inspectors appointed to National Irish Bank Ltd and National Irish Bank Financial Services Ltd presented their Report to the High Court on 12 July 2004.</P>
        <P>One investigation under section 14 of the Companies Act 1990 was completed in 1998 and the report was referred to the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP).</P>
        <P>One investigation was undertaken under section 59 of the Insurance Act 1989. The report on this was referred to the DPP as well as to the Inspectors who undertook the section 8 investigation into that company.</P>
        <P>Eleven investigations were initiated by the Minister under section 19 of the Companies Act 1990. Six of these have been concluded.</P>
        <P>Two of the eleven Section 19 investigations were held up in legal appeals, to such extent that no effective progress was made by the authorised officer and the matter of reports of the examinations did not arise. These enquiries are now the responsibility of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</P>
        <P>In relation to the three remaining Section 19 examinations, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 11278 of 23 March 2006. The Authorised Officer is continuing to provide information and assistance to relevant authorities, as outlined in that reply.</P>
        <P el="10"><i>Table of Investigations under Section 12, 14  &amp; 19 of the Companies Act 1990</i></P>
        <P>The table outlines the costs incurred by the Exchequer on company investigations commenced since 1995, up to and including 31 December 2004.  The costs do not include the salary cost of civil service staff working on or who have worked on these investigations or the legal costs relating to a number of these investigations that were borne by the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office.</P><Col N="677"/>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>A working group established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness (PPF), with cross-departmental membership which includes my Department and chaired by the Department of Health and Children, has examined the feasibility of the introduction of a cost of disability payment.  The National Disability Authority, on behalf of the working group and in line with its own remit, commissioned research into the feasibility of the introduction of such a payment.  The purpose of this research was to advise regarding the additional costs incurred by people with disabilities, owing specifically to the direct or indirect costs of disability and the appropriate mechanisms or instruments by which to address identified additional costs.  The resultant report, Disability and the Cost of Living, was subsequently published by the National Disability Authority. </P>
        <P>The group considers it vital that comprehensive data is available on which to base consideration of the introduction of a cost of disability payment, in addition to a structured process of the assessment of need.  The working group recommended <Col N="682"/>that steps be taken to improve the quality of data relating to disability in Ireland, for example, adjustment of existing data gathering exercises undertaken by the Central Statistics Office or other relevant bodies to include questions on the numbers per household with disabilities, the nature of disability and severity of impairment.</P>
        <P>The group has also examined the scope for addressing barriers that exist for people with disabilities who wish to undertake or increase their employment and thus move to a position of greater economic independence.  In this regard, as part of the Social Welfare Budget package 2006, I introduced a change to the withdrawal rate of Disability Allowance and Blind Pension for income in excess of the current earnings disregard level which means that a single person can earn up to a maximum of &euro;390 per week from rehabilitative employment before their Disability Allowance or Blind Pension is fully withdrawn.   The outcome of this change will be monitored to assess its effect on increased employment participation and to identify any further policy changes required.</P>
        <P>In terms of ensuring adequate levels of income for people with disabilities, the current ten-year Social Partnership Agreement, Towards 2016, includes the commitment to work for the continued enhancement and integration of supports in line with overall social welfare targets. These will include a rationalisation of existing allowances for people with disabilities in the context of the Government&rsquo;s policy of mainstreaming and <Col N="683"/>the proposed transfer of functions from the Health Services Executive to my Department which includes a number of disability-related schemes, including the Domiciliary Care Allowance, Mobility Allowance and Blind Welfare Allowance.  An inter-departmental working group has now been established to progress the implementation of this transfer. Other issues around the cost of disability will be considered following the development of a needs assessment system provided for under Part 2 of the Disability Act, 2005.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s Disability Sectoral Plan similarly contains actions in relation to the rationalisation of existing allowances for people with disabilities. The Plan also includes agreed protocols with the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on actions required to ensure that income supports and associated benefits do not create financial barriers to people with disabilities participating in the labour force or availing of training, educational or other developmental opportunities.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the implementation of the sectoral plan over the next three years and to continuing the commitment to expand and deliver services that best support, recognise and encourage people with disabilities as well as those who provide a caring role.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Towards 2016, the recently ratified social partnership agreement, includes a commitment to achieve the target of &euro;150 per week, in 2002 terms, for the lowest social welfare rates by 2007 and to maintain the value of these rates at this level over the course of the agreement, subject to available resources. This commitment applies to a wide range of social welfare schemes, including disability allowance.  Budget 2006 saw an increase of &euro;17 per week in the weekly rate of disability allowance to &euro;165.80 per week. This represented an increase of 11.4%, which was well above the 2006 projected inflation rate and ensured that the Government remains on course to deliver on its commitment on the lowest social welfare rates.  A &euro;20 increase in the rate of disability allowance would cost an estimated &euro;93.5 million in a full year.  Further improvements in the rate of disability allowance will be considered in the context of the forthcoming Budget.</P>

        <Quest> the cost to the Exchequer in <Col N="684"/>each case of raising the qualifying threshold for fuel allowance by &euro;20 per week, &euro;50 per week and &euro;100 per week. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive payments with meeting the cost of their heating needs during the winter season.  Fuel allowances are paid for 29 weeks from end-September to mid-April. The allowance represents a contribution towards a person&rsquo;s normal heating expenses.  It is estimated that some 274,000 people (151,000 with basic fuel allowance and 123,000 with smokeless fuel supplement) will benefit in 2006 at an estimated annual cost &euro;125.1m. </P>
        <P>A number of improvements have been made to the scheme in recent years including the easing of the means test and extending the duration of payment from 26 weeks to 29 weeks.  Most recently, Budget 2006 provided for an increase in the rate of fuel allowance of &euro;5.00 from &euro;9.00 to &euro;14.00 (&euro;17.90 in designated smokeless areas).  Eligibility to the fuel allowance scheme is subject to means and other conditions.  The main conditions that apply to the fuel allowance scheme are that a person must be in receipt of a qualifying payment, must satisfy a means test and must either be living alone or with a qualifying dependant.</P>
        <P>People who are in receipt of relevant non-contributory payments do not have to undergo a further means assessment for fuel allowance purposes.  An income test applies in the case of other applicants whereby they and members of their household may have savings/investments of up to &euro;46,000 or a combined household income of up to &euro;51 per week, over and above the maximum rate of state pension (contributory) and still qualify for fuel allowance.  This income limit was increased to &euro;51 per week with effect from 1 June 2005.  The fuel allowance income limits increase each season in line with the increases in the rate of the state pension (contributory).</P>
        <P>The cost to the exchequer from raising qualifying thresholds as outlined in the Deputy&rsquo;s question would depend on the extra numbers who would apply and qualify for the fuel allowance as a result of the measure. An accurate quantification of these numbers is not readily available. However, it is estimated that it could cost approximately &euro;1.9 million to raise the income limit by &euro;20, approximately &euro;3.7 million to raise it by &euro;50 and approximately &euro;5.5 million to raise it by &euro;100.</P>
        <P>Any changes to the fuel allowance scheme such as rates of payment, income limits and eligibility would have significant cost implications and would have to be considered in the context of the Budget and in the light of the resources available for improvements in social welfare generally.  		</P>

	<P Just="Left">The living alone allowance or living alone increase as it is now known, is an additional payment of  &euro;7.70 per week made to people aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments and who are living alone. It is also available to people under 66 years of age who are living alone and who receive payments under one of a number of invalidity type schemes. The increase is intended as a contribution towards the additional costs people face when they live alone.  The payment was last increased in 1996 and at that time the Living Alone Increase represented 8% of the personal rate for old age contributory pensioners.  If the increase had kept pace with the increase in pensions since then it would now be worth approximately &euro;15.40 per week.  The estimated cost of bringing the increase up to this level is &euro;61.5 million per annum.</P>
        <P>I should point out that, over the past 10 years, the Government has made great strides in improving and expanding social welfare payments and entitlements, e.g., since 1996, pensions have increased by almost 104%, or nearly 50% in real terms.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 187 to 189, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Entitlement to carer&rsquo;s allowance is based on an applicant satisfying medical, means and residency conditions.  In determining entitlement to the allowance there are, in certain cases, unavoidable time lags involved in making the necessary investigations and enquiries to enable timely and accurate decision to be made.  Delays can also arise if persons applying for the allowance are not in a position to supply all the necessary information in support of their claim.					</P>
        <P>Because of these factors, there will always be a certain volume of claims on hands awaiting finalisation and these cannot be regarded as a backlog. Many applicants for carer&rsquo;s allowance are already in receipt of another social welfare payment while their claim is being processed.  Such payments will normally continue until entitlement to their carers allowance is determined.</P>
        <P>There are currently 2,163 pending cases awaiting a decision, over 40% of which were received within the last eight weeks. The majority of claims currently on hands will be processed within the next ten weeks. The average time for deciding an application for carer&rsquo;s allowance is currently 9.53 weeks, although in many cases they are processed within a far shorter timeframe.  The average in 2005 was 8.88 weeks, while the average in 2004 was 12.70 weeks. It is not possible to identify the longest amount of time it has taken to process an individual carer&rsquo;s allowance application in 2006.  7,177 new claims were processed to a final decision in the nine months up to the end of September, compared to a total of 8,793 over the whole of 2005 and 8,196 in 2004.</P>
        <P>The volume of claims finalised so far this year represents a 9% increase on the average achieved in 2005 and a 17% increase on the average achieved in 2004.  There are 27,000 carer&rsquo;s allowances in payment, compared to 25,000 at the end of 2005 and 23,000 at the end of 2004.  The staff and other resources available to my Department must be deployed to ensure good customer service, to prevent fraud and abuse of the schemes and to achieve value for money. My Department is engaged in an ongoing process to ensure that available resources are prioritised to the greatest extent possible on front line service delivery and to ensure that the best possible standard of response is provided across the range of schemes and services. The position will be kept under review to ensure that the best possible customer service is provided.</P>

	<P>As outlined in the Minister&rsquo;s reply of 16 February 2006, Dublin Port Company wrote to me as Marine Minister on 18 May 2005 seeking ministerial approval for the company to enter into an arrangement with the Anna Livia consortium, as detailed in draft heads of terms enclosed with the letter.</P>
        <P>The proposed arrangement was in essence that in the event that the consortium was successful in the National Conference Centre competition, and subject to the Minister&rsquo;s consent, Dublin Port Company would make a site available to facilitate the consortium&rsquo;s proposal for a National Conference Centre.  Following approval by the Government, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, John O&rsquo;Donoghue, TD, announced in November 2005 that Spencer Dock International Conference Centre Consortium was being invited to become the Provisional Preferred Tenderer for the provision of a National Conference Centre in Dublin.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Deputy may be aware, on 31 August 2006, that Minister further announced that this consortium was being invited to become the Preferred Tenderer in this regard.  Since the consortium with which Dublin Port Company signed the heads of terms was not successful in the competition, the Ministerial approval requested by Dublin Port Company on 18 May 2005 is no longer required.  Regarding the advice received on the matter from the Attorney General, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that such advice is subject to legal professional privilege.</P>

        <P>Refugees were identified &mdash; along with asylum seekers &mdash; as a target group of the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme (LDSIP) at its outset in 2000. Since then, under the LDSIP a significant number of Area-based Partnerships, Community Partnerships and Employment Pacts have developed actions to support refugees, often as part of broader supports for immigrants, including asylum seekers and/or migrant workers.</P>
        <P>With regard to expenditure under LDSIP for immigrant groups etc., the position is that the LDSIP data is not currently disaggregated.  However, I am informed that in 2005 18% of initiatives under the services to the unemployed measure were for Asylum Seekers &amp; Refugees, 27% of initiatives under the Community Development measure were for that target group as were 9% of initiatives under the Community based Youth Initiatives measure.</P>

	<P>The person named submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the 2005 Single Payment Scheme National Reserve under Categories A and B.</P>
        <P>Category A caters for farmers who inherited land or received land free of charge or for a nominal sum from a farmer who had retired or died by 16 May, 2005 and who had leased out his/her holding to a third party during the reference period 2000 to 2002.  The person named has been deemed successful under this Category.</P>
        <P>Category B caters for farmers who, between 1 January, 2000 and 19 October, 2003 made an investment in production capacity in a farming sector for which a direct payment under Livestock Premia and/or Arable Aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000-2002.  Investments can include purchase or long term lease of land, purchase of suckler and/or ewe quota or other investments.</P>
        <P>The person named applied under Category B(i) in relation to purchased/leased land and has been deemed unsuccessful as the land involved was inherited and inherited land is not eligible under  this category.  He also applied under Category B(ii) for the purchase of suckler quota and B(iv) for other investments and was deemed successful under both categories.

	<P>The requirement that all bovine animals over 30 months of age, slaughtered for human consumption, must be tested for BSE is provided for in Regulation (EC) No. 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council, laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, TSEs.  Under the Regulation, as it currently stands, I have no discretion to raise the age limit at which bovines destined for human consumption must be tested.  I, and my officials, have made repeated efforts to have the age thresholds for the various categories of animals changed, based on the results of surveillance carried out here.  Amendments to the TSE Regulation, including Community rules in relation to testing for BSE, have been under discussion in various EU fora, including the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament.  My support for a change reflects the difficulties which I entirely appreciate are being experienced by some producers in having cattle finished within 30 months and I hope that any changes that may be agreed would alleviate those difficulties.</P>
        <P>These discussions are almost complete but the regulation is not expected to be adopted before the end of the year.  It is however likely to include a provision to allow Member States wishing to change the age limit for testing for BSE in healthy animals slaughtered for human consumption  to seek the approval of the Commission and other Member States for revisions to their annual monitoring programmes, within the framework of the Standing Committee on Animal Health and the Food Chain.  Such applications would be made by reference to a range of criteria relating to the BSE situation  and controls in the particular country.  These criteria have yet to be determined and may take some time to finalise.  It should also be pointed out that our view that the age limit should be raised is not shared by all Member States.  I will, of course continue to press for a change in the age threshold at every opportunity, as I and my officials have done for the past three years.</P>

	<P>Teacher allocations to second level schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment.  Each school management authority is required to organise its timetable and subject options with regard to pupils&rsquo; needs within the limit of its approved teacher allocation.  The rules for allocating teaching resources provide that where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department will consider applications for additional short term support, curricular concessions.  An application for curricular concessions was received by the school referred to by the Deputy and an extra 0.45 wholetime equivalent teacher post was allocated.  An independent appeals mechanism is available to school authorities which wish to appeal the adequacy of their teacher allocation.  The school referred to by the Deputy availed of this appeals mechanism and was allocated a further 0.55 wholetime equivalent teacher post.  The decision of the Appeals Committee is final.  As the Appeals Committee operates independently of my Department in taking its decisions, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate to intervene in any such decision.</P>
        <P>The Property Management Section of the Office of Public Works, which acts on behalf of my Department in relation to site acquisitions generally, has been exploring the possibility of acquiring a site for the school referred to by the Deputy.  A number of options have been considered including the possibility of using one of the sites of the existing schools as the site of amalgamation.  The preferred option however is the location of the new school on a greenfield site.  Over the past few years a number of sites have been identified as a possibility for the location of the proposed new school but their acquisition met with difficulties. Following a re-advertisement for possible sites, some new proposals were received.  All site options have been examined by the OPW.  My Department is awaiting clarification from OPW on a number of the new site proposals.  Due to the commercial sensitivities of site acquisitions, it is not proposed at this stage to identify specific sites being considered.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, through the local special educational needs organiser, is responsible for processing applications for special educational needs supports from primary and post-primary schools.  In the case referred to by the Deputy, an application for resource teaching hours was made to the relevant special educational needs organiser.  However, the application did not meet my Department&rsquo;s criteria for individual resource teaching support.  The school in question has been allocated 17.5 hours learning support/resource teacher hours under the general allocation system introduced in primary schools in September 2005.  It is a matter for the school principal to identify the pupils who should access such support and to determine if such support is delivered within a group or individual setting.  It is open to the parent to discuss the matter with the school to determine if the pupil qualifies for such support.  The NCSE will review decisions previously taken in relation to such cases on foot of a request from the school or parents/guardians, when accompanied by relevant additional information, which may not have been to hand at the time of the decision.  The NCSE has outlined this process in its Circular 01/05 which issued to all primary schools.</P>

In such circumstances, and where new schools are required, the Department will seek to provide a school on a temporary site until the site acquisition has been completed.</P>
        <P>It must also be borne in mind that while housing developments may be completed, there is generally a lead in time before there is sufficient pupil output to warrant the purchase and development of any given site.  This situation is monitored through contacts with local authorities and any existing schools.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Department recently entered into a partnership approach with Fingal County Council to ensure that new schools can be provided to match the rapid pace of housing development in that area while at the same time providing important facilities for the community.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the agreement and based on the school planning projections of the Department, Fingal County Council will identify and acquire appropriate sites where schools with enhanced sporting, community and arts facilities will be built to the benefit of both the school and the wider community.  It is hoped that this agreement will help to fast-track the delivery of schools and community facilities throughout Fingal.</P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the home tuition scheme provides funding to parents to provide education at home for children who, for a variety of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school. The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for pupils awaiting a suitable educational placement.</P>
        <P>As the tuition takes place outside of the school supervision, the Deputy will appreciate the need to ensure that tuition providers are appropriately qualified to give education to the children concerned. The usual requirement is a fully qualified teacher. However other qualifications are accept<Col N="702"/>able depending on the individual needs of the child.</P>
        <P>Nominated tuition providers with qualifications other than teaching qualifications have been accepted for the first school term this year to allow time to establish the suitability of the range of qualifications submitted. As the process progresses the parents concerned will be informed of the decision which will result in approval for subsequent terms of the nominated tuition provider or direction to recruit a tuition provider with suitable qualifications. It is important to stress that the allocation of tuition hours under the scheme is not at issue in the context of the review of qualifications in this regard.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Under the terms of my Department&rsquo;s Third Level Maintenance Grant Schemes, which are administered on behalf of the Department by the Local Authorities and the Vocational Education Committees, the position is that generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants <Col N="703"/>where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to residence, age, means, nationality and previous academic attainment. An approved course for the purpose of the Schemes means a full-time undergraduate course of not less than two years duration and full time postgraduate course of not less that one year's duration pursued in an approved institution.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the Department&rsquo;s maintenance grants schemes, and in accordance with the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act 1992, a mature student is defined as a candidate who is at least 23 years of age on the 1st January of the year of entry or re-entry to an approved course.</P>
        <P>Mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents or guardians. An independent mature student is defined as meaning a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his/her parents or guardians from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are assessed without reference to either their parents&rsquo; or guardians&rsquo; income or address.</P>
        <P>Part-time courses are not approved courses under the terms of the Maintenance Grant Schemes. Any extension of the student support schemes to part-time studies would have significant cost implications. I have no plans at present to extend the grant schemes to include part-time students.</P>
        <P>Under my Department&rsquo;s Free Fees Initiative the Exchequer meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending approved full-time undergraduate third-level courses in the State. I have no plans at present to extend these schemes to include part-time students.</P>
        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy of the provisions under Section 473A, Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. This provides tax relief for eligible persons, at the standard rate of tax, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including certain approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in E.U. Member States and postgraduate courses in non EU countries.</P>
        <P>Tax relief for courses of at least two years&rsquo; duration at undergraduate level extends to approved full/part-time courses in both private and publicly funded third level colleges in the State and any other EU Member State and approved full/part-time courses operated by Colleges in any EU Member State providing distance education in the State.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at primary in recent years. At the beginning of the current school year there are no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002. The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level. </P>
        <P>Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.</P>
        <P>Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Over the next two school years even more teachers will be put in place both for the above priority areas of disadvantage and special education and also under a reduction in the mainstream staffing schedule.</P>
        <P>As you know all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that &mdash; with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on &mdash; but the general <Col N="705"/>rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next year (2007/2008 school year) this is being reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher.</P>
        <P>A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year, as is the case in Lucan and Clondalkin. 170 such posts were sanctioned in the 2005/06 school year, compared to 105 in 2004/05.</P>
        <P>This Government has shown a clear determination to improve the staffing in our schools and we will continue to prioritise this issue going forward.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of my Department provides an educational psychological service to primary and post primary schools.  NEPS also offers support and advice to all schools in the context of traumatic incidents, including suicide.  The level of support offered depends on the needs of individual students and the capacity of the school to respond.  A school may, in the normal way, request a consultation with the school psychologist about a pupil who has experienced bereavement through suicide or may, with parental permission, request that the pupil meet with the school psychologist.  Where necessary, NEPS cooperates with the HSE in catering for the needs of these pupils.</P>
        <P>All post primary schools receive ex-quota hours to provide a guidance and counselling service to their students.  The number of hours allocated to each school is based on its enrolment.  From the beginning of the 2005/06 academic year, all schools in the Free Education/Block Grant scheme with a student enrolment of 200 or more received an increased ex-quota allocation. In addition, beginning in the 2006/07 academic year, all schools included in the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) initiative received a further increase in their ex-quota allocation for guidance and counselling.  Qualified guidance counsellors, working in second level schools, are trained to provide counselling support to students.</P>

	<P>DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP). The School Support Programme will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage. </P>
        <P>The process of identifying primary and second-level schools for participation in the SSP was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work coordinated through the Department&rsquo;s regional offices and the Inspectorate. As a result of the identification process, 840 schools were invited to participate in the SSP. These comprised 640 primary schools (320 urban/town schools and 320 rural schools) and 200 second-level schools. I am delighted to say that 833 of the schools invited to join the new programme accepted the invitation.</P>
        <P>A review mechanism was put in place to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in the School Support Programme but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which is of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme. The review process operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and pro<Col N="708"/>cedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review.</P>
        <P>The closing date for receipt of review applications was Friday, 31st March, 2006. Applications for review were not received from the schools referred to by the Deputy. The Group has submitted a final report which has been accepted by the Department and the review process is now concluded. Schools which have not qualified for the new School Support Programme and which are receiving additional resources, both human and financial, under pre-existing schemes and programmes for addressing concentrated disadvantage, will retain these supports for 2006/2007. After that, schools will continue to get support in line with the level of disadvantage among their pupils.</P>
        <P>The DEIS action plan states that, as well as the provision being made under the new School Support Programme for schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage, financial support will also continue to be provided for other primary schools where the level of disadvantage is more dispersed.</P>

	<P>One of the main objectives of the School Transport Scheme is to provide a basic level of service for children who live long distances from school and who might otherwise experience difficulty in attending regularly. In general primary school transport routes are planned so that, as far as possible, no eligible pupil will have more than 2.4 kilometres to travel to a pick up point.  The school transport service provided to the family referred to in the details supplied are within this guideline. My Department understands from Bus &Eacute;ireann that an extension to the existing service is not feasible due to operational reasons.</P>

	<P>Under the terms of my Department&rsquo;s third level maintenance grants schemes, grant assistance is available to eligible students attending approved third level courses in approved institutions. An approved course for the purpose of the schemes means a full-time <Col N="711"/>undergraduate course of not less than two years duration and a full time postgraduate course of not less than one year duration pursued in an approved institution. In order to qualify for grant assistance, a candidate must, of course, satisfy the prescribed conditions of the schemes including those relating to residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Students from this State who are attending undergraduate courses in Northern Ireland can apply for maintenance grants in respect of approved courses generally at Higher National Diploma level or higher, which are pursued in colleges approved for the purpose of my Department's Higher Education Grant Scheme and Vocational Education Committees&rsquo; Scholarship Scheme. Both of these schemes provide that where a candidate is not eligible for free tuition under the Free Fees Initiative and is pursuing an approved course at undergraduate level in an institution listed in the State, the Local Authority/VEC may award a full or part grant in respect of the candidate&rsquo;s lecture fee, subject to the terms of this Scheme. There are no plans to extend the payment of tuition fees under the Student Support Schemes to undergraduate students attending approved courses outside the State.</P>
        <P>It is understood however that students attending Higher Education Institutions in Northern Ireland and who are ordinarily resident in a Member State of the European Union will be eligible for a fee loan from the Northern Ireland Authorities up to the amount charged by the Higher Education Institution.  Further clarification can be sought by the individual from Department of Employment and Learning in the Northern Ireland. Their e-mail address is <i>studentfinance@delni.gov.uk</i>. An extension of the scope of the free fees initiative or the maintenance grant schemes could only be considered having regard to overall resource constraints and other competing demands in the education sector.</P>
        <P>Students pursuing approved postgraduate courses in Northern Ireland can apply for assistance under the terms of the Schemes in respect of maintenance grants and, also, grants in respect of the cost of their tuition fees, subject to a maximum fee limit, which is currently &euro;5,730.  Section 473A Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 also provides for tax relief on tuition fees, at the standard rate of tax in respect of approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including certain approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU and non-EU member states.</P>

	<P>The informal meeting of Defence Ministers took place in Levi in Finland on the 2nd and 3rd of October, 2006.  Due to prior commitments, I was unable to attend and the Secretary General of my Department attended in my stead. </P>
        <P>The meeting discussed current operations including the current EU Operation Althea in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  A presentation on the current operation and future plans for Operation Althea was made by General Sir John Reith, the current operational commander.  While recognising that the mission will be scaled down going into 2007, member States agreed that any drawdown of forces must be event rather than time driven.  The meeting also discussed the EU Support mission to AMIS, the African Union mission <Col N="716"/>in Sudan/Darfur.  Member States welcomed the agreement of the African Union to extend the mandate for its operation to the end of the year and the need, therefore, for the EU to continue to do the utmost to support AMIS on the ground especially with financial and logistical support.  The member States also agreed on the importance of continuing to engage with the government of Sudan to achieve acceptance of the deployment of a UN mission in Darfur.  It was noted that in the absence of the Sudanese Government&rsquo;s acceptance it will be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve the required UN transition.  During a working lunch the EU operation in support of MONUC, the UN operation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, was reviewed.  There was also a discussion on potential support by the EU to Lebanon in the aftermath of the recent conflict there.  Quite a number of the member States are extensively engaged in the UN mission in Lebanon UNIFIL II.</P>
        <P>In a further working session, Ministers discussed the Headline Goal 2010 and the current status of the Force Catalogue, which sets out the capability requirements for the EU Rapid Reaction Force.  The meeting also looked forward to achieving full operational capability for EU Battlegroups in January 2007, and discussed ways of improving co-ordination across the civil and military elements of EU operations.</P>
        <P>In tandem with the informal Defence Ministers&rsquo; meeting, there was also a Ministerial level meeting of the EDA Steering Board.  The main item on the Agenda for the Steering Board was a discussion on the EDA&rsquo;s initial long-term vision, which has been developed by the Agency over the past number of months.  The purpose of the LTV is to set out a view of the future global context and, against this background, the potential capability requirements for ESDP operations.  While the overall thrust of the document was supported by the Steering Board as providing a broad compass looking into the future of possible capability needs for EU military forces engaged in ESDP operations, it is important to note the document is non-binding, non-committing and is not a document agreed in word-by-word detail by the member States.  The LTV will provide some guidance on the focus of R&amp;T initiatives which may be facilitated by the EDA and will feed into an ESDP Capability Development Plan to be submitted to the Capabilities Steering Board in December.  Any future R&amp;T Agenda or Capability Development Plans will have to be agreed specifically by the Steering Board on a case-by-case basis.  The long-term vision is a living document to be reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis, probably every 2 to 3 years.</P>
        <P>The meeting also reviewed progress on a major Force Protection Project which is being facilitated by the EDA.  This is an ad hoc project where particular member States agree to provide funding for <Col N="717"/>research projects to be managed and administered by the Agency on their behalf.  Ireland is not participating in any ad-hoc projects at present.</P>
        <P>Finally the meeting discussed the Financial Framework for the Agency for 2007-2009.  There was general agreement that more information and a more compelling case for the Agency&rsquo;s proposals was required before any decision could be taken on the framework. The Agency is to bring forward more specific proposals to the next Steering Board meeting.</P>

	<P>My Department provides capital funding to assist voluntary and co-operative housing associations to deliver high quality housing for low income families as well as for vulnerable groups such as elderly people, people with disabilities, the homeless and travellers. Earlier this year I substantially increased the capital funding limits for voluntary and co-operative housing projects. My Department&rsquo;s involvement with the <Col N="720"/>capital funding schemes relates primarily to the provision of funds for individual projects. The administration of the scheme, and the certification that particular projects comply with the terms of the scheme, are the responsibility of the local authority. </P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Design Guidelines provide general design guidance at the level of both the overall scheme and the individual dwelling unit. The guidelines state that the choice of heating system and fuel should be determined primarily by expected capital and running costs, including possible servicing and maintenance costs and the preferences of the likely occupants. Regard should also be had to efficiency in use, ease of operation and expected emissions of smoke, carbon dioxide and other harmful gasses. Where natural gas is available on-site, it should generally be the preferred fuel for space and water heating, unless there are particular reasons for the use of an alternative fuel. Consideration should also be given to the possibility of using solar panels or other renewable energy technology to provide a proportion of the energy for space and water heating, where economical and practical. The use of geothermal or other alternative systems should be determined on the basis of technical merit and cost and will be considered for funding by my Department following a technical assessment by Sustainable Energy Ireland.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 253 to 255, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Ireland is in compliance with the requirement under Directive 98/70/EC to apply a maximum sulphur content of 50ppm in diesel fuel from 1 January 2005.  As part of the national arrangements to ensure compliance with the Directive, diesel fuel samples are taken by the Revenue Commissioners at both refinery and oil terminals, and examined by the State Laboratory.  In 2005, 94 diesel samples were analysed for sulphur content and all were found to be in compliance with the limit value.  The average value for the year was 27ppm, well below the EU requirement and consistent with the separate requirement under Directive 2003/17/EC to move progressively towards sulphur free-status.  Sulphur-free petrol and diesel will be mandatory from 1 January 2009.  The water content of diesel is not a matter within my Department&rsquo;s remit and I am not aware of the issues raised.</P>

<P FLI="0"><u>PROPOSAL NO. 2 &mdash; Participation Proposal</u></P>

<P el="0">As an alternative to the outright purchase proposal above I am prepared to deal with Lots 1 &mdash; 5 (inclusive) above on the basis that I would be given a 50% share in the ownership of the said lands in exchange for procuring Planning Permission and Building Bye Law Approval. The time span which I would require to be allowed to obtain the Permissions and Approval and my anticipated financial expenditure (apart from my time input) in respect of the different lots would be as follows:&mdash;</P>
<P></P>
<P><u>Lots 1, 2 and 3</u></P>

<P>A period of 2 years within which to procure a buildable Planning Permission and Building Bye Laws Approval for mixed development including housing, industrial and commercial.</P>
<P></P>
<P>My financial expenditure up to a figure of &pound;150,000 (to include Architect's fees, Consulting Engineer's fees, Planning and Bye Law charges etc.).</P>
<P></P>
<P><u>Lots 4 and 5</u></P>

<P>Time requirement &mdash; 3 years.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Financial Expenditure &mdash; up to &pound;150,000</P>
<P></P>
<P>In considering the above proposals the following points of information should be borne in mind by all parties:&mdash;</P><Col N="734"/>

<P Li="1">1.  From the point of view of obtaining Planning Permission the entire lands 1-6 inclusive) have the following shortcomings:&mdash;</P>

<P LI="2">NO zoning for development purposes</P>

<P LI="2">NO services.</P>

<P LI="2">NO proposal in current draft development plans (City and County) for the zoning of the lands or any part thereof for development purposes.</P>


<P LI="1">2. We face a very severe uphill battle to arrange for the availability of services and for the ultimate procurement of Planning Permission.</P>

<P LI="1">3. The steps to be taken on the way to procuring a buildable Planning Permission and Building Bye Laws Approval are notoriously difficult, time consuming and expensive. Material Contravention Orders must be obtained and this involves their procurement of a majority vote at 2 full Council Meetings at which 78 Council Members must be present and it also involves satisfactory compliance with extensive requirements and pre-conditions of the Planning Authority and the inevitable dealing with protracted Appeals to An Bord Pleanala.</P>

<P LI="1">4. It is essential that the Planning Application should be brought in the name of an active house building company which enjoys good standing and good working relationship with the Planners and the Council Members and in this regard I confirm that in the event of our reaching agreement regarding the within proposals that all Planning Applications would be made by one of my Companies which meets the said requirements.</P>

<P LI="1">5. In the case of all of the lands the applications will be highly sensitive and controversial and we can realistically expect strenous opposition from private, political and planning sectors. One of my active companies will have to take the limelight in such applications and withstand the objections and protests which will inevitably confront it. Apart from the anticipated financial expenditure as outlined above it should be borne in mind that I will personally have to give extensively of my time and efforts over the entire period of the applications including the necessary preliminary negotiations in regard to services and zoning. It must be borne in mind that I will have to abandon other projects which would be open to myself and my companies in order to give proper attention to this project. If I am successful in changing your lands from their present status of agricultural lands with very limited potential even for agricultural use into highly valuable building lands I would have to be rewarded with a minimum 50% stake in the ownership of the lands. Our advisors would <Col N="735"/>have to work out the details as to how this can be effected in the most tax efficient manner.</P>

<P el="10">I look forward to hearing from you in relation to the above proposals. In the case of the first proposal which relates to the outright purchase of the lands (excluding Lot 6) I would not be adverse to a proposal which would involve the vendors retaining a participation stake of up to 20% in the purchasing company if you felt that an ongoing interest in the future development of <Col N="736"/>the lands would be more acceptable to the present owners.</P>

<P el="10">Yours sincerely,</P>
