    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31. I will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn"><NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss an issue of urgent national importance, namely, the current underspend of &euro;3.65 billion in the funding allocated to the BMW region under the national development plan for the period 2000 to 2006 and in the light of the revelation that &euro;4 million in tourism funding for the west was reallocated last year to child care programmes and given that there is now only 11 months remaining in the lifetime of the national development plan what measures are being taken to ensure that the funding allocated to the BMW region will be expended in the BMW region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il to raise a matter of urgent public importance and interest, the new deportation order issued against student Olunkunle Eluhanla in defiance of the clear wish of his classmates and the community in Palmerstown and of the Irish people generally who prevailed upon the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to have him returned from his initial ill-judged deportation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matter of urgent public and national concern, namely, road safety on the N7 in the vicinity of the Curragh. Much needed cattle grids that are required to prevent livestock from straying on to the road have not been installed on some roads adjacent to the Curragh in spite of a commitment given in the 1993 N7 inquiry. Funding for these works must be provided by central Government immediately for the protection of the public and in the interests of animal welfare. Currently a <Col N="974"/>sheep farmer from the Curragh is in Portlaoise Prison because of a protest associated with the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy cannot add to the notice long since given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matter of urgent public and national concern, namely, the casemix incentivisation scheme of hospital funding introduced by the Department of Health and Children which, in allocating funds based on previous years&rsquo; casemix criteria, fails to take into account the unique service difficulties prevailing in certain hospitals, which will have the effect of forcing major hospital managements to process patients like statistics, deflecting them to smaller hospitals, which do not attract the same level of brownie points in terms of productivity, to maintain their own high casemix productivity levels, making vital decisions on purely financial grounds rather than on the basis of care or need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask under the terms of Standing Order 31 that this House be adjourned to debate an issue of national importance, public importance and importance to the T&aacute;naiste, namely, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform&rsquo;s continuing refusal to grant an amnesty to all overseas nationals who sought refuge in this country as minors and who have spent at least three years in Ireland, including, for example, the case of Olunkunle Eluhanla, who the Minister allowed to remain following the efforts of the Palmerstown community and particularly Pobalscoil Isolde, but has now made a decision to deport on seemingly, by any right-thinking member of society&rsquo;s view, spiteful grounds; and to discuss legislation that would introduce a balanced and fair policy for the treatment of internationals such as Kunle and his classmate, Tunde Omoniyi, who came here as children, who have roots here, have built friendships and, if allowed to stay, could make a positive contribution to Irish society and the economy. I call on the T&aacute;naiste to make a statement to clarify whether she agrees with her colleague&rsquo;s decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek leave to move a motion for the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matter, the sacking of a shop steward with the union Mandate from her position at Dunnes Stores in the Ashleaf centre in Crumlin for wearing a union badge on her store uniform, the company&rsquo;s subsequent refusal to attend a meeting about the disciplinary action because the worker was accompanied by her trade union official and the urgent necessity for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to intervene directly with Dunnes Stores to ensure the immediate reinstatement of this worker and to <Col N="975"/>make it clear to the company that such anti-trade union behaviour will not be tolerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of urgent national importance, namely, in light of the fact that Teagasc yesterday stated that vital elements of its advice to Government on the nitrates action plan was excluded from the final regulation and that the new regulation which is due to come into force on Wednesday next without guidelines being issued to farmers will leave them liable to a jail sentence of up to six months, there is now an immediate need for the Government to withdraw the current legislation and to provide for an implementable and workable framework.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>On the basis that the Order of Business will allow statements by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children on the loss of 10% of HSE capital expenditure of &euro;558 million for 2006, I withdraw my request under Standing Order 31.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Having considered the other matters raised, they are not in order under Standing Order 31.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to take No. 1, Competition (Amendment) Bill 2005 <i>[Seanad]</i>&mdash; Second Stage; No. 18<i>a</i>, statements to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, regarding the Vote for the Health Service Executive &mdash; it should read 2005-06 &mdash; to be taken&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Another mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it is not another mistake, it is a typing issue. The statements are to be taken at 2.40 p.m today and the order shall not resume thereafter.</P>
      <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the proceedings on No. 18<i>a</i> shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 50 minutes and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) subject to (ii), the statements shall be confined to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children and to the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and the Technical Group, who shall be called upon in that order, and shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; (ii) Members may share time; and (iii) immediately following the statements, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children shall take questions for a period not exceeding ten minutes. Private Members&rsquo; business shall be No. 45, motion re services directive, resumed, to be taken immediately after the Order of Business and to conclude after 90 minutes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is one proposal to be put to the House. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 18<i>a</i> agreed to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The leopard has not changed its spots and what happened yesterday is typical of this Government. Whether that relates to leaking tunnels, rails coming apart or money going astray, it is all small change in the Government&rsquo;s eyes. With regard to the proposed statements, why did the T&aacute;naiste not come into the House yesterday to make a statement? We are being asked to approve retrospectively the Appropriation Bill 2005, which the House passed but on which consent was not given for this practice.</P>
      <P Just="Left">After nine years of these parties in Government, we still do not know how many people work in the health service, how much they are paid or how money is spent. The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children promised that when the Health Service Executive was set up, it would result in a bright new world of effective accountability of the use of public money in the health services. However, we now find the HSE has driven a coach and four through these practices.</P>
      <P>During last November and December, the T&aacute;naiste will recall that I asked her whether she was aware of the difficulties the former health boards were having in meeting payments to suppliers and in regard to their cash flow. She denied knowledge of the HSE having such difficulties. I have been told that in December the shackles were taken off by the HSE and substantial amounts were paid into particular accounts for activities in which former health boards were involved. The T&aacute;naiste must answer questions on this.</P>
      <P>Prior to the statements being taken later, is she satisfied that financial controls and arrangements within the HSE are effective? Does the decision to make the chief executive officer the Accounting Officer need to be revisited? What is the breakdown between pay and non-pay items in the HSE? Finally, and most importantly, when did the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children and the Government become aware of the practice of the HSE using capital funding for current purposes? We need to know that now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It would appear the Government is determined to start the new year the way it finished the old one. There was a great deal of hope that the mismanagement, incompetence, waste and unwillingness to answer questions of last year would have gone out with the calendar year but we have begun on the same note this year. The Minister for Finance admitted he knew about this on 17 January, yet a schedule of business circulated to the House last week contained no reference to it. An amended schedule of business was circulated at midday yesterday and it contained no reference to it. At 4.28 p.m. yesterday the Minister for Finance by fax issued a state<Col N="977"/>ment with minimal information, 20 minutes before the matter was to be raised in the House.</P>
      <P>I have known the Minister for a long time and I would never have previously accused him of political cowardice and sleight of hand but that was what was engaged in yesterday, including a misuse of the Standing Order that permits personal statements in the House. I ask the Leas-Cheann Comhairle&rsquo;s esteemed advisers in front to put up Standing Order 43 in front of him. It provides for a personal statement &ldquo;that shall be brief, non-argumentative and strictly personal and shall not be such as would give cause to further debate or explanation&rdquo;. There was nothing personal about the statement yesterday; it was of the most fundamental political and public importance.</P>
      <P>This error would not be made by a first-year accountancy student. Such a student who could not distinguish between capital and current would not be allowed to continue his or her course. It appears nobody on the Government Front Bench read a bank statement. We had an explanation this morning that defied belief from somebody describing himself as chief finance officer of the HSE. One did not know whether the money was missing; the implication was he would find it again before St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day. I do not know the genealogy of the man in question but he should be put in control of the national finances because he does not seem to think the money is missing and, if it is, he will find it.</P>
      <P>It is not acceptable that the personal statement provision should be used in this fashion by the Minister for Finance to sneak in on an unsuspecting House and confess to this scale of cock-up by the Department of Health and Children, the HSE and the T&aacute;naiste, who is responsible as the political head of that Department. The time provided for the matter put to the House of ten minutes for party leaders to make a contribution and ten minutes for the combined Opposition to put questions to the T&aacute;naiste is entirely inadequate. She is perfectly capable of giving one reply that will take up the ten minutes. It is not a fair way to ventilate a subject such as this. The taxpayer will be appalled to learn the Government parties have embarked on a new year in which they intend to continue waste, lose and mismanage public money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>More time is needed for these statements than has been allocated to them. Whatever about the Minister for Finance coming into the House in a surprise, lightning strike to tell us about the demise of &euro;56 million, the time allocated equates to approximately &euro;1 million per minute to explain the loss of this money. That may seem like small change to some people but, for example, hospital staff in St. Ita&rsquo;s Hospital, Portrane, County Dublin, must contend with one hand basin for 24 patients in the male admissions <Col N="978"/>unit. These staff are instructed to be hygienic and to wash themselves to prevent the spread of MRSA. That highlights what this money could have been and should have been used for and more than 50 minutes is needed for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to explain what happened.</P>
      <P>The HSE was established amid a great fanfare to introduce greater control and accountability and less duplication of work. However, when cock-ups occur now, they are massive as a result of that change. A major investigation is needed, therefore, to get to the bottom of this because this system was not meant to go wrong in this manner. If it is going wrong, we need much more than 50 minutes to find out about it and to get to the bottom of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue is the inadequate time to address the seriousness of what is involved. It draws into question the approach of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, the procedures adopted by the HSE and the operation and management of the health services. This is against the backdrop of a depletion of services at critical hospital sites throughout the country, with communities totally disaffected from the governance and delivery of health care. Here we have the further example of not only the inefficiency but, as I have described, the shambolic approach of those entrusted to oversee and ensure oversight of health care delivery.</P>
      <P>Both the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance should come before the House in a more substantive way than the proposal for the T&aacute;naiste to take a ten-minute question and answer session. Where is the accountability in this? As is now the case with most of the parliamentary questions we submit to her, is it no longer her responsibility? She washes her hands of all responsibility in deflecting more than 45% of health related questions from the Opposition to the HSE as a further delaying mechanism. This is completely unacceptable. Will the T&aacute;naiste clarify whether the Minister for Finance is procedurally obliged to attain the approval of the House in this matter? Has that approval been sought? Was it secured yesterday? How do matters stand in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no difficulty in allocating more time for questions on this issue. I am more than happy to answer any questions Deputies have. Subject to agreement, I am pleased to take questions for half an hour, if that is in order. I wish, however, to put matters in perspective. At the start of 2005, the former health boards announced an overspend of more than &euro;200 million for the previous year and there was not a word about it in this House. We must put this issue in context.</P>
      <P>To answer Deputy Kenny, the chief executive officer of the HSE is that body&rsquo;s Accounting Officer. It is right that those with responsibility <Col N="979"/>for delivering services should also have responsibility for finances. We have seen through the health boards that it is not good management or practice that one group should be responsible for spending money and another charged with accounting for that to the Oireachtas. A good system has been put in place and I have total confidence in Professor Drumm and his team to deliver an effective health care system in line with the money the Oireachtas can make available in any one year.</P>
      <P>I propose we amend the Order of Business to provide for 30 minutes of questions after the initial statements from the spokespersons for the Opposition parties and the Technical Group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>When was the T&aacute;naiste first informed about this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Some two weeks ago, at approximately the same time as the Minister for Finance. I can let Deputy Kenny know the date later; it was the week before last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Was this the first time she was made aware of the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>During a meeting with Professor Drumm earlier that week, it appeared the revenue allocated equated to the revenue spent and that there was a surplus of &euro;56 million on the capital side. A day or two later, it emerged this may not be the case. As we know, Government accounting is extraordinarily complicated and the exact picture will not emerge until the final accounts are signed off by the end of March. The Minister for Finance said yesterday it now seems some &euro;56 million of capital funding may well have been spent as revenue. He felt obliged to inform the House of this and was right to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Procedurally, must the Minister for Finance come back to the House for approval?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I will deal with this in greater detail later. If the position indicated by the Minister is confirmed at the end of March, we must come forward with a Supplementary Estimate for that amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Arising from the PPARS debacle last year, information I requested under the freedom of information legislation indicated that the Department of Finance, in the middle of last year, notified the Department of Health and Children that this practice must stop. If the Department of Finance was aware of it in respect of the PPARS fiasco in the middle of last year and notified the Department and Health and Children at that time that it must stop, how was this allowed to happen? The Department of Finance was well aware that capital moneys were being used for current expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="980"/>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The freedom of information data supplied to me indicates the Department of Finance gave an instruction &mdash; or, at least, a direction &mdash; to the Department of Health and Children that this practice must stop. I will produce that evidence for the T&aacute;naiste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We must clarify the proposal on the Order of Business. I take it from what the T&aacute;naiste has said that the statements will be taken at 2.20 p.m. instead of 2.40 p.m., in other words, 20 minutes earlier than the original proposal, and that the time taken for questions shall be for a period not exceeding 30 minutes? Is that agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a difficulty in that the first round of speakers on Second Stage of the Competition (Amendment) Bill 2005 will now have insufficient time. My understanding was that extra time for this matter would be provided without impinging on the debate on that Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Question Time begins at 3.30 p.m. so the statements must commence at 2.20 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are precedents whereby Question Time is often interrupted by Private Notice Questions and the like. I cannot see why Question Time cannot start 15 minutes later if that is so ordered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the T&aacute;naiste clarify whether the Government will agree to the Minister for Finance accompanying her in answering questions on this matter? In his end of year statement, the Minister boasted about an underspend on Government balances of &euro;564 million on current spending. Yesterday, however, he confessed in a personal statement that &euro;56 million had gone AWOL.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter for the statements. I must put the proposal regarding the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste has a particular responsibility in this matter but the Minister for Finance has responsibility to answer questions in the context of his personal statement. Perhaps it requires Inspector Clouseau or Hercule Poirot to discover what happened to the &euro;56 million. The Minister for Finance has a critical role in this because he has oversight of Government spending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I must put the proposal. I ask the Deputy to resume her seat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>We have received completely different figures for underspends and overspends on current and capital figures.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="981"/>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the T&aacute;naiste be accompanied by the Minister for Finance when she comes into the House to answer questions on this fiasco?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair must put the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>If this happened in Uganda, we would be worried about a banana republic. It has not happened here before and we are entitled to answers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>To ensure we are clear on what it is the vote entails, I suggest the Whips meet briefly. The Government Whip can present an amended Order of Business when we have agreed it. I am sure there will be no difficulty in reaching agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to accept Deputy Stagg&rsquo;s suggestion. When it is agreed, I will return and outline the new proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Arising from the comments made yesterday in respect of random breath testing, the T&aacute;naiste is aware that prior to Christmas, we were informed such testing is unconstitutional. Yesterday, however, the Taoiseach said it would now be deemed to be legal. There seems to be some confusion about the information given to the Joint Committee on Transport yesterday by the Garda Commissioner. Will it be necessary to introduce legislation to give effect to random breath testing, which the Taoiseach now says is legal? If so, when is that legislation likely to be produced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The public and Members of this House were entirely bemused by yesterday&rsquo;s developments, where random breath testing is now apparently deemed consistent with the Constitution when, prior to Christmas, we were advised to the contrary. It begs the question whether it was necessary for the tragic carnage that has happened since Christmas to bring some urgency to the matter and to produce clarity of legal advice. It is an extraordinary development that on something so major we were advised to one effect prior to Christmas and to an entirely different effect when the matter was raised by Deputy Kenny yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>A pattern appears to be arising in the Department of Transport whereby two Bills have been announced which are not on the programme for Government. This is even more bizarre because we were told there is a constitutional problem in regard to random breath testing, yet we heard the chairman of the transport committee saying on the radio this morning that there was no difficulty all along and the garda&iacute; <Col N="982"/>could have carried out what is being proposed. We must hear the actual legal evidence on the route the Government is proposing because other views have been expressed, supposedly on authoritative advice, yet we are now on a third strand of a course of action. The seriousness of the matter requires absolute clarity so the issue will not get bogged down in some court challenge and that there will be some effect on reducing or eliminating the carnage on our roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be a need for legislation. The Government is anxious to provide the Garda with all the powers required to deal with this matter. There were and are constitutional issues. However, there is a way to deal with the matter which the Attorney General has advised will be within the spirit of the Constitution. The Minister for Transport will bring forward legislation as quickly as possible. He will make further information available later on how that might happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a pity he did not deal with the matter seven years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it not true that random breath testing may be implemented by the garda&iacute; because it must await legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>There must be legal advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>That is an entirely different story from the spin yesterday. We now learn that nothing has changed since before Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The advice of the Attorney General has changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Chairman of the transport committee was misinformed. Given the Government&rsquo;s recent performance on legislation, when will the legislation be brought before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Attorney General has now advised the Minister for Transport that it will be possible to bring in a form of legislation to give this power to the Garda, but the legislation must be passed first. It is the Minister&rsquo;s wish to have this done before the summer of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>Will the T&aacute;naiste clarify her Department and the Government&rsquo;s intent in regard to the Bill described once again as the nurses and midwives Bill, which in the previous legislative programme was entitled the nurses Bill, but previous to that it was known as the nurses and midwives Bill. I welcome the fuller title which is now restored. Will she confirm that the Bill, which has been promised since 2002, and expected to be published in 2006, will be pub<Col N="983"/>lished in the current year or during the lifetime of this D&aacute;il?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I can confirm that the Bill will be published this year. While significant advances have been made in the legislation, the Department of Health and Children has a huge legislative agenda and clearly some issues have taken priority. The Bill will be published, as will the Medical Council legislation. In advance of the legislation, I have used the Irish Medicines Board legislation to give prescribing rights to nurses. It was intended it would await the nurses Bill but we have gone ahead in advance of it. The Bill will be published and, I hope, debated in the House this year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>

	<P>A question on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It applies to promised legislation because she explained that some of her popularity was due to the fact that she was able to do away with hospital waiting lists in three months. In congratulating her, the T&aacute;naiste might ask for some advice in that regard.</P>
      <P>Can I ask about promised legislation, which is a related matter? We have heard much debate about the health repayment scheme Bill which, a year after the court case, is up for publication. Has the T&aacute;naiste been in communication verbally and in writing with the Minister for Education and Science in regard to the Regina Coeli and Morning Star mother and baby unit? That issue is still unresolved. The T&aacute;naiste said her Department funded the hostel and, therefore, it should come under the redress qualification provisions.</P>

	<P>Throughout Ireland there is much discussion of work permits and labour migration. By limiting the numbers of available workers we would be putting barriers to enterprise creation in Ireland in the future. To do so would put our economy into slowdown mode, moving irreversibly into inflation, higher wages, higher costs, lack of competitiveness, recession, loss of jobs and emigration. It would mean a cut-back in all the advances that we have made in health, education and social welfare.</P>
        <P>It is because the number of people in paying jobs in Ireland has increased from 1 million to 2 million that this country has prospered over the past ten years. To continue that growth in the economy we will need 50,000 to 60,000 new workers each year, and that is accepted by every sane person in this country. With this economy being close to full employment, those workers can only come from abroad.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We who agree that immigration is essential to future prosperity and a good thing in itself need to convince our voters that it is not a threat. The Labour Party has obviously done some polling on issues that might affect voting patterns. According to the latest <i>The Irish Times </i>TNS MRBI poll, and I particularly want to compliment Mark Brannock, the chief political correspondent for his excellent commentary, most voters see the presence of foreign workers here as good for the Irish economy and Irish society. At the same time the majority believe there are already enough or too many foreign workers here. Those two views do not hold together, so to speak.</P><Col N="992"/>
        <P>Deputy Rabbitte has decided for purely party political gain to react to voter perceptions no matter how much they could affect the economy and be bad for the country. I agree that it is not unrealistic to believe that if tens of thousands of skilled workers used to working in their home countries for far less than the Irish rates come here to work that increased supply has the potential to push down wages but it has not worked out that way. Deputy Rabbitte has been scaremongering on this issue. There is no empirical evidence to show that wages and working conditions will be worsened. In fact the figures point in the exact opposite direction.</P>
        <P>The unions in this case have taken a very responsible attitude to the situation. They have not gone along with the ramblings of Deputy Rabbitte on work permits. They have asked for better inspection and enforcement of work standards. I agree with that, as I believe everybody does. I encourage workers, particularly those in low paid jobs, to join the unions because the current leadership is fabulous. By doing so they would be well represented in respect of their long-term interest, as opposed to short-term political expediency, as put out by the Labour Party. Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s suggestion that workers from accession countries are displacing Irish workers by putting them out of jobs does not have any credibility, given that we almost have full employment in our economy. Ireland&rsquo;s unemployment rate is the lowest in Europe. I accept that we need to be wary, not in the services sector but in the exposed trade and manufacturing sector where the pain is being felt. Deputies on the Labour Party benches argued last night that too few inspectors are charged with enforcing work standards.</P>

	<P>The services directive will bring some benefits to the well educated and well trained workforce in Ireland. This country&rsquo;s services exports have increased by 167% over the past six years. Although Ireland is a very small country, it is the source of 2.2% of the world&rsquo;s total services exports, which is a fabulous feat. We are punching well above our weight in the services sector. When the services directive, which needs to be amended, is put in place, it will be of great benefit to Ireland. An independent analysis that was conducted on behalf of Forf&aacute;s has estimated that the services directive will be worth approximately &euro;450 million to Ireland. As politicians, we need to bring about a better Ireland rather than pandering to immediate political expediency, as has been seen to be done in recent times.</P>
        <P>I propose to share the rest of my time with Deputies Fiona O&rsquo;Malley, Andrews, O&rsquo;Connor and Curran.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In the few minutes available to me, I would like to respond directly to the Technical Group&rsquo;s motion and to discuss the wider issue of work permits, which was raised recently by the Labour Party. I agree with the section of the Opposition motion which states that services are crucial to the European Internal Market because they account for between 60% and 70% of economic activity in the European Union of 25 member states. I support the proposition that we need to promote social solidarity as a core value among EU citizens. For that reason, the Labour Party&rsquo;s call for the Government to roll back on its decision to give all the citizens of the EU of 25 member states equality of status as Europeans is thoroughly offensive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>There was no such call.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The services directive aims to facilitate opportunity and to ease the manner in which business is conducted throughout the European market. Bureaucracy and red tape have impeded and hampered the ease of access to a market of 450 million people. Just as Ireland has thrived under the EU principle of the free movement of goods and people, the free movement of services will offer enormous opportunities to this island. As the Minister pointed out, Ireland depends on trade because it is an island nation that exports 85% of what it produces. Last night&rsquo;s contributions failed to address the problems that the services directive is <Col N="994"/>designed to solve. The directive is good for Irish businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises. As it is pro-consumer, it will increase consumer confidence in cross-border services.</P>
        <P>I hope Opposition Deputies support these efforts. If they do, they should have highlighted that support in their motion. The original motion refers to trade union fears about labour standards and the country of origin principle, but it neglects to mention that such concerns are shared and have been expressed by the Government. Ireland broadly supports the country of origin principle, but the support of the Progressive Democrats and the Government is subject to further detailed technical work on its application. Much more work needs to be done on all aspects of the directive before it is ready for adoption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>A lot done, more to do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>That has not been acknowledged by the Opposition, however, deliberately or otherwise.</P>
        <P>When the Minister challenged the House last night to demonstrate that the services directive, if implemented, would legitimise the treatment of the Gama Construction workers, he was met with hushed silence. He pointed out that the problems in question arose in the absence of the proposed directive. It seems that a welcome but modest level of honesty is finally creeping into the debate on this issue. An article in last weekend&rsquo;s <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> referred to the acknowledgment by trade unions that the proposed directive, which incorporates the country of origin principle, expressly does not allow, for example, Latvians to be paid Latvian wages for working in Ireland. It has been clearly stated that such practice is already prohibited by European law in the form of the posting of workers directive and by Irish law in the form of the Protection of Employees Acts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Opposition Deputies have referred to well-founded fears that the services directive will be used by some employers to undermine established rates of pay, as well as safe and reasonable working conditions. However, no consideration has been given to Ireland&rsquo;s comprehensive body of employment rights legislation which protects employees against arbitrary behaviour by employers, for example, in the area of health and safety.</P>
        <P>Members of the Opposition, especially Labour Party Deputies, have shown their brass neck by lecturing people &mdash; I refer especially to Progressive Democrats Members &mdash; on issues such as the minimum wage. I am sure they will not like to be reminded that the former Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, and his Minister of State colleague in the rainbow Government, Deputy Rabbitte, sat idly by whereas the next Minister to have responsibility in that sector, the current T&aacute;naiste, introduced this country&rsquo;s first national minimum wage. The Members <Col N="995"/>opposite are not in a position to lecture anyone on the issue of workers&rsquo; rights.</P>
        <P>Fears have been expressed about downward pressure on wages as a result of the proposed directive. Such fears are based on the approximately twofold difference between the average industrial wage in Ireland, which is approximately &euro;30,000, and the annualised minimum wage rate. The Opposition&rsquo;s lack of understanding is again evident in this instance. If the directive is not put in place, it will continue to be the case that anyone can establish a business in Ireland and offer to pay workers the national minimum wage. Reports indicate that very few people are prepared to work under such conditions for any significant length of time. The reality is that employers in Ireland find themselves having to pay higher, rather than lower, wages. The general thrust of the Technical Group&rsquo;s motion is that the proposed directive will lead to exploitation or social dumping. If that were the case, the directive would not be supported by the Government. It is as simple as that.</P>
        <P>There has been an unfortunate use of language during the recent wider debate on this issue. I have noted the emergence of a viewpoint that favours looking after the so-called natives. When Irish people looked for work abroad in the past, they were confronted with signs saying &ldquo;Irish need not apply&rdquo;. I hope people are not suggesting that signs saying &ldquo;Only Irish need apply&rdquo; should be displayed in Ireland today.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party has suggested the imposition of work permits for EU workers as a solution to fears about lower pay and conditions. As my party colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, has pointed out, such a suggestion illustrates &ldquo;questionable political judgement, little or no grasp of economics and wilful ignorance of European law&rdquo;. I accept that the general concern about pay and conditions was reflected in a recent opinion poll. The root of that concern is the idea that foreign workers are willing to work for lesser pay and conditions than Irish workers, thereby replacing or displacing them. The Labour Party must explain how the imposition of work permits on migrant workers will address this issue in an effective manner.</P>
        <P>As we consider whether a problem exists to the extent suggested by the Labour Party, we should bear in mind that we are at full employment. That party&rsquo;s recent proposals cement the view that its overall policy framework could threaten Ireland&rsquo;s economic prosperity. The economy needs migrant workers to allow it to continue to thrive. Research indicates that we will have to meet a skills shortage of 30,000 workers per year. If the Labour Party advocates putting a cap on the job opportunities of migrant workers by stopping many of them from working here, many more people will start to believe the Labour Party is a danger to this country&rsquo;s economic prosperity.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to start by describing the dangerous position that exists in Ireland in terms of our attitude to the European Union. We are on the brink of becoming a net contributor and people are beginning to get anxious about the implications and question reflectively anything coming from the European Union. We are as wedded to it as we used to be because by 2013, the next round of financial perspectives, we know we will be in the position of having to contribute to the European Union for the first time.</P>
        <P>The other issue relates to agricultural subsidies and support for Irish farmers and is beginning to cause the crystallisation of people&rsquo;s views. If there was a referendum on any issue in respect of the European Union, for example, on the constitution, we would not have the same core support as we had for the European Union. There is also the great bogey man that people raise all the time, the issue of immigration from the accession states and the future accession states of Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey. These are the reasons we are at a cross-roads in regard to our relationship with the European Union.</P>
        <P>As politicians and leaders it is our responsibility to take a stand on where we think we should be in regard to the European Union and to try to encourage people to think along those lines and not to appeal to their more baser instincts. The phrase &ldquo;race to the bottom&rdquo; has become misunderstood. It means nothing to many. It is the kind of jargon that is used to feed into people&rsquo;s fears. Frequently it is stated that people are prisoners in their own homes in respect of crime. Anybody who uses that kind of jargon does not know what they are talking about. It is clear they are appealing to base instincts. Similarly, anybody who uses the phrase &ldquo;race to the bottom&rdquo; in respect of these issues is equally using jargon and does not know what he or she is talking about.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>European trade union federation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>If &ldquo;race to the bottom&rdquo; means anything in the context of the current debate it means political parties flying kites that appeal to the baser instincts of ordinary people, excluding people from the Irish workforce and rolling back on the basic rights contained in the Treaty of Rome, not to mention the more recent directives on workers&rsquo; freedom of movement. That is what <Col N="997"/>is wrong about the debate the Labour Party has initiated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with Deputy Ardagh, although I have no evidence, and I have a suspicion that the Labour Party has had focus groups looking at these issues. I wonder about not just those brave activists in the Labour Party who wrote to <i>The Irish Times</i> describing the policy as disgraceful and not in the least wedded to traditional Labour Party policies but there are more within the left wing movement, never mind the Labour Party, who are not pleased about this. What does Deputy Quinn, head of the European movement, think of all this? I wonder whether the Labour Party is fully behind this issue and it is a question it will have to answer.</P>
        <P>On the matter of the services directives we are questioning the basic provisions at the core of the entire European principle because we are at this cross-roads and people are seeking ways to improve their political position and to draw some electoral dividend. It is evident they have lost the argument on the economy and every other argument and are looking for some other hook on which to hang their debates in the future. There is no doubt that Ireland will be at the front of the queue in the liberalisation of services. We have the most open economy and rely almost entirely on services for our GNP. While there are vested interests who will lose out and suffer there is a much greater body, who are unknown at this time and may still be in school or college and cannot form themselves into an angry protest outside Leinster House, who will not thank us in ten or 20 years&rsquo; time when we take short-term decisions for short-term gain, rather than looking to the long term and realising it is future Irish workers who will benefit from our braver decision making at this time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>My colleague from Clondalkin and I are sharing time. I thank you for the opportunity to speak briefly on this motion. I compliment the Independent group on its initiative in this regard because it gives us an opportunity to contribute to the debate. It is a good start to the business. I am glad nothing has changed and everybody is calm and we are going about our business. I said on another occasion that there is no need to be too frenetic because there are at least 500 days to the next general election. Therefore, let us be calm about this business and deal with the issues of concern to people.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to listen to the debate from all sides because there is no doubt it is generating much interest and concern. Already this morning the Labour Party and my good friend, Deputy Rabbitte, have got enough mention so I will not mention them. Like other colleagues I was interested in the correspondence to <i>The Irish Times. </i>It is interesting to note &mdash; I do not say this in a flippant way &mdash; that in other parties there is much debate and even friction on some issues. Perhaps that is a healthy sign of democracy and <Col N="998"/>politics. There is no doubt that people have diverse views on this subject. This morning we received correspondence from groups expressing concerns about the issue. Sometimes I say I was not born a Deputy and used to be quite normal and have a trade union background which may not compare to that of some illustrious colleagues in the House.</P>
        <P>I know from trade union contacts and those who have stopped me on the streets in Tallaght and elsewhere that people are talking about this issue. There is much in this directive which could have consequences and we should be mindful of the different views. I had the opportunity on a number of occasions in recent weeks, including yesterday, to speak with my party colleague, Deputy Eoin Ryan, MEP, who has received much correspondence on this issue. In the build up to the debate on St. Valentine&rsquo;s Day in February there is still much to be said. I remind the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Killeen, who has impressed us by his work in the Department since assuming office, there are differing views on this issue. I am open to listening to what people have to say. Trade unionists say there are good things in this directive but there are also issues about which we should be careful. Other colleagues have made the point about racing to the bottom. In all our constituencies there are challenges in that regard and we should be careful about how we deal with them as well as the issues that could cause problems and issues that verge on racism. There is a responsibility on those of us in parliament to listen to the views from all sides and to represent them.</P>
        <P>A rational debate is something everyone would welcome. As we proceed I hope that will be the case. It is important to state that the Government strongly favours a single market in services. We understand it would be in Ireland&rsquo;s interests in terms of employment prospects, trade opportunities, consumer choice and welfare enhancement. The draft directive is due to be discussed at the European Parliament. I hope colleagues from all sides liaise, as I have done in recent weeks, with our MEPs. In my case I have spoken with our Dublin representative, Deputy Eoin Ryan, MEP, who is taking a particular interest in the matter and has attended the SIPTU conference which dealt with the matter. He is due in Dublin to attend the ICTU conference this weekend. I expect he will take the same opportunity of listening to what people have to say and try to progress the issues.</P>
        <P>I will digress for a moment to mention that in my recent encounters with trade unionists, in addition to this issue, they referred to the forthcoming production of the film on Connolly, in which they are taking a particular interest, as I am sure are all colleagues. I hope the Minister of State will note our particular support in that regard. Trade unionists throughout the country have asked that this endeavour would be brought <Col N="999"/>to the attention of the Government. It is a most worthwhile project that should be supported.</P>
        <P>I look forward to hearing the remainder of the debate on this Private Members&rsquo; motion. It is important that we are rational about it. There are points of view to be made on all sides. However, we should acknowledge that concerns exist and these should be addressed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this debate. The EU services directive is most important from an Irish perspective. I have listened to Opposition Members raise queries and fears, but we should view the directive positively as it will provide Ireland with increased opportunities to trade in services across the EU. I regret that much of the debate got side-tracked over Labour Party policy and the work permits issue. The debate on work permits is in many ways a red herring. Even if they were to be introduced, the time is limited. We had a work permit system a number of years ago but it did not address the issues about which people have genuine concerns in terms of labour welfare and so forth. The issue of work permits is irrelevant in this debate.</P>
        <P>Ireland is the 14th largest <i>per capita</i> exporter of services in the world. Its share of services has increased significantly in the past decade, from under 0.4% in 1993-94 to 2.2% in 2004. That is a very significant figure for a small economy such as Ireland&rsquo;s. It is because of the export of services that this directive is of particular importance to this country. It is worth bearing in mind that at this stage the directive is only in draft form. It is not finalised and there is a substantial number of amendments to be made.</P>
        <P>In most member states, services account for up to 70% of GNP and employment. They also account for the majority of new jobs created in Ireland in recent years and they are likely to account for the majority of new jobs created in the years to come. Studies have shown that the creation of a genuine single market for services would result in significant export opportunities for Irish service providers and would give Irish consumers access to a wider variety of services at more competitive prices. The overall effect would be to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and hence increase the potential market and employment levels of Irish service providers. It is worth noting that this is a two-way street. People are concerned about service providers coming to Ireland but this would also increase competition in the market here. The arrival of Bank of Scotland to the Irish market is a good example of this.</P>
        <P>We should bear in mind that in 2004, the latest year for which figures are available, the level of Irish service exports was 2.2%. This is a significant figure for a small economy. Economic analysis undertaken by Forf&aacute;s suggests that the implementation of this directive would result in potential gains to Ireland in the order of &euro;450 mil<Col N="1000"/>lion. The reason the directive is important is that many small and medium sized companies are burdened with red tape, bureaucracy and so forth, which makes it very difficult to trade abroad.</P>
        <P>When debating the services directive, the issue that most frequently comes to light is the country of origin principle. With a number of Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues I had detailed discussions on this issue before Christmas with the trade union leadership. It had genuine concerns on specific points, especially the country of origin principle, but was not opposed to the directive. It gave examples of countries such as Latvia and elsewhere that have considerably different wages and conditions and the negative impact this could have if that system were transferred to Ireland. We listened carefully to what was said and made these views known to our Members of the European Parliament.</P>
        <P>We are concerned to ensure that employment conditions and standards in this country are maintained with the passing of the directive. That is absolutely crucial and we are committed to it. We want the directive to be implemented because it will enhance our export of services but we will maintain standards of employment and conditions in this country. We currently have a specific derogation from the country of origin principle in the posting of workers directive. I would like to see the draft directive changed so that instead of having a derogation, the country of origin principle would be changed in such a way as to ensure that our domestic arrangements would always have precedence.</P>
        <P>I would like to see the amendment reflect this specifically, rather than having to rely on the derogation from the country of origin principle for the posting of workers directive. This derogation is currently in effect and any employee sent here to deliver a service would have to work under Irish labour conditions, including the minimum wage, annual leave, working time and any other agreement. It is important that our standards are maintained. Admittedly, at present this is by means of derogation. The amendments must reflect where we are coming from in regard to this point. We do not want to depend on derogation. We must maintain standards for workers but we must equally recognise that the passing of this directive offers significant opportunities for Irish workers and employers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very pleased to have an opportunity to deal with this most important issue. I begin by genuinely and heartily commending the members of the Technical Group for placing the services directive on the agenda of this House. Too often, European directives in particular are not debated here in advance of their completion and the view of this national Parliament is not taken into account before we are presented with the final product. It is difficult for committees in this House to follow all of the European agenda but it is an important job of work and one we must do.</P><Col N="1001"/>
        <P>I welcome the previous two contributions from the Government benches that were not only reasoned but reasonable, unlike the two contributions prior to that from the Government benches from Deputies Ardagh and Fiona O&rsquo;Malley who sought to be political and mischievous in misrepresenting a point of view. That is not helpful because, by and large, it would be possible to build consensus around these issues in this House. There is not a huge divergence of view at the core of what we want although there are philosophical differences. Perhaps the Progressive Democrats agenda is such that it might&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Despite the statement of Deputy Ardagh, it does not advocate that we would resile from the position that I supported at the point of the enlargement of the European Union that we would introduce a work permit system for the new member states. It does not say that. It states that in order to avoid that we need to take measures to regulate our own economy.</P>
        <P>I will outline the measures we want to take and see who would reject them; the development and extension of the registered employment agreements model, which gives binding status to agreements reached at sectoral and employment level to prevent the undermining of agreed wage levels in sectoral employments; better resourcing of the labour inspectorate and more effective enforcement and prosecution of offences. There is a consensus that the enforcement of our regime is wholly inadequate. I suggest to the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, that the health and safety inspectorate of more than 100 people be merged with the 21 people we now have inspecting labour law, instead of building up a parallel system. They could be trained in so that we can immediately have a force which might be up to the job of looking after a workforce of 2 million and thousands of workplaces, so we can keep the standards we <Col N="1002"/>want. I do not think we will have a division on these matters.</P>
        <P>As for the targeted enforcement and revenue inspections of sub-contractor and agency worker issues in the construction sector, who would object to that &mdash; or to the insistence that contractors working for local authorities and public bodies meet minimum labour standards in order to prevent a repeat of the Gama situation?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Reform of the existing work permit system so that it becomes a green card system, which was promised by the leader of the Progressive Democrats when she was the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which does not bind workers to particular employers, would hardly create huge differences between us. Perhaps it might, because the Employment Permits Bill before us creates a two-tier system, which is wrong. At the meeting of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business this morning we heard the view of the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, which said the two-tier system is wrong.</P>
        <P>As for confirmation of the rights of self-employed persons who enter into contracts personally to execute any work of labour to join a trade union and to engage in collective bargaining, people are in favour of that, to judge from what I heard this morning. Deputy Ardagh thinks the trade unions are &ldquo;magnificent&rdquo;, so I am sure he would not object. We also seem to have a consensus on advocating significant change in the services directive. The final proposal is that we should sign the international convention on the rights of migrant workers and enshrine its protection in our domestic laws.</P>
        <P>These comprise the significant proposals in the Labour Party document, before people lose the run of themselves and get carried away. These are important issues which must be put in place to protect the working environment, rates of pay and working conditions for people in our economy, and to have regard for a changing set of economic circumstances in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The services directive has at last got the focus and attention it merits. As outlined in the Technical Group motion, and by many Deputies, this directive, if unamended, poses a substantial threat not only to our economy but to the standards enjoyed by Irish workers in it. That is an inescapable fact. It is not some pie in the sky analysis but the analysis of the social democratic and progressive parties across Europe, and of the European trade union movement.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Although the originator of the directive, former Commissioner Bolkestein, has left the stage, his successor, Commissioner McCreevy, has proven more determined and more right-wing in pursuing this proposal. The European Trade Union Confederation has said it is gravely concerned with some of the main provisions of this directive. It warns that if implemented, the directive &ldquo;could seriously erode workers&rsquo; rights and protection and damage the supply of essential services like health care to European citi<Col N="1003"/>zens&rdquo;. The confederation rightly argues that removing unjustified barriers, which is the stated reason for having a directive &mdash; a principle on which we could have consensus &mdash; should not mean that justified barriers also have to be abolished. The confederation says there is a need to lay down minimum or common standards for the principal issues in order to safeguard the public interest, workers&rsquo; rights and protection.</P>
        <P>The principle should be that we have a set of common standards operating across the European Union, but they should not be the minimum standards. If that were the basis for instituting international law across the European Union, we would have no environmental standards, or the environmental standards of the worst environmental performer in the European Union, and accept that as being all right. That is not the basis on which European law is developed. We have set high standards which must be applied throughout the European Union, and not drag everyone down to the lowest level, which seems to be implicit in what is proposed in this directive. It is quite unacceptable that we would take that route. In any other issue we have looked at, it seems to boil down to saying that if it is good enough from where one comes from, it is good enough for this country too. If that were accepted, we would have no common protection for consumers or consumer goods, no common entitlement to equal pay for men and women and no environmental protection laws at all.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party has no difficulty with the idea that there should be freedom to provide services across European frontiers. However, that must be in accordance with common and agreed future standards rather than tolerating that the current worst standard becomes the acceptable norm throughout the European Union. That is the principle at the core of this matter.</P>
        <P>Of most concern is the country of origin principle. Under this principle, service provided in any member state would be subject only to the law of the company&rsquo;s country of origin and not subject to the potentially stricter national legislation where the service is delivered. Various regimes could co-exist. One would not have a common high standard. In effect, the law governing terms and conditions could vary from person to person or from place to place. That would be a difficult and unacceptable situation and very difficult to enforce.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister said last night, and other Deputies have reiterated today, that this was always taken care of by means of the posting of a workers directive. We have been assured that such posting will prevent the services directive from undermining terms and conditions of employment in this jurisdiction. That is a security on which the Minister has relied, and he has said we should not get ourselves &ldquo;worked up&rdquo; about it.</P><Col N="1004"/>
        <P>I will make three points about the posting of workers directive. First, significant weaknesses, both in its provisions and its overall implementation, have emerged, and I ask the Minister of State to address this issue honestly. Over the past two years, the European Parliament has twice called on the Commission to come forward with proposals to revise the posting of workers directive to address these very weaknesses. Second, member states do not have a general right under the posting of workers directive to insist that all statutory employment conditions and collective agreements negotiated by the social partners in any particular country must be respected. In July 2003, in a report on the implementation of the posting of workers directive at national level, the Commission said:</P>
        <P LI="1">It should be pointed out that the directive in no way permits member states to extend all their legislative provisions and/or collective agreements governing terms and conditions of employment to workers posted on their territory.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That quote comes from page 11 of COM 2003, 458, final. Accordingly, this is not the &ldquo;get out of jail&rdquo; card which Members in this House have presented it to be. We must be alert to such issues and not give assurances unless we are certain they are watertight regarding such a fundamental issue.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Finally, despite the assurances of Commissioner McCreevy, the draft services directive undermines a number of important provisions of the posting of workers directive which are essential to ensure that national labour provisions are respected. It would abolish the current requirements for the service provider to obtain prior authorisation from and to make formal declaration to the host country before providing any service in this country or in any host country. It would abolish the need to send all labour documentation normally held in its head office to the place of posting. It would abolish the requirement to designate a representative with whom the host country can liaise. I am informed this is of crucial importance in countries like Sweden and Denmark. In October 2004, the European Court of Justice ruled that the effective protection of workers in the construction industry can require the holding of documents on site. This would also be undermined by the services directive should it proceed in its current form. I make those points before people say in a blas&eacute; manner that all is well. I hope that the Minister of State will mention this in his contribution.</P>
        <P>I wish to deal with the public services dimension of the proposed services directive. It is unacceptable for social services to be treated as purely commercial services. By definition they are a critical part of the social protection and welfare systems of each member state. I am aware that the European Commissioner, Mr. McCreevy, <Col N="1005"/>said in the European Parliament last March that the Commission &ldquo;endorsed the suggestion that health and social services of general interest be excluded from the proposal.&rdquo; This is positive and indicates movement; I hope it will come to pass. I am confident that the socialist group in the European Parliament, the PES, together with other progressive forces will bring about substantial changes when the draft is considered in coming weeks. I understand more than 1,000 amendments have been tabled for discussion on 14 February. For once this House is considering such a proposal in good time and perhaps its views can be taken into account.</P>
        <P>Let me return to the principle. There seem to be two views in the general debate about how our employment market should develop. One view, with which some on the Government benches have associated themselves, is that employers should have free access to an unlimited supply of cheap labour. I heard the same argument when I was arguing from this side of the House for the protection of community employment, instituted by Deputy Quinn when he was Minister for Enterprise and Employment. A mindset exists that those involved in community employment, particularly when we had strong growth in the economy and good employment rates, should be doing menial jobs in the workforce and that whatever social good they were doing in community employment was a matter of indifference to them. They were regarded as cheap workers who should be doing work in the economy.</P>
        <P>The other view is that we must defend what has taken 20, 30 or 40 years to build up, which is the European social model and social protection. I know words like &ldquo;protection&rdquo; grate with some on the Government benches. Protecting a model of quality is appropriate. Perhaps if I regauge it in the context protecting the quality of the environment, those on the Government benches might be more attuned to it. Quality is good when it comes to protection. Protection of wage rates and decent standards must be carefully addressed by this House, not in a headlong rush almost on an ideological basis to say that, because free movement of goods and services is an underlying principle of the European Union, standards are of a secondary or even an indifferent nature.</P>
        <P>It is not the future model for Ireland to base our next generation of jobs on the minimum wage. I commend the T&aacute;naiste for introducing the minimum wage when she was Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. It was a new, good and positive development. While I wish we had done it, I commend her for it. There is a danger that what was put in as a floor could become a ceiling.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Some employers now believe the minimum wage is a decent rate of pay and it is acceptable. I deal with individual cases in which migrant workers in particular are employed on the minimum wage, which is regarded as acceptable. I frequently hear the justification that people are being paid the minimum wage, that we have social protection even in terms of this services directive because employers must pay the minimum rate. Deputy Fiona O&rsquo;Malley is right that we have not got there yet. However, if we embark on a future in which the minimum wage is no longer the floor but the ceiling or is regarded as a decent and acceptable wage to be paid across the economy, we have no good future for workers, either migrant or national.</P>
        <P>I welcome migrant workers to this country. I have spent most of the past 20 years dealing with them. I have defended every category of them. I have defended the notion of asylum seekers when Government Deputies in my constituency and others had different views on these matters. I put my record up for anybody to examine in this regard. We will need migrants not only to build our economy, but also to enrich our society as they have done in the past decade. This is the way we should go forward.</P>
        <P>We have much more to do. We need to provide for integration and we need to understand and respect cultural difference. We must do this on a consensual basis. While it is possible to point fingers in many directions, I hope that the debate that has now ignited will not degenerate into some political slanging match, but will be constructed on how to create a society and economy that will respect all its workers, where all will be treated equally and well, and where our future is at the highest level of scale of payment and conditions, not dragging ourselves down to the lowest. I believe that, unamended, this directive would seriously damage that vision for a proper, healthy, prosperous and integrated future for our country.</P>

	<P>Sinn F&eacute;in supports the motion tabled by the Independent Deputies in the Technical Group. As the Government clearly did not intend allowing time for this matter, we welcome the opportunity to debate this important EU services directive. We join the Independent Deputies in urging Members of this House to mandate the Government to reject the directive at the Council of Ministers. If passed the directive would have profound impact on the lives of workers and service users across Ireland and the EU. It would also have potentially grave implications for the environment. The directive is symptomatic of the general shift to the right and <Col N="1007"/>the adoption of the neo-liberal agenda of privatisation and deregulation.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in belongs to the Confederal Group of the European United Left-Nordic Green Left, GUE-NGL, in the European Parliament. Our group has been the most united on the services directive and has strongly opposed it from the beginning. In doing so we have worked alongside many organisations that have called for it to be withdrawn. Sinn F&eacute;in members who attended a major conference of political parties, trade unions and NGOs in Brussels were accompanied by representatives of trade unions from Ireland, SIPTU, UNISON and the Independent Workers Union among them.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Morgan said last night, in common with the European Trade Union Confederation, Sinn F&eacute;in believes that neither the current text nor the report from the Internal Market Committee secures high level quality of services and social progress in the EU. We recognise that the Internal Market Committee has proposed some important improvements to the Commission&rsquo;s draft, for example, stating that the objective of the directive is not to deal with labour law, collective agreements and industrial action. It is accepted that some public services, health in particular, should be excluded from the scope of the directive.</P>
        <P>We will strive to uphold those improvements but the Internal Market Committee, IMC, has left the Commission&rsquo;s proposal largely intact. The original proposal has not been withdrawn or significantly changed. We remain opposed to the directive and will vote to reject it in the European Parliament in February. We encourage others to do so. However, we will support any amendments that address our key concerns, among them that the country of origin principle remains.</P>
        <P>Some who have recognised that there is strong opposition to this principle are now calling it something else, such as the freedom to provide services. The groups that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael belong to have changed the wording, which does not alter the threat posed any more than changing the name of Windscale to Sellafield. The country of origin principle will lead to social dumping or the encouragement of downward regulatory competition between member states. The removal of the principle in its entirety is a prerequisite for support for any proposal in respect of the services directive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In response to a parliamentary question I tabled to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in December 2005 regarding the Government&rsquo;s position on the country of origin principle, the Minister made it crystal clear that the Government supports it. He went so far as to argue that the introduction of the principle is necessary to give legislative effect to the treaty right of free movement of services. I contest this. The county of origin principle has no treaty basis. The Government&rsquo;s chosen interpretation of the <Col N="1008"/>right to free movement of services as implying that member states cannot introduce their own democratically determined laws and regulations governing the provision of services is a massive and disproportionate leap.</P>
        <P>The country of origin principle is in direct conflict with other articles of the treaty relating to subsidiarity, workers&rsquo; rights and the freedom to provide services. For example, Article 39 of the consolidated version of the Treaty Establishing the European Community states: &ldquo;To stay in a member state for the purpose of employment in accordance with the provisions governing the employment of nationals of that state laid down by law, regulation or administrative action&rdquo;. Article 50 states: &ldquo;Without prejudice to the provisions of the chapter relating to the right of establishment, the person providing a service may, in order to do so, temporarily pursue his activity in the state where the service is provided, under the same conditions as are imposed by that state on its own nationals.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The main thrust of the services directive is still one of deregulation, including the elimination of authorisation schemes, monitoring procedures and the provisions aimed at ensuring quality and access. In all sectors, the host member state must be enabled to monitor and supervise all service providers operating in its jurisdiction. The ability to regulate service provision in the public interest is an essential tool that elected authorities must be allowed to keep.</P>
        <P>The deregulatory nature of this directive in areas other than employment conditions is an aspect that has been unfortunately absent from the debate. The directive severely limits the ability of elected authorities to use laws, regulations and administrative requirements to ensure that the services are accessible, continuous and of high quality. This will have detrimental consequences for society and, in particular, vulnerable groups. For example, Greece has no equivalent to Ireland&rsquo;s Equal Status Act 2000. That is, Greece has no anti-discrimination laws governing the provision of services. Therefore, under the country of origin principle, Greek service providers can operate discriminatory practices in the course of their business in this country, which would have a negative impact on the social and economic interests of, for example, people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>The EU and this Government must not be allowed to enforce a single market in services without harmonising social and environmental guarantees upwards across all member states. In areas where harmonisation exists, this directive prohibits member states from demanding standards above the bare minimum. It is important to note that this constitutes a break from the manner in which harmonisation usually operates in the EU. Normally, harmonisation relates to the minimum acceptable standard to which members states are free and encouraged to approve. Under <Col N="1009"/>the current draft of this directive, the opposite is the case.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in believes that all services of general interest &mdash; EU-speak for public services, economic or non-economic &mdash; should be excluded from the scope of the directive. While the simple exclusion of services of general economic interest alone, as proposed by some, would constitute an improvement, it would be inadequate protection given the absence of a clear and sufficient definition of such services.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Morgan explained, language relating to labour law, collective bargaining and industrial relations is ambiguous in the Internal Market Committee&rsquo;s report. Stronger and unambiguous language ensuring that the directive in no way interferes with labour law, collective bargaining and industrial relations in member states and explicitly refers to the right to take industrial action is needed.</P>
        <P>If this Government truly wishes to protect workers, service users and the environment, it will reject this directive. I urge the Government at this stage to take the opportunity to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Ar dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire, ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a gabh&aacute;il leis na Teachta&iacute; Neamhsple&aacute;cha as ucht seans a thabhairt d&uacute;inn an &aacute;bhar t&aacute;bhachtach seo a phl&eacute; agus c&uacute;pla tuaraim&iacute; a nocht&uacute;. It is regrettable that, when one examines the coverage of this debate to date, it has been very lame in that it has covered the Government position to a significant extent. Even the commentaries do not seem to give adequate opportunity for critical analysis of what the services directive is proposing, whether it is amended or otherwise.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The issue will come back to haunt the House unless we consider in advance the effects it will have and the conditions in which it will operate. Freedom of movement of goods is a well established principle but it is one that has grown out of a profound taking for granted, I could say, of the way in which those goods are to be transported. In some quarters it is selectively seen that, if one is free to move goods, one is free, as it were, to prevent people moving around as they follow the opportunities for labour and employment, try to improve their lot or escape exploitation if it affects them. The debate must focus there. One cannot have free movement of goods if one does not have free movement of people. If one will be restrictive about how people move around, it is valid that one should be conditional about how the goods move.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition, account must be taken of the fact that it is not feasible &mdash; perhaps it is on paper &mdash; to strip away all barriers. For example, an RTE programme last night was hosted by Mr. Vincent Browne. He listened to views from people who had been or lived in India. In that country, while it appeared that people were working in decent jobs, their conditions were appalling. They were effectively living in tents. Rent was so high that they could not afford to have a roof over their <Col N="1010"/>heads. The only reason they did not die in those conditions was that the weather was sufficiently warm to survive outdoors and still have a so-called decent job. That is a symptom of the type of challenges we are facing. As many homeless people will testify, we do not have the climate where one could have a decent job and sleep in a tent. If one is to take away barriers we will have conditions that obtain in India. We must consider what we are asking people to accept.</P>
        <P>If globalisation is the agenda, we must realise this trend was built on mass transportation. We have grown so accustomed to transportation that it is now seen as a commodity. In turn, this raises the question of how we will cope without fossil fuels as it is recognised that peak oil production has been reached.</P>
        <P>Climate change will affect food production as well as weather. World grain yields have been falling over the past four years and we have the lowest grain reserves in 30 years. Every 1% rise in temperature creates a 10% drop in world grain yield. This is an issue that must be taken in the context of this directive, which does not simply deal with accounting or the rules on how work is carried out. If one reads Lester R. Brown&rsquo;s book <i>Outgrowing the Earth: The Food Security Challenge in an Age of Falling Water Tables and Rising Temperatures</i>, one realises that if water is essential for life and we are taking oil for granted, we must seriously consider localisation rather than globalisation as our objective. If we do not do this we are sentencing many more people to poverty, including ourselves.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Listening to the debate last night and the contribution of Government speakers today I, like Deputy Hogan, find it difficult to understand why the Government has submitted an amendment to the Independents&rsquo; motion. The Government&rsquo;s argument is that this draft services directive will not be the same as the final directive. I do not accept that argument. This Government is philosophically inclined towards the intent behind the services directive. Any changes it will seek to make, as a member of the European Council of Ministers, will be cosmetic. The Minister outlined 300 observations on the draft directive but would not specify how many had come from Ireland. The Minister of State referred to six areas where the Government sought further information on the directive, rather than raising objections, reservations or concerns.</P>
        <P>One of the areas where the Government sought only further information was the country of origin principle. If the Minister and the Government seek to be taken seriously on this subject they must listen to what Members have stated. The country of origin principle needs to be removed from the services directive. Engaging in some minuet with Commission officials and Commissioner McCreevy will not address the concerns this directive raises because the country <Col N="1011"/>of origin principle is not acceptable to Irish people.</P>
        <P>Though there are real concerns about employment, displacement of jobs and undercutting wages, not enough emphasis has been placed on services that would be made more freely available to private interests if this directive was passed in its current form. The directive in its draft state is similar to what it will be if Commissioner McCreevy and the Commission succeed. Employment risks, as a consequence of importing workers from another country to provide services, are not the only concern. We must consider the type of services that can or might be provided under this directive, such as health and education services. I refer to these because of the previous ministerial experience of the Minster for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
        <P>We must also consider the provision of services of important natural resources, such as water. If it takes a <i>carte blanche</i> approach to the provision of important social services, as well as the employment implications of this directive, the Government is flying in the face of reality, and applying the philosophical intent of Commissioner McCreevy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Health services are not included in this directive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the direction the EU is taking on services and competition. This must be seen as an indication of how the EU is thinking on this matter and how Commissioner McCreevy is thinking. This Government is <i>ad idem</i> with that philosophy. If the Minister is not prepared to address the concerns, we do not have a Government that will ensure the draft services directive is not passed in its current state and we must depend on other governments and other social movements within Europe to ensure the directive does not come into effect and that the necessary changes are made.</P>
        <P>The Opposition, and my party in particular, is not confident these changes will be sought by this Government. As the Government structures its policies, it takes an approach of damning the workers. The underlying message is that profit must be sought to justify the structure of the Government&rsquo;s economic policies. We will not support this approach and will continue to question and harry the Government until it reflects the sentiment that exists on this side of the House and in the country in general.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to respond to the debate on this very important subject. The Government recognises that recent events, such as the Irish Ferries dispute, have caused concern that there might be some link between that dispute and the attempt by the European Union to create a single market in <Col N="1012"/>services. I wish to emphasise on behalf of the Government that there is not. The services directive would not permit social dumping or the exploitation of workers and it would not be supported by the Government if it did.</P>
        <P>The broader debate on migrant workers and the growing numbers of these workers in modern Ireland overshadows our debate. There are two important aspects to this wider debate on migrant workers: fears among some people that Ireland is being swamped by non-national workers and the possibility of these workers displacing their Irish counterparts; and the need to protect the rights, pay and conditions of these workers.</P>
        <P>The recent opinion poll has confirmed what many of us know, namely, that the public has concerns about this issue. I welcome the contribution of Deputy Howlin to this debate and I have listened carefully to Deputy Rabbitte of the Labour Party. In a reckless and opportunistic way, Deputy Rabbitte had tapped into those concerns, fuelling them to the exclusion of explaining or contextualising them. Rather than providing leadership on this issue he is, by his utterances, inciting fears of the perceived threat of EU migrant workers among some sections of our population.</P>
        <P>In a reference to Polish workers who are making a substantial contribution to our economic development he reminds us that &ldquo;[t]here are 40 million or so Poles after all&rdquo;. The clear message is that these Poles could come here and take our jobs. His comments run counter to the notion of a social Europe, a Union of openness and equality that his party has supported since we joined the European Union.</P>
        <P>It is most unfortunate that the leader of a Labour Party, for the first time in the history of the Labour Party in Ireland, would pursue such a conservative, anti-European and unenlightened policy on immigration. Deputy Rabbitte bases his arguments regarding the displacement of Irish workers on anecdotal evidence. It is a well established fact that sound public policy can never be based on foundations as flimsy as anecdotal evidence. Comments on the issue of migrant workers and in particular on the issue of the possible displacement of Irish workers must be measured and accurate. As I said, there is understandable anxiety among the public concerning the potential impact of migrant workers on Irish jobs and wages. However, such concerns do not appear to be substantially grounded or to have a concrete basis in fact. On the contrary, there appears to be little evidence to warrant widespread concern. The facts are that since our employment market was opened up to migrant workers from the accession states in 2004, our unemployment rate has actually fallen.</P>
        <P>All economic forecasts appear to agree that Ireland&rsquo;s economy is strong and continues to grow. Our employment rates still grow at a phenomenal rate and look likely to do so for the foreseeable future. There is growth in all areas of <Col N="1013"/>employment, including women returning to the workplace and the employment of older people. The evidence available suggests that the migratory pattern of workers is directly related to work available. The numbers of migrant workers travelling to Sweden, which has a similar open policy to ours, has dramatically fallen in line with the slow down in its economic growth.</P>
        <P>There are issues we need to address in this debate: the need for the Government to engage with the social partners on the rights, pay and conditions of all workers, Irish and non-Irish, employed in this country; the need to continue to enforce our employment law in a growing labour market and the need to continue a policy of upskilling our workforce.</P>
        <P>I welcome Archbishop Martin&rsquo;s thoughtful contribution to this wider debate, which I know will continue for some time. I acknowledge the important data compiled by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, on the numbers of migrant workers here in Ireland. Their work on the forthcoming census will be helpful in clarifying the make-up of the population of modern Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is much confusion surrounding this debate and it is interesting to note Commissioner Vladimir Spidla&rsquo;s comments in <i>The Irish Times</i> today that the states which imposed restrictions on the ten new EU states when they joined the EU in May 2004 had seen &ldquo;an increase in undeclared work, bogus self-employed work, dishonest sub-contracting and other such undesirable consequences&rdquo;, according to preliminary conclusions of studies undertaken by the Commission.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I say to Deputy Rabbitte, let us conduct this debate in a measured, constructive and honest way rather than in a divisive, disingenuous and destructive manner. Returning to the services directive, it is clear from the contributions that there are concerns about this proposal, which are shared by the Government. As the Minister made clear in his remarks, Ireland has sought improvements to the original proposal published by the Commission and, indeed, we still have a great many concerns that we want to see examined before we can give our support to the proposal.</P>

	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Catherine Murphy, Gregory and Joe Higgins.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle and I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this debate. I congratulate Deputies Harkin and Higgins on the hard work they did on this directive. The services directive is a misguided attempt to facilitate trade within the European Union. While its creators claim to have economic interests in mind, they failed to fully explore and evaluate the potential risks, such as the removal of safeguards against exploitation of workers. I believe the essential point to be made is that we must put the interests of people before the <Col N="1014"/>interests of money and preserving an economic boom that frankly carries no guarantees of continuing and has the potential of putting the poorest members of our society such as migrant workers in an ever-increasing state of vulnerability. We must not think like that. We must think of people foremost.</P>
        <P>The services directive puts at risk the workers on which our economic success depends. We must not allow unprincipled employers the opportunity to relocate their businesses or workers into poorer EU states to take advantage of lower standards of employee rights and access to quality social services or to come here to take advantage of workers in Ireland whether they are local or migrant.</P>
        <P>Concerns have been raised across the EU on the dangerous impacts of including social services in this directive. Dr. Beverley Malone, the general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, the largest professional union of nursing in the world, stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Nurses are extremely concerned about the potential consequences of including healthcare in this directive. The systems of regulation and monitoring of quality standards in this country are designed to ensure that patients receive well administered and high quality care. There is a real danger that there could be a race to the bottom in terms of standards, with unscrupulous companies setting up in countries with the least rigorous regulation in order to then maximise profits elsewhere. We urge the Government to exclude health and social care from the directive.</P>
        <P FLI="0">She also stated that the directive should be thrown out. The services directive not only threatens the preservation of migrant interests, it also threatens the security of Irish workers whose interests are put at risk by allowing low standards of safety and inequitable minimum wages such as those that would be allowed under the country of origin principle of the services directive.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Acting Chairman and will conclude by asking that the directive be withdrawn.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">If the Lisbon Agenda is the origin of the services directive, it is impossible to reconcile aspects of that directive with Lisbon. When launching the review of the Lisbon Agenda, the European Commission stated: &ldquo;By modernising labour markets and social protection systems, it will help people seize the opportunities created by international competition, technological advances and changing population patterns while protecting the most vulnerable in society.&rdquo; Commissioner McCreevy has responsibility for this directive and in a BBC interview <Col N="1015"/>he stated, &ldquo;If you consider that the EU has been growing at a snail&rsquo;s pace over the past number of years, then it&rsquo;s obvious that we must do something pretty dramatic to create economic activity&rdquo;. He went on to state: &ldquo;Seventy per cent of all the EUs GDP is from services, therefore it doesn&rsquo;t take a great mathematician to say we should concentrate [on that].&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The problem is that the Lisbon strategy was never exclusively an economic agenda. The Commission stated it was underpinned by a set of principles based on three mutually dependent pillars, which each supplement one another, namely, the economic, social and environmental pillars. The stated aim is to develop the most competitive knowledge economy, a society with a high rate of employment and social protection and a healthy environment. The project is described as creating a Europe of excellence.</P>
        <P>The services directive has components that may see more people at work but at the cost of lower wages and regulatory standards. There is a real fear that the minimum wage will end up being the maximum wage. The Irish Ferries dispute opened the eyes of the public to that possibility. Criticism of the directive by environmental groups, anti-poverty groups, European health care organisations and trade unions show the diverse range of concerns. The environmental network draws attention to the fact that the 25 member states have different laws and policies and highlights the complications the country of origin principle creates for the environmental authorities, which will be required to operate in 25 or more countries to control the activities of their service providers.</P>
        <P>The trade union movements seem to favour an internal market for services, but have serious concerns about the country of origin principle. They argue the directive would lead to legal chaos among member states and would make control of monitoring impossible. One aspect they drew attention to is the need for clear definitions of a worker and a self-employed person. The present approach opens the door to fictional self-employment, which in most cases amounts to social dumping. The anti-poverty networks, which represent those most vulnerable, state the services directive, even as amended by the internal committee, would create damaging fractions within national regulatory social service systems.</P>
        <P>The aim is not to place barriers in the way of cross-border provision of services but to protect the users of social services, which is essential to contributing to social cohesion. It appears Commissioner McCreevy draws his vision for this directive not from the EU social model but from the United States of America. The question is whether that is from where the Government draws its vision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyGregory"><NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
	<P>This motion, calling for the rejection of the services directive as currently pro<Col N="1016"/>posed and in particular the country of origin principle, is one of the most timely and vital motions to have come before this D&aacute;il. There is no doubt that no matter what the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, stated this morning, there is widespread public concern among Irish workers and trade unions that if this draft of the services directive or anything approximating to it were introduced, it would pose the single gravest threat to established and hard-won rates of pay and labour standards in this country in recent times. There is no point in the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, fooling the House or attempting to mislead it as he did last night by referring to the posting of workers directive. What he stated is simply not true. The posting of workers directive will only allow for a minimum wage and it will not allow this Government or any Irish Government to insist on implementing collective agreements. It will not deal with issues such as training of service providers or educational qualifications. The posting of workers directive is not the panacea for all ills and it will not and cannot deal adequately with the country of origin principle. Hence, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, should not mislead the workers of this country or the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Independent Members join with the European Trade Union Confederation to demand an end to ambiguity in this directive. We are not prepared to accept anything less than a clear commitment, in unambiguous and much stronger language, that labour law, collective bargaining and the right to take industrial action will be fully protected. In addition, this State must be entitled to impose supervisory measures on all services provided within it, regardless of their country of origin, because without such an entitlement, the end result would be unfair competition and lowering of standards. Moreover, services of general needs, such as water supply and social services must be excluded from any future directive. These are basic demands, as is the demand that the minimum wage must not become the norm or the means to undermine trade union rates of pay for a range of services.</P>
        <P>I reject the Government&rsquo;s amendment. It is as ambiguous as the directive which it defends, and nowhere does it mention rates of pay in Ireland. They are to be sacrificed to enable employers and business interests to exploit the services market in Europe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I warmly commend my colleagues in the Independent section of the Technical Group on this timely motion. The principles which it lays down are crystal clear, namely, that no directive should be tolerated which would in any way undermine the principles of a decent wage for workers, decent conditions and trade union rights in the workplace.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment came into the House yesterday and <Col N="1017"/>stated that &ldquo;unfortunately, much confusion surrounds this directive because of its complexity&rdquo;, implying that its opponents are a bunch of dul am&uacute;s, too stupid to understand its crucial implications because of its complexity. Time and again the Minister has criticised the directive&rsquo;s opponents without dealing in any way with the nub of their reservations, which have been outlined clearly and excellently in the debate by both Members and outside groups.</P>
        <P>However, the Minister undermined the directive in his speech. He was forced to so do because he knows the concern that exists among workers throughout Europe. He stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">We [the Government] are as concerned as anyone else is in this House ... with issues of standards, especially employment standards. This is why, for anyone who cares to look at the latest draft of the directive, one will see more than 300 footnotes of reservations, many of them from Ireland.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Why would there be 300 reservations, many dealing with the erosion of workers&rsquo; standards, if this document was not a massive attack on those standards to begin with? In this instance, the Minister has admitted the case. Furthermore, he stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">We can have a very agitated debate about the country of origin principle, although this would amount to a great deal of wasted energy and hot air. All the indications are ... that the Commission intends to amend significantly that aspect of the directive.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In other words, the Minister concedes the point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>He does. Why should it be grievously and seriously amended if it already protected workers&rsquo; rights?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>While the Minister has come out with much political bluff, he has been forced to concede that the directive must be fundamentally changed if it is to be acceptable to European workers. A short time ago, Deputy Fiona O&rsquo;Malley stated that &ldquo;a welcome but modest level of honesty is finally creeping into the debate on this issue&rdquo;. While her comment was aimed at the Opposition, perhaps she should have directed her remarks towards her Minister.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The European Commission is pushing a right wing neo-liberal agenda and wishes to drive down <Col N="1018"/>wages and conditions. The proof can be seen in Commissioner McCreevy&rsquo;s attitude towards the Vaxholm Laval case in Sweden where he clearly stands with the exploiter against the Swedish trade unions who are trying to protect wages and conditions of migrant workers operating in Sweden. Workers in the European Union cannot rely on the Government to protect their rights. They must rely on their own power and organisation to fight a relentless drive by the major corporations to drive down wages and conditions to maximise profits. In recent years, we have seen many struggles by working people in Europe in this respect.</P>
        <P>As far as Irish workers are concerned, I vehemently disagree with the idea floated by the leader of the Labour Party, namely, that a new regime of work permits is the way to protect workers&rsquo; rights.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind Members that the biggest scandal of exploitation of migrant labour in the history of the State &mdash; the Gama case &mdash; was carried out under the regime of work permits. Members have also witnessed many other examples during that time. Naturally, the Government&rsquo;s attack on the Labour Party leader has been completely hypocritical.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>While we need a strengthening of inspectors and laws protecting workers&rsquo; rights, we especially need the wider labour movement and the trade union movement to launch a militant campaign to expose and isolate bosses who would exploit either migrant or Irish workers. We have a swathe of low-paid Irish workers who are being hugely exploited in our society. An energetic and imaginative campaign of organising the unorganised workers, be they migrants or Irish-born, is how we will build a strong united movement of the working class in this country. That is the only real answer to the attempts now being made by the European Commission and by governments throughout Europe which are supported by the Government.</P>

	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that on 8 November last, I announced that the Government had decided to revoke the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order in its entirety. This decision can only be implemented by means of an Act of the Oireachtas. Thus, the revocation of the groceries order is one of the principal purposes of this Bill. I also announced on 8 November that I intended to bring forward changes to the Competition Act 2002 to deal with certain practices in the grocery trade, including resale price maintenance, unfair discrimination, advertising allowances and what is termed &ldquo;hello money&rdquo;. These matters are also addressed in the Bill. I welcome that we have been able to bring forward this Bill speedily because any element of uncertainty regarding the regulatory regime and its enforcement is detrimental not only to the public interest but also to the principle of better regulation.</P>
      <P>Before I explain in detail the structure and scope of the Competition (Amendment) Bill, I will speak about the background to it. The groceries order has been with us since 1956 and has been subject to periodic review since then. In 1987, the order was amended to introduce a ban on grocery retailers selling products below their net invoice price and, since that time, it has been the subject of intense debate. Trade representatives and business interests defended the order on the grounds that it provided a level playing pitch and a stable business environment that enabled the smallest suppliers and retailers to survive alongside the major international multiple operators. On the other hand, those representing the interests of consumers, including the Competition Authority and, more recently, the new National Consumer Agency, have argued strongly for the removal of the order on the basis that it was anti-competitive and acted against the interests of consumers. Other independent groups, such as the competition and mergers review group in 2000, also recommended that the order be repealed on competition grounds.</P>
      <P>In March 2004, almost 12 months ago, the Consumer Strategy Group, CSG, made a series of recommendations for the development of a new national consumer policy in Ireland. It recommended the repeal of the groceries order in its entirety on the basis that it was not a ban on below-cost selling. According to the CSG, the order operated as a ban on selling below net invoice price and, in so doing, kept the prices of grocery goods higher than they otherwise might be. It is fair to say there was little consensus around this view and supporters of the order continued to oppose its removal.</P>
      <P>Against this background of opposing viewpoints, I decided to engage in a public consul<Col N="1024"/>tation process to ascertain the detailed views of all those who might have an interest in the matter. I was concerned to ensure we had a structured debate on the future of the order. I also wanted to ensure there was as much hard evidence as possible on the impact the order was having on a critical sector of the economy. I was concerned to collate the views not only of retailers and consumers but also of suppliers, manufacturers, producers and others for whom the grocery trade is their very lifeblood. Where specialist economic expertise was required to assist in assessing the 600 or so submissions received, my Department ensured this was available through one of the country&rsquo;s largest universities. Legal advice on issues arising was available through the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>My Department&rsquo;s resulting report on the consultation process and its review of the groceries order was published in early November last. This report amounted to one of the most comprehensive reviews of the order in the past 15 years or so. It detailed the order&rsquo;s history and analysed its legal structure, examined changes in the structure of the grocery trade in the period since 1987, analysed the impact on prices and inflation and compared trends in that regard with those in other European countries. It also looked at the regulatory regimes throughout Europe and further afield, and examined the situation in the United Kingdom where no ban on below-cost selling exists. The evidence, argumentation, analysis, conclusions and recommendations set out in the report are the basis for the changes proposed in this Bill. It is appropriate, therefore, that I outline briefly some of its key findings.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The issue that surprises most people when examining the findings in the report is that the groceries order did not provide the type of protection that many thought it did, for either suppliers or small independent retailers. One of the most important findings is that the order never operated as a ban on below-cost selling but rather as a ban on selling below net invoice price. The difference is critical for a number of reasons. In the first instance, the Irish grocery trade operates on the basis of substantial discounts and rebates paid to retailers, which are never placed on the invoice. These discounts were negotiated between retailers and their suppliers in a highly secretive, arbitrary and discriminatory manner. Retailers were free to pressurise suppliers into providing higher discounts and thus any protection afforded to suppliers was limited.</P>
      <P>As these discounts and rebates were never placed on the invoice in the first place, they could not be passed on to the consumers in the form of lower prices and so became part of the retailer&rsquo;s profit margin. In practice, by specifying a value for the goods on the invoice, suppliers were free to determine the price the retailers could then charge consumers for those same goods. Retailers could be confident there was a minimum price below which the competition would not sell and <Col N="1025"/>were thus protected, not from unfair competition, but from all competition. It is little wonder the trade has fought so hard and so long to keep the groceries order in place. What sector of the economy would not give its right arm for that type of protection?</P>
      <P>It has been argued that one of the greatest benefits of the order was that it prohibited predatory pricing in the grocery trade. That is simply not true. It makes no attempt to define cost price and, for that reason, was simply incapable of addressing the issue of predatory pricing, which is all about selling below cost price. The term &ldquo;net invoice price&rdquo;, which is used in the order, is found to have no economic rationale. It was no more than an administrative convenience. This is extraordinary given the impact the order had on the trade and on consumer welfare generally. Thus, one of the greatest so-called benefits of the groceries order has been shown to be nothing more than an illusion.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Other findings in the report are just as damning. It had been argued that the H. Williams Group, which went out of business in the 1980s, was a victim of predatory pricing and that the groceries order had been introduced as a direct result of that company&rsquo;s closure and as a means of protecting smaller retailers from the power of the multiples. This argument ignores the fact that the H. Williams Group was itself a multiple. It is clear from media reports, contributions made to the Oireachtas at the time and from later evidence given to the Restrictive Practices Commission that the closure of the H. Williams Group was as much the result of its weak financial position as it was of any price war. Moreover, the groceries order was made some months before the company went out of business.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In the 15 years after the 1987 order came into being, there was a decline of some 20% in the number of grocery stores. Almost 2,500 stores had closed by 2002. In the meantime, the market became more concentrated as a result of the significant growth of the symbol groups, the Spars, Centras and so on. The order was not protecting the small independent retailers and was not preventing market concentration. Our grocery market is more concentrated than the market in Britain where there is no groceries order.</P>
      <P>Since the mid-1990s, the rate of food inflation in Ireland has been three times that in the United Kingdom and almost twice the EU average. Supporters of the order said this was the result of the higher cost of doing business in Ireland. Why then is the rate of inflation in the clothing sector virtually identical to that in the United Kingdom? That is not easily explained. The most obvious explanation may well be the correct one, that the Irish grocery trade is protected from competition.</P>
      <P>We have been told that if we get rid of the groceries order, we will end up like the United Kingdom, where it is alleged some 70% of towns and villages have no shop. The report clearly demonstrates this statistic has no basis in fact. <Col N="1026"/>Access to groceries in the United Kingdom is shown to be excellent. Nearly 90% of rural households in England live within 4 km of a petrol station, most of which have a convenience store attached. Almost 80% of rural households live within 4 km of a supermarket.</P>
      <P>The ghost town Britain report, about which we heard so much during the debate on the order, is found to argue that the price of fresh meat and vegetables in edge-of-town supermarkets is often higher than in local, independently owned outlets. Ghost-town Britain is an anti-globalisation argument which has nothing to do with below-cost selling of groceries.</P>
      <P>It is against the background of these findings that I bring the Competition (Amendment) Bill before the House. In addition to revoking the Groceries Order, the Bill proposes to amend the Competition Act 2002 to deal with practices such as unfair discrimination, advertising allowances and what is termed &ldquo;hello money&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>By way of background, I should explain that the Competition Act 2002 prohibits anti-competitive behaviour in the economy generally. The Act is enforced by the Competition Authority. Prohibitions in the Act are divided into two categories. Section 4 prohibits agreements and concerted practices that have the effect of distorting competition. The undertakings participating in such activity do not have to be dominant for their activity or conduct to be captured by the provisions of section 4. Section 5 prohibits similar unilateral conduct, where no agreement or concerted practice is necessary, on the part of dominant undertakings.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendments contained in the Competition (Amendment) Bill 2005 is to strengthen the existing provisions of the 2002 Act by prohibiting certain unilateral conduct on the part of non-dominant undertakings in the grocery trade. These are practices which it is feared might emerge following revocation of the groceries order and which might not be captured by either section 4 of the 2002 Act or section 5 because they are not the conduct of a dominant undertaking.</P>
      <P>Section 1 inserts new sections into the 2002 Act. Section 15A includes new definitions. Grocery goods are defined as food and drink for human consumption, including alcohol but excluding anything sold in a restaurant or bar. This definition will cover the vast bulk of products sold in conventional grocery stores. A grocery goods undertaking is defined as any undertaking engaged in the production, supply or distribution of grocery goods. A retailer is defined as anyone who sells grocery goods to the public.</P>
      <P>Section 15B(1) prohibits resale price maintenance in regard to the supply of grocery goods. Resale price maintenance is the practice whereby manufacturers or suppliers specify the minimum prices at which their goods may be resold. This practice was prohibited by section 3 of the grocer<Col N="1027"/>ies order. Notwithstanding this, the provisions of the order preventing sale below invoice price legitimised the practice, a contradiction which my Department&rsquo;s report suggested had the potential to bring the Statute Book into disrepute. This section simply restates a prohibition that has been around since 1958.</P>
      <P>Section 15B(2) is designed to prohibit unfair discrimination in regard to the supply of grocery goods. This means that a supplier cannot offer preferential terms to one buyer over another when the transactions involved are equivalent in nature. This simple provision replaces the hugely convoluted and ineffective provisions in the groceries order that did not operate as intended and allowed discrimination into the trade by means of secretive and arbitrary payment of off-invoice discounts. The language used in section 15B(2) is based on language already in section 4 of the 2002 Act.</P>
      <P>Section 15B(3) prevents an undertaking from forcing another to pay for the advertising or display of grocery goods. Article 18 of the groceries order prevented the payment of such advertising allowances in all cases. This Bill takes a slightly different approach by preventing any undertaking from being forced into making such payments. This would not prevent collaborative advertising arrangements which are mutually beneficial to the participants and which promote competition by bringing the availability of grocery goods to the attention of consumers.</P>
      <P>Section 15B(4) prohibits a retailer from forcing a supplier to pay &ldquo;hello money&rdquo;. This is the practice whereby a retailer demands a payment from a supplier before agreeing to stock that supplier&rsquo;s products. As in Article 18 of the groceries order, the circumstances in which the practice will be prohibited include on the opening of a new store, an extension to an existing store or a change of ownership of a store. However, this Bill seeks to amend a serious flaw in the order by specifying a period of time, 60 days, during which the prohibition applies.</P>
      <P>Section 15B(5) replicates language already used in section 4 of the 2002 Act and states that the conduct described is only prohibited when it has the object or effect of preventing, restricting or distorting competition in the grocery trade, either in the State or in any part of the State.</P>
      <P>Section 15C provides a right of action for any party aggrieved by prohibited conduct. Such a right allows the party to apply to the Circuit Court or the High Court for injunctive relief and damages, including exemplary damages. The Competition Authority will have a right of action under this section. That completes the new part being added to the Competition Act.</P>
      <P>Section 2 applies section 30 of the Competition Act 2002 in respect of the right of action specified under section 15C of the Bill which I have already outlined. Specifically, it applies section 30(4)<i>(b) </i>of the 2002 Act which does not allow the auth<Col N="1028"/>ority to delegate the power to initiate legal proceedings to a member of the authority or a member of staff of the authority.</P>
      <P>Section 3 applies section 45 of the Competition Act 2002, which contains provisions in respect of authorised officers of the Competition Authority and their warrants of appointment.</P>
      <P>Section 4(1) of the Bill then revokes the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order 1987. Subsections (2) to (4), inclusive, apply standard interpretation provisions. Such provisions are also part of the new Interpretation Act that come into force on 1 January next. They are replicated here for avoidance of doubt.</P>
      <P>Section 5 contains further repeal provisions in respect of the statutes listed in the Schedule to the Bill. These statutes are confirming Acts in respect of orders made under the former Restrictive Practices Acts, which are now redundant. Section 6 contains standard provisions in regard to Short Title, collective citation and commencement.</P>
      <P>There is no provision in the Bill to prohibit predatory pricing for the simple reason that such conduct is already prohibited by section 5 of the Competition Act 2002, which outlaws abuse of dominance. I have received a large number of representations claiming that the current law on predatory pricing is not strong enough and that there is a need to prohibit predatory pricing by non-dominant retailers. It has also been claimed that no large Irish retailer would be deemed to be dominant and that all such retailers would be free to engage in predatory pricing without fear of legal restriction.</P>
      <P>These assertions are incorrect in a number of ways. Predatory pricing by a non-dominant firm is a contradiction in terms. Attempting to prohibit predatory pricing by a non-dominant retailer would mean applying a definition of predatory pricing in the grocery trade that is different to the definition that applies in all other sectors of the economy, different to the definition enshrined in international case law and different to the definition applying in most other jurisdictions. It would also introduce a level of protection into the grocery trade that is not available in other sectors, which is unjustified and which would prevent pro-competitive low pricing strategies that benefit consumers. That is precisely what happened with the groceries order.</P>
      <P>Predatory pricing is clearly illegal under Irish competition law and it is punishable by fines of up to &euro;4 million or 10% of turnover. The Competition Act 2002 is based on Articles 81 and 82 of the European Community treaty. There is a strong body of case law which shows that these provisions can be and are used to prohibit and punish predatory pricing. Furthermore, dominance does not have to be assessed on a national basis. An individual supermarket outlet in a rural town, whether part of a multiple, could be considered dominant within the meaning of the Com<Col N="1029"/>petition Act 2002, and thus prosecuted if it engaged in predatory pricing.</P>
      <P>The United Kingdom, in a major inquiry into the potential takeover of Safeway supermarkets in 2003, found grocery markets to be essentially local. Indeed, competition concerns in the retail sector are often assessed in terms of their effects on the local area. The law on predatory pricing is stronger and broader than the words written in the legislative text. Departing from European Union case law and attempting to define precisely predatory pricing in legislation would seriously weaken and undermine competition law in Ireland and harm consumers more than it would help them.</P>
      <P Just="Left">This is a short but very important Bill. The groceries order has been comprehensively analysed and subjected to detailed legal and economic investigation. That analysis and investigation has shown that the order has not served the purpose for which it was intended and it did not protect many participants in the trade as was claimed. The order was anti-competitive and acted against the interests of consumers. The grocery business is about more than mere grocery stores. It is about all those involved in the production and distribution chain, right back to the factory floor and the farm gate. It is also about consumers. The reality is that for industry to survive and prosper in a global economy, it must be able to compete with the best. To that end, it is not just right and proper that we guarantee fair competition, it is essential that we do so. However, we will not do industry any favours by continuing to protect it from all competition on domestic markets. That is what the groceries order did and that is the type of protection some critics of this Bill would like to see remain in place.</P>
      <P>Our competition laws are not designed to protect competitors, they are designed to protect competition. There is a world of difference between the two. We must ensure that competition laws are kept under review and enforced vigorously when needed. That is why the Government has more than doubled the resources available to the Competition Authority in the past five years. It is the reason, moreover, we have provided the authority with an additional &euro;750,000 in 2006 to boost its investigative and enforcement capacity. It is the reason we brought forward the Competition (Amendment) Bill 2005.</P>
      <P>I will be happy to expand on any of the foregoing and to clarify and answer any questions Deputies may have during Committee Stage. In the meantime, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Competition (Amendment) Bill 2005. Having listened to the Minister&rsquo;s speech, I notice he did not draw any conclusions about the impact this legislation would have on consumer prices, similar to the advice and submissions he received. The clear submissions, on which he relied mainly to make <Col N="1030"/>these changes, were from the Competition Authority and the Consumer Strategy Group. The latter group said that if the Minister revoked the groceries order and made the necessary changes to the Competition Act, we would have a 9% reduction in prices almost immediately. However, a few months later the chairperson of the Consumer Strategy Group decided that perhaps that figure was a little high and indicated a figure of 3% and said that in 12 months&rsquo; time that may happen. The second issue was that Dr. Fingleton, the former chairman of the Competition Authority, said that consumers could expect to have up to &euro;500 million put back in their pockets if the groceries order was revoked. I note the Minister ignored all this in his contribution. He was wise to do so.</P>

	<P>It is with a deep sense of irony that this House debates this Bill. The Government has done almost nothing to improve the lot of our consumers. It has presided over an appalling lack of competition in every area from energy to insurance, from transport to communications. It is only since the Government was stung by a TV series broadcast last August that it is attempting to pull the wool over the eyes of an electorate whereby it wants to ignore the fact that it imposed no fewer than 41 stealth taxes in the past three and a half years. The Minister is attempting to reinvent himself as the champion of consumers in the context of this legislation, but already this attempt at political deception will fail.</P>
      <P>This Bill is short in terms of words on pages and on benefit to consumers. The Minister can be assured that because of our total opposition to predatory pricing and market dominance, we will not support the Bill in its current form. It will become clear to him from his colleagues on the backbenches and to Fianna F&aacute;il and PD Deputies who support the concentration of the market, particularly the grocery market, in the hands of the few, particularly the hands of the multiples, that in the long run consumers will experience less choice and competition and, ultimately, higher prices. In addition, the suppliers of indigenous Irish produce to those particular multiplies and retailers will be forced to outsource in order to remain competitive. Therefore, the consequent reduction in employment in the food sector is a worrying feature for many people.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael believes that we cannot accept the Bill as it stands because it weakens a number of key protections for consumers and relaxes certain regulations dealing with the relationship between suppliers and the major multiples with no benefit to the consumer. I had no difficulty about reviewing the groceries order after it having been in place for 17 or 18 years, which we advocated, but what we needed was for the some of pro<Col N="1031"/>visions of the groceries order, which were of considerable assistance to achieving a level playing pitch, to be included in this Bill. We wanted to see rebates and discounts and a guarantee that they would be passed on to consumers. There is nothing in the Bill to suggest this will happen.</P>
      <P>We are particularly concerned with section 15B of the Bill. This section has five subsections. Subsection (1) prevents grocery goods undertakings from fixing prices, which is a good measure. Subsection (2) is a general anti-discrimination measure which prohibits dissimilar conditions being applied to equivalent transactions. This, again, is a measure we fully support. Subsections (3) and (4) deal with the issue of &ldquo;hello money&rdquo; and prohibit its payment, with which we also agree. However, we have a difficulty with subsection (5). It states, &ldquo;Conduct described in subsections (1) to (4) shall not be prohibited unless it has as its object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition in trade in any grocery goods in the State or any part of the State&rdquo;. In other words, acts that are blatantly anti-competitive and were, up to now, automatically deemed to be illegal are to be subject to some vague test that will, in almost total certainty, render their prohibition inoperable. The result of this section of the Bill is to effectively open the door to &ldquo;hello money&rdquo;, discriminatory practices and price fixing &mdash; the very anti-competitive practices the Minister stated he wanted to eradicate.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael believes, and has consistently stated, that the groceries order should be replaced with a new law such as this legislation but which would take account of the changes required to the Competition Act and of the modern trends in the grocery trade. The new law, when enacted, should protect our communities from predatory pricing by multiples and ensure we have choice and diversity in the food sector where multiples and local shops can compete on a level playing pitch. We wish to see a facility in place that will ensure the banning of predatory pricing and allow discounts and rebates to be passed on to consumers and not put into the pockets of the retailers. It is for these reasons and the fact that such provisions are not included in this legislation that we cannot support it. The Bill, as it stands, will replace the groceries order with something worse. It adds a ridiculous, needless &ldquo;get out&rdquo; clause for all those who wish to abuse their market dominance and eliminate the competition.</P>
      <P>In his response I want the Minister to explain the reason section 15B(5) was included; what benefit it could possibly bring to consumers, who lobbied for its inclusion, how it can be interpreted other than as a charter for anti-competitive practices and if he received advice not to include it, and, if so, why he ignored it. He might also explain what drove him to make something that is currently illegal, as it is blatantly anti-competitive and anti-consumer, now acceptable, unless <Col N="1032"/>the case for the prosecution is able to meet a series of tests which are not even set down in this legislation or in the Competition Act.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Ireland is crying out for change in the context of competition. Some 41 new stealth taxes have been imposed on everything from energy to stamps. We have suffered a drop of 22 places in our international competitiveness ranking. Dublin is now a more expensive city than Paris and Vienna and Ireland is the most expensive country in Europe. That represents Government action in terms of imposing additional charges and taxes in order to make the country uncompetitive. Government inaction on the consumer agenda is undoubtedly part of the reason we are in this mess. However, if we really want to tackle the root causes of our high cost base, which feature will be more vital in the years ahead, it is time to take on the anti-competitive behaviour and rid this country, once and for all, of the cartels and agreements that work against the consumer interest. The Minister has set out his objective to do that, but he is doing the opposite. The Bill signally fails to do that in this case.</P>
      <P>In his review of the report of the public consultation process on the groceries order which was published in October, the Minister told the House that report recommended the 2002 Act will be significantly strengthened in order to specifically prohibit resale, price maintenance, unfair discrimination and &ldquo;hello money&rdquo;. With the inclusion of section 15B(5), the Minister flies in the face of that statement and his Department&rsquo;s recommendation in that report. He is doing exactly what his critics said he would do, critics whom he ridiculed as being anti-consumer, anti-competitive and anti-change. The Minister has failed to live up to what he said when his Department&rsquo;s report was published. It is interesting that in his Department&rsquo;s report, to which he has frequently referred, one of the conclusions in one of the paragraphs I read was that there is no evidence that the abolition of the groceries will lead to lower prices. That is what the Minister and the Department concluded from all of the submissions received, which is an interesting conclusion, considering all the big change and hype the Consumer Strategy Group and the Competition Authority said this change would make. That is in the report.</P>

	<P>Not surprisingly it has all the hallmarks of having been hastily drafted and presented because there are many flaws in it. The abolition of the groceries order and the introduction of these changes are clearly meant to take the heat off the Government for its inaction towards Irish consumers for a long time. Faced with the ever increasing costs, particularly those in the State sector, and in the context of considerable consumer concern about being ripped off, this Administration has demonstrated inaction and neglect in terms of the plight of Irish consumers. Aside from direct increases in costs of goods and services within the State sector, the Government has consistently failed to give consumers the benefit of competition in key sectors. Instead of truly taking a positive and pro-consumer stance on consumer issues, all we have had is lip service. For example, we have a new National Consumer Agency, which has been presented as the saviour for Irish consumers, but it has very little power. All I have seen in recent times has been the spending of plenty of money on soft PR initiatives. Few who have witnessed the activities of the National Consumer Agency since its establishment on an interim basis cannot be inspired with confidence that it will be the saviour of Irish consumers. In particular, it has failed to give any indication of the areas it intends to tackle on behalf of consumers. It seems to be considering many areas. That is hardly surprising, given that the Consumers&rsquo; Association of Ireland was ignored when the members of the agency were being appointed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is some precedent in this regard. The National Consumer Agency can consider the Competition Authority&rsquo;s disgracefully low level of performance and output. Few entities established by the Oireachtas have made so much noise while doing so little for consumers over the years. The authority has failed to connect with the issues of utmost importance to people. It has preferred to concentrate on highbrow and esoteric studies, which have usually been produced too late to influence Government policy. The authority has not yet produced a final report on legal services, even though the Minister has announced his proposals in that regard. It has failed to produce a final report on architects, even though the Government is proceeding with the Building Control Bill 2005. The authority&rsquo;s report on insurance was produced long after the Government established the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, with the support of the House, to tackle the issue of high insurance costs.</P>
      <P>The Competition Authority&rsquo;s record in the area of enforcement has been dire. There is no evidence that it has successfully deconstructed any cartels in the economy, or taken on any hard cases in a manner that has benefitted consumers. The authority&rsquo;s approach to the financial services industry, which resulted in a weak and mealy-mouthed report, can be contrasted with the work of the National Consumer Council in Northern Ireland, where a hard-hitting and focused report had the banks in that jurisdiction in a state of crisis as they sought to stave off an investigation by the Office of Fair Trading.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the authority is not operating as an effective body. It does not have a chairman and there is no sign of a new chairman being appointed. There are vacancies in key areas of its membership. For example, the head of its anti-cartel division left that position some months ago. The Minister is relying on some of his officials to ensure that the authority has a quorum so it can do its business.</P>
      <P>The Minister does not seem to care about the poor performance of the Competition Authority and the impact that is having on consumers and businesses. He seems content to allow the authority to perform at a low level. By giving it new powers in this legislation, the Minister is placing his faith four square behind the authority. He has shown his hallmark unwillingness to take measures beyond those contained in the manila covered brief handed to him by his officials. Fine Gael has published some constructive policy proposals which will make the Competition Authority more resourceful and effective on behalf of consumers. I ask the Minister to examine our proposals on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The Minister&rsquo;s approach to competition policy is illustrated by the provisions of the legislation we are debating, which has been presented on <Col N="1035"/>foot of a consultation process on the future of the groceries order. I have mentioned some of the problems I have with the Minister&rsquo;s report and his subsequent legislation. It is interesting to review the manner in which some of the submissions which were received by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment have been presented in the Department&rsquo;s report. It is clear from the report that the Department decided to remove the groceries order before it received any submissions on the matter. Having read the report, I have to express strong concern about a policy decision being taken on the basis of one side of an argument.</P>
      <P>I find some parts of the report particularly disturbing. For example, the report dismisses the views or perspectives of parties with views contrary to those of the Consumer Strategy Group or the Competition Authority. That represents an arrogant dismissal of the genuine concerns of people who will be directly or adversely affected as result of any changes which will be made. The negative attitude to the positions of those who have traditionally supported the groceries order was hard to understand until I read the foreword to the report. I learned that the evaluation and assessment of submissions was carried out with the assistance of an academic from Trinity College who is a well known opponent of the order and whose work is also referred to on an ostensibly objective basis in the course of the report.</P>
      <P>I was particularly disconcerted by the report&rsquo;s cursory dismissal of the valid concerns expressed by the few non-vested interests to express a perspective on the groceries order and competition in food retailing. I am a member of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business which received some impressive submissions about the retail food sector from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Crosscare and the Combat Poverty Agency, which is a statutory agency. The committee was particularly impressed by the agencies&rsquo; support for many of the measures which should be included in this legislation, but are being excluded as a consequence of the provisions of section 15(5)(<i>b</i>), which I mentioned earlier. The Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency would do well to emulate the standard of the presentations made by the agencies in question whose valid concerns have been ignored.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Martin, has criticised the groceries order and the measures in it on the basis that they lead to higher consumer prices. His departmental officials have failed to establish that this is the case, however. They have not adopted the flawed analysis presented by the Competition Authority in this regard. One telling difficulty with the Department&rsquo;s analysis of the groceries order, in the context of the legislation before the House, is that neither the Minister nor his officials have indicated the likely con<Col N="1036"/>sequences of the abolition of the order in terms of consumer prices, competition, employment and investment in the food sector. Members are aware of the recent sad news from County Waterford concerning Cappoquin Chickens. I suspect that similar announcements will be commonplace in the next few years as the changes being introduced by the Minister in this legislation take effect. I will discuss my concerns about the provisions relating to predatory pricing later in this debate.</P>
      <P>I have concerns about the Department&rsquo;s use of statistics and data on the provision of food services in the UK. I have serious doubts about the Department&rsquo;s contention that there is no difficulty in the provision of food shopping in the UK. The Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business will take up this matter at a later stage. It is interesting to note that since the Department published the report, a group of MPs in the UK has issued a report calling for major action to prevent further deterioration in the provision of food shop facilities in that country. Why would they do that if there were no problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister familiar with that report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>

	<P>We know what side the Minister is on. As I said, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment accepted in its report that there is nothing wrong with people using the statistics which best illustrate their case. That is a criticism that might also apply to the Department.</P>
      <P>I have serious concerns about the provisions the Minister is introducing in this legislation. The key objection to the groceries order was that it prevented consumers from accessing the discounts which retailers were receiving from suppliers. What part of this legislation ensures that they will be able to access such discounts in future? It was argued that the order&rsquo;s definition of below cost selling maintained an element of resale price maintenance, in effect preventing retailers from passing on wholesaler or supplier discounts. There is little evidence to support the existence of this practice, although there are clear anecdotal indications that people feel it is happening. We needed to see evidence of it in the Department&rsquo;s and the Minister&rsquo;s reports, but we did not get it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind the Minister that I would like to see discounts and rebates being passed on to consumers. The Minister had the opportunity to receive many submissions on the matter and to produce a report, but there is nothing in the <Col N="1038"/>report to suggest that such practices are happening or to indicate what the Minister intends to do about them. The problems in this regard again cause me to highlight my difficulties with the performance of the Competition Authority. In this area, as in many other areas, we are legislating in a vacuum because the Minister has not provided the evidence and key information that would allow policy makers to make informed and accurate decisions about the consequences of legislation for key sectors and consumers.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael, in advocating a review of the groceries order, which has been in place for 17 years, called on the Government to put legal mechanisms in place to ensure that discounts and rebates are passed on to consumers, rather than ending up in the pockets of retailers.</P>
      <P>In the retail grocery sector most of the key players deliberately and consciously obscure and conceal from public gaze information about their profitability and turnover. We have no information on the profitability of the multiples and no details on their turnover, and there is an absence of information to enable us determine whether they are making super normal profits through the maintenance or retention of these discounts. The Minister has a blind spot about this issue and has failed to tackle a vested interest to get them to reveal their profitability and their margins so that we can assess whether the discounts are huge or small or whether they can be passed on.</P>
      <P>In a reply to a parliamentary question I tabled last year the Minister steadfastly refused to take measures to compel these companies in the context of amending the Companies Acts to reveal their profitability. I am puzzled as to why that stance continues to be maintained particularly given concerns expressed by the consumer strategy group and the national consumer agency about the absence of this information. Perhaps in the course of his reply to this Second Stage debate the Minister will enlighten us as to whether he has changed his mind on this issue.</P>
      <P>There is one body that has the power to get all this information, the Competition Authority, but it has failed to do so. Its inaction has done Irish consumers a further disservice. The national consumer agency is conducting a campaign about giving consumers information. Details on the profitability of large retailers is one aspect of information that Irish consumers are entitled to receive and the Minister should stop protecting them.</P>
      <P>I have particular concerns about the legislation presented on the basis of what it says about predatory pricing. This is the nub of the matter and an important aspect of the legislation. The Minister has consistently stated that existing competition law is sufficiently robust and appropriate to deal with the issue of predatory pricing. I presume he has a legal opinion from the Attorney General who changes his mind regularly and has done so recently. He changed his mind yesterday <Col N="1039"/>on one piece of legislation. He reversed engines completely on the issue of imposing administrative fines in connection with one Bill. It seems it can be done now whereas it was unconstitutional a few months ago.</P>
      <P>On the issue of predatory pricing there has been no decision by the Competition Authority or the Irish courts to date under the Competition Act 2002. I do not know how the Minister can give assurances that existing competition legislation covers predatory pricing. We have no case. We are depending completely on EU law so that it is untested in this jurisdiction under the Competition Act 2002. How can the Minister make that assertion?</P>
      <P>According to my legal advice, having regard to case law, the provisions of the Competition Act 2002 do not provide sufficient protection for retailers in respect of aggressive pricing tactics for two reasons, first, the difficulty of establishing dominance, which is a complex economic and legal exercise. Given that only one of the multiples in the grocery trade, the largest player in the market, has a share of 25%, that is a long way from what is defined in the Competition Act 2002 and interpreted by the Competition Authority as dominance. Its definition of dominance in the newspaper trade is 65%, yet it was not regarded as dominant in the <i>Drogheda Independent</i> case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not my interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The second reason is the question of proof required to establish predation. I have been advised that cases on predatory pricing may give rise to huge costs for any supplier or customer advocating a case to the High Court in regard to predatory pricing. Who will take the risk of putting themselves out of business by the evidential burden of costs or by losing customer share, if they lose the case, by aggressive tackling on predatory pricing? It is a big problem for a person to take on a case as it is very expensive and is likely to continue for two or three years. My advice is that there is a logical inconsistency in the approach adopted by the Minister in the Bill. He is prepared to accept that certain activities, such as hello money, unfair discrimination and resale price maintenance are not appropriate in the context of issues that came under the groceries order and that he wishes to put into the Competition Act, which come under threat with section 15(5), but he is not prepared to do the same in regard to predatory pricing. The question is why.</P>
      <P>In response to a direct question on whether the Competition Act 2002 provides a sufficient safeguard against predatory pricing in the retail grocery trade my advice is that it does not stack up for the following reasons. It does not provide a sufficient safeguard because there are significant difficulties in establishing predatory pricing, in particular in terms of the definition of what is <Col N="1040"/>predatory pricing. One would require extensive economic evidence to establish in any given case whether the pricing is predatory and to obtain that evidence extremely extensive discovery would have to be made. There could be no certainty of success given the case law in this area and the very small number of cases that have successfully established predatory pricing in the context of EU law. Linked to that is the difficulty of establishing the dominance necessary to make predatory pricing unlawful. It is a difficult area. The Minister is incorrect to suggest, therefore, that existing competition law adequately covers the issue of predatory pricing. It is clear that existing competition law does not present a viable or practical means of addressing predatory pricing activities by large multiples in Ireland. That will be an issue of contention on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>It is clear that amendments will be needed on Committee Stage. My primary concern is that the Bill will merely serve to increase the powers of the big players in the market to the detriment of consumers, the food industry and the independent retail sector. It will do so in an atmosphere where there is no transparency on performance of pricing and where there is no effective block or check against the excesses or abuses by these significantly large companies in the local marketplace. The Minister must recognise there is a wide body of opinion in the House, including on the Government backbenches, and outside the House that recognises the need to ensure fair competition and that all consumers can have the benefit of low prices, selection and diversity in retailing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

	<P>Conscious that this debate will adjourn at 2.20 p.m. I shall confine myself to the 21 minutes available to me rather than have a few minutes carryover. I shall begin by saying something positive. At least in the legislation the Minister has brought forward he has made a decision on something, and for that we should be grateful. Huge debate has surrounded this issue over a protracted period. That debate has centred around significant potential consequences in making changes that are proposed by the Minister in the legislation. The Minister has made his choice. He assured the House, as he did previously at the launch of the review of the report of the public consultation process undertaken by his Department and in the other House, that the societal damaging consequences predicted by many of the changes intended to be put in place will not come to pass. I am minded to refer to the hit television series, &ldquo;Yes, Minister&rdquo;. When Ministers found themselves in that position, the senior civil servant would say, &ldquo;courageous&rdquo;. The Minister has taken a grave responsibility upon himself and, as Deputy Hogan and those of us who have watched this for two years have said, without any great evidence to back up the assertions and the confidence he has presented. Only time will judge and the Minister will have moved on to other things by then, perhaps even to greater things. One way or another, society will live with the consequences of this decision, narrow and all in its encompass, but potentially of major impact in societal terms in the way the grocery trade is delivered to the people in future.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order 1987 was put in place and maintained for the past 18 years through successive Governments. It was brought in 18 years ago, not by a reckless Minister but by a very well respected one and a former Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, for a purpose. It was not mindless, so before we change it we must have a compelling case.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It would be wise to examine in a dispassionate way how the order has impacted on prices over the past 18 years. The Minister is very anxious, both in his contribution here and elsewhere, to be restrictive enough in his focus to deal with the <Col N="1042"/>issue of prices, although the consultation paper does deal with other issues. It is interesting that the position of the Competition Authority, both in its public manifestations and in its presentations to the joint Oireachtas committee, exclusively focused on the price issue. That seemed to be the compelling issue, that to have cheaper prices we had to do away with the groceries order. In a nutshell, that is the argument that came in a simplistic fashion from a number of quarters during the course of this debate.</P>
      <P>For a moment let us park the other significant issues of access, transport, the ghost town argument and all the rest. We will come back to them. Let us deal on the basis that the Minister and the former chairman of the Competition Authority have put forward, the issue of prices. Figures have been thrown around like snuff at a wake. Some of the figures I have seen have been massaged.</P>
      <P>To deal with the price issue, I am happy to rely in my presentation exclusively on the authoritative analysis provided to the Oireachtas joint committee by an organisation that is beyond reproach, the Central Statistics Office. It carried out the analysis of prices over the duration of the existence of the groceries order. The order was signed in June 1987 and came into effect in December 1987. The period from June 1987 to July 2005 was presented to the Oireachtas joint committee for analysis by the CSO, the authoritative, definitive and independent collector of data and statistics in the State.</P>
      <P>It is very interesting to look precisely at the effect of the groceries order on the items covered by it in comparison with food, non-alcoholic beverages and alcohol consumed at home, which was the issue it was asked to consider. Eighteen years is a very long period of analysis and it should provide definitive results on the cost of a basket of groceries between items that are covered by the groceries order compared with items not covered by it.</P>
      <P>Items covered by the groceries order were cheaper than items not covered by the groceries order for nine of the past 18 years. I see the officials are writing about this. I will give the figures for the individual years. For the other nine years, items covered by the groceries order increased by more than items not covered. For nine of the 18 years, items covered by the groceries order had a greater inflation rate than items not covered and for the other nine years they had a lower inflation rate. If one looks at the figures in detail, as I have done, from 1987 to 2003, the difference in the rate of increase was entirely negligible. They were comparable. The existence of the groceries order was neither here nor there in the rate of price inflation over all the years from the inception of the groceries order in 1987 to the year 2003.</P>
      <P>In truth, something did happen after that. Let me give the figures. Items covered by the groceries order had increased in price by 50.9%, that is, from a base of 100 to 150.9. Items not covered by <Col N="1043"/>the groceries order had increased by 49.8%, that is, from a base of 100 to a base of 149.8. The measured impact presented by the Central Statistics Office between price increases over 16 of the 18 years, as between items covered by the groceries order and those not covered, was of the order of 1.1%. If this is such an extraordinarily uncompetitive barrier to cheaper prices how can the difference only be 1%?</P>
      <P>That information comes from the independent figures presented to us. It is hardly a compelling case for us to take this particular area and look at it as a matter of urgent reform that would require us to launch the Competition Authority into a review and that would make us change the law and announce with fanfare that it would lead to cheaper prices and the devil and all else.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Hogan pointed out, we are not as ambitious in the projections now as we were when the argument was still being formulated, for example, the 9% decrease predicted by the Consumer Strategy Group or the prediction by the Competition Authority that it would be worth between &euro;500 and &euro;1,000 per consumer. We are a little bit more circumspect than this. The Minister has made no predictions. If one makes no predictions one cannot be found out. He just knows in his heart like de Valera that it will be a good thing but he is not sure how good&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>A pragmatic outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and that in the fullness of time we would not be found out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Hogan wanted the groceries order abolished as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wanted a pragmatic outcome &mdash; lower prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps I may continue as I have less time than my two colleagues because of the way the order of the House falls.</P>
      <P>To be fair, I wish to address another issue. I refer to the past two years, in case the Minister asks about them. There has been a difference between prices of items covered by the groceries order and those not covered by it in the years 2004 and 2005. After 16 years of no change, a very significant gap in the figures of 9.7% opened in the past two years. Something extraordinary happened. The items covered by the order did not shoot up in price. They only increased by 1% in the period presented to the Oireachtas joint committee, that is, from 150.9 in 2003 to 151.9 in July 2005. What did happen is that the non-grocery items fell during that period by 7.6% from 149.3 in 2003 to 142.2.</P>
      <P>Since those figures were presented, I have been trying to understand why the items not covered by the groceries order declined in price by 7.6% in that period. I decided to ask the expert in these <Col N="1044"/>matters, the chairman of the Competition Authority, when he came before the Oireachtas committee but he was not sure. He did not know. What he predicted was that it was probably because of the arrival in the market of Aldi and Lidl in that period. The great irony is that the evidence they gave to the committee is that, because of predatory pricing, they could not have opened in Ireland had it not been for the groceries order. They present a relatively narrow range of goods and said they would have been devoured and killed off by Tesco and Dunnes Stores in proximity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy believe that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister can laugh. What would those groups know about the grocery business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>They know nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister knows more, of course. They are merely operating in the business.</P>
      <P>What we have over the entire duration of the groceries order makes virtually no difference to the bulk of the sector, except in the most recent two years, and that is not because items covered by the groceries order have dramatically increased. They have not.</P>
      <P>I am a little at a loss to know why the revocation of the groceries order became the priority of the Minister. I suppose Eddie Hobbs might be an explanation in that following his programmes, the Minister had to be seen doing something, and the supermarkets, God knows, are much easier to handle than those &ldquo;ornery lawyers&rdquo;, for example, if the Minister wanted to attack an uncompetitive sector. The lawyers would be a more difficult nut to crack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>How many party questions will the Deputy ask?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The move had much more to do with image than reality. In Ireland, where examples of patent rip-offs are as common as rainy Mondays, why would the grocery sector be singled out as the area to be attacked first given that, as an Oireachtas joint committee report showed, food inflation was a negative &mdash; minus 1% in the year to last May &mdash; and was the second lowest among the 25 members of the European Union? It is more to do with image than reality, and with the notion that the sector is an easier target than professional legal costs and other professional fees.</P>
      <P>In his pronouncements, the Minister has urged us to focus on the Bill&rsquo;s contents alone and not on spatial planning or access by the elderly or those without private transport. However, we cannot consider these issues in a vacuum. By way of reassurance, the Minister tells us that access to <Col N="1045"/>groceries in the UK is excellent, as 90% of rural households in England live within 4 km of a petrol station. That is all right, then. For those without private transport, it is fine to live 4 km from a petrol station. When one gets there, one can get a gallon of petrol and one day one might be able to save up for the car. Access is an issue which was very strongly argued by Combat Poverty, Crosscare, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and other important groups. From personal experience I know how important it is to have access and to be able to live independently.</P>
      <P>There is another debate to which the Minister will be well attuned given his former responsibilities in the Department of Health and Children. I refer to care of the elderly. It is important to keep elderly people living at home for as long as possible and access to groceries is an important dimension of that.</P>
      <P>Price is not everything. At the Oireachtas joint committee on Enterprise and Small Business, we put the former chairman of the Competition Authority under some pressure. I asked him if there were one shopping centre in Wexford, Tesco, for example, which had the cheapest prices, would it matter if there were no other centre in the vicinity, and he said it would not. From his perspective and that of the Competition Authority, the only important issue was price. Price is not the be-all and end-all. It is very important, but access is important if one is old, infirm and reliant on public transport.</P>
      <P>The Minister also told the House that while food cost inflation has been three times the rate of the UK since the mid-1990s, inflation in the clothing sector is virtually identical to the UK rate. The conclusion he has come to is that the food sector is uncompetitive because the clothing sector is clearly competitive. Perhaps this might have something to do with the fact that we have devastated our clothing industry and now import our clothes from China and Morocco. Perhaps it is the view of the Minister that a similar exercise should be carried on in our food industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is deliberately missing the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps we should now be content to bring in cheaper meat from South America or Thai chicken, for example, and have it processed in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>We could get our milk from Hong Kong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The notion that anyone would give clothing as an example, when we have devastated the clothing industry and that we now&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is deliberately distorting what I said. The comparison between the UK rates and the Irish rates is the key point.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1046"/>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister said that if we compare clothing prices in the UK and Ireland, the inflation rate is virtually identical, while there is a disparity between the food prices because the groceries area in Ireland is not competitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am saying it is more protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course one can get cheaper clothing when one has no clothing industry and can import all one&rsquo;s clothes, just as the UK does. The UK has the same attitude to food because it is a food importing country. Ireland is a food producing nation and some of us would like to hang on to food production in this country. It is an important part of our economy. The representations made by the farming industry and food producers indicated they would like not only to maintain food production but increase the volume. That is a factor which has not arisen in this debate but which will impact on the Minister&rsquo;s decision.</P>
      <P>I had hoped to examine the specific proposals in some detail but will confine myself to some general remarks on them. I support the objective of the prohibition of resale price maintenance. It was a practice already proscribed in the groceries order and is simply being restated. It is important that suppliers cannot specify a minimum price for the resale of goods. The Minister said he is strengthening the provision in this enactment. I welcome that and support the Minister in that action. I also support the proposal in section 15(<i>b</i>)(iv) to prohibit a retailer from forcing a supplier to pay &ldquo;hello money&rdquo;. That was intended in Article 18 of the existing groceries order of 1987 and is being presented again in a clearer and more robust manner. That is fine. These are all the aspects we said we wanted to support in any event.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The main area of contention is the issue of predatory pricing and the Minister&rsquo;s view of it. There is no reference in the Bill to predatory pricing. In his Seanad speech, the Minister said that, &ldquo;hand on heart&rdquo;, this was because it was already prohibited by section 5 of the Competition Act 2002. To bolster the criticised weakness of that Act, the Minister takes refuge in defined European case law. I am always suspicious when legislators prefer to depend on precedents in case law rather than clarity of legislation. If the Minister wants to be clear on predatory pricing, let us as legislators collectively enact clear legislation rather than say that although case law under the Competition Act is weak enough, the judgments of the courts are clearer and we do not want to dislodge those. That is not the normal way in which legislators carry out their business.</P>
      <P>What do we mean by predatory pricing? There is a variety of definitions and the Minister added more in his speech. The general view is that it will be all right on the night, a dominant position is what a dominant position will be determined to <Col N="1047"/>be and the courts will decide it. As a legislator, I would prefer if we decided these matters.</P>
      <P>I would like to say much more but I know my time has expired.</P>
      <P>We will get a chance to tease out these matters in some detail on Committee Stage. I have had an open mind to this debate from the start. I wanted to see if a compelling case would be presented. In all the documentation &mdash; God knows enough documentation has been produced &mdash; I have not read a compelling case. This is a classic example of a decision being made and the argument being marshalled to support the decision rather than the other way around. In any event we will tease out these matters. The Minister has embarked on a risky strategy without any clear justification and it is an unwise move, which I hope we can at least ameliorate on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Title>Vote for the Health Service Executive 2005-06: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Finance brought to the attention of the House yesterday a possible change to the estimated carryover of capital to 2006 for the Vote of the Health Service Executive. There has been justifiable concern but also considerable confusion and misunderstanding about this matter. I propose to set out what is fact and what is fiction, what the facts mean and what happens next. I want to avoid financial jargon to the greatest extent possible and to concentrate on substance over form, which is the basis of good accounting in any case.</P>
      <P>The facts are as follows. The Oireachtas has provided for two Votes in the health area, Vote 39 for the Department of Health and Children and Vote 40 for the Health Service Executive. There are two Accounting Officers for the Votes, the Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children for Vote 39 and the chief executive officer of the Health Service Executive for Vote 40. The political responsibility for both Votes is mine, as Minister for Health and Children. The role of the Minister for Finance, as was evident yesterday, is to propose the Appropriation Bill to the House which includes provisions for carryover of capital funds from one year to another. It was entirely appropriate for him to make his statement to the House yesterday in that context and given that the Seanad is today hearing statements on the Appropriation Act.</P>
      <P>The matter raised by the Minister for Finance yesterday relates solely to Vote 40, the HSE Vote. Throughout last year the HSE provided expenditure reports to the Department of Health and Children of spending against its budget, both current and capital. Last December, as is normal, the HSE provided an estimate of what spending <Col N="1048"/>would be for the year that was nearing its end. These were the forecast outturn figures for 2005. They indicated that they expected capital savings of approximately &euro;56 million and current savings of approximately &euro;12 million, that is a total gross saving of &euro;68 million. Provision was, therefore, made in the Appropriation Act for a carryover of &euro;56.4 million capital into 2006.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise for interrupting; is a script to be circulated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, a script is to be circulated. I hope the Department officials will bring it to the Chamber. In January, as is normal, the HSE prepared a report of what it estimated spending actually had been for the year that had just ended. These were the provisional outturn figures. These figures show a capital underspend of &euro;57.5 million and a current overspend of &euro;53 million, that is, a total gross saving of &euro;4.5 million rather than &euro;68 million as earlier forecast. This change gave rise to the need for the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s statement to the House yesterday. The HSE is continuing to work to prepare its own appropriation account, which must be submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General by the Accounting Officer by 31 March. The final, definitive statement of spending in 2005 will appear in this account. They are the facts regarding financial reporting.</P>
      <P>In his statement the Minister for Finance said: &ldquo;on the basis of the preliminary outturn figures for 2005 from the HSE, the capital savings anticipated by the executive in December may have been used to meet similar sized costs under the current expenditure heading.&rdquo; The Minister could not be definitive at this time because the final accounts are not ultimately signed off until the deadline of 31 March. The suggestion has been made that somehow the HSE had misappropriated money from a capital budget and spent it on current needs. In plain terms, this would have meant someone in the HSE taking money meant for purchasing medical equipment, such as buildings or wash-hand basins, and using it to pay staff or buy drugs. This would be a breach of very basic financial discipline in any part of the public service. The HSE has assured me this did not happen.</P>
      <P>It is part of the normal, continual financial oversight on the part of Ministers and Accounting Officers to ensure that every aspect of spending is properly allocated and reported as between current and capital. However, to suggest a deliberate misappropriation of a capital account to meet current expenses is something altogether different. If it remains the case that there was an overspend on current spending last year, savings on the capital side can offset it. This situation is provided for in public financial procedures. The HSE will be following the standard Government accounting rules. It will seek any necessary sanction to transfer capital savings to cover a current <Col N="1049"/>excess in respect of 2005. This request will be considered in the normal way by the Department of Finance. The D&aacute;il approves the total net allocation for the Vote. It does not approve individual subheads or the division between current and capital spending. There is no question of any funding having been spent without authorisation or without D&aacute;il approval.</P>
      <P>Deputies may ask why should there be any variation between a forecast of spending near the year end and an estimate of actual spending just after the year end. We expect that financial systems in the public service should be capable of tracking spending accurately and making reasonable forecasts relative to overall budget.</P>
      <P>In the case of the HSE, I will mention a number of points. It is bringing in cash accounting for its Vote to go alongside income and expenditure accounting. It was acknowledged from the start that it would take some time for the HSE to put in place financial systems that would deliver maximum integration of these two systems. As this work is done, the HSE will be in an even better position to deliver robust financial management. The cash accounting basis is providing more transparency, notwithstanding the challenge of transition it poses to the HSE. There is no question of the HSE having failed to manage its Vote or not knowing what is going on. The HSE got a total gross allocation of &euro;11.5 billion and its provisional outturn figures are practically the same. I stand over my decision, approved by Government and enacted by the Oireachtas, to give the HSE its own Vote and appoint the CEO as an Accounting Officer. I stand over the policy of having financial responsibility go with management responsibility.</P>
      <P>Opposition Members hear the sound of the wind blowing through the trees and declare it is a tornado bringing destruction on our houses and our land. Despite what they would like, this is no tornado. The Minister for Finance made clear yesterday his determination to avoid any adverse impact on HSE capital spending plans in 2006. He also made clear today in the Seanad that there is no change to the multi-annual capital investment programme for health. No health service provided to the public was affected by this last year and no service is currently affected by it. No planned service or planned capital project will be affected by this. It does not mean that some hospital, community centre or other health service will not now be built, commissioned or refurbished.</P>
      <P>It is not correct to say that money was used for current spending when it was intended for capital. It is not correct to say that there is a major fault in the Department of Health and Children&rsquo;s financial reporting. The full Estimate has been accounted for. There is no hole in the accounts. There has been no misappropriation of funds. No one can suggest taxpayers&rsquo; money has gone missing. I repeat that the 2005 outturn figures have yet to be finalised by the HSE. Depending on the <Col N="1050"/>final figures, it may be the case that the HSE will be able to carry forward some or all of the &euro;56 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s statement that she would try to avoid accountancy terms in her contribution. The credibility of the Government is on the line in this matter. Before Christmas the T&aacute;naiste announced a surplus of &euro;1.6 million, when that was due to over-taxation of the people, something the Government got wrong in regard to the economy in general. We are now hearing that the Government is not spending taxpayers&rsquo; money properly. The T&aacute;naiste might say it makes no difference as this money was for the HSE. However, there was a major problem between current and capital spending.</P>
      <P>In December we were told that &euro;12 million was overspent on the current side. This has now jumped to &euro;56 million to balance the books between current and capital spending. This is otherwise known as creative accounting, which is what has happened.</P>
      <P>It was expected that &euro;56 million would be left over from capital spending by the end of 2005, which is 10% of the capital budget that the former health boards and the HSE have tried to keep back every year for the past six or seven years to carry over into the following year. The figure allowed to be carried forward was 10%.</P>
      <P>The HSE got it wrong on the current side of its spending. It overspent by &euro;50 million and the T&aacute;naiste is now trying to rejig matters in January so that it does not really matter whether the money is spent as current or capital, so long as the money is spent. Commentators from the Department of Health and Children and the HSE&rsquo;s Financial Officer were not sure whether the money was missing, had been spent or so forth. We have heard this over the past 24 hours. The matter seems to have suddenly exploded from out of nowhere and, for some reason, we are getting the information now.</P>
      <P>What happened last June when the Department of Finance wrote to the Department of Health and Children to say it was unhappy with the practice of spending money dedicated to capital projects on current day to day spending? Was the T&aacute;naiste informed in June that this was going on? What happened between June and December or January that meant the T&aacute;naiste did not know about this issue until two weeks ago? This is bad practice when one spends &euro;12 billion per year. It is bad practice for the HSE, the Accounting Officers and the Minister responsible for managing the taxpayers&rsquo;&euro;12 billion spent on health services. More issues will come out.</P>
      <P>Mr. Kevin Kelly told us at the beginning of 2005 that he would need an extra &euro;200 million if he were to deliver his corporate plan in 2005. We saw what happened, that is, cutbacks in services and home help hours in 2005. Services were not delivered until the end of 2005. This is the next <Col N="1051"/>problem we must begin exploring in respect of how Governments spend their money. How much is spent towards the end of the year? How much capital and current spending occurs at a profound rate in the HSE in order for people to balance the bottom line? It is not about the delivery of services or proper accountability, rather balancing the bottom line for the T&aacute;naiste to tell the House that there was no problem. This year, there was clearly a problem and someone made a serious mistake. The T&aacute;naiste does not know what is happening within the service.</P>
      <P>We should get a clearer statement from the Department&rsquo;s Accounting Officers if they are keeping the T&aacute;naiste informed on what is happening. It would be important for her. When the T&aacute;naiste stood in this Chamber to debate the Health Act 2004 establishing the HSE, she said there were two reasons for proposing the legislation and two ways in which Government policies should be judged, namely, better outcomes for patients and better value for taxpayers&rsquo; money. We do not know whether we are getting better value with this sort of carry on, when money is put aside for capital projects. The T&aacute;naiste seems to be saying that this 10% is nothing more than a slush fund if a booboo is made on the current day to day spending in the health services.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Kenny pointed out this morning, we do not know how many people work for the HSE or where millions of taxpayers&rsquo; money is being spent. I often hear anecdotal information about end of year spending and how health authorities run out to buy computers, televisions and pieces of equipment that they are not sure they need. We never know whether this really happens as it is very difficult to trawl through the accounts to determine what is happening unless someone tells us what is going on.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The T&aacute;naiste made another mistake this morning when she stated that &euro;200 million was overspent in the establishment of the HSE and no one in this House cared less about it. I raised that issue during the debate on the Estimates for the public service in 2006 and asked whether it cost approximately &euro;200 million to establish the HSE in 2005 and, if it were true, whether the Department could clarify the figure. Interestingly, an official present contacted me within a number of days to say there was an issue of overspending in the health authorities among other matters, which he did not go into at the time. As we were approaching the end of the year, I decided to raise it in the next round of parliamentary questions. I submitted a parliamentary question to the T&aacute;naiste before 11 a.m. yesterday and I hope she will give me a nice, clear answer now that she has raised the issue. <Col N="1052"/>Five hours before the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, appeared in the House, I asked about where the &euro;200 million went. I hope the Minister will give a clear answer as it is important that we know what is happening with money spent on the health care service.</P>
      <P>Why did this happen? The T&aacute;naiste is not right when she says it is a big pot into which authorities can dip when they need millions of euro to spend. I was under the impression that finance officers were told to rigidly stay within budget, whether they were in health boards or the HSE. The practice about which the T&aacute;naiste spoke, of holding back major capital projects and spending until the end of the year, came about as a result of the idea that authorities were told not to overrun on their budgets. Will the T&aacute;naiste explain what is happening in this respect?</P>
      <P>The health care service has a significant number of problems but the T&aacute;naiste put her name on the line in terms of the efficiency and financial accountability the HSE is supposed to bring to it. Nothing we have seen throughout 2005 or the beginning of 2006 gives us any confidence that the HSE is getting its act together. Why did the finance officer appointed at the beginning of 2005 stay for only four or five months? Did he have any comments to make on this matter? Are there other issues concerning financial accountability and the HSE that we should hear about before we must trawl through freedom of information requests to find out the information ourselves? Will the T&aacute;naiste make a clear statement on whether there are difficulties regarding financial accountability within the HSE and health care services?</P>
      <P>Within certain sections of the HSE there is a lack of confidence that the organisation is working as intended. If that is the case, the T&aacute;naiste may have greater issues to face than the &euro;56 million, the &euro;150 million spent on PPARS or as yet to be exposed money wasted on other matters throughout the health service.</P>
      <P>While this was happening, services were denied to patients. Operations were cancelled, there was no home help or speech therapy services and a whole range of elements were denied to patients across the health service. The House needs clear answers. I will wait to hear the contributions of others and then ask the T&aacute;naiste something else during the questions and answers session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Here we are on the second day of the new D&aacute;il session and it is already groundhog day. Nothing has been learned by this Government. Despite PPARS, the leaking tunnel, dodgy Luas tracks and electronic voting, nothing has changed and here we are, yet again, dealing with money that has been misspent and waste and incompetence that could only lie at the door of the Government.</P>
      <P>It is clear the Government has known for some weeks that this money has been mismanaged, to put it kindly, within the HSE but we are only <Col N="1053"/>hearing about it now. This is the T&aacute;naiste who made the great claim to be outspoken, to tell it as it is and when it happens. However, these attributes seem to disappear the longer she stays in her brief. Even though the T&aacute;naiste is responsible, it was the Minister for Finance who sneaked in here yesterday, told his sorry tale and sneaked out again. The Government has been trying to spin and obfuscate its way out of this matter ever since, as it has done in the past.</P>
      <P>The facts are plain. It is clear that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children is floundering. Far from being in charge, she is flailing around and trying to spread a bit of the blame for the latest debacle in a chaotic health system, a chaos that is largely her own responsibility. Even with her latest speech she is unable to answer legitimate questions asked about her stewardship of the health service.</P>
      <P>Let us examine the record since she has been in that office. She failed to deal with the accident and emergency crisis despite her grand promises. Her medical card scheme has fallen apart and the scheme for repayments to the elderly is still on ice, yet this is the Minister who insisted on forcing through the establishment of the new regime, the HSE, last January despite the advice of civil servants and the urging of people like myself. She insisted on pushing through legislation and making the Accounting Officer of the HSE the CEO of the administration. At the time, there was no CEO on the horizon, there was only the sight of Professor Halligan scampering away as quickly as he could. The Minister forced through the legislation without debate, leading to a new regime that did not have the preparation and planning necessary for such a major regime change.</P>
      <P>In Britain, when changes of that type occur, much more time was given to preparing the transition from one system to another. We are now reaping the whirlwind of a health service managed by two systems, the old and the new. This has led to much bewilderment from people operating the system. I recall the assistant CEO stating that since the establishment of the HSE he had six different job titles. One cannot manage a health service in a professional way when there is such administrative chaos.</P>
      <P>The incoherence in the system was not eliminated but exacerbated by the Minister&rsquo;s actions. She overlaid an old system with a new, unfamiliar one. Millions of euro have been lost or unspent as a result. Before we get too tangled up in issues of financial management, let us recall that elderly patients are lying on trolleys in accident and emergency units, hospital wards are filthy and cancer patients have difficulty accessing desperately needed treatment.</P>
      <P>The clear message that comes back is that we must build capacity. The pressures on our health service are so great that capacity building is crucial yet &euro;56 million that could have provided new beds, built accident and emergency units or increased capacity in operating theatres remains <Col N="1054"/>unspent. The Minister must explain why it was unspent. Why does Professor Drumm point out that the capital programme was not agreed until July? I believe the Minister bears responsibility for delays in delivering the capital programme in 2005. Had there been political leadership to drive the capital programme, no money would have been left in the kitty.</P>
      <P>From year to year the capital programme is not spent and this suits the Government as it appears more money is put in each year. Money remains unspent on the most important project in the health service, namely, building capacity. Our population, the elderly population, and our health needs are all growing fast but the element that is not growing fast is capacity. This debacle is further evidence of this lack of growth and this is deeply disturbing to people dependent on the health services.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has no perception of how deep is the crisis in the health service. He speaks of people being unintelligent if they ask why a relative is lying on a trolley in an accident and emergency unit. This reflects his understanding of the seriousness of the situation.</P>
      <P>The simple rules of good governance should be ones this Minister would espouse and understand. The HSE was warned by the Department of Finance last June about the issue of transferring money from capital to current spending. Why did it not heed this warning? What must the Minister tell the HSE so that it understands what is happening? What are the pressures on the HSE that lead to it paying bills for day-to-day spending, even though the Minister cannot tell us which bills these are?</P>
      <P>The central point is that a high price has been paid, going back as far as the establishment of the HSE, for the pig-headed approach of the Minister, who drove this project without thought, preparation, foresight or understanding of the implications of bad management. One year later, a little humility would not go astray even if, during the Minister&rsquo;s watch, some &euro;56 million has gone astray.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste promised efficiency, accountability and value for money when she became Minister for Health and Children. The Minister cannot tell us how much the HSE has spent, where the money is gone, how many people are employed in the health service and how much this costs, even though &euro;160 million has been spent on a computer system to find this out.</P>
      <P>She has been successful at apportioning responsibility and blame. The Secretary General of the Department is gone and the previous Minster is responsible for so much. This latest incident has happened during her watch and reflects a lack of understanding of how the health system works. We all accept that a change was required in terms of streamlining the system.</P>
      <P>The HSE was established without a CEO, which does not make sense at the most basic level. One does not have to be senior manage<Col N="1055"/>ment to realise that this creates difficulty. The director of finance vanished very early in the life of the HSE. The disappearance of the director of the hospital authority received much publicity but we do not know why the director of finance left. What are the difficulties in the management of finances in the HSE? I regret we do not have more time as this subject requires much more attention and detailed investigation. I hope the Minister will accept the invitation of the Joint Committee on Health and Children to attend a meeting to address this in more detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to share time with Deputies Gregory and McHugh.</P>
      <P>In the 200 seconds I have to speak on this issue I wish to hold the Minister to account. The Minister has indulged in some creative accounting. Yesterday the Minister for Finance told us we would have, in the Government&rsquo;s term, a carry over of &euro;56 million. This is public money and the public wants to know what is going on in the Department of Health and Children. Can the Minister state what is going on? I believe she cannot because it is a Department that is out of control.</P>
      <P>Other speakers referred to a litany of incompetence, and we have seen a scandalous waste of money, including PPARS, the nursing homes, the Dunne inquiry, MRSA and the accident and emergency units crisis. All this has happened on the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s watch, a shocking litany of unparalleled and abject failure. The T&aacute;naiste promised greater efficiency and value for money. Where is the value for money? Where is the efficiency and accountability? Where is the world class health system the T&aacute;naiste promised this House? It was suggested by some that we ought to give this Government a pocket calculator. That might stretch its capabilities. I suggest we give the Government an abacus that will allow simple subtraction and addition. The T&aacute;naiste is getting her figures so badly wrong that at this stage we are discussing gross incompetence and bungling on an unprecedented scale.</P>
      <P>Who will take responsibility for this? Is it the T&aacute;naiste or the HSE? Will anybody resign? It seems that under the administration of Fianna F&aacute;il and the PDs nobody takes responsibility. That is the difficulty. The figures shows a capital underspend of &euro;57.5 million. The T&aacute;naiste misspent public money in the past and she suggests that the underspend will not make any difference to services. Try telling that to the hundreds of people on trolleys this evening. It certainly would make a difference.</P>
      <P>It is time the T&aacute;naiste and the Government got their act together regarding health. The people will hold them to account. The T&aacute;naiste may feel the people will forget about it. She stated in the past that people have short memories. They are wising up to this Government and the T&aacute;naiste will be found out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The revelation yesterday of a massive accounting blunder by the Health Service Executive came eight days after the HSE told the Department of Health and Children it wished to alter the figures previously presented in the D&aacute;il in the context of the Appropriation Bill. This is how the matter came to light according to the Minister for Finance yesterday. The question must be asked as to why it was not announced as soon as it became known. Why was it not put before the D&aacute;il in a proper manner by way of an appropriate motion, amending legislation or Supplementary Estimate? As was pointed out earlier, the use of a personal statement by the Minister for Finance for this purpose is clearly contrary to Standing Orders. If a member of the Opposition attempted to do this, he or she would be ruled out of order.</P>
      <P>The bigger question is how such an error could have occurred and what it says about health service governance in this State. It is shambolic to say the least. It is another blow for the credibility of the Government and its health policy and management, and for the credibility of the HSE which was established with such fanfare. The Government used the HSE as a shield to deflect criticism from itself over the rolling crisis in our public health services. Today that tactic has come back to haunt the Government, which has used the HSE to reduce its own accountability to the D&aacute;il on the health services. As I stated this morning, we now have a situation, as exposed in reply to a D&aacute;il question I asked, where approximately 46% of D&aacute;il questions tabled to the T&aacute;naiste as Minister for Health and Children are referred to the HSE. That compares to a figure of less than 30% to the health boards when they were established.</P>
      <P>Coming on top of the PPARS scandal, this blunder further undermines public confidence. This is dangerous at a time when the Government is in alliance with the private health business, clearly to the comfort of the T&aacute;naiste, and is pursuing a privatisation strategy in our health services. There are those who will use blunders such as this to undermine the principle of public provision of health care. That principle must be maintained, despite the efforts of the T&aacute;naiste and her colleagues to shift the entire emphasis in our health care structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I want to nail the spin put on this situation, that &euro;56 million is a small amount of money when taken in the context of the &euro;11 billion budget of the new Health Service Executive. It is true to say it is a small percentage in the context of the HSE's overall budget, but anybody or any Minister who feels that &euro;56 million is a small amount of money has completely lost touch with reality.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Apparently what happened was that &euro;56 million allocated for capital projects was not spent for that purpose but was instead used on day to day spending. The question must be asked as to <Col N="1057"/>what capital projects suffered as a result. Was it the Tuam community hospital promised by the Taoiseach four years ago and not delivered to date? Was it the ambulance base for Tuam to serve north-east Galway, south Mayo and west Roscommon that has not been delivered, resulting in patients' lives being put at risk on a daily basis? Was it the primary care unit for Tuam promised but not delivered? If it was any of those projects, will the T&aacute;naiste assure us during the question segment of this debate that the Tuam projects will be included in this year&rsquo;s capital projects programme.</P>
      <P>My colleague from Clare, Deputy James Breen, who was anxious to speak on this debate but was unable to do so due to time constraints, is equally concerned about Ennis General Hospital, where funding was allocated but not spent. Perhaps the T&aacute;naiste will take the opportunity today to explain why that funding was not spent and what she proposes to do about Ennis General Hospital. In the later part of this session will the T&aacute;naiste outline what projects have suffered, particularly whether Tuam or Ennis suffered? The total amount for those projects is the same as the amount that was misappropriated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory"><NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of the delay in the capital programme for 2005 I want to raise the urgent need for a decision on the future of Temple Street Children&rsquo;s Hospital. The plan for a new modern children&rsquo;s hospital on the Mater site has been ready to go to final tender since last year. Despite many inquiries by the Temple Street Children&rsquo;s Hospital authorities, there is still no indication of approval from the HSE to allow the new children&rsquo;s hospital to progress. This is despite several commitments, including from the Taoiseach, that work would start this spring and be completed by 2009. Who is taking responsibility for the health services? Is it the Government and the T&aacute;naiste or is it the new bureaucrats of the HSE?</P>
      <P>Temple Street Children&rsquo;s Hospital desperately needs new modern facilities. It has some of the busiest accident and emergency departments, wards and theatres in Ireland, with queuing, a lack of privacy, an extremely dedicated staff and grossly inadequate facilities. The children of the northside of Dublin need Temple Street Children&rsquo;s Hospital and deserve better treatment than this. They deserve the new facilities this Government has promised for so long. Apparently that promise has now been broken. Will the T&aacute;naiste honour the commitments already given on Temple Street Children&rsquo;s Hospital? Will she act like a Minister for Health and Children and get this project back on the rails and back on the timescale promised to start in the spring of this year?</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste should specifically answer this question when she replies. It is not only the dedicated staff and the parents of children in the hospital who are dependent on this new modern <Col N="1058"/>facility. The entire future of the northside of Dublin is also dependent on it. The facility has been given commitment after commitment and promise after promise. A total of &euro;45 million has already been spent on developing the proposal, which was put on hold at the final critical stage when it was ready to start. I want a full explanation for this. The people and children of the northside of Dublin deserve an answer to these questions. I ask the T&aacute;naiste to take whatever steps she can to ensure the HSE responds to the requests from Temple Street Children&rsquo;s Hospital and get the project moving. It is urgently required.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter of the &euro;56 million is not the only one that indicates a cavalier attitude towards accountability in Government spending. The Minister for Finance has questions to answer regarding this issue. The June memo was discussed earlier. It is quite clear that the Department of Finance told the Department for Health and Children that it was unclear how the costs were and continued to be appropriated as between current and capital spending, that current items were treated as capital and that it must stop. That is what the Department of Finance stated in June.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Another meeting was held in September for the Department of Finance relating to what was happening at the Department of Health and Children. It stated that no sanction had yet been given for any IT spending in the HSE for 2005. However, it was aware that substantial moneys continued to be spent, despite the lack of sanction. For PPARS and FISP, it had informal indications that this could amount to &euro;1.75 million per week.</P>
      <P>This appears to indicate that although no sanction was given for such expenditure, up to &euro;1.75 million was being spent every week within the Department of Health and Children. I want the T&aacute;naiste to clear this up&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department of Finance&rsquo;s role in this regard is also important. This took place between June and September. Another important issue is that Professor Drumm did not get his capital budget until July.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a final question. Will the T&aacute;naiste repeat her remarks regarding the sum of &euro;12 million? Apparently, an over-expenditure of &euro;12 million was indicated in December, which appears to have increased to &euro;56 million by January. How did the figures change over the months? What happened?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope it will not sound arrogant to state that there appears to be a complete misunderstanding as to what happened. First, I will reiterate the point in my speech that there was no misappropriation, no money was misspent and no money went missing. It was not the case that any capital money was used on the revenue side. I wish to make it clear that that did not happen.</P>
      <P>As for Deputy Twomey&rsquo;s comments in respect of the Department of Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Finance said so yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>No, he did not. As for the Department of Finance memorandum dated 28 June, it stated that it would be wrong to spend any capital money on current expenditure or <i>vice versa</i>, and it would have been wrong had it happened in this case. However, I will reiterate my earlier remarks. On 22 December, the HSE gave the Department a forecast. Each month the HSE meets the Department and we align expenditure with budgets. It&rsquo;s forecast stated that it had an underspend on the capital side of approximately &euro;56.4 million for the year and an underspend on the revenue side of &euro;11.9 million. The appropriation account was drawn up on the basis of that forecast and the figure of 10% was carried over. It was an estimate of what the HSE thought the outturn for the year would be.</P>
      <P>On 17 January, the HSE informed the Department that it appeared that the forecast might change in that while it still had an underspend on the capital side of &euro;57.4 million, it might have an overspend on the revenue side of &euro;53 million, and that it would not have the final outturn until 31 March, when it is obliged to so do under legislation.</P>
      <P>The HSE did not use capital funds on the revenue side. If the HSE&rsquo;s estimate turns out to <Col N="1060"/>be the position in March, we will seek the Department of Finance&rsquo;s permission to use the surplus on capital to make up the deficit on the revenue side. However, it is not the case that the HSE&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is exactly the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it did not spend capital money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>It will simply wait until March to have it approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>We are discussing possible outcomes. The outturn will be revealed on 31 March. Lest Members do not understand, we have moved from an accounting system based on income and expenditure under the old health boards. Under that system, one measures what is spent, what is raised, what income has been generated that has not yet been received and what expenditure has been incurred that has not yet been paid. While we must continue to use that system, we have also moved to what is called an accrual system, which is an exact picture in time. As the Department of Finance informed the Committee of Public Accounts in February, this is a significant transition and will take some time to complete. However, I reassure the House that there was no question of the HSE using capital funding on the revenue side. It has given us details of what the picture looks like as of January and we will know the final and true picture on 31 March 2006.</P>
      <P>Moreover, with regard to my statements this morning on the Order of Business, Deputy Twomey should be aware that the old health boards were able to maintain overdrafts. If the old health board regime was still in operation, this transparency would not exist and we would know nothing about this matter. Hence, in 2005 we were obliged to pay off the old health boards&rsquo; overdraft of &euro;130 million and were obliged to pay &euro;90 million in pay and PRSI as a once-off measure. Effectively, this covered the pay and PRSI for the month of December of the previous year, which was included in the 2005 budget. This explains the sum of &euro;216 million about which I understand the Deputy has tabled a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has not answered the question which has been asked by several Deputies. Why was the money not spent on the capital programme? What was lost as a result? Where was the money spent, which is almost equivalent &mdash; the T&aacute;naiste is simply playing with words at this stage &mdash; to the amount overspent on the revenue, or the day to day expenditure side. On what was it spent? Why was there such an enormous divergence, of more than &euro;50 million, between a forecast in the middle of December and the middle of January? Allowing for Christmas, this was period of a couple of weeks.</P>
      <P>Who has been the Accounting Officer from 1 January 2005? Surely the T&aacute;naiste now accepts that she was far too hasty in establishing a new <Col N="1061"/>authority to take over the entire management of the health service without a CEO and without proper preparation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Kevin Kelly was the Accounting Officer from 1 January. He was the acting CEO of the organisation and I believe that Professor Drumm became the Accounting Officer on 14 August, when he took over as CEO. With regard to the capital side, clearly capital projects are scaled or phased. The capital budget was not approved until July 2005 because of the transitional arrangements from the old health boards. This year, the capital budget will be approved in February. Clearly, a capital budget that has not been approved until July poses major problems for an organisation. We always knew, as I have acknowledged in the House, that there would be transitional issues in 2005, given that, effectively, we moved from 11 organisations to a single organisation.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will acknowledge, the forecasts and estimates do not enable me to ascertain how the overspending might have taken place. This will not be known until we see the final set of accounts, which this House and the Comptroller and Auditor General require to be produced by March 31. In no accounting arrangement in the world &mdash; I know this even from an example such as running an organisation like a political party &mdash; and in no commercial organisation does one finalise one&rsquo;s accounts exactly on 31 December. Everyone has a couple of weeks or months into the new year to finalise their accounts and their position.</P>
      <P>As for the figure given on 17 January, Professor Drumm was being cautious and prudent. He stated that this might now be the position and immediately we alerted the Department of Finance. As the Minister introduced his Appropriation Bill, he correctly informed the House of the potential issue regarding the final outturn in March. I stress that while there may be an issue, equally there may not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste has used an interesting phrase, namely, &ldquo;transitional issues&rdquo;. For how long will we experience these transitional issues? In other words, for how long will the position get worse before it gets better? The T&aacute;naiste has repeated her assertion that it is not correct to state that money was used for current spending when it was intended for capital purposes. However, does she not understand that this is how it appears when one examines these figures and sees a capital underspend of &euro;57.5 million with a current overspend of &euro;53 million? Are we not examining this sufficiently carefully or has the T&aacute;naiste explained it in a different way? She mentioned the manner in which people do accounts, even in political parties, but is it not the case that one can bandy around figures and make them look as one wishes?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Gormley should take a lesson from Deputy McManus and confine himself to questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I have just asked a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>If we are going to answer questions about this issue, it is important that we deal with reality rather than with perceptions. It is not the case that the HSE had a sum of capital funding available, intended for all kinds of capital projects, which it decided to switch over to spend on salaries, wages or other current expenditure, such as the items mentioned by Deputy Bruton earlier when he referred to home helps and medical cards. Both are examples of current rather than capital expenditure. The HSE did not do that. Its position is that, as of 17 January, it appears as though it has a &euro;57 million underspend on the capital side and an overspend of &euro;53 million on the revenue side. If that is the case, it will only be able to offset one against the other subject to the permission of the Department of Finance. If that permission is not forthcoming, I will come before the House with a Supplementary Estimate for the overrun on the revenue side. The HSE has not done that. It has simply totted up both sides and given its position. However, it did not use money identified for capital expenditure on the revenue side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Subject to approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course it would be subject to approval. If it did what has been suggested, namely, to use capital money for current expenditure, it would be a serious breach of the rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>It knows it will get permission to so do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>No, there may have to be a Supplementary Estimate. It does not know that it will get permission to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what will happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason we moved from the income and expenditure basis for accounting to the accrual method is to have an exact picture, greater transparency and greater accountability. I strongly stand over the decision of the Government to make the chief executive officer, who has responsibility for delivering services, also financially accountable. I stand over that because one cannot have responsibility without accountability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>How long before it happens?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department of Finance stated in a memo to the Committee of Public Accounts that it would take some time to make the transition from 11 financing systems into one. They are doing extraordinarily well. Among the staff at the HSE level are people who worked formerly <Col N="1063"/>for the Comptroller and Auditor General. The HSE has much expertise in this area.</P>
      <P>This is the largest change management process ever undertaken in this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is why it is dangerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and one of the largest ever done in the world. That is a fact. It is being done for good reasons, to provide a more streamlined effective delivery of health care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not happening. Was any of the &euro;56 million underspent on the capital side used to pay administrative staff?</P>
      <P>When the Health Service Executive was set up and the 11 health boards were abolished, what happened to the chief executive officers and all their staff? None of them was sacked or anything like that. What are they doing now and what are they being paid to do now?</P>
      <P>On the cutbacks in home help, I received a letter from the Health Service Executive in late December stating&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Would the Deputy confine himself to questions because there are a number of Deputies offering?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a question. I want clarification on this. The letter stated that there are people in Clonbur who would take up the post but there is an embargo on the recruitment of staff at present. In reply to a parliamentary question yesterday, the Minister stated that her Department has not imposed any limits on the recruitment of staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a matter appropriate to Question Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there an embargo on the recruitment of staff for home help? I am aware of cases where home help has been cut back from eight to four hours and the Health Service Executive informs me it cannot appoint anybody. If the money available were released, we would be able to keep people in their own homes rather than put them into institutional care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy&rsquo;s question is &ldquo;No&rdquo;. The answer to the second part is we have invested substantial new moneys in home help for 2006. It is not a question of there being any&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Why is there an embargo on the recruitment of staff?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>There is not. There are ceilings in the health system. It does not apply to home help, to accident and emergency services or to the packages for disability and the elderly. We have appointed more than 40,000 new staff to the <Col N="1064"/>health service in the past seven years. Clearly we must be prudent and sensible in the areas where we recruit new staff. It would be mainly in the area of front-line workers where the additional staff would be recruited. The home help service is not affected. On the contrary, it will be greatly expanded during 2006.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>What happened to the CEOs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, most of the CEOs have retired and are in other jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>They are pushing paper in offices. What are the former CEOs doing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a good question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Was the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children serious when she stated in her speech that there is a gross saving of &euro;4.5 million rather than a non-capital spend of &euro;56 million, a figure which, incidentally, was given to the D&aacute;il in November when the Estimates were published just before the budget? She states that, by running the &euro;56 million and the current overspend of &euro;53 million together, she is creating a saving of &euro;4.5 million? She just stated that the distinction between capital and current spending is critical and it would be wrong to confuse them. I put it to her that the spin in her speech is designed to mix them even more than the Taoiseach&rsquo;s syntax. Would she respond to that? As the Department&rsquo;s current expenditure figure is wrong by &euro;53 million and there is a &euro;56 million carryover, is the error in the Department&rsquo;s account nearly &euro;112 million?</P>
      <P>In the budget before last, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children will recall that the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s great invention was the 10% capital carryover. She is now playing ducks and drakes with it. It was published in the Estimates and it was confirmed by this House as part of the budget package. Why is the Minister for Finance not sitting beside her to account for his great budget reform of capital carryover permission when she and the HSE have made a shambles of it?</P>
      <P>Did somebody in the HSE go to Enron and look at that company&rsquo;s accounting practices because it is precisely this kind of sleight of hand that usually lies at the bottom of financial misrepresentation? The statement the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children made today is a disgrace. It is unworthy of her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Burton is an accountant and no doubt understands, perhaps more than most, the difference between income and expenditure and accrual accounting etc.</P>

	<P>Fiddling figures.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1065"/>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>She accuses me of getting involved in creative accounting by stating there is a &euro;4 million surplus and yet she goes on about &euro;112 million. In order not to confuse people &mdash; Deputy Burton is a member of the Committee of Public Accounts &mdash; the outturn for 2005 must be clear by 31 March when the CEO signs off on the accounts and presents them to the Comptroller and Auditor General. That would be the true picture but the CEO, to be cautious and prudent, stated on 17 January that this is what it looks like: a &euro;57 million underspend on capital and a &euro;53 million overspend on revenue. When one takes the overspend from the underspend, one still has a surplus of &euro;4 million in the health system. That is not&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Rubbish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>No. All day we are being accused of overspending, mismanagement and misappropriation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>That is Enron accounting.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>No, it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Nobody misappropriated any money or misspent any money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Except the service was cut back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have total confidence in Professor Drumm and the management of the HSE. It is being suggested that this is a major scandal and somebody did something terribly wrong. That did not happen. If we had not changed the accounting system, we would not even be having this debate. As I stated, I was not asked many questions and people were not screaming in the D&aacute;il last January when the health boards ran an overdraft of &euro;130 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste had a means of stopping that, there and then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>If the HSE could run an overdraft, we would not be having this debate either but we will not do that anymore. More transparency, a clearer picture&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I asked what happened to the carryover. It is abandoned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I am conscious that the time is flying and others wish to contribute. Why was the matter not announced when the information was given by the HSE to the Department last Tuesday week? When exactly did the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children become aware of this matter? As the information was known well in advance of the commencement of yesterday&rsquo;s business, the first day of the D&aacute;il following the recess, why was this matter not put on the D&aacute;il schedule for this week in the normal course? Is it not ironic the that HSE has imposed penalties for alleged inefficiencies on hospital sites, including on Monaghan, Cavan and Navan hospitals in my region to the tune of &euro;1.5 million, and yet has itself overseen such gross inefficiency to the tune of &euro;56.4 million? Surely this will not be sold at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Oireachtas votes the total sum for the HSE and the Department and switching money from one subhead to another does not require the approval of the Oireachtas. When the HSE informed us on 22 December, the Secretary General of the Department informed me. I remember him telling me the position on the day, and again on 17 January.</P>
      <P>I am not being told I should have made a statement on 22 December to the effect that the situation is so one day and otherwise the next. The reason the Minister correctly brought it to the attention of the House was because of the implications for what he had done in the appropriation accounts, but even he made it clear yesterday that it may be the position. Equally, it may not be the position when we see the final accounts. That is a fact.</P>
      <P>It is important to stress here that there is no question of any impropriety, mismanagement or misappropriations of money from the capital to the current account. That did not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy James Breen. A number of Deputies have not spoken yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>

	<P>Does the Deputy have a question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a question. The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children met the Ennis hospital action group 12 months ago. Will she now confirm whether Ennis General Hospital will remain an acute medical and surgical unit, with a 24-hour accident and emergency service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know what this has to do with the HSE accounting issue. Commitments made by the HSE during 2005 regarding facilities at Ennis hospital will be fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister indicated all that was required was the authorisation of the Department of Finance in a case like this but that is not true. Will she confirm that in respect of a deviation such as this the practice followed by the former health boards was that the accountancy department in the section concerned had to authorise the over-expenditure in the first instance and the non-expenditure under the other heading? Following this, authorisation was provided by the Department of Finance, not the other way around.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Minister referred to overspending of &euro;200 million several years ago by the former health boards. Will she confirm that the then Minister and the Department knew of the overspending well in advance, it was monitored on a regular basis, the Minister was kept up to date and it was not a surprise by any stretch of the imagination?</P>
      <P>With regard to overall expenditure on health services, this is a new but dangerous system. Will she confirm that, normally, clear indications were given at regular intervals throughout the year regarding expenditure under capital and current headings and any deviation from that had to be immediately authorised by the Accounting Officer with health board staff and members being notified at an early date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is saving up for the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Switching from one subhead to another and balancing the position is a matter for the Department of Finance and if the Department did not approve it, a Supplementary Estimate would be required. That is the technical procedure.</P>
      <P>Precise detail is not provided week by week when a Department is spending &euro;11 billion. Estimates close to budget are provided, as people try to forecast demand. Many of the schemes under the aegis of my Department, similar to other Departments, are demand-led and they can vary.</P>
      <P>While it was known the former health boards had overdrafts, I was not aware of the extent of the overdrafts. The precise amount was not known until early 2006 and that was when the <Col N="1068"/>figure of &euro;216 million emerged, comprising &euro;90 million for staff and PRSI and approximately &euro;130 million for the overdrafts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>Why does the financial year of the HSE not coincide with the Department&rsquo;s financial year? That would be logical. Even the Revenue Commissioners changed from an April to April financial year so that they could reconcile accounts. The same scenario could emerge next year if there is not certainty regarding the conclusion of the financial year.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated &ldquo;No planned service or planned capital project will be affected by this&rdquo;. A sum of &euro;56 million will not be available for capital projects. Will the Minister have to introduce a Supplementary Estimate to replace this sum, if it has been expended elsewhere?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The capital budget surplus had not been spent on revenue, which cannot happen without approval. The Minister for Finance confirmed in the House yesterday and in the Seanad earlier that there is no question of the capital budget suffering a loss of &euro;56 million.</P>
      <P>The financial year is the same. While the accounts will be produced by 31 March, they will relate to the calendar year, 1 January to 31 December 2005. That is the same as the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday the clear impression was given that money would be transferred from the capital budget to a day to day spending budget but the Minister has said this is not true. Can she guarantee the sum of &euro;56 million will carry over from last year to this year&rsquo;s capital programme? That is important because the money is desperately needed.</P>
      <P>Will a Supplementary Estimate be introduced because there is overspending on day to day spending? If the Minister is to guarantee the carryover in capital spending, such an Estimate will have to be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, in accordance with the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s contributions in the House yesterday and the Seanad earlier, there will be no loss to the capital programme and, therefore, if the situation that emerged on 17 January pertains when the accounts are signed off, what the Deputy is suggesting will have to happen. The 2005 accounts will be balanced and the shortfall will have to be made up so that the capital budget will not suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not saying it is gone. If the position on 17 January turns out to be the final position for 2005, there will be a surplus in capital funding of &euro;56 million and an overspend on revenue. One of the options in reconciling this is to balance one against the other with the permission of the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister cannot guarantee that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>No. If that turns out to be the position, the Minister of Finance is on record in both Houses that there will be no overfunding of the capital programme as a result of this matter.</P>

This situation is provided for in the public financial procedures&rdquo;. Why does she continue to insist there is no question of the capital budget being used for current spending? Is she concerned about the underexpenditure of <Col N="1070"/>the capital budget when people are crying for money for a variety of capital projects?</P>

	<P>In view of the underspend on capital funding and the Minister&rsquo;s statement that no planned capital project will be affected, does this explain the unexpected decision last December not to grant permission to Temple Street Hospital to proceed with a capital project, despite the necessity for the hospital to meet its agreed start date of spring 2006 and completion date of 2009?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>When did the Minister find out the amount of the overdrafts? When did this information become public? I do not recall hearing a figure of &euro;120 million in 2005. I only heard about it when a departmental official got back to me in November 2005.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The overdrafts were in the Revised Estimates published early last year.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Gregory&rsquo;s question, the Mater-Temple Street project will cost almost &euro;500 million. It will comprise a major proportion of the HSE&rsquo;s capital programme for several years. Tertiary paediatric facilities in the Dublin area are provided at Crumlin, Tallaght, Beaumont and Temple Street hospitals. Paediatricians, therefore, are spread around the four hospitals to look after sick children. That does not make sense for tertiary treatment in the city or the State. Every paediatrician to whom I have spoken has voiced this opinion.</P>
      <P>The review of tertiary paediatric services established by Professor Drumm will be completed by 31 January. The Mater and Temple Street hospitals have sought approval to proceed with the construction of a carpark. Professor Drumm recently met the hospital authorities and informed them that this application is on hold pending the outcome of the paediatric review. There is no point spending &euro;200 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money on a tertiary facility if it is not appropriate to our needs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>The hosting of the Ryder Cup at the K Club in September is a key event for Irish tourism this year. While the event itself will undoubtedly contribute significantly to overseas tourism revenues in 2006, the principal benefits of the agreement between Ireland and the European tour will flow from the promotional package that is part of the agreement and which has extended in the nine years since the agreement was signed. In this context, the Government has made a significant level of resources available to F&aacute;ilte Ireland to ensure the tourism spin-off to Ireland, and to golfing tourism in particular, is maximised. This has involved one of the most intensive and sustained tourism event promotion programmes ever undertaken and this year&rsquo;s event will be an exciting and spectacular culmination to this promotional campaign.</P>
        <P>This programme is not only about promoting Ireland as a premium golf destination. The media coverage of this major sporting event presents a unique opportunity to market all that Ireland has to offer as a tourism destination. To that end, both F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland have been working closely together over the last number of years in the lead up to the event to optimise the promotional spin-off and this work will intensify over the course of this year.</P>
        <P>For example, Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s network of overseas market offices are being deployed to maximise the positive publicity which the television coverage, with an expected audience of over 1 billion in 150 countries, will generate. Working with the Ryder Cup team in F&aacute;ilte Ireland, an unprecedented level of promotional activity has been organised around the staging of the competition. In all our key markets, dedicated budget lines have been allocated to Ryder Cup related activities, including print advertising, direct mail campaigns and consumer promotions at key golfing events in the lead-up to the event.</P>
        <P>In regard to golf tourism specifically, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has used the Ryder Cup as a central plank of its golf marketing activity since 1999. For instance, Ireland has taken advantage of the golf events supported as part of the Ryder Cup deal to showcase the best of Irish golf across our key markets. Many of our overseas visitors cite televised coverage of the Irish Open, European Open or Irish Seniors Open as their first exposure to Irish golf. Furthermore, F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s marketing team has attended key golf tournaments across all key markets to showcase the best of Irish golf, be it links or parkland. This year the team, in conjunction with the various regional tourism authorities, will take promotional stands at 13 of the Ryder Cup qualifying events.</P><Col N="1072"/>
        <P>In addition, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has put in place arrangements that will allow the marketing team to piggyback other tourism products on the back of the exposure being secured around the Ryder Cup. They will be placing multi-product destination advertisements rather than solely golf material television advertising around all key golf events in 2006, including the Ryder Cup.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister ensure that the Ryder Cup will be free-to-air for Irish viewers? I understand the promoters have reached an agreement with Sky television whereby the latter will have the sole rights to broadcast the competition. RTE, meanwhile, can show only delayed highlights. This is simply not good enough for the vast majority of Irish golf enthusiasts, including many young people. Only one in four households avail of Sky&rsquo;s services and there may be major expense for a significant number of golf enthusiasts in securing access to live broadcasts.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister give a commitment on behalf of the Government in this regard? I understand the consultation period has finished. The Minister has made some hard statements on behalf of viewers. Will he confirm that RTE viewers will enjoy this historical competition, the third largest sporting event in the world, free-to-air?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>As the House is aware, all broadcasting matters, including the broadcasting of major events, are governed by the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act 1999 and the associated Designation of Major Events Order 2003, which fall under the remit of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey. In this regard, I understand the Minister recently announced his intention to conduct a review of the list of events designated as of major importance to society, for which the right of the qualifying broadcaster to provide coverage on a free television service should be provided in the public interest.</P>
        <P>In inviting submissions from interested parties and members of the public on the designated events and the possible designation of additional events, the Minister also announced his intention to consider the possible designation of the 2006 Ryder Cup in the course of the review. It would be inappropriate for me to offer comment on this issue until that review is completed. I appreciate there will undoubtedly be interest among golf fans and other members of the public in seeing the Ryder Cup matches live on terrestrial television. However, the television audience that is my priority from a tourist perspective, and the focus of our investment in securing the event, is the worldwide television audience of 1 billion in 150 countries to whom the Ryder Cup will be broadcast, thereby giving our tourism agencies an unprecedented opportunity to showcase the island of Ireland.</P>

He has taken similar actions in the past in regard to the effect of section 481 on the film industry. Does the Minister have information on the position of RTE, which I understand made a submission? What is its view on the prospect of providing only delayed transmission of the highlights of this event?</P>

I am not privy to information on the source or contents of these submissions. I have said it would be inappropriate for me to comment on this matter, pending a review of the submissions by the Minister. I confirm, however, that I have been in contact with him on this issue.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Arts, Sport</askee>
        <Quest>and Tourism if he agrees that alcohol sponsorship has no place in sport; his further views on whether legislation must be brought in to remove any option open to sporting organisations regarding alcohol sponsorship; his plans to introduce such legislation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[2549/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>On 22 September 2004, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children launched the second report of the strategic task force on alcohol, which included representatives of my Department and the Irish Sports Council. The report recommends that national sporting bodies, with high youth participation, develop a proactive strategy to find an alternative to alcohol sponsorship.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I support this recommendation, which is in keeping with the provisions of the Irish Sports Council&rsquo;s Code of Ethics and Good Practice for Children&rsquo;s Sport in Ireland, to which national governing bodies of sport have subscribed. The development of such a strategy is a matter for the individual national governing bodies of sport. This derives from the recognition that the independence and autonomy of sports organisations, their affiliates and individual clubs, have remained a fundamental principle underpinning successive Governments&rsquo; support for Irish sport.</P>
        <P>In any debate on issues arising in connection with the sponsorship of sport, it is important to retain perspective. Governing bodies and clubs across the spectrum of sports freely acknowledge that sponsorship from the business and commercial sectors provides much needed financial, material and promotional support. This has the effect of freeing up other resources which can then be invested in the development of the sport, increased participation and improved facilities. I <Col N="1074"/>agree, nevertheless, that where alcohol is concerned, great care must be taken by sports organisations to ensure the nature and extent of any sponsorship is proportionate and appropriate to the environment in which sporting activities take place. This is particularly important when it comes to assessing the effect such sponsorship could have on children and young people involved in sport.</P>
        <P>I am pleased that the three major field sports, the GAA, FAI and IRFU, have moved away from sponsorship by alcohol interests in so far as it relates to their underage activities and competitions. The GAA, in particular, acting in response to its alcohol task force, has recently appointed a full-time alcohol abuse officer, who is developing a strategy in regard to alcohol for the association.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Legislation to prevent sports organisations from availing of sponsorship from alcohol interests is neither necessary nor appropriate. I prefer instead to exhort all governing bodies to ensure restraint and good judgment are applied in regard to such sponsorship at all levels of their organisations. In this regard, the recent initiative taken by the GAA serves as an example of a mature and considered response to concerns articulated by its membership. It provides a model which could be followed by other governing bodies in the interests of both sports people and the health and welfare of the wider population.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply. There are two sectors involved in this. One is at national level, which the Minister outlined in regard to the national governing bodies. However, there is also a major problem at grassroots level whereby clubs are sponsored by public houses, inns etc., in their own area. There is an onus on clubs sponsored by such sources, regardless of the sport involved, to have their members return to them following their sporting activities. Members feel obliged to frequent the establishments that give them the most sponsorship. As 25% of deaths on our roads have been related to drink driving problems, it is with the grassroots level of sponsorship I have major concerns.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Minister do something about this? We have had the report from the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to which the major bodies signed up. However, it has not reached the grassroots level where the major problem exists. I attend many sporting events and people appear to feel obliged to return to the club that sponsors the sport. This creates a problem after such events, because young people travel to the pub and drive home afterwards. I tabled the question to explore whether something could be done about this. Is there funding available to help to alleviate or redirect the clubs from drink related sources of sponsorship?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1075"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>Everyone will welcome the code of ethics published by the Irish Sports Council and the fact that sponsorship is not allowed in the GAA where people under the age of 21 are concerned. They will also agree that where sponsorship and advertising occurs, it should be appropriate and proportionate. There should not be an over-sell in this context.</P>
        <P>The difficulty sports organisations in general experience is that they find it difficult to fund their various sports. I accept that in an ideal world it would be best if alcohol sponsorship in sport could be discontinued. However, clubs and national organisations say that without funding from these sources very often they would not be able to improve participation levels or provide the kind of facilities required in this day and age to enable people to enjoy the sport in which they are involved.</P>
        <P>The strategic task force report is important. The interim report published in May 2002, and the second report published in September 2004, are quite useful. It is important that young people do not associate a given sport with alcohol. I exhort all sporting organisations to follow the lead of the GAA where people under the age of 21 are concerned. I call for proportionality and appropriateness in regard to the remainder of drink sponsorship.</P>

        <Quest>and Tourism his views on the way in which tourism is affected by a lack of price display and price increases by certain public houses and accommodation providers during key tourism and sporting events such as the upcoming rugby season, St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day and other crowd-pullers in view of eight Kilkenny city publicans being fined in January 2006 for failing to display drink prices; if discussions have been held with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in terms of measures to prevent same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[2521/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I have already stated very clearly in the House, and particularly in response to Question No. 5 on 22 March 2005, my views on the tourism impact of price increases prior to or during major sporting and other events.</P>
        <P>While excessive profiteering by a small segment of the sector around special events may be legal, it is not helpful to the reputation of any tourism destination. It may be capable of being rationalised from a narrow, short-term, economic perspective but it would be unfair to tar the entire sector with the same brush.</P>
        <P>The reality is that we live in a free market and the tourism sector, just like other traders, is generally entitled to charge what it wishes. The problem is that Ireland tends to have a weak consumer culture. We tend to be reluctant to pursue <Col N="1076"/>complaints about price, service or quality, even when we have legitimate grounds for so doing.</P>
        <P>There is no legislation specifically governing rates charged by accommodation providers. However, all hotels must be registered by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and they must display a notice stating their maximum prices. If consumers are charged more than the stated maximum, they should take it up with management. If they are then forced to pay more, and have evidence to prove it, they should report the matter to F&aacute;ilte Ireland, or its agents, who will take the matter up with the hotel concerned.</P>
        <P>There is no legislation in place that prevents publicans from increasing their prices prior to or during an event. However, the Retail Price (Beverages in Licensed Premises) Display Order 1999 obliges all premises where alcohol is sold to display the price of alcohol and soft drinks both inside and outside the premises. This gives consumers the information they need to decide, in advance, whether to accept the prices displayed.</P>
        <P>I have not discussed this issue with my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. However, I am aware that the publication of the price surveys undertaken by the Director of Consumer Affairs, allied to increased consumer vigilance, has had some positive effects. The change in practice around the time of the rugby internationals in Lansdowne Road is a case in point. Last year, the Director of Consumer Affairs reported that only two out of 26 premises surveyed had raised their prices on the day of the match. This confirms my view that the best and ultimate regulator is the consumer and suggests that the extent of the practice of increasing drink prices around special events may be exaggerated at times.</P>
        <P>I note the comments made by the Director of Consumer Affairs, in the case of the Kilkenny publicans, that &ldquo;the fines imposed by the Judge totalled &euro;1,300 while the total award in costs amounted to &euro;2,400. It is extraordinary that all eight licensed premises failed to display their drinks price lists at the same time. It makes one wonder whether there was a concerted plan to raise prices during the festival.&rdquo; The director said that her office would continue to enforce the drinks display legislation, as this was a key entitlement of the customer who could then choose where to drink on the basis of value for money. These judgments should send a message to the trade that it must display its prices.</P>
        <P>The Deputy might also note that my Department has taken the initiative of contacting the Director of Consumer Affairs, requesting that a special investigation be undertaken around the time of the Ryder Cup to ensure that price lists in restaurants and public houses are displayed prominently, and it has been informed that the appropriate checks will be carried out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments on this issue. As he said, it is mind-bog<Col N="1077"/>gling that eight publicans in Kilkenny city were caught at the one time. One wonders was there some sort of concerted effort in this regard given that Kilkenny is such a beautiful city, such a crowd-puller and a major tourism attraction of which we should be proud. I am not highlighting this to demean Kilkenny, but it might send out a message to other publicans to stop this practice which will damage business in the town in the long term.</P>
        <P>In regard to hoteliers, in particular, they are currently required to display their price list on the wall. They display a particularly high maximum price so that whenever a suitable event or demand arises they can go to that peak price, to which most of them would adhere. What are the Minister&rsquo;s views on introducing legislation which would create a clear minimum-maximum differential so that they could not have such a high price away from their off-season price? During the peak summer season, they charge three quarters of the maximum price, but if they think they will get away with it, they charge the full price. Could this matter be investigated so that hoteliers would not be able to charge prices which exceed their minimum off-season price? In that way people would be assured of getting value and quality.</P>
        <P>Given that the Minister has not yet discussed the publicans issue in this context with his colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and that such price-taking during events is legal, could a legislative approach be taken to ensure that a company or other entity, be it an accommodation provider or a publican, could not charge more than a fixed price at a certain time? Publicans are less limited than hoteliers in this context. Could a legislative route be followed to ensure such protection and, if so, would the Minister favour that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not consider that legislation is the answer to this problem. The fact that publicans must display their prices is welcome. The Director of Consumer Affairs was highly critical of eight Kilkenny publicans recently, and rightly so. However, she confirmed that the majority of publicans do not increase their prices in the way in which those Kilkenny publicans did.</P>
        <P>The regulations governing hotels and registration with F&aacute;ilte Ireland are clear. They must display their maximum prices. It is impossible for us, given that we are without the necessary legislative tool, to insist at a given time of year that they would charge less than the maximum price and that they would not charge the maximum price in the off-season or in respect of special events. All we can do is ask people to complain to us if the maximum price is exceeded. They can do this by contacting F&aacute;ilte Ireland. Unfortunately, there are people who will be unscrupulous. In the final analysis the market finds its own level. In time people discover who is and who is <Col N="1078"/>not involved in unfair pricing and make decisions accordingly.</P>
        <P>I am anxious, particularly during the course of major events, that there would not be price hikes which are unfair to the consumer. In that context, for example, we asked that the Ryder Cup event be closely monitored to ensure that people do not leave this country following their visit here for it with the view that they were charged unfairly, or treated badly or wrongly.</P>

        <Quest>and Tourism if preferential treatment will be given to sports organisations which have applied under the 2006 sports capital programme to provide a sports hall on the grounds of or adjacent to primary or post-primary schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>All applications for funding received under the 2006 sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, will be considered in accordance with the various requirements and assessment criteria which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. Primary and post-primary schools wishing to be considered for funding under the programme may only apply for funding jointly with local sports clubs or community groups and must meet other conditions, including a requirement that the local community will have significant access to the proposed facility, at least 30 hours a week throughout the year, when it is not being used by the school. Any sports facility proposed for funding by a sporting organisation and which would be located within school grounds would have to meet these same conditions.</P>
        <P>To encourage full use of facilities funded, applications for funding are requested to indicate the extent to which they have consulted with other clubs and organisations in the community, including schools. A commitment from schools that they will utilise the intended facility would be important and would increase the project&rsquo;s assessment score. Any such applications received this year will be considered and assessed on that basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that the Department of Education and Science gave a low priority to the provision of sports halls at primary and second levels and that the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor advised schools that they should turn their general purpose rooms into classrooms when a problem with accommodation arose, I appeal to the Minister to ensure that any application which includes the provision of a sports hall for a school, be it primary or post-primary, be considered positively, given that it is the only way such a school may be able to provide a sports hall.</P><Col N="1079"/>
        <P>I carried out a survey of primary schools last year prior to Christmas to which 1,400 responded. Of that number, only 322 schools had sports halls. Of those, only 32 had a sports hall larger than 170 sq m or the size of two badminton courts, which is quite small. Therefore, 310 schools had sports halls smaller than that. With our weather conditions, unless schools have indoor sports facilities, it is impossible for teachers, especially in primary schools, to carry out a physical education programme. As a result, children in many schools are not exposed to any physical activity from October to May as it is impossible to provide for that when the necessary facilities are not in place. The Minister has an opportunity under this programme to do something about that.</P>
        <P>Owing to the lack of physical activity among children, the report of the national task force on obesity showed that 300,000 children are either overweight or obese and that condition is increasing by 10,000 every year. The national children&rsquo;s food survey in 2005 showed that one out of every five children in the five to 12 year old category are either overweight or obese. The children in this age category are those attending primary school. The increase in the incidence of this condition is a problem of epidemic proportions. The Minister can play a role in the provision of facilities by giving preferential treatment any application received to provide a sports hall or similar facility on the grounds of or adjacent to a primary or a post-primary school.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>It should be pointed out that since 1998, under the sports capital programme, 4,923 grants have been awarded to various sporting organisations. This has occurred in every city, town, village and parish. The value of the grants in total is &euro;395 million. Children would have access to these facilities. We have covered considerable ground in providing sporting facilities for the nation.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the funding of schools&rsquo; sports halls is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Hanafin. As I outlined in my reply, the assessment criteria for applications under the sports capital programme include the extent to which integrated facilities are available to a school and its wider community.</P>
        <P>Additionally, my Department has commenced work on the development of a sports facility strategy that will advocate a planned approach to the provision of sports facilities at local and national level. An inter-agency steering group has been established to oversee this work. It includes representations from the Department of Education and Science. One of the key areas being examined as part of this strategy is community access to school facilities. This relates to both optimising use by local communities of existing school facilities outside school hours and how the Department might provide funding to plan sport <Col N="1080"/>halls in schools to enhance the facilities, where necessary, to facilitate a wide range of sports.</P>
        <P>However, there are genuine concerns within schools relating to issues such as security, insurance and running costs which can be barriers to facilitating community access which need to be addressed. Where schools benefit from funding to enhance their facilities on the basis of the wider benefit to the local community, there needs to be a mechanism to ensure that this access is provided and maintained into the future. It is expected that work on this strategy will be completed later this year.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Last year we received 30 school applications. A total of &euro;634,000 was allocated to seven primary and post-primary school projects which met the criteria I outlined. I accept the need to improve physical education facilities in schools. We will look carefully at any applications received this year from schools which have the support of the local community.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Despite the acknowledged investment in community facilities, I remind the Minister that such provision is not impacting sufficiently on the primary or post-primary sectors, given that less physical education is provided now than was provided 25 years ago. I repeat that his Department should examine its overall policy in terms of where resources are directed. The Government has failed dismally in the provision of facilities at primary school level. If such facilities had been provided, we would not have many of the current health problems in society, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, which is relevant at present.</P>
      </Speaker>

It is clear that applications from schools which have the support of local communities will be considered. I remind Deputy Deenihan that the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism is responsible for the provision of sports facilities to all the population and not just to a single segment of it. Therefore, it has to take community access into account when school applications are being considered.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As I previously advised the House in response to similar questions on 17 November 2005, individual actions and measures relating to tourism promotion and development in specific areas of the country are day-to-day functions of the State tourism agencies. I was pleased to launch the economic report referred to by the Deputy, The Case of Ireland West, which was commissioned by Ireland West Tourism. The report, an important work, complements the report of the tourism policy review group, which highlighted the economic and regional importance of the tourism sector and the issues and challenges which need to be faced if we are to ensure the benefits of tourism growth are spread throughout the country. National tourism policy has placed a particular emphasis on putting policy measures in place, arising from the policy review document, New Horizons for Irish Tourism: An Agenda for Action, to achieve a wider regional spread of tourism business. This is important as the increase in shorter breaks and urban tourism continues to bite in rural areas. In 2006, F&aacute;ilte Ireland will invest over &euro;60 million in developing regional tourism, for example by supporting local festivals, building capability and strengthening the tourism product. It will channel approximately &euro;10 million directly to the regional tourism companies, which are responsible for promoting and developing tourism, so they can strengthen and enhance their operational and marketing capabilities this year. This investment is designed to ensure a high-quality visitor servicing experience at key tourist information offices and a strong overseas promotional effort.</P>
        <P>Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland are rolling out some innovative approaches in 2006, which should heighten the regional impact of Ireland&rsquo;s marketing activities nationally and overseas. F&aacute;ilte Ireland is introducing a new local area marketing fund to help the industry to generate additional business in 2006 and 2007. As it recognises the importance of home holidays at regional level, it proposes to invest &euro;4 million to sustain the recent remarkable growth in the home market. It will advertise domestic holidays and short breaks for 44 weeks of the year to reach and stimulate the impulse market. F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s website, <i>www.ireland.ie</i>, generated 500,000 direct sales leads to the tourism industry in 2005. As activities and attractions &mdash; things to do and see &mdash; are central to increasing the average spend per visitor, F&aacute;ilte Ireland intends to continue to concentrate on product development, such as <Col N="1082"/>developing and promoting looped walks, angling, festivals, cycling routes, equestrian, golfing and water based activities. A new &euro;1 million innovation fund will be available to industry groups seeking to develop and market new tourism initiatives. The recruitment and training of people to work in tourism remains a key issue for the industry across all regions. F&aacute;ilte Ireland has decided to deliver 80 return to work programmes in 55 locations. Four temporary training centres will be set up to attract approximately 500 local people into tourism. The programmes which are run at the workshops have proved to be extremely popular as a means of providing training relevant to the needs of local employers. F&aacute;ilte Ireland recognises the particular pressures on small tourism businesses. In response, it is establishing tourism business networks in every county as a practical step to help small businesses to address their development needs.</P>
        <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
        <P>Tourism Ireland will invest an estimated &euro;5 million in 2006 to support the promotion of the regions of Ireland overseas. It will engage in additional co-operative marketing with all regions. Key activities include presenting &ldquo;super region&rdquo; brands based on strategic marketing alliances between adjoining neighbour regions. Building on the success of the Go West initiative, which was launched last year, Tourism Ireland is proposing an enhanced joint marketing programme for the regions. The campaigns will highlight the attractions of the area, such as ease of access, and present good value packages from the industry to consumers in the key markets of Great Britain and mainland Europe. Tourism Ireland will also present and promote a series of all-island tourist theme trails, or rainbow routes, to help tourists to get the most out of their visit. The themes of the trails will include music, gourmet interests, literature, history, Christian heritage and houses and gardens. The trails will be cross-regional. Tourism Ireland will further promote and support regional access development and reinvigorate the car touring sector.</P>
        <P>The House will appreciate that visitors cannot be forced to go to a particular location against their will. Individual communities and operators in the regions are primarily responsible for presenting and marketing compelling attractions, facilities, accommodation and experiences that deliver value for money and quality service. The Deputy will be aware that the initiatives to which I have referred are being pursued against a backdrop of the restructuring and refocusing of the delivery of tourism at regional level. They will eventually lead to the provision of a one-stop-shop for the tourism industry in the regions, with strong regional representation. The revision of regional tourism structures, which I have fully endorsed, is based on the PricewaterhouseCoopers and Travers reports on how best F&aacute;ilte <Col N="1083"/>Ireland might carry out its development mandate throughout the country. The PricewaterhouseCoopers report highlights the need for a much wider and strategic brief for regional tourism. It recommends a greatly increased emphasis on targeted marketing, product development and enterprise support and suggests establishing an integrated linkage between regional tourism strategy and national policy and exploiting avenues to leverage increased resources. An implementation group, chaired by Mr. Finbarr Flood, was established to assist F&aacute;ilte Ireland in implementing the recommendations of the two reports. F&aacute;ilte Ireland expects that changes on foot of this work will be seen in the regions later this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply on this matter. It is obvious that the report initiated by Ireland West Tourism has many interesting implications for employment for the west. It highlights the decrease of 21% in the number of people employed in the agriculture sector. How does the Minister envisage that the proposals he has announced will address that loss of employment? Can we examine the potential of agri-tourism, for example, in reversing the obvious decline in farm incomes?</P>
        <P>It is vitally important for the west that the Ryder Cup should be broadcast on free-to-air television. Just one in four houses in this country subscribes to Sky television. Given that a great deal of tourism promotion will take place at all the Ryder Cup qualifying events, as the Minister has said, he should use all his powers to encourage his ministerial colleague, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to take a positive decision to ensure that free-to-air facilities are made available for the Ryder Cup. If we do not provide for such facilities, we will be shooting ourselves in the foot in our attempts to encourage people to come to Ireland to play golf. There are some smashing golf courses in the west. If live coverage of the Ryder Cup is confined to Sky television, many of the tourists who come to Ireland next September without tickets for that event will be unable to watch it on television.</P>
        <P>Can the Minister outline the current position in respect of the Shannon stopover, particularly as it relates to the west as a whole? I have asked the Minister about the smaller airports in the west, such as Galway Airport and Sligo Airport, on many occasions. What can we do to try to ensure that such airports are successful? I am aware that Aer Arann uses the facilities in question to increase the number of flights into the west. Can anything else be done to ensure the west attracts the maximum proportion of those who come to Ireland, especially from the UK, for shorter periods, such as weekends? What aspects of the airports should be developed to attract such tourists to places like Galway, Castlebar and Westport in the same way as they are attracted <Col N="1084"/>to Dublin? I do not think the extra costs would have much of an effect on people who like to take short weekend breaks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not doubt that the concentration on the regions by Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland will lead to an increase in agri-tourism. It is important to point out that the west had a better tourism year in 2005 than in 2004. I agree with Deputy Wall that access is of crucial importance. In that context, it is particularly welcome that transatlantic traffic increased by 17% last year. The willingness of American Airlines, the largest airline in the world, to voluntarily start direct flights into Shannon Airport, as well as Dublin Airport, represents a vote of confidence in the future of Shannon Airport. Ryanair&rsquo;s decision to locate its European hub at Shannon Airport constitutes a further vote of confidence. I do not doubt that the Shannon Airport Authority will succeed in attracting a considerable amount of business to the very fine airport it runs. I do not anticipate a reduction in the numbers of passengers coming through Shannon Airport from all sources. I expect that such numbers will increase, just as there will be a substantial increase in overall tourism numbers in the years to come. We need to continue to improve access to all parts of the country. Transport 21, which involves the provision of &euro;34 billion over ten years, is of crucial and fundamental importance in that regard. The outlook for the tourism industry is extremely bright, in general terms. Indicative figures for this year will probably show that this country has exceeded its target, which is particularly welcome against a difficult and competitive backdrop.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 34 together.</P>
        <P>The staging of the Olympic Games in London in 2012 will offer this country some great oppor<Col N="1085"/>tunities in the fields of tourism and sport, as well as in the wider business area. As a nation, Ireland must be prepared to take full advantage of its proximity to this event. As I have already indicated, I intend to establish an interagency group to oversee the development of a planned approach to ensure that such opportunities are maximised. Since the announcement last July that London was selected as the host city, I have availed of numerous opportunities to outline Ireland&rsquo;s eagerness to play a useful role and to be closely associated with the games. When I met David Hanson MP, Northern Ireland&rsquo;s Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure, we discussed the opportunities for Northern Ireland and the Republic to benefit through mutual co-operation from the games. We will keep channels of communication open relating to our respective strategies around London 2012 and we are committed to close co-operation in this matter. I have also discussed the situation with Richard Caborn MP, the British Minister for Sport, who has warmly welcomed the approach being undertaken on an all-island basis here in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The General Assembly of the European Olympic committees held in Dublin last month was another opportunity to promote Ireland&rsquo;s potential in regard to the games. It was attended by leading figures from World and European Olympic organisations, including the president of the International Olympic Committee, Jacques Rogge. It was also attended by the successful London bid team and its chairman, Lord Sebastian Coe. This major conference afforded a unique opportunity to draw the early attention of this highly influential group to the many services which Ireland can offer to Olympic squads from around the world. I take this opportunity to congratulate the president of the Olympic Council and his colleagues for hosting this conference which was of immense importance and brought great prestige to Ireland.</P>
        <P>Clearly there are opportunities in the fields of sport around pre-tournament training for many of the countries participating. There will also be a tourism dimension for tournament visitors. In addition, there may be a number of sporting events in the years leading up to 2012 that could yield similar opportunities. The supply of economic services to London 2012 may also be another significant area of opportunity for which Irish business interests might benefit.</P>
        <P>Given the lead-in time to 2012, there is scope to identify the precise nature of sports and ancillary facilities required by visiting countries to plan ahead. The type of facilities required by competing teams would be along the lines of those envisaged in the proposals for a sports campus at Abbotstown and existing to a certain degree in the University of Limerick. We are aware that 25 Olympic medals have been won by spokespersons from abroad who have used the existing facilities in Limerick.</P><Col N="1086"/>
        <P Just="Left">The funding provided in December&rsquo;s budget, will allow work to commence in 2006 on the first phase of the Abbotstown sports campus to be completed by 2010. Complementing this are proposals currently under consideration for an Irish institute of sport, to deliver optimal support services for Olympic and Paralympic athletes and sports. These developments together with the ongoing provision of substantial funding for sports facilities at national and regional level under the sports capital programme will ensure that Ireland is on track to provide state-of-the-art facilities for sports men and women to train and prepare for competition at the highest level.</P>
        <P>The Government will continue to invest significant funding in Irish sport which has already seen in excess of &euro;500 million provided since 1997 for the development of sporting facilities. This funding has helped to develop facilities of international standard for many sports, including swimming, diving, rowing, hockey, tennis, basketball, boxing and athletics, and many of these facilities will be availed of in a structured way in the lead-up to the 2012 games.</P>
        <P>From a tourism perspective, Ireland stands to gain significantly from the London Olympics in 2012. Our proximity and ease of access to the main venue, with our traditional selling points as a tourism destination &mdash; our people, culture and scenery &mdash; should make a stay in Ireland a very compelling proposition for both spectators and participants alike. There are points in Ireland which will have a closer proximity to the London games and greater ease of access than many parts of Britain.</P>
        <P>Tourism Ireland as an all-island body will seek to maximise the tourism benefits of the Olympics to the island as a whole. In the lead-up to the event, Tourism Ireland will identify key opportunities in our overseas markets aimed at both competitors and spectators. This could include publicity messages in relevant markets should Ireland be successful in attracting countries for pre-training. The agency will work closely with Visit Britain, particularly in our new and developing markets and North America, to maximise awareness of Ireland as a close neighbour to the United Kingdom.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>Obviously the Olympic games in London in 2012 are almost as significant as the Ryder Cup in regard to tourism and sport in Ireland. Given the competition for pre-training bases and bases for the actual games, has the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism been in contact with Irish Embassies around the world to ascertain their interest in seeking pre-training bases or bases in Ireland during the Olympic games? When will the interagency to which the Minister referred be put in place? Obviously it will include members of the Sports Council and the Olympic Council.</P>
        <P>On the last day we discussed this issue the Minister and I said the GAA has its own identity <Col N="1087"/>and its own regulations. This is an opportunity to extend the hand of sport to ensure Ireland benefits most. The national sports councils that have facilities that would attract foreign countries to prepare a base here should be contacted. Given the Minister&rsquo;s success in representing the Government side in regard to Croke Park, although not involved in the decision-making process, this is another opportunity to extend the hand of sport through the mechanisms of the GAA, the IRFU and the FAI to facilities that can be used.</P>
        <P>Apart from the Ryder Cup this is the most important sporting event here and in the UK since 1948. I hope we can use every facility and all the goodwill in sport in Ireland to attract as many countries as possible for pre-training or actual bases during the Olympic games. Have the Irish embassies been contacted? Are there possibilities in respect of sport organisations? When will the interagency be put in place? Will we see a detailed programme of events leading up to the games and a successful association with these games?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate Deputy Wall&rsquo;s intervention and recognise the important opportunities provided for Ireland as a result of the London Olympics 2012. We have to plan ahead. The agency will be established as soon as possible this year and will have the role of making the necessary contacts with a view to maximising the opportunities for Ireland. We should state our strengths. There has been considerable interest in the university in Limerick because of its facilities, including a fine swimming pool. There is also the National Aquatic Centre in Abbotstown. There are other sports we should target. Those that come to mind are rowing &mdash; we have a fine national rowing centre at Inniscarra &mdash; boxing and equestrian sports.</P>
        <P>The first phase of Abbotstown should provide further facilities which will attract visiting teams. The new indoor arena which will be constructed in Abbotstown by the end of 2010 will provide for 30 minority sports so that I envisage us having facilities for groups interested. We have a range of facilities across the country that we did not have heretofore. Therefore, I anticipate a great degree of interest by visiting Olympic teams from across the globe. I am not saying they will all want to come here but some will. The University of Limerick has had inquiries. It is important to avail of the opportunity from a tourism perspective. That is why Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland will be involved in ensuring we maximise the amount of tourism revenue we can obtain from foreign sources as a result of people attending the games. In this context the continued strengthening of access to and from Britain by air is of immense importance. I sincerely hope this continues and I believe it will.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1088"/>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister referred to the University of Limerick and rowing. Is he aware of a very exciting proposal by the University of Limerick to build a top class facility for rowing that would cost in the region of &euro;4.6 million? The university can provide &euro;4 million of that amount. Would the Minister look favourably at providing the balance? I have asked him this question before.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking questions in response to what the Minister said. The rules should be applied fairly to everyone.</P>
        <P>I tabled a question today on the institute of sport but it was ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office. The Minister recently referred to this matter. I do not know why the question was rejected by the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office but I will take this opportunity to ask the Minister when he thinks the institute of sport will be provided and where it will be located. I agree with what he said. Whatever about the Olympic Games in 2012, it is most important to have a sports institute in this country, as exists in Australia and Canada, if we are to produce world class athletes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>We will certainly give consideration to any application which the University of Limerick makes, although such an application would possibly be more appropriate to the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It will get nothing from that Department. The Minister&rsquo;s Department is the university&rsquo;s only hope.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>If Deputy Deenihan feels our Department is the only hope I suppose we will look at it and do what we possibly can.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what it looks like.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In reply to Deputy Deenihan&rsquo;s question on the institute of sport, we have had some important developments in recent months in the world of sport, namely the GAA&rsquo;s recognition in tangible terms of the integrity of its congress&rsquo;s decision with regard to Croke Park <Col N="1089"/>and the fact that we will start the sports campus at Abbotstown this year, allied to the application for planning permission having been lodged for Lansdowne Road. These are important milestones. To crown these, it would be important that we develop an institute of sport. In that context, the Sports Council is still formulating its plans. I do not know when exactly it will have them finalised. My view is straightforward, namely that we need an institute of sport if we are to assist elite athletes to reach their full potential. If we do that, hopefully they will be successful in the international arena which will make them role models and heroes and heroines for young people who, in turn, will be attracted into sport, thereby increasing participation levels.</P>
        <P>Since becoming Minister for sport, I have always advocated the requirement for an institute of sport. This has had the Taoiseach&rsquo;s backing for a considerable period and he is of the same opinion. Therefore, I anticipate that we will be establishing an institute of sport. I cannot give the precise date or time but I sincerely hope we will be in a position to proceed with it this year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 16 and 75 together.</P>
        <P>Following a decision in principle taken by the Government in 2004, Deputies will recall that Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited, CSID, undertook an indepth preparatory process and drew up proposals for the development of the sports campus in a series of phases. Phase I of the development control plan proposed the development of pitches and ancillary <Col N="1090"/>accommodation catering mainly for rugby, soccer and Gaelic games, the sports which engage the greatest number of people in Ireland. In addition, an indoor sports centre is planned to cater for a range of indoor sports with spectator accommodation, and publicly accessible all-weather floodlit synthetic pitches are also included.</P>
        <P>The Government had an initial discussion on the proposal early last autumn and requested that further analysis be carried out by the Office of Public Works in connection with the delivery of the project. I reported to my Cabinet colleagues on the outcome of this additional work in November 2005. The Government gave its assent to the project and funds for the delivery of the project have been provided in my Department&rsquo;s capital envelope for 2006-10.</P>
        <P>CSID, the company charged with developing the campus project, has taken the planning and preparation of the project forward since that date and has laid down a challenging schedule for the coming years to put in place this welcome and much needed programme of sports facilities which will enable Irish sports men and women to benefit from state-of-the-art facilities here in Ireland, as is only appropriate. The estimated cost of the project is &euro;119 million. A sum of &euro;9.5 million has been provided in my Department&rsquo;s budget for 2006 and funding has been agreed for the period 2007-10.</P>
        <P>CSID is now proceeding to implement the Government decision. In addition to providing the sports facilities I have just listed, discussions have commenced, with the approval of the Government, on providing a site for a hospice on land adjacent to Connolly Hospital and talks are already under way with the FAI about the location of a new headquarters for the organisation in the former State Laboratory building at Abbotstown.</P>
        <P>As regards the opportunities which will be opened up by the London Olympics in 2012, I am very conscious of the need to have top class sports facilities in place in time to provide good training opportunities for Irish athletes, and at the same time promote Ireland as a location for foreign teams wishing to avail of training for these games. Clearly, the timely development of a sports campus at Abbotstown, together with the other major facilities already in place, will be a key element to Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to provide state-of-the-art training facilities which would attract competing athletes to locate here.</P>
        <P>To give added impetus to the drive to capitalise on the opportunities of the London Olympics and to ensure a joined up approach which would take account of sporting, tourism, commercial and economic considerations, I intend to establish an inter-agency group to co-ordinate and support the work of the agencies already working in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact that this development has finally been put in place and that we will <Col N="1091"/>see progress from this year with the completion of the first phase in 2010. The obvious need for this facility has been stressed by various spokespersons and the Minister over a long period of time. It is welcome news for the various sports that will be facilitated at Abbotstown.</P>
        <P>In regard to the FAI, will the costings involved be underpinned by the sale of the Merrion Square facility which it currently owns? The Minister stated that 30 minority sports would be facilitated. Will this just be in terms of the sports campus or will these sports have administrative back-up facilities provided to them? A shared approach to administration, computer facilities and so on could be of major benefit to minority sports that make a significant contribution in terms of the development of sport in Ireland. Is that a feasible proposition? Most small sporting bodies are hampered by the prohibitive costs associated with administration and if something could be done about this we could see these sports gaining a new momentum. These groups do not have the kind of following associated with the GAA, the FAI or the IRFU and lack the funds to develop their facilities. It would be of benefit to them if the administrative burden associated with running competitions, keeping track of membership and so on could be reduced or done on a collective basis. I listened today to the radio to some of those hoping to participate in the Winter Olympics. One can see the costs that such people must bear on a personal basis as well as the costs for organisations. If something like that could be done, it would make a major difference in the future for the overall perspective of developing sport in all the sectors and associations involved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>The Campus Stadium Ireland Development Company is in negotiations with the FAI regarding the possibility of the latter moving its administrative offices to the laboratories at Abbotstown once they have been refurbished. In addition, discussions are under way with national governing bodies of sport in charge of what I may describe as minority sports in the country with a view to seeing whether user agreements can be negotiated with them to provide administrative offices for them. All of this is very welcome because clearly it means that administrative costs are reduced. I do not know what the FAI will do with its Merrion Square offices, which is a matter for the FAI itself.</P>
        <P>With regard to the provision of facilities, the indoor arena at Abbotstown will provide for more than 30 minority sports. That is a major development. Regarding the cost of running competitions and being involved in sport, I recognise that the unsung heroes and heroines of Irish sport are the 400,000 among the population who devote their time and energy to promoting sport, particularly among young people.</P><Col N="1092"/>
        <P>Funding for the Irish Sports Council, which was given statutory recognition in the year 2000, has increased considerably over the past five to six years. In 2000, its budget was &euro;13 million while this year its budget is &euro;40.9 million. Accordingly there is much more money available for distribution to the national governing bodies of sport. At a very pleasant function at lunchtime today, we announced core funding of &euro;7.5 million for the national governing bodies of sport and they were very appreciative of that. Further announcements on disbursements by the Sports Council will be made as the year goes on. We have certainly improved the position of the national governing bodies of sport and are seeking to improve it further.</P>

	<P>With regard to the National Aquatic Centre at Campus Stadium Ireland, has a structural report been prepared on the reported defects of the building? A structural review was carried out on the part of the building damaged by storm in early 2005, and at the time I called for a structural report on the entire building. Has that been carried out and have defects been identified? If so, have they been repaired? Is the Minister happy that the National Aquatic Centre is now in good working order and that there will be no further problems with structural defects to the building?</P>
        <P>With regard to the concentration of facilities on Campus Stadium Ireland, which I agree with and always supported, not all athletes will have access to these facilities because of distance. Has the Minister a spatial strategy for sport whereby there would be facilities in all regions so that all our athletes and potential athletes will have access to top-class facilities? There are no other comparable facilities to those in Limerick and Campus Stadium Ireland to accommodate all junior and budding athletes and senior athletes, and they will not be able to reach their full potential unless they have ready access within short travelling time to top-class facilities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>During the severe weather conditions experienced in the west Dublin area on 1 January 2005, damage was caused to the National Aquatic Centre. The roof of the 50-metre diving pool was damaged, as was the roof of the leisure water area, in addition to damage to lights and fittings around the complex. Kavanagh Mansfield and Partners, consulting structural and civil engineers, were commissioned to examine the damage and oversee the repairs. Repair works for the National Aquatic Centre were completed on 20 May 2005 and the centre was reopened to the public on that date. Kavanagh Mansfield and Partners have certified that the programme of works was carried out in accordance with the requirements of the design and secured certification from the designers, contractors and subcontractors for the various elements of the works.</P><Col N="1093"/>
        <P>To date, no State expenditure has been incurred in this work. Campus Stadium Ireland Development Company has taken an approach that payment for the repairs is a matter for the contractor and the insurer to resolve between them.</P>
        <P>In June 2005 there were media reports about alleged leaks at the National Aquatic Centre. These stories were unfounded and may have been connected &mdash; I do not know &mdash; with other extraneous issues. Arising from those reports, Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited arranged that Rohcon Limited, the company which constructed the National Aquatic Centre, should carry out an inspection of it. The inspection team conducted a technical examination of the entire centre with particular reference to the structural integrity of the concrete works. The inspection involved experts in the field. It was led by Rohcon and included S&amp;P Architects, URS Structural Engineering, Europools, specialist subcontractors, Davis Langton, PKS Project Management and Kavanagh Mansfield and Partners, consulting structural and civil engineers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Rohcon found no evidence of any structural defects or of any water leaking into the plant, despite what had been alleged in the media. The company found some leakage through pipe joints and valves, which in its view was an operational and not a structural matter. In addition, a test was carried out which confirmed there were no leaks from the swimming pools. URS Structural Engineering confirmed the concrete works were designed and constructed to meet the British standard 8007. They confirmed that any cracks which existed were not leaking, were not of a structural nature and were entirely normal for a building of this type. Rohcon published the results of its findings on 7 July. Campus Stadium Ireland received a separate report from its own structural engineers, Kavanagh Mansfield and Partners, which supported the Rohcon findings, but unfortunately these reports, stating there were no leaks, received very little coverage in the media. The original media reports were unfounded, untrue and incorrect.</P>
        <P>Deputy Deenihan spoke of the possibility of providing other centres of excellence throughout the country. Unfortunately, resources only go so far. We have had a very successful battle with a view to providing funding to start the first phase at Abbotstown. I also appreciate the encouragement and support received from both principal Opposition spokespersons in this respect. I anticipate that in future years, Governments will add pearls to the Abbotstown necklace and will end up with a sports campus of international standard which will be capable of hosting any event.</P>
        <P>The provision of further facilities throughout the country is dependent on the sports capital programme. As I said earlier, we have provided almost 5,000 facilities at a cost of &euro;395 million in every city, town, village and parish. We have touched every home. I hope these facilities will <Col N="1094"/>help people to participate but, unfortunately, we cannot have an Abbotstown in every parish.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>Is any costing available for the necessary refurbishment of the offices at Abbotstown? Is that figure available to the Minister? I understand that the overall cost of changing the similar agricultural aspect at Celbridge came to either &euro;116 million or &euro;165 million</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>The intention is to begin the work on the laboratories this year and the provision by my Department for this year is &euro;9.5 million. I do not know if that will cover the entire cost but anticipate it will and that we will be in a position to refurbish and accommodate the FAI, I hope by the end of the year and certainly by next year. This will be of considerable assistance to the association. I do not know the precise figure involved, but the provision for this year is &euro;9.5 million.</P>

	<P>Will the entire site of approximately 500 acres be used for sporting facilities or is it planned to sell off part of the site for housing as mentioned in the D&aacute;il this week? Did the Minister see the proposal from a particular organisation to establish a race track there?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>While I have heard of proposals to have an indoor or even an outdoor track at Abbotstown, I have not received a formal proposal unless Horse Racing Ireland has one. That is a matter that would receive consideration if it was put forward. It was part of the agreement with the Minister for Finance that a portion of the land at Abbotstown would be utilised for commercial purposes and that negotiations would take place with the relevant local authority to see whether planning permission could be forthcoming. It was intended that the funding that would be acquired from the sale of that portion of land would be utilised to finance the campus at Abbotstown. Either way sufficient land will be available to provide a centre of sporting excellence at Abbotstown. It is my wish and fervent hope that future governments, regardless of political persuasion, will continue to put pearls on the Abbotstown necklace.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the 30 minority sports, is that the number that have applied or the number that can be facilitated? Is there room for manoeuvre on that figure? It would be a pity to get this far if there was a cap on the number that could be facilitated. Is that the number of applications or the figure the Minister believes will be the total?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the latter. I believe the figure will be in the order of 30 or 32.</P>

        <QRef>[2503/06]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland offers a unique horseracing experience to the race going public both at home and abroad. I am satisfied that Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, in close collaboration with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, is very much engaged in marketing that unique experience overseas. Horse Racing Ireland, as the national authority for racing, includes within its remit, the representation of Irish racing abroad. Through its board, its senior executives and its international marketing subsidiary, Irish Thoroughbred Marketing, it promotes and enhances the reputation of the Irish thoroughbred industry internationally. Horse Racing Ireland&rsquo;s five-year strategic plan specifically prioritises the development and promotion of Ireland as a world centre of excellence for horseracing and breeding and I have every confidence that it is committing the necessary resources to that task.</P>
        <P>Having just returned from a very successful Irish trade mission trip to India, headed by the Taoiseach, I witnessed at first hand the influence of Irish horseracing abroad. The Irish Trophy Race, held in Mumbai Racecourse, was won by an Irish bred horse, Golden Triangle, ridden by Niall McCullagh. Golden Triangle is now one of the leading sires in India. I had the honour of presenting the winning connections with their prize to bring to a conclusion a highly successful trip.</P>
        <P>I am aware that Horse Racing Ireland specifically targets overseas visitors to Irish race meetings particularly race-goers from the UK. For 2006, it has earmarked over &euro;1.5 million for overseas promotion. The UK race-goer in particular presents an outstanding opportunity for inward tourism based on the Irish racing product. It is estimated that in the region of 60,000 UK visitors come racing here each year and the three agencies, Horse Racing Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland consider that there is substantial potential for growth from this market given the fact that in excess of 6 million attendances are recorded annually at race meetings in the UK.</P>
        <P>This is a highly affluent target sector with a propensity to spend on hotels, restaurant, car hire and other forms of entertainment. UK racegoers are used to paying as much as double the Irish rate for reserved enclosure access which, combined with the favourable sterling to euro exchange rate, give us an unprecedented opportunity to offer a high quality racing experience <Col N="1096"/>at relatively better value than is available in the United Kingdom.</P>
        <P>In addition to its own initiatives, Horse Racing Ireland has a long-standing relationship with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland in jointly promoting Ireland as a destination for racing tourism. At the behest of my Department, the three agencies are actively exploring possible synergies and in that context, Horse Racing Ireland specifically identified the Punchestown festival as an attractive event to increase inbound racing tourism. I understand that discussions between Horse Racing Ireland and the tourism agencies are well under way and that Horse Racing Ireland is committed to a significant marketing campaign in the United Kingdom in 2006 as part of a joint campaign with both tourism agencies. I am confident that the combined expertise of the agencies will produce the right result for horseracing and for tourism.</P>

      <sTitle>Hospital Staff.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment this afternoon. This is not the first time I have raised on the Adjournment the issue of nursing shortages experienced at Kerry General Hospital. Almost eight months ago I warned the Minister that Kerry General Hospital was so under-resourced and understaffed that it could not conceivably continue to deliver the present level of service and that services would need to be curtailed if a commitment to provide additional nursing posts was not given.</P>
        <P>At the end of May 2005, the industrial relations officer of the INO, Mr. Michael Dineen said:</P>
        <P LI="1">Our members within Kerry General Hospital are under severe pressure to deliver an appropriate level of care to the patients in their charge due to staff shortages. If the present position continues, it will only exacerbate the difficulties being experienced as nurses will inevitably leave rather than continue to work in the current environment.</P>
        <P FLI="0">At that time I was informed by the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, that representatives of the southern area of the HSE had offered to meet the INO representatives shortly afterwards to discuss the hospital staffing issues. Unfortunately, it took until today, when the INO was forced to threaten industrial action, for progress to be made between the Health Service Executive southern area and the INO. I welcome the outcome of today&rsquo;s meeting.</P>
        <P>A staffing review will take place at a meeting between the Health Service Executive and the INO next Wednesday. At that meeting, in the event of staffing deficiencies being identified, I ask both the HSE and the Minister of State in his reply on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, that a clear commitment be given to have these deficiencies addressed. Otherwise, we may have a recurrence of this threat of work to rule.</P>
        <P>I am not privy to what happened at the meeting but I understand a clear commitment was given by the representative of the HSE that vacancies would be filled as they arise and because of that industrial action at Tralee General Hospital was averted today. I understand that a bank of nurses within the hospital will be established for additional shift work if called upon, which will be done in a structured way. The services of agency nurses will also be retained in a structured fashion. They will fill any temporary vacancies that may occur as a result of absenteeism or so on.</P>
        <P>The level of under-staffing at Tralee General Hospital stems from the failure to take the need <Col N="1098"/>for the relief component into account when staffing arrangements were being made. I understand that a hospital&rsquo;s nursing staff relief component is usually 25% of the total nursing staff level, which is approximately 410 in Tralee. When one considers the need for a relief component, the hospital should, therefore, have between 490 and 500 nursing staff. Provision is made for a relief component at all other hospitals in the country.</P>
        <P>Tralee General Hospital should be upgraded to a band one hospital. It has a turnover of 22,000 patients per annum between inpatients and day patients. Hospitals with a throughput of more than 16,000 patients per annum generally fall into the band one category. It is clear that Tralee General Hospital thoroughly deserves band one status and funding should be increased commensurate with the activity level in the hospital.</P>
        <P>When the hospital first opened in 1984, 15,000 patients used the accident and emergency department annually. This figure has jumped to more than 30,000. A nurse was absent from the unit today but a replacement nurse was not provided for the day. This is a regular occurrence. I call on the Minister of State to visit or ask that his senior Minister visit Tralee General Hospital during her forthcoming visit to County Kerry to meet the management, staff and consultants to discuss service levels.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment on behalf of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. As Deputy Deenihan is aware, operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services lies with the HSE, including responsibility for the provision of services at Tralee General Hospital. It would not be appropriate for the T&aacute;naiste to intervene in industrial relations matters in Tralee General Hospital. Existing industrial relations mechanisms and procedures are in place to discuss and resolve issues of dispute.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children has been informed by the HSE that the threat of industrial action by the INO to which the Deputy referred has been withdrawn. The HSE has reported that a review of nurse staffing levels at Tralee General Hospital to commence on 1 February 2006 has been agreed. The review will be undertaken by an external consultant.</P>
        <P>It has been acknowledged by all sides in this dispute that every effort will continue to be made to maintain current nurse staffing levels using all available resources. Hospital management has stated that the same high quality of patient care will continue to be delivered by Tralee General Hospital.</P>

      <sTitle>Variant CJD Incidence.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for permitting me to raise this issue. It is the second <Col N="1099"/>time I raised the sad case of a 24 year old constituent who contracted CJD. I raised it on 5 May 2005 when the young man was still in hospital. Jason Moran of Shankill, County Dublin has since died. At his recent inquest, the Dublin County Coroner called for a State investigation into Jason&rsquo;s death and the possibility that there may be a CJD cluster in the local area.</P>
        <P>It has emerged that three cases of variant CJD were closely linked geographically, namely, the case of Jason Moran from Shankill, a second case in Bray and a third case with close family ties in Ballybrack. The total distance between the places where all three cases occurred is approximately five miles.</P>
        <P>As I stated in May, Jason Moran contracted variant CJD in Ireland. He had not been out of the country prior to the time in which he could have picked up the disease and it follows that he must have contracted CJD from a meat product purchased and consumed in Ireland. That two other cases have such close geographic links to Jason raises obvious questions as to whether there are CJD clusters.</P>
        <P>The State authorities have a duty to investigate how Jason Moran contracted variant CJD in the first instance and whether there are any links to the other cases. I understand that the HSE has been asked to carry out some inquiries. I would like to know more about their nature and whether it is intended to publish the outcome. I do not wish to raise an alarm about the cases concerned but, given the Jason Moran case and two others, the possibilities must be fully examined and the results made public.</P>
        <P>Separately, the Government should introduce a compensation scheme for the families of variant CJD victims. Such a scheme was introduced in the United Kingdom following the publication of the Southwood report in 1989. The Government should do the same. The most immediate requirement is for the State to accede to the request of the county coroner, hold an investigation into these cases and publish the results.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am also taking this Adjournment debate on behalf of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides the T&aacute;naiste an opportunity to outline to this House the position in regard to this issue.</P>
        <P>Late in 2004 the T&aacute;naiste learned with regret of the occurrence of a case of variant CJD in a young man in Dublin. This young man subsequently died in 2005 and the recent inquest into his death confirmed that he died of variant CJD. The T&aacute;naiste and I again wish to extend our deepest sympathies to his family.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Following the inquest on 10 January last, the Dublin County Coroner wrote to the T&aacute;naiste and to the Minister for Agriculture and Food requesting an investigation into the apparent geo<Col N="1100"/>graphical connection of this case with two others. The chief medical officer of my Department has requested the HSE to examine these cases to investigate any possible link between them. In addition, the CJD advisory group, which operates under the aegis of my Department, will discuss this issue at its next meeting to be held on 7 February. However, on the information currently available to the HSE, it can see no basis for the suggestion that there may be a cluster of such cases but it is making further inquiries in this regard and will keep my Department informed of any developments.</P>
        <P>At this stage it can be said that the probability is that this case of variant CJD was contracted before the current very strict controls on the sale of meat in Ireland were brought into force in 1996. Given that the incubation period for variant CJD is considered to be up to 15 years, it is virtually impossible to identify a specific source of infection. The long incubation period would also make it difficult to establish a common exposure time between individual cases.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The CJD advisory group provides scientific, professional and technical advice on all aspects of CJD and recommends appropriate policy responses in light of the evolving information and evidence on this topic. The group comprises experts in public health, communicable disease surveillance, neurology, transfusion medicine and food safety. The group will continue to monitor all developments nationally and internationally and, along with my Department&rsquo;s chief medical officer, will advise on any relevant developments. The T&aacute;naiste has been briefed by the chairman of the CJD advisory group on any possible broader public health implications that may have arisen from this case.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>There are no public health issues in this case in regard to the blood supply or any surgical procedures. New variant CJD, vCJD, is a rare degenerative fatal brain disorder in humans. It is believed the vast majority of persons who have developed vCJD became infected through the consumption of cattle products contaminated with the agent of BSE.</P>
        <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland and the Department of Agriculture and Food are responsible for BSE controls in Ireland. The FSAI stress that BSE controls in place in Ireland since 1996 are very strict and there are layers of robust control measures to ensure maximum consumer protection from BSE.</P>
        <P>The incidence of BSE in Ireland continues to decline in the Irish cattle population, demonstrating that the controls introduced in 1996 and 1997 are working. There are fewer cases of BSE, and the vast majority of current cases are in animals born before the introduction of these enhanced controls.</P>
        <P>One of the key factors for establishing the FSAI in 1996 was the BSE crisis. The FSAI bases its decisions on the best scientific data and know<Col N="1101"/>ledge, and develops inspection and audit controls to ensure maximum consumer protection for meat and meat products. A rigorous policy of safeguards is firmly established throughout the food chain.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In Ireland, there is a sequence of controls for BSE along the food chain. The feeding of meat and bone meal is prohibited to all farm animals and there are stringent controls at rendering plants and feed mills. The main consumer protection measure has been the removal of specified risk materials, SRM, from the human food chain. SRM are the parts of an animal most likely to contain BSE infectivity if that animal is incubating the disease.</P>
        <P>All cattle are examined by veterinary inspectors before slaughter at the abattoir and rapid BSE testing is carried out on all animals over 30 months of age. Veterinary inspectors, under service contract to the FSAI, ensure slaughtered cattle have had SRM removed. At boning plants, the carcasses are inspected again. In butcher shops, environmental health officers under contract to the FSAI inspect carcasses at this level. In addition, all butchers operating in Ireland are aware that it is illegal to sell meat products containing SRM.</P>
        <P>The FSAI and the Department of Agriculture and Food have been at the forefront in the EU with the most aggressive controls to protect both animals and humans from the BSE agent. The FSAI, the Department of Agriculture and Food and the other agencies involved in policing the food chain are working to ensure full compliance and maximum consumer protection.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste has also been assured that the measures in place to protect public health, particularly on the protection of the blood supply, are in accordance with best international practice. A number of technical sterilising measures are taken on blood supplies and a number of donor deferral measures, especially in respect of people who lived in the UK, form the cornerstone of this activity.</P>
        <P>Following discussions with the chairman of the CJD advisory group and the medical director of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, IBTS, the conclusion is that the circumstances presented by the occurrence of this case do not require that any other measures need to be taken. The IBTS undertook a review of its policies following the case of transfusion infection in the UK in 2004 and will continue with those policies.</P>
        <P>The CJD advisory group has also endorsed the most up-to-date infection control guidance in respect of the management of CJD in the hospital setting and the Department has ensured the circulation of the guidance through the hospital system. The disease continues to be notifiable and the national CJD surveillance unit in Beaumont Hospital continues its activity in monitoring the occurrence of CJD in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The results of the HSE investigation into possible links between three variant CJD cases is <Col N="1102"/>awaited and it will be referred to the CJD advisory group for consideration.</P>

	<P>New rules and regulations on the Department of Social and Family Affairs lone-parent family payments are being introduced from the middle of February. From that point on, payments will have to be collected from the post office within five days.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The monitor in the Chamber states the Minister for Transport is responding.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not realise the ministerial changes were so radical.</P>
        <P>A new regulation has been circulated to postmasters and postmistresses throughout the country. The payment is due on Thursday and must be collected by the following Tuesday. There is no provision made for retention of the money if the collection is not made. This seems too rigid as it leaves no scope for a bereavement where someone may have to travel to England or another part of the country. No scope is allowed for holidays or sickness and no hardship provision is made. No margin of error is allowed for in these regulations. It would be more beneficial to allow 15 days, two weeks encompassing three Thursdays, for collection. This would cover all eventualities.</P>
        <P>Let us consider the alternatives. If someone does not collect payment within five days, he or she must make a fresh application to the Department. This must be queried and checked, resulting in bureaucracy and expense. Even though the Minister intends to streamline the procedure, that is not the result.</P>
        <P>Additional strain will be placed on the post offices because the alternative is for someone to open a bank account, receiving their payments directly and bypassing the post office. This will be beneficial to banks but not to post offices and most people who attend the post office do not have bank accounts. What appears to be a simple streamlining regulation has major implications. The number of people who do not collect the entitlement within the one week period is not high, unless there is a serious problem. I suggest the Minister review the regulation, allowing 15 days rather than five and allowing the post office to retain the money for that period. This will avoid bureaucracy and make the system more humane and compassionate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan. The one-parent family payment, OPFP, is the income support scheme for separated, unmarried and widowed persons and also for prisoners&rsquo; spouses who are bringing up a child or children without the support of a partner. At the end of December 2005, the total number of one-parent family recipients being paid by the <Col N="1103"/>Department was 83,066. Included in this figure are payments to 906 widowed persons.</P>
        <P>The current scheme was introduced in 1997 when it replaced a number of schemes for different categories of lone parent. These schemes included lone-parent&rsquo;s allowance and deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit. Under the current scheme lone parents are encouraged to maximise their income from different sources and the means test for this scheme makes provision for the exemption of significant levels of earnings and maintenance payments.</P>
        <P>Lone parents may earn up to &euro;146.50 per week from employment without affecting the payment. Above that level, half of any earnings are assessed, up to a maximum of &euro;293 per week. The maximum limit of &euro;293 is being increased to &euro;375 per week with effect from June 2006, as a result of changes introduced in last month&rsquo;s budget. Lone parents may also be eligible to avail of the range of employment support services operated by the Department.</P>
        <P>Until recently, most of the claim processing work relating to one-parent family claims has been done in the social welfare services office in Sligo. In 2000 the Department undertook a review of the payments arrangements for lone parents. This review recommended that administration of the scheme should be moved to the Department&rsquo;s local offices to bring lone parents into closer contact with the various support services available in those offices. The move to local office level is intended to improve customer service through closer linkage with the local investigative officer network as well as providing more direct local contact for lone parents with the Department&rsquo;s employment support services.</P>
        <P>Local one-parent family payment, OPFP, claim processing commenced on a trial basis in the Department&rsquo;s local office in Tallaght in 2001. Following the success of this project, the process has been gradually extended. One-parent family payment applications are processed in 35 social welfare local offices. It is planned that all one-parent <Col N="1104"/>family claims will be administered from social welfare local offices early in 2007. Traditionally most one-parent family payment claims using the personalised paying order, PPO, book at their local post office. However, in order that these customers can avail of the services of their local social welfare office, it is necessary to transfer them to another computer system and change their payment method.</P>
        <P>From 16 February 2006, the OPFP will no longer have a book of payable orders. Recipients will still collect their payment at post offices utilising their social services card. The card will be swiped at the post office counter for validation purposes and the cash will then be handed to the customer. This form of card-based payment is known as electronic information transfer, ElT, payment. Under this system, the payment must be collected by close of business on the Tuesday following the Thursday payday. If the payment is not collected by then, the payment is returned to the Department. If the customer has been unable to collect the payment, for instance due to illness, work commitments or holidays, arrangements are made to have the payment reissued. The Department is reviewing the possibility of extending the period during which the payment may be collected. That is the substance of the issue raised by Deputy Costello in moving this Adjournment.</P>
        <P>A total of 13,795 one-parent family payment recipients receive their payments using the ElT method of payment. Approximately 44,000 customers are being issued with social services cards via the An Post network to enable them to avail of the ElT payment method in preparation for their claims being processed on a localised basis. An information sheet has been enclosed with the cards advising customers on the change in their payment method and when the change will come into effect. If a customer has ongoing difficulty collecting the payment promptly every week, he or she should contact the one-parent family payment section in Sligo.</P>
        <adjournment>The D&aacute;il adjourned at 5.10 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 31 January 2006.</adjournment><Col N="1103"/><Col N="1105"/>

        <P>I refer the Deputies to my response to Priority Question No. 5 of today in which I set out the policy and programme measures in place to achieve a wider spread of tourism business.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies are aware, the Minister for Transport has primary responsibility for the Transport 21 initiative. Its launch in November 2005, with a ten year budget line of &euro;34 billion &mdash; the most significant transport investment programme ever &mdash; marks an important milestone on the path to delivery of a transport infrastructure throughout the country commensurate with the level and pace of economic and demographic growth in Ireland today.</P>
        <P>The plan addresses many of the issues of importance to tourism raised in the New Horizons report of the tourism policy review group. These include the upgrading of specific national, regional, sub-regional and urban orbital routes of importance to tourism, the upgrading of bus and rail services and amenities to facilitate regional tourism development and the development of a Dublin Airport metro link.</P>
        <P>Tourism should benefit greatly from this plan and it has been already welcomed by the key industry groups. Its orderly implementation over time will make a significant difference to tourism development and narrow the competitiveness gap that currently exists as regards our internal transport infrastructure.</P>

	<P>The national lottery-funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. The programme is advertised on an annual basis.</P>
        <P>The closing date for applications under the 2006 sports capital programme was Friday last, with in excess of 1,300 applications being received by the closing date. Given the large volume of applications received and the complexity of processing and evaluating the information required, it is not possible at this early stage to provide a breakdown of applications by type of applicant or the localities from which applications have been submitted. However, when the sorting process has been completed it will be possible to provide general information of the type sought by the Deputy. The Deputy may wish to note that under the 2005 sports capital programme, 268 out of 1,362, or 19.6%, of applications received by the closing date for the programme were from Dublin.</P>
        <P>I will decide later on the level of provisional grant allocations to be made this year having regard both to the quality of the applications received under the 2006 programme and the pattern of grant allocations and drawdowns on foot of earlier years&rsquo; approvals.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 70 together.</P>
        <P>The priority under the local authority swimming pool programme, which is administered by my Department, is to continue to support those projects remaining to be completed under the current programme, where the deadline for submission of applications was 31 July 2000. Of the 56 projects being dealt with, 31 have been grant aided, of which 18 have been completed, leaving 13 under construction or about to begin construction. The remaining 25 projects are at various stages in the programme &mdash; three at tender stage, 15 at contract document stage and seven at preliminary report stage. It is important to note that expenditure under the programme is largely determined not by my Department, but by the <Col N="1108"/>speed at which individual local authorities progress their projects. In this regard, however, I am pleased to say that activity under the programme has increased considerably as evidenced by the results for 2005 where I approved grant aid for five projects &mdash; in Monaghan town, Ballybunion, Clondalkin, Killarney and Askeaton which permits the project developers to proceed with placing the contracts and having the work commence; contract documents for eight projects &mdash; in Naas, Clondalkin, Askeaton, Thurles, Portarlington, Portlaoise, Athy and Longford, allowing them to invite tenders for the projects; and preliminary reports for nine projects &mdash; in Athy, Kilkenny, Buncrana, New Ross, Castlebar, Bray, Greystones, Birr and Roscrea which permits the preparation of contract documents for the projects. The House will agree that we are now seeing good progress with this programme which is aimed at providing modern public swimming facilities for our people.</P>
        <P>My Department is carrying out an expenditure review of the programme, which is examining, among other things, the number and nature of projects supported under the programme, the benefits which have accrued to the areas where pools have been built under the programme and what amendments, if any, are required to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of the programme. On the completion of this review, which I expect will be available by mid-year, the question of re-opening the programme to new applications will be considered.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>International comparisons are far less simple than initially appears to be the case. Approaches to what is classified as &ldquo;arts&rdquo; spend can differ quite dramatically from one jurisdiction and context to another, for example. It must also be said that jurisdictions with very high spending across the board also tend to have very high tax rates, and the latter is something that we do not have here.</P>
        <P>The arts must compete for funding with all other sectors and I have committed myself to securing the best possible deal for the arts in that context. This is the only sensible approach. It is also an approach which has paid off in recent <Col N="1109"/>years. During my own term as the Minister responsible for the arts, funding for the Arts Council has increased by almost 52% &mdash; from &euro;47.67 million in 2002, to &euro;72.31 million this year. This has allowed the Arts Council to support a record number of artists and arts organisations. This built on earlier increases of about 80% between 1997 and 2002. This does not include the very substantial funding of almost &euro;90 million allocated by my Department for the capital development of arts and culture facilities around the country in recent years.</P>
        <P>These are significant amounts of money in any context, and the amounts of both current and capital funding that have been provided in recent years have transformed the arts, have increased access to the arts, and provide an excellent platform for still further developments in the years ahead.</P>
        <P>Arts Council representatives met the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural, and Gaeltacht Affairs on 19 October 2005. As part of their presentation the council representatives outlined their plans for the next three years under the new strategy for the arts which was published last December. This is a three-year strategy which seeks to increase Exchequer funding to &euro;100 million by 2008. As part of the first phase of the strategy, the council has sought an allocation of &euro;79.3 million in 2006. Following on from the meeting the Chairman of the joint committee wrote to me in support of the council&rsquo;s request for &euro;79.3 million in 2006 leading to &euro;100 million over a three year cycle.</P>
        <P>It is entirely appropriate for the Arts Council to request such funding as it believes it needs, and for the joint committee to express its view. The Government, however, must balance competing demands from every part of our economy and society. In this context, I was delighted to secure an allocation of &euro;72.319 million for the council this year representing almost a 19% increase on 2005 and almost 38% on 2004.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to the text of my detailed reply on this matter to Question No. 5 on 13 October 2005 and further reply to Question No. 27 on 17 November 2005.</P>
        <P>I am aware of concerns being expressed by some about the risk of excessive prices being charged by certain elements of the Irish tourism <Col N="1110"/>and hospitality industry in the context of the Ryder Cup 2006. However, as I have previously indicated, the State tourism agencies are being particularly vigilant about the risk of excessive prices being charged in the context of this important event. In all of their dealings with the industry, they are taking the opportunity to encourage a commonsense approach to the pricing of our tourism products during the staging of the event. For my part, I will continue to raise this issue, as appropriate, in my regular contacts with the industry in the build up to the Ryder Cup.</P>
        <P>The Deputy might also note that my Department wrote to the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs in early November 2005 requesting that a special initiative be undertaken around the time of the Ryder Cup to ensure that price lists in restaurants and public houses are displayed prominently, and has been informed that the appropriate checks will be carried out.</P>

One of the key cross-cutting issues is the pursuit of an environmental policy that accommodates the sensitive development and expansion of tourism, with opportunities for the development of rural tourism and the enjoyment of natural resources for tourism, sport and recreation.</P>
        <P>The position is that primary responsibility for the protection of the physical environment in Ireland rests with my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>There is widespread acceptance of the importance of good management and conservation practices in maintaining and enhancing the attractiveness of both the built and the natural environment. The tourism development strategy set out in the report of the tourism policy review group, New Horizons for Irish Tourism &mdash; An Agenda for Action, provides a model to address cross-departmental issues relating to tourism development, including environmental sustainability.</P>

        <P>On 17 November last, I informed the House that, following approval by the Government, I had the previous day announced that Spencer Dock international conference centre consortium was being invited to become the provisional preferred tenderer for the provision of a national conference centre in Dublin. The decision had been taken by the national conference centre steering group following a detailed assessment and evaluation of tenders received against award criteria set out in the invitation to negotiate document.</P><Col N="1112"/>
        <P>In accordance with the competition process, the contracting authority, the Office of Public Works, is currently engaging with the PPT to negotiate, settle and agree any required amendments to the project agreement. It is also necessary for the PPT to resolve all outstanding due diligence issues. Assuming that these negotiations prove successful, the next step will be the appointment of the provisional preferred tenderer as preferred tenderer. During the preferred tenderer phase, the preferred tenderer will develop and provide the full range of project documents which will require review and approval by the contracting authority. I look forward to the early completion of the next stages and to a final decision by Government in the course of this year.</P>
        <P>On the basis of consultations undertaken earlier by my Department and research reviewed, I am totally convinced of the need for a modern, dedicated national conference centre if Ireland is to realise its full potential in the hugely valuable international conference market.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 77 together.</P>
        <P>The increased prosperity of Irish residents in recent years coupled with the greatly improved access to foreign tourist destinations has undoubtedly led to sustained growth in the overseas holiday market. Irish consumers have more choice than ever before. They are generally taking more than one holiday a year, although the evidence suggests that they continue to take at least one holiday in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Against a backdrop of intense international competition for Irish holidaymakers, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, which is responsible for promoting the home market, has significantly stepped up its home holiday campaigns in recent years backed by significant Exchequer resources.</P><Col N="1113"/>
        <P>In 2006, some &euro;4 million has been allocated by F&aacute;ilte Ireland to home holiday promotion. F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s consumer website for the domestic market -<i> www.ireland.ie</i>&mdash; which was launched early in 2005 has proven particularly successful in generating quality year round business for the sector. F&aacute;ilte Ireland also publishes the highly successful Discover Ireland series of brochures aimed at the domestic consumer.</P>
        <P>CSO figures over the last five years would suggest that this investment is yielding a good return with domestic holiday trips up 32% and expenditure up 51% over that period. Given the volatile nature of the tourism industry and the level of international competition, I am reluctant, so early in the year, to make predictions regarding the numbers we can expect to visit Ireland this year. However, the targets set in Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s ambitious marketing plans for 2006 are for 5% growth in overseas visitor numbers and 6.7% growth in revenue terms. These targets are predicated on the ambitious targets set out in the New Horizons report and are based on a number of important assumptions in relation to the economic climate in our key source markets, continuing development of access routes to Ireland and the maintenance of Ireland&rsquo;s competitive position. I am confident that backed by an unparalleled level of public investment in tourism marketing and development, this growth can be achieved in 2006.</P>

	<P>The national lottery-funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding to sporting and community organisations and, in certain circumstances, schools and colleges, throughout the country. Projects must be of a capital nature and be directly related to the provision of sporting and physical recreation facilities. This means that the project must involve: improving or building an asset; or purchasing non-personal sports equipment that will be used for at least five years.</P>
        <P>Applications to the programme from primary and post-primary schools and colleges must be made jointly with local sports clubs or community groups and must: demonstrate a clear need for the proposed sports facility in the area as formally agreed with other local groups and-or the local authority; demonstrate how the proposed facility will meet that need; and demonstrate that the local community will have significant access to the proposed facility when it is not being used by the school or college itself. In this regard, the <Col N="1114"/>significant access is a requirement for a minimum of at least 30 hours a week throughout the year.</P>
        <P>The sports capital programme is administered on an annual basis. The deadline for receipt of applications under the 2006 programme was at close of business on Friday last, 20 January, by which time over 1,300 applications were received. Given that large volume of applications and the complexity of processing and evaluating the information required, it is not possible at this very early stage to provide a breakdown of applications by type of applicant or to say how many were related to schools and colleges.</P>
        <P>However, for the Deputy&rsquo;s information and as a point of reference, under the 2005 sports capital programme, 30 out of 1,362, or 2.2%, of the applications received for that programme were projects from schools and colleges, while a further nine applications were received from third level institutions.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 30 and 32 together.</P>
        <P>As the House is aware, in January 2004 the Government agreed to provide funding of &euro;191million to the joint IRFU-FAI project for the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road stadium. The new design for the stadium, which I was very pleased to launch on Monday 17 October 2005, has been created in consultation with the different stakeholder groups that will be involved in and impacted on by the stadium. As a result, in order to minimise the impact on those residents living in close proximity to the new structure, the <Col N="1115"/>design, which is at four levels on the east, west and south sides, sweeps down to a single level at the north end. Lansdowne Road Stadium Development Company has adopted a very open and listening approach to the concerns of local residents, who understandably are concerned at the changes planned for the existing stadium grounds. Among the initiatives taken by the company is the establishment of a consultative forum, involving all the local residents groups, under an agreed independent chairman.</P>
        <P>Very good progress has been made with this project and Lansdowne Road Stadium Development Company, the company charged with delivery of the project, submitted the planning application for the project on 12 January 2006. At this stage it is not realistically possible to establish with certainty the length of time that will be required to complete the planning process. Working on the assumption that there is no untoward delay, construction work will commence in early 2007. Construction is scheduled to take 29 months and on that basis the end of 2009 could see completion of the redeveloped stadium, which would cater for the international rugby and soccer fixtures of the IRFU and the FAI.</P>
        <P>From an early stage in the development of this project, discussions have been ongoing between the Lansdowne Stadium Development Company and CIE and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann. These deliberations seek to ensure the safe demolition of the existing west stand of the Lansdowne stadium and the redevelopment of the new stand in the most cost-efficient manner while being mindful of the needs of the travelling public. The work involved will inevitably impinge on the rail line, because the existing west stand overhangs the Dart rail line. The discussions and planning relating to this programme of work have involved CIE, Lansdowne Road Stadium Development Company, the IRFU and the FAI, my Department and both CIE and the Department of Transport. It is the intention of all concerned to find a satisfactory solution to the challenge of carrying out the work in the vicinity of the railway line in the shortest possible timeframe and in a cost efficient manner while endeavouring to ensure that travelling public who use the southern line of the Dart are not unduly disrupted.</P>

My Department is currently processing data relating to such facilities that have been previously funded under the Department programmes. That data are being sorted and analysed and will give a picture of sports facilities throughout the country, although the list will not be exhaustive. The next step will be to fill any gaps in this information in consultation with a variety of sporting bodies and local authorities. It is then proposed to issue detailed questionnaires to facility managers and owners, which will broaden the database of information on existing facilities.</P>

	<P Just="Left">As I have previously advised the House, I do not have responsibility for the registration and listing of tourist accommodation facilities. This is a day-to-day function of F&aacute;ilte Ireland under the National Tourism Development Authority Act 2003.</P>
        <P>However, I am aware that the bed and breakfast and guest house sectors have experienced a loss in market share in recent years for a number of reasons, including changes in consumer preferences, growth in urban and short-break holiday taking and the addition of a large amount of budget hotel accommodation stock.</P><Col N="1117"/>
        <P>As I pointed out in an earlier reply today, visitors cannot be forced to go to a particular location or to avail of particular products against their will. The responsibility primarily lies with the individual communities and operators in the sector to present and market compelling attractions, facilities, accommodation and experiences that deliver value for money and quality service. Having said that, F&aacute;ilte Ireland recognises that staying in an Irish home can be a defining experience for overseas visitors and is convinced that this should remain an element of the Irish tourism brand. The importance of the product is reflected in the fact that over half of the 3,000 nominations received in 2005 for the Irish Welcome Awards were for people running bed and breakfast accommodation.</P>
        <P>The tourism policy review group considered that the important and unique product which the bed and breakfast sector offers to tourists could be better developed and promoted if the different groups representing the sector came together into a more unified and single structure to more effectively represent their industry and to work closely with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland for that purpose.</P>
        <P>Facilitated by officials from Teagasc and Leader, a number of representative groups for accommodation and other service providers, including Irish Farmhouse Holidays came together in May 2004 to form a national rural tourism federation. This is receiving funding from F&aacute;ilte Ireland, which will assist in establishing it as a more effective representative body for rural tourism providers. With these developments, there is more scope for joint marketing activities and the development of stronger links with other, non-member, organisations.</P>
        <P>In response to concerns about its short and medium term prospects, a strategic review of the bed and breakfast sector was commissioned by F&aacute;ilte Ireland. Recently, the consultants&rsquo; recommendations were presented to representatives of the sector&rsquo;s main associations for their views. In the meantime, F&aacute;ilte Ireland is continuing to support the bed and breakfast and small and medium-sized accommodation sector through specific marketing initiatives. Programmes include co-operative marketing activities and education programmes for bed and breakfast providers.</P>
        <P>In addition, F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s small and medium sized enterprise scheme continues to support key sectors such as bed and breakfast, self-catering, caravan and camping, rural tourism and hostels in the areas of market supports, e-business and capability building at both the sector and enterprise level. A business solutions tool kit is also available to assist small businesses in understanding basic, but key, areas of business operation.</P>

	<P>The tax exemption for artists will continue to be of great benefit to artists in Ireland. An adjustable cap of &euro;250,000 on annual tax-exempt earnings has been applied but this will have no impact whatsoever on the vast majority of artists, who earn well below that amount. The feedback available to me indicates that artists in general very much welcome the retention of the scheme, notwithstanding the adjustments to it. The scheme ensures that Ireland continues to be a place where the work of artists is valued and where their place in society is assured.</P>

	<P>Based on extensive research carried out on behalf of our tourism agencies, it is clear that Ireland&rsquo;s heritage and culture are a major selling point for overseas and domestic holidaymakers. In 2004, 2.3 million overseas visitors interacted with some aspect of the heritage and culture product. It is also the most popular tourism product among domestic tourists.</P>
        <P>Both Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland recognise the importance of our heritage and culture in terms of the promotion of Ireland as a tourism destination. In its extensive research for the new tourism brand Ireland campaign, Tourism Ireland found that of a total market potential of 66 million outbound international holidaymakers in our key markets, 44 million have a strong interest in sightseeing and culture, with 21 million defined as core sightseers and culture seekers. The impli<Col N="1119"/>cations for Ireland with its wealth of cultural attractions are very positive and Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s new &euro;50 million marketing campaign will focus particular attention over the next three years on those elements of the Irish tourism product that appeal to this very particular and lucrative segment of the international market.</P>
        <P>Culturalist and sightseeing tourists are especially important as they are more likely than average to tour around the country and take in sites outside the main metropolitan centres and they tend to spend more per visit than the average holidaymaker. They are also a growing segment, as many are in the older age bracket. As consumers age and gain travel experience, their holiday needs become even more closely aligned with the type of tourism experience in which Ireland excels. They are particularly interested in learning about a country and its culture, admiring the scenery, visiting historical sights and sightseeing and experiencing music and the arts.</P>
        <P>This year F&aacute;ilte Ireland will launch a new long-term product development strategy which will focus particular attention on the needs and potential of this market segment. In addition, it is intended to pilot a number of new themed products including traditional culture and Christian heritage. F&aacute;ilte Ireland is also working to add greater emphasis to the area of living culture, including music, dance, theatre, festivals, language, arts and crafts. In terms of our built heritage, the key challenge is to tell stories in a more compelling way and to get the visitor more engaged in their Irish holiday.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This year will also see the development of major capital investment by my Department in key elements of our national cultural infrastructure. The package announced in the budget includes the redevelopment of the Abbey Theatre and of the National Concert Hall, the complete remodelling of the Theatre Royal in Wexford and the substantial refurbishment of the Gaiety Theatre in Dublin. These are acknowledged flagship projects, which will greatly enhance the quality of Ireland&rsquo;s cultural infrastructure, both for Irish and overseas visitors.</P>
        <P>Recognising the need for greater engagement and interaction among the State funded organisations involved in tourism, culture and sports, a working group was established last year under the chairmanship of the Secretary General of my Department to identify specific areas of synergy among the three sectors. This group is designed to bring the heads of all relevant bodies and institutions together to identify practical initiatives which can benefit all concerned. This phase of the group&rsquo;s work is almost complete and I understand a report is being finalised which will set out some very valuable recommendations for immediate action by the agencies and institutions concerned.</P>

	<P>The Government has agreed the key elements of a scheme for the repayment of long stay charges for publicly funded residential care. All those fully eligible persons who were wrongly charged and are alive and the estates of all those who were wrongly charged and are dead since 9 December 1998 will have the charges repaid in full. The repayments will include both the actual charge paid and an amount to take account of inflation, using the consumer price index, since the time the person involved was charged.</P>
        <P>It is expected that the scheme will cost approximately &euro;1 billion and at this stage it is envisaged that applications for the scheme can be received up to 31 December 2007. Figures provided by the Health Service Executive show an estimated <Col N="1123"/>60,000 people are likely to be due a repayment, approximately 20,000 of these are living and 40,000 repayments relate to estates of deceased patients. The Health Service Executive has received 21,600 registrations of interest for a repayment to date.</P>
        <P>Draft heads of a Bill for a repayment scheme were submitted to Government in December and were approved. The draft heads have been submitted to Parliamentary Counsel for drafting and it is my intention to have the Bill published in the current parliamentary session and to have repayments commence shortly after the Bill is approved and signed into law.</P>
        <P>The scheme will be designed and managed with the aim of ensuring that those who are eligible for repayments receive them as soon as possible and with the minimum possible imposition in terms of bureaucracy. Priority will be given to those who are still alive. Many of those eligible for repayments have already been identified as a result of initial payments made following my announcement in December 2004. The scheme will include a transparent and thorough appeals process.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The World Health Organisation&rsquo;s European Health for All database of June 2005 shows that the number of acute care beds in Ireland in 2003 was three per 1,000 population and that the EU average for the same year was four per 1,000 population.</P>
        <P>The organisation advises caution in the interpretation of the cross-country data in the database. Health data recording systems and practices vary between countries as do the availability and accuracy of data. Data comparability is also limited, owing to differences in definitions and-or time periods or other national specificities in data recording and processing. For example, the Irish data do not include day beds. Day activity is now a significant component of hospital-based care. There has been a rapid movement in the last few years towards day case work where a variety of routine and complex treatments, surgery and diagnostic tests can now be performed with the patient being admitted and discharged from hospital on the same day. In addition, the Irish data does not include acute beds located in private hospitals whereas some other countries include private beds and-or long-term care beds.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that the acute bed numbers <i>per capita</i> do not take account of variations in the age structure of the population in <Col N="1124"/>different countries. Acute bed usage tends to be concentrated in the older age groups both in terms of admission rates and average lengths of stay. Within the EU, Ireland continues to have a significantly younger population than the average.</P>

	<P>Rights commissioners investigate trade disputes referred by individuals or small groups of workers. Having carried out an investigation, the rights commissioner issues a recommendation &mdash; which is not binding on the parties involved &mdash; giving his or her opinion on the merits, or otherwise, of the dispute. The rights commissioner does not seek to impose a solution on the parties to a dispute but to assist them in arriving at a solution. Ultimately, responsibility for the settlement of a trade dispute rests with the parties to the dispute. In this case the parties are the Health Service Executive north eastern area and the individual concerned.

	<P>The primary care strategy aims to develop services in the community so that patients will have direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary teams of general practitioners, nurses, health care assistants, home helps, occupational therapists and others.</P>
        <P>The Government is fully committed to the implementation of the principles contained in the primary care strategy which provides a template for the reform and development of primary care services over a period of ten to 15 years. The chief executive officer of the Health Service Executive has also emphasised the importance of developing primary care services, both as the appropriate service for the delivery of the majority of people&rsquo;s health and social care needs, and to complement the services provided by acute hospitals. This is an important priority of the executive which has my full endorsement. The implementation process at an operational level is a function of the Health Service Executive, HSE, which under the Health Act 2004 is responsible for the management and delivery of health and personal social services.</P>
        <P>An initial ten primary care teams have been established nationally, with funding to enable existing staff resources within the public system to be augmented. These teams enable the primary care model to be demonstrated in action and have allowed practical experience to be gained of the process involved in developing a primary care team and providing expanded services in the community. The HSE will be building on the experience gained in these ten projects as it develops team-based primary care services on a wider scale.</P><Col N="1127"/>
        <P>In order to support further implementation of the strategy in 2006, additional revenue funding of &euro;16 million has been provided which will enable: the appointment of some 300 additional front-line personnel to work alongside GPs in approximately 75 to 100 teams in the improved delivery of community primary care services; the establishment of an additional 22 GP training places; and the further development of general practitioner out-of-hours co-operatives to enable an estimated 350,000 additional persons to benefit from such services. This means that &euro;28 million will be available in 2006 specifically to support the implementation of the primary care strategy. However, other development funding will also be used to support the development of services in line with the principles of the strategy.</P>
        <P>Wider implementation of the primary care strategy will focus on developing new ways of working and of reorganising the resources already available to the health service in line with the service model described in the strategy. This whole-system approach to implementation means change will be required in many sectors in the health service, and not solely within primary care itself.</P>

	<P>GMS GPs are contractually obliged to provide a service for medical card and GP visit card holders on a 24 hour basis. Funding was first provided for out of hours general practitioner co-operatives in 2000. The resources allocated to facilitate development of these services have been increased annually since then and in 2006 the sum available for GP co-ops amounts to &euro;33.984 million, of which &euro;2 million is additional funding. These figures do not include the fees of the participating doctors. The additional funding in 2006 will allow for an additional 350,000 persons to be covered by comprehensive out of hours general practitioner cover. The HSE estimates that 2.4 million people are presently covered by the existing out of hours co-operatives. Thus the 2006 estimate will bring total coverage to approximately 2.75 million people or 70% of the population of the country.</P>
        <P>One new co-operative was started in the HSE&rsquo;s eastern region in 2004. All areas of the Health Service Executive have expanded their out of hours co-operatives and services since 2004. Co-operatives are now in place in part of all areas of the Health Service Executive, providing coverage in part of all counties. The executive is working <Col N="1128"/>to further extend the availability of co-op services in parts of the country where these are not yet in place. Expansion of out of hours co-operatives is also dependent on GPs in the areas agreeing to join as participation is voluntary.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Mater and Children&rsquo;s Hospital development is the largest single capital development project in the HSE capital programme. It involves the redevelopment of the Mater campus to include considerably expanded and improved facilities for the Mater itself, and the construction of new, purpose-built accommodation which will replace the Children&rsquo;s University Hospital, Temple Street.</P>
        <P>In the context of the decision to be taken on the possible relocation of the facilities at Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, I asked the Health Service Executive to undertake a review of tertiary, or highly specialised, paediatric services to ensure that paediatric services are provided in the most efficient and effective <Col N="1129"/>manner. The HSE recently engaged a team of management consultants to provide a report on the strategic organisation of tertiary paediatric services in Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Specifically, the report is to identify: whether tertiary paediatric services should be provided on one or more sites; the facilities, beds, etc., required to meet tertiary needs; and the facilities required to meet secondary, that is, less complex, paediatric services in Dublin. This review clearly has implications for the scope of the Mater and Children&rsquo;s Hospital development project and the HSE has accordingly advised the hospital that it needs to await the report before giving approval for the project to proceed to tender. The HSE expects to receive the consultant&rsquo;s report by the end of this month and my Department will be having further discussions with the HSE at that stage to see how we advance the development project. My primary concern is to ensure that we arrive at a solution which is in the best interests of the children of this country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Thalidomide preparations were marketed in Ireland from May 1959 to January 1962 when they were withdrawn from sale by the manufacturers. In May 1970, following confirmation by the Department of External Affairs that an offer of compensation by the German manufacturers of thalidomide applied to Irish born children with conditions attributed to thalidomide, the Department of Health issued advertisements inviting parents and others involved in the care of such children to furnish particulars which were forwarded to representatives of the manufacturers.</P>
        <P>In May 1973, the Government decided in principle that it should provide financial assistance in addition to that paid by the German foundation. The then Minister for Health established the Irish thalidomide medical board to identify the number of Irish children affected and report on each individual case. The board concluded that 34 Irish children were affected by the drug &mdash; one of whom was the beneficiary of the British compensation scheme as the mother was prescribed the drug while living in the UK. In December 1974 the Government granted each of the remaining 33 children further financial assistance by way of a lump sum and a monthly allowance for life. My Department has been unable to ascertain, within this timescale, the existence of any case as described by the Deputy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The childminding relief I introduced in budget 2006 allows an individual to mind up to three children in the minder&rsquo;s own home, without paying tax, PRSI or levies on the childminding earnings received, provided the amount is not more than &euro;10,000 per annum. If childminding income exceeds &euro;10,000, the total amount will be taxable, as normal, under self-assessment.</P>
        <P>The new scheme is not a tax allowance, but is in fact an income disregard of &euro;10,000. It automatically follows that the amount earned, once it does not exceed &euro;10,000, is not assessable to tax or PRSI or levies and is thus exempt from tax, PRSI and levies. Any change to make the income subject to PRSI, either on a mandatory basis or in all circumstances on a voluntary basis, would require an amendment to the relevant social wel<Col N="1132"/>fare legislation which would be a matter for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to consider in the first instance.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The information is available on the basis of &ldquo;bailiwick&rdquo; meaning the jurisdiction or boundaries within which Revenue Sheriffs, County Registrars or their officers operate for the purposes of enforcement of tax debt. It equates geographically with &ldquo;county&rdquo;. Companies are associated on the tax record with the county address of the head-office or branch with which contact is established for tax purposes, which may be different to the city or county addresses of other branches.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to quantify the success rate of the BES scheme as many factors can contribute to the success of a company. Taking this into account, it is clear that this scheme has been of benefit to start up companies in Ireland. Small companies pursuing growth opportunities are still finding it difficult to attract equity funding particularly for amounts less than &euro;250,000. The BES scheme is an important vehicle aimed at the level of the market which is at too early a stage of development for many venture capitalists and is still regarded as too risky for many investors. It is a valuable source of finance for companies that have exhausted the promoters&rsquo; resources, other micro-finance options and family and friends as investors.</P>
        <P>I would point out to the Deputy that the BES, along with the seed capital scheme, are due to end on 31 December 2006. Both of these schemes will be reviewed this year in advance of their termination date by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Revenue Commissioners. I should be better positioned to comment on the success of the BES when the review of the scheme is complete.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme, the development co-operation directorate of the Department of Foreign Affairs, currently based in Dublin, will decentralise to Limerick. This is scheduled to take place during the first quarter of 2007.</P>
        <P>Already 24 posts in the directorate, including that of director general, are filled by officers who have signalled their intention to decentralise to Limerick. Nine of these officers were already serving within the Department at the time of the announcement of the decentralisation programme in December 2003. The remainder is made up of nine officers who have been recruited from other Departments via the central applications facility for Limerick, four who have been assigned from inter-departmental promotion panels and two newly recruited officers.</P>
        <P>In addition, there are currently 15 officers serving elsewhere in the Department, mostly abroad, who have also expressed an interest in decentralising to Limerick. These officers will be assigned to the directorate on a phased basis. The process of recruiting further staff for Limerick via the central applications facility is now being accelerated. The aim is that by the second half of 2006 most posts in the directorate will be filled by staff who will decentralise to Limerick. The total of 39 represents some 31% of the posts being transferred to Limerick.</P>
        <P>Since my last reply to a parliamentary question on this issue, six specialist staff have withdrawn their applications to decentralise to Limerick. Discussions are ongoing with representatives of the specialists, with their union IMPACT, and with the Department of Finance about the con<Col N="1135"/>ditions of service that will be applicable to those specialists who decentralise with the directorate to Limerick and those who choose to remain in Dublin. This issue, of course, also has a wider Civil Service dimension.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Romania, together with Bulgaria, has signed a treaty of accession with the European Union, which is currently in the process of being ratified by EU member states. Ireland has traditionally been supportive of EU enlargement and we look forward to welcoming Romania into the European Union once the ratification and pre-accession procedures have been completed. The European Commission is currently monitoring Romania&rsquo;s preparations for accession to ensure that it can meet all the requirements of membership by the projected date of accession, 1 January 2007.</P>
        <P>The Commission&rsquo;s annual monitoring report for Romania, reflecting the position as of 30 September 2005, was published on 25 October 2005. It provides a comprehensive overview of the progress made by Romania towards meeting the requirements of EU membership. A number of red flag issues have been identified and these will need to be urgently addressed by Romania before the date of accession.</P>
        <P>In the general area of human rights and the protection of minorities, the Commission stated that further efforts were needed in advance of accession. With regard to the reform of child protection, the Commission noted that progress has been made with the closure of large, old-style institutions and the creation of modern child protection alternatives.</P>
        <P>New legislation on children&rsquo;s rights and adoption entered into force in January 2005. According to the Commission report, this legislation brings Romania into line with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the European Convention on Human Rights, and completes the reform of child protection. The progress achieved in the field of child protection in Romania has been widely acknowledged by the independent panel of experts on family law of EU member <Col N="1136"/>states in May 2005. It is regarded as satisfactory and in line with member states&rsquo; best practices.</P>
        <P>The Commission will closely monitor the steps taken to tackle outstanding pre-accession issues and will present a final recommendation to Council in April-May 2006. This will determine if Romania will be in a position to accede as planned on 1 January 2007. If sufficient progress has not been made, the Commission can recommend that the Council postpone the date of accession until 1 January 2008. However, the Commission has noted that, although urgent corrective action is needed in certain areas, Romania, like Bulgaria, still holds the key to its accession on time.</P>
        <P>In a decision taken on 12 April 2005, the Government approved the terms of the treaty of accession for Bulgaria and Romania and authorised its signature, subject to ratification, on behalf of Ireland. The treaty was signed by the EU member states, together with Bulgaria and Romania, on 25 April 2005. To enter into force, the treaty must be ratified by Bulgaria, Romania and all the current member states by 31 December 2006. Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the accession treaty will require an amendment to the European Communities Act 1972. Preparations for this are underway and it is hoped to put the relevant Bill before the Oireachtas in the coming months.</P>

	<P>I regard the film sector as an essential part of our national cultural life. It has also been demonstrated conclusively that the film sector can bring significant economic benefits to this country. However, like any other traded sector, it is subject to the dynamics of international competition, including exchange rates, lower cost structures and new and enhanced incentives elsewhere.</P>
        <P>The Government has shown its support for the film sector in a number of ways. The section 481 incentive scheme has been extended to at least 2008, with the amount that can be raised increasing from &euro;10.48 million to &euro;15 million from 2005.</P>

	<P>The national lottery funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding to sporting and <Col N="1138"/>community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. The programme is advertised on an annual basis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Schools may only apply for funding jointly with local sports clubs or community groups and must show a clear need for the proposed sports facility in the area as formally agreed with other local groups and-or the local authority; show how the proposed facility will meet that need; and show that the local community will have significant access to the proposed facility when it is not being used by the school or college itself. In this regard, the significant access is a requirement for a minimum of at least 30 hours a week throughout the year. Applications from primary and post-primary schools and colleges on their own will not be considered under the programme.</P>
        <P>Applications for funding under the 2006 programme were invited through advertisements in the press on 27 and 28 November 2005. The closing date for receipt of applications was 20 January 2006. All applications received before the deadline, including one from the organisation in question, will be evaluated against the programme&rsquo;s requirements and assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. I intend to announce the grant allocations for the programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>Government policy on the arts is to promote and strengthen the arts in all their forms, increase access to and participation in the arts, and make the arts an integral and valued part of our national life. Responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels throughout the country is primarily devolved to the Arts Council, an independent body funded by the Department and independent in its day-to-day operations.</P>
        <P>During my term as the Minister responsible for the arts, funding for the Arts Council has increased by almost 52% &mdash; from &euro;47.67 million in 2002 to &euro;72.31 million in 2006. This has allowed the council to support a record number of artists and arts organisations. A new record will be set this year with the council&rsquo;s largest ever grants programme of &euro;51 million which will benefit a <Col N="1139"/>total of 325 arts organisations around the country, 22 more than last year.</P>
        <P>The Department has taken a more direct role in the provision of grant-aid for arts and cultural infrastructure and has provided very substantial funding for the capital development of facilities around the country in recent years. The Department&rsquo;s ACCESS scheme, for example, has provided &euro;45.7 million for the development of 44 facilities including museums, arts centres, theatres, and multi-purpose arts spaces throughout the country.</P>
        <P>These are significant amounts of money in any context and the amounts of both current and capital funding that have been provided in recent years have transformed and increased access to the arts and provide an excellent platform for even further developments in the years ahead.</P>
        <P>On the promotion of arts internationally, in February 2005 I launched Culture Ireland, the new body charged with the promotion of Irish arts abroad. This year I secured a budget of &euro;3 million for Culture Ireland, up from &euro;2 million in 2005. This increased funding will enable Culture Ireland to develop Ireland&rsquo;s international arts profile, to provide new opportunities for Irish artists and organisations to work abroad, and to forge new connections for Irish arts internationally.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 85 together.</P>
        <P>In response to a similar question posed by the Deputy in December last I indicated that I had visited Kerry on 21 July 2005 with officials from my Department and the State development agencies. It is my firm intention to visit the Tralee and north Kerry area as soon as my departmental and parliamentary commitments permit and I look forward to discussion with the local chambers of commerce and other interested groups about investment and economic development generally in the region.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland and I, as Minister, am precluded from giving directives to the agency regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.</P>
        <P>At the end of 2004 there were 2,022 people in permanent employment in 21 IDA supported companies in County Kerry. I have been informed by IDA Ireland that employment in client companies in north Kerry increased by 7% in 2005, which is above the national average.</P>
        <P Just="Left">IDA is committed to the development of north Kerry and recognises the need to provide high value employment opportunities that provide sustainable long-term jobs. IDA&rsquo;s strategy for the area is to target companies and projects, particularly in the engineering and consumer products sectors, which are more knowledge intensive and have a higher skill requirement as these types of projects are better capable of integrating into the local economy and being sustained in the long term.</P>
        <P>Shannon Development has responsibility for the provision of property solutions in north Kerry which is part of the IDA mid west region. IDA is actively marketing the Kerry technology park, KTP, adjacent to the Institute of Technology, Tralee, and also the Listowel development centre, as property solutions to potential overseas <Col N="1142"/>investors. IDA officials are also working with the local authority, chamber of commerce, Shannon Development and private property developers in the Tralee area to improve the infrastructure for investment. The installation of broadband connection, via the metropolitan area network, will be a valuable addition to this infrastructure when completed. In addition the agency is working continuously with the existing client base to deepen the global strategic importance of Irish operations within parent corporations.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by IDA Ireland, together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development, will continue to bear fruit in terms of maximising sustainable investment and jobs for the people of Kerry.</P>

	<P Just="Left">A total of 7,015 claims were refused by my Department because of the habitual residence condition up to 23 January 2006. A breakdown by scheme type is set out in the tabular statement below.</P>
        <P>There has been no EU directive on the habitual residence condition and no review of refused cases is either planned or necessary. However, under Article 7(1) of EEC Regulation 1612/68, a worker who is a national of a member state may not, in the territory of the another member state, be treated differently from national workers by reason of his or her nationality in respect of any conditions of employment and work, in particular as regards remuneration, dismissal and, should he or she become unemployed, reinstatement or re-employment. Under Article 7(2) he or she shall enjoy the same social and tax advantages as national workers there.</P>
        <P>The European Court of Justice has held that social benefits guaranteeing the minimum means of subsistence, such as supplementary welfare allowance, is a social advantage within the meaning of Article 7(2) of EEC Regulation 1612/68. Accordingly, on the basis of the principle of equal treatment as outlined above, workers from other EEA countries must be treated in the same way as national workers in determining entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance. This requirement does not apply in the case of other social welfare benefits, such as unemployment assistance or old age pension, as the provisions of EU Regulation 1408/71, which deal with the co-ordination of social security entitlements for migrant workers moving within the EEA, contain specific rules applying to such payments. EU Regulation 1408/71 takes precedence over EEC Regulation 1612/68 in this respect.</P>
        <P>In November 2005 a circular issued to community welfare officers, who administer supplementary welfare allowance on behalf of the Department, clarifying the definition of an EEA worker and a former EEA worker. The purpose of the circular was to ensure that there was no uncertainty regarding the treatment of claims for supplementary welfare allowance from EEA workers. Claims from EEA nationals who are job seekers, claims from other EEA nationals who are not workers and claims from non-EEA nationals are not affected by EEC Regulation 1612/68. All such claims are subject to the habitual residence condition and continue to be processed as heretofore.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The back to education allowance is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force. In budget 2005 the qualifying period for persons accessing the third level option of the scheme was reduced from 15 months&rsquo; to 12 months&rsquo; attachment to a relevant social welfare payment. In August 2005, I announced a further reduction in the 12 month requirement to nine months for persons participating in the national employment <Col N="1145"/>action plan, NEAP, process, provided that the third level course of study being pursued is assessed and recommended by the F&Aacute;S employment services officer as essential to the enhancement of the individual&rsquo;s employment prospects.</P>
        <P>The freedom of information guidelines relating to the scheme were updated in a timely manner to reflect the change and published on my Department&rsquo;s website at that time. The information booklet on the scheme, SW70, is updated each year following the budget. The latest version of the booklet is also published on-line on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>Given the fact that those persons affected by the reduction to nine months would be informed on an individual basis by the F&Aacute;S employment services officer, the then imminence of the new academic year, and the fact that a revised information booklet would not be available in a short timeframe, it was decided that it was not necessary or feasible to produce a new information booklet prior to budget 2006. Work has commenced on the reprint of the information booklet. When the final document is published details will also be updated on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

        <asker>Mr. Stanton</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>if his Department has information on the level of educational qualification attained by each lone parent in receipt of one parent family payments; if so, the breakdown of the educational qualifications achieved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The one parent family payment, OFP, is paid by my Department to parents who, for one reason or another, are parenting alone. Educational attainment is not a condition for receipt of the payment and no data on the level of qualification attained by the OFP recipient are captured at the time of application. At the end of 2005 there were some 80,000 lone parents in receipt of one parent family payment.</P>
        <P>Based on data from the CSO census in 2002, a total of 154,000 persons categorised themselves as lone parents. This included people on one parent family payment, widow&rsquo;s pension and people not in receipt of any social welfare payment. However, a breakdown across those categories is not available. As the total includes more than 37,000 people aged 65 years or more, it presumably includes parents with adult children who self-categorise themselves as lone parents. The CSO&rsquo;s analysis of the lone parent census data shows that 32% of those who categorised themselves as lone parents had primary level or no formal education, 26% had completed the junior certificate, 22% had completed the leaving certificate, 13% had completed third level and 7% were either not stated or not available.</P>
        <P>Analysis of the census data shows that age is a key factor in the highest level of education com<Col N="1146"/>pleted, with older age groups tending to have completed education at a lower level. For example, 45.6% of lone parents with primary level or no formal education are aged 65 or more and a further 47.3% are aged 35 to 64, meaning that 92.9% are over 35. Recipients of the one parent family payment tend to fall into younger age groups. For example, two-thirds of OFP recipients are under 35, whereas only 21% of lone parents reported in the census are under 35.</P>
        <P>Census data for lone parents aged under 35 show that approximately 10% have primary level education only, including those with no formal education, and a further 37% have intermediate level. Therefore approximately 47% have a level of education which would bring them to the minimum school leaving age but not beyond.</P>
        <P>The census findings refer to those in the population as a whole who categorise themselves as lone parents and cannot be assumed to apply in the same proportions to those in receipt of the one parent family payment.</P>
        <P>One of the key tasks in the ending child poverty initiative under Sustaining Progress is to address obstacles to employment for lone parents. In this context, a sub-group of the senior officials group on social inclusion has been examining obstacles to employment for lone parent families, with particular emphasis on income supports, employment, education, child care and support programmes and information. In addition, a working group established in my Department to review the income support arrangements for lone parents has looked at issues including the contingency basis of the one parent family payment, cohabitation, maintenance and secondary benefits. A consultation process with social partners and other interested parties was also undertaken to inform the work of the group.</P>
        <P>I intend to make the findings of both working groups public in the near future.</P>

        <P>My Department, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, has developed a package of measures to deal with the backlog of driving test applications. It is my intention to reduce the driving test backlog by 80,000 by June 2007. To this end a package of measures was proposed which included a bonus scheme for driver testers, recruitment of an additional ten testers and the outsourcing of a batch of 40,000 tests. The testing and recruitment process of the proposed ten contract testers is currently under way in the Public Appointments Service. Some 89 driver testers have signed up for the bonus scheme which is due to commence on 6 February 2006. This is expected to deliver over 30,000 tests based on commitments given.</P>
        <P>The tendering process for the outsourcing of tests has been completed and a preferred tender has been selected. However no contract has yet been awarded as the matter has been the subject of conciliation at the Labour Relations Commission as unions consider the proposed outsourcing to be in breach of Sustaining Progress. Agreement was reached at the LRC under which it was agreed that my Department would seek expressions of interest from surplus staff within the Department of Agriculture and Food for temporary re-deployment as driver testers. A minimum number of 25 additional staff were required. My Department has processed the applications received and this week will interview a shortlist of ten following which the successful candidates will be trained as driver testers. The agreement also provided that in the event of the proposal proving to be undeliverable at any stage the Department would take measures to address the backlog.</P>
        <P>As the number of additional staff from the Department of Agriculture and Food is insufficient to deliver the required tests my Department has resumed discussions with the preferred tenderer with a view to awarding a contract for the outsourcing of 40,000 tests.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The formulation of traffic management strategies generally is a matter for the determination of each local authority. In that context the development of a specific strategy for the management of heavy goods vehicles in Dublin city to coincide with the opening of the Dublin Port Tunnel is a matter for Dublin City Council. An initial draft of such a strategy was made available to my Department in December 2003 for information purposes prior to the instigation by the city council of a public consultation process. Significant developments have been pursued in respect of the proposed strategy and I understand that a further public consultation process was initiated by the city council in respect of their latest proposals in December 2005.</P>
        <P>The management strategy currently proposed by the city council will incorporate the application of certain restrictions on the use of heavy goods vehicles in areas in the city, which will have to be supported by an appropriate statutory framework. The city council has been engaged with my Department since early 2004 in the determination of such a framework. This will <Col N="1150"/>incorporate the making of traffic and parking regulations under section 35 of the Road Traffic Act 1994 which will address, in particular, the parameters for restrictions or exemptions for the operation of a permit system, and the making of traffic signs regulations under section 95 of the Road Traffic Act 1961.</P>
        <P>Decisions regarding the areas where the restrictions will apply and the vehicles that will be subject to it will be matters for the determination of the city council.</P>

	<P>In January 2005, I made the Road Traffic (Speed Limit &mdash; Traffic Signs) Regulations 2005, SI 10 of 2005, prescribing the regulatory traffic signs displaying metric units of measurement, namely km/h, that the road authorities must provide on public roads to indicate the speed limit in force. This range of traffic signs can be deployed to indicate that a default speed limit, a special speed limit including the use of a periodic speed limit or a road works speed limit is in force.</P>
        <P>On 30 November 2005, I made further regulations, the Road Traffic (Traffic Signs &mdash; Periodic Special Speed Limits) Regulations 2005, SI 756 of 2005, to provide an alternative format of a speed limit traffic sign, which may be deployed to indicate that a periodic special speed limit under section 9(5) of the Road Traffic Act 2004 is applied.</P>

Applicants must be in receipt of farm assist, or have been allocated a valid herd or flock number from the Department of Agriculture and Food and be in receipt of either unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit, if previously on CE disability allowance, from the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>
        <P>Alternatively, applicants will be self-employed fisherpersons on a fishing boat which has been entered in the register of fishing boats, or have been issued with a fishing licence for fishing for <Col N="1153"/>salmon at sea from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, and in receipt of one of unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, if previously on CE, or disability allowance from the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>
        <P>The person in question, prior to commencement on this scheme, was signing for credited social insurance contributions, or credits, with the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Credited contributions are notional social insurance contributions, which are awarded to an insured person without a pay related social insurance, PRSI, payment being received.</P>
        <P>My Department has established, following legal advice, that a person signing for credits has no underlying entitlement to participate in the scheme. The person concerned spent one year on the scheme but following the legal clarification was informed that she could not continue to participate for a further period on the basis of credited social insurance contributions. To be eligible going forward a person must meet the criteria set out above.</P>

	<P>The national drugs strategy contains 108 actions to counteract drug misuse, including the misuse of cocaine and crack cocaine. At present there is no substitution treatment drug for cocaine and existing services such as counselling and behavioural therapy are the best treatments available. In this context, the Health Service Executive has recruited additional counsellors and outreach workers in the past number of years.</P>
        <P>In 2005 I launched four pilot cocaine treatment projects to examine different methods of treatment for cocaine use, as well as a training initiative focusing on frontline workers. Funding of almost &euro;400,000 was provided by me to support these initiatives.</P>
        <P>The four projects deal with the following cohorts of cocaine users; intravenous cocaine users; poly-drug users using cocaine; problematic intranasal cocaine users; and problematic female cocaine users.</P>
        <P>Independent consultants have been engaged to conduct an evaluation of the pilot projects. This work has commenced and it is expected that a preliminary report will be available in the coming months. The main thrust of the evaluation will be to analyse, in a systematic manner, what is being <Col N="1154"/>achieved by the projects and to report on the lessons to be learned as a result. It is hoped that the results of this evaluation will aid the formulation of further effective actions aimed at tackling cocaine and crack cocaine misuse.</P>
        <P>I also point out that all schools now have substance misuse prevention programmes. Furthermore, a national drugs awareness campaign focused specifically on cocaine use in 2004-05. This well-received campaign sought to dispel the image that cocaine was a clean and safe drug with few detrimental consequences.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As part of the national drugs strategy, ten regional drugs task forces, RDTFs, have been established throughout the country. The RDTFs work in a partnership manner, similar to the local drugs task forces, LDTFs, and are made up of nominees from State agencies working in the region, the community and voluntary sectors and elected public representatives. They cover all parts of the country that are not serviced by one of the 14 LDTFs.</P>
        <P>At the outset the RDTFs were involved in mapping out the patterns of drug misuse in their areas, as well as the current levels of services in place to address these problems. This work informed the development of action plans to address gaps in key services going forward. The action plan in respect of each RDTF was subsequently forwarded to the national drugs strategy team, NDST, for assessment. Arising from the plans, I have made allocations totalling just under &euro;5 million per annum to allow the RDTFs to get a range of projects up and running in their areas.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, offers of employment as RDTF co-ordinators have recently been made to those individuals who were successful in a recent recruitment process and I am confident that the level of activity of the RDTFs in the provision of services will increase substantially in the current year.</P>

        <P>I do not accept that there has been any delay on the part of my Department in the preparation of the revised farm waste management scheme. Last July I announced outline details of the proposed revised scheme. However, as the Deputies are aware, the approval of the European Commission is required for such from a state aids perspective. A formal application seeking Commission approval for the revised scheme was submitted on 30 September 2005. The application has been the subject of ongoing negotiation between the Commission and my Department in the intervening period.</P>
        <P>I expect that the outstanding issues will be resolved in the near future so that the revised scheme can be introduced at an early date.</P>

	<P>The person named submitted an application, on 28 October 2004, for consideration of his circumstances under the second tranche of the <i>force majeure</i>-exceptional circumstances measure of the single payment scheme. Having assessed the application the single payment entitlements unit informed the person named that the circumstances outlined did not fulfil the <i>force majeure</i> criteria laid down in Article 40 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1782/2003. Furthermore, no payments issued under the premia and arable aid schemes, except a minimal amount of slaughter premium, during the reference period 2000-02 and none during the earlier reference period 1997-99. There are no provisions under the <i>force majeure</i> measure that permit the allocation of any additional entitlements regardless of the circumstances.</P>
        <P>However, the person named was advised to submit applications under the new entrant-inheritance measures of the single payment scheme. During the processing of his new entrant application, it was established that he was not eligible under this measure because he did not establish entitlements in his own right in the reference years 2000-02. However, the application for the transfer of entitlements by way of inheritance was successful and he was notified that inherited entitlements were transferred to him. A single payment amounting to &euro;256.58 was paid to the applicant on 1 December 2005. The outstanding amount of &euro;1,281.00 due to the person named in respect of the dairy premium is scheduled to issue to him shortly.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, which are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength of Monivea Garda station as at 25 January 2006 was one sergeant and one garda. Local Garda management states there are currently no plans to alter the personnel strength of Monivea Garda station and resources are augmented from within the district-division, as required. Local Garda management also states it will continue to monitor policing arrangements in all sub-districts with a view to ensuring that all areas receive an adequate policing service and when additional personnel next become available the needs of Monivea Garda station will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country.</P>
        <P>The timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in line with the commitment in the agreed programme for Government remains as when I announced the Government approval in October 2004 for my proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this process, 1,125 Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda College during 2005. The college will induct 1,100 recruits this year and a further 1,100 in 2007, by way of intakes to the Garda College of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. This project is fully on target and will be achieved.</P>

	<P>There are currently 64 Garda youth diversion projects, three of which &mdash; KEY, JAY and YEW &mdash; are operating in the Tallaght area. In addition, one sergeant and four Garda level juvenile liaison officers operate from Tallaght Garda station. I am committed to the continuing development and, as resources permit, expansion of Garda youth diversion projects and the possibility of funding further projects in light of budgetary conditions remains. A budget of &euro;6.6 million has been provided for the Garda youth diversion projects and local drugs task force projects in 2006. This represents an increase of &euro;1.2 million in the budget for youth diversion compared with 2005.</P>
        <P>It is my intention to ensure that 100 schemes will be established nationwide before the end of 2007. I have, therefore, asked the Garda Commissioner to bring forward proposals for further community based initiatives in this area in light of the additional funding. I am informed by the Garda authorities that an updated application for an additional project in the Tallaght area &mdash; the STAY project &mdash; was received by the Garda community relations section on 5 January 2006. The catchment area proposed by this project covers Tymon North. This application is being assessed by the community relations section in accordance with the Garda youth diversion project guidelines. This assessment, when completed, and a recommendation on funding will be forwarded to my Department for consideration.</P>

        <Quest>the membership of the disability legislation consultation group; the remit of this group; the meetings he or his Minister of State have had with the members of this group following the passage of the Disability Act 2005; his plans to set up additional such groups with a wider membership to monitor the progress of the Disability Act 2005; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>The disability legislation consultation group, DLCG, is a group comprising representatives of people with disabilities, their families, carers and service providers brought together by the National Disability Authority, NDA, to provide an input to the consultation process on the Disability Bill initiated by the Government in April 2002.</P>
        <P>Neither I nor the Minister of State have formally met the DLCG since the enactment of the Disability Bill in July 2005. With regard to the question of monitoring the progress of the Disability Act 2005, I accept that a broadly based representative group or groups capable of channelling overall concerns in this regard and making representations to Ministers in relevant Departments would be advantageous for Departments and the disability sector. I would welcome any initiative from the sector, in the first place, to organise itself on this basis or any such initiative that may be facilitated by the NDA. Officials from my Department are currently in contact with the NDA with a view to advancing the position in this regard. In the event that nothing crystallises, the Minister of State intends to consider how best to facilitate, if necessary, an initiative.</P>
        <P>I might add that Departments are engaging with the sector on the matters particular to those Departments under the Disability Act and good examples of constructive consultations are evident in the process of the development by the various Departments of their sectoral plans under the Act. The NDA is playing a valuable role in supporting and co-ordinating this consultation.</P>

	<P>The person in question applied for permission to remain in the State under the revised arrangements announced by me on 15 January 2005 for the processing of applications from the non-national parents of Irish born children born before 1 January 2005. It is required <Col N="1164"/>under the revised arrangements that the applicant must provide evidence that he or she has been living with the Irish born child or children in the State on a continuous basis since the child&rsquo;s birth. In this case, the applicant did not provide any evidence to show that he is resident with his Irish born children or is involved in their upbringing. It is also required that the applicant provides evidence of identity in the form of a passport or national identity card. The applicant has not to date submitted either of these documents. Accordingly, the application for permission to remain was refused.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, an application for a Garda CCTV system in Drogheda had been submitted to the CCTV advisory committee for consideration. This committee was established by the Garda Commissioner to advise on all matters relating to CCTV systems. Following recommendations from the Garda authorities, I have approved the implementation of new Garda CCTV systems in a further six locations, including Drogheda. The additional locations are as follows, in alphabetical order: Drogheda, Dungarvan, Kinsale, Mullingar, Portlaoise and Tullamore.</P>
        <P>With the addition of the six new locations I have outlined, a total of 17 Garda town centre CCTV systems will be implemented in the following locations: Athlone, Ballyfermot, Carlow, Castlebar, Clondalkin, Clonmel, Drogheda, Dungarvan, Ennis, Kilkenny, Kinsale, Mullingar, Portlaoise, Sligo, Tallaght, Tullamore and Waterford.</P>
        <P>As I have indicated previously, I am anxious to accelerate the implementation of this CCTV programme and reduce as far as possible the workload of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard. The answer is to outsource the installation of Garda CCTV systems to the greatest extent possible, making use not only of the technical but also of the project management expertise in the private sector.</P>
        <P>In recent months the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has conducted a thorough examination of all aspects of Garda involvement in CCTV systems. Following <Col N="1168"/>this review, I have recently received a comprehensive and innovative proposal for the project management and the outsourced service provision of Garda CCTV systems from the Garda Commissioner.</P>
        <P>The Garda authorities wish to commence the initial public procurement process and I am also anxious to proceed urgently with this comprehensive request for tender to source the best CCTV service possible for Drogheda and the other 16 locations selected. This will happen in conjunction with the imminent commencement of section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 which provides a legislative basis for the operation of CCTV in public places. My Department is currently in consultation with the Department of Finance with a view to proceeding as quickly as possible with the procurement process to contract the project managers and outsourced service providers for the development, installation and management of these CCTV systems.</P>
        <P>My ambition is to have a Garda CCTV system operating in Drogheda and in the other 16 locations, at the earliest opportunity, subject to the limitations of compliance with relevant procurement legislation and procedures.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition, I have recently approved a grant for stage 2 &mdash; operational &mdash; funding, subject to contract negotiations with Pobal, to Drogheda Borough Council following its successful application under my Department&rsquo;s community based CCTV scheme. Pobal has been engaged to administer the scheme on behalf of my Department and will liaise directly with the applicant before a draw down of funds is authorised.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I understand that the council&rsquo;s community CCTV proposal involves the installation of cameras in a number of RAPID designated areas in Drogheda. This differs from the Drogheda Garda CCTV system, which will cover the town centre.</P>
        <P>On CCTV for Ardee, I recently approved a stage 1 &mdash; pre-development &mdash; grant award of &euro;5,000 to Ardee community CCTV scheme group following an application under my Department&rsquo;s community based CCTV scheme.</P>
        <P>I am further advised by Pobal that it has recently written directly to all successful stage 1 applicants regarding the next step in this process. It is also my intention to invite a new round of applications for funding under the community based CCTV scheme in the coming months, and it is open to the Ardee community CCTV scheme group to submit a stage 2 application for funding at that time.</P>

	<P>The consumption of alcohol and drugs has long been accepted as a factor which increases the risk of involvement in collisions. The information contained in the report of the Louth county coroner is further confirmation of the deleterious relationship between alcohol, drugs and driving. The report shows a trend towards improved driver behaviour with a general increase in the percentage of drivers below the alcohol legal limit for the period. While in 2000 some 57% of drivers killed in road traffic accidents were below the legal limit, this increased to 78% and 82% in 2004 and 2005, respectively.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The number of convictions for drink driving shows a reduction for the years 2002 and 2003. A contributory factor to this reduction was the adjournment of a very large number of cases based on the results of evidential breath testing in Garda stations to await the outcome of a constitutional challenge to the Road Traffic Act 1994, which has since been successfully defended in the courts. I am further informed by the Garda authorities that figures are not complied in such a way as to distinguish between driving under the influence of alcohol and driving under the influence of drugs. The final figure for 2005 is not yet available.</P>

Representations setting out reasons that she should not be deported were subsequently received.</P>

	<P>I would like to clarify at the outset that the person concerned is not the subject of a deportation order. She is, however, subject to a transfer order under the Dublin II Regulation &mdash; Council Regulation (EC) No. 343/2003. This regulation is intended to prevent the phenomenon of &ldquo;asylum shopping&rdquo; across Europe and sets out criteria for determining which member state is responsible for examining an asylum application. At the same time, it guarantees applicants that one state will process their application, thereby preventing the creation of &ldquo;refugees in orbit&rdquo;, a situation which had pertained in Europe prior to the introduction in 1995 of its predecessor, the Dublin Convention. Under the Dublin II Regulation, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner can, on the basis <Col N="1173"/>of the relevant criteria, request another state to accept responsibility for an asylum application and have it processed in that other state.</P>
        <P>The person concerned arrived in Ireland on 14 October 2005 and claimed asylum. Following investigation, it was determined by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner that pursuant to the provisions of the Dublin regulation, Belgium was the appropriate state to process her application as she had already made an earlier asylum claim there on 4 April 2005. She was offered an opportunity to appeal the determination of the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner to the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal but chose not to do so. She was kept informed of developments throughout the course of her asylum application in Ireland and was made aware that her case fell to be dealt with under the terms of the Dublin II Regulation.</P>
        <P>Belgium accepted responsibility for this case and a transfer order was signed on 11 January 2006 in respect of the person concerned, requiring her to return to Belgium. The order issued to her on 16 January 2006 requiring her to present herself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB, 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2, on Monday 23 January 2006. She presented as required. Her removal from the State and transfer to Belgium is now an operational matter for GNIB.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Belgium, and not Ireland, is responsible for examining the asylum application of the person concerned. Indeed it is for the Belgian authorities to assess the protection needs, if any, of the person concerned. Belgium is a party to and thus bound by international human rights instruments which prohibit <i>refoulement.</i> I am, therefore, satisfied that any medical and-or protection needs arising in this case can be suitably dealt with by the Belgian authorities.</P>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 1 July 2005 and claimed asylum on that date. His asylum claim was investigated by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner who concluded that the person concerned did not meet the criteria for recognition as a refugee. This position was conveyed to the person concerned by letter dated 9 August 2005. This communication also advised the person concerned of his entitlement to appeal this determination to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal which he duly did. The Refugee Appeals Tribunal considered this appeal and, having done so, decided to affirm the recommendation of the Refugee Applications Commissioner. This position was conveyed to the person concerned by letter dated 16 November 2005.</P>
        <P>In accordance with normal procedures, the file of the person concerned was forwarded to the ministerial decisions unit of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for the purposes of having the Minister&rsquo;s formal decision conveyed to the person concerned, in accordance with the provisions of section 17(1) of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended. As a result, by letter dated 16 January 2006, my Department&rsquo;s ministerial decisions unit wrote to the person concerned to advise him that he had been refused a declaration of refugee status. This communication also advised him that his entitlement to be in the State had expired and advised him of the options open to him at that point in time, namely, to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to deportation or to submit, within 15 working days, written representations to the Minister setting out reasons why he should not be deported, that is, <Col N="1176"/>why he should be permitted to remain in the State.</P>
        <P>Any representations received from or on behalf of the person concerned will be fully considered before a final decision is taken in relation to his position in the State. In arriving at such a decision, I must have regard for the 11 headings set out in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, for example, the family and domestic circumstances of the person concerned, the duration of their residence in the State and other humanitarian considerations and I must also have regard for section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, on the prohibition of <i>refoulement</i>.</P>
        <P Just="Left"><?oasys _dc14- ?>The Deputy should note that all elements of an asylum claim advanced by an applicant are fully investigated by the Refugee Applications Commissioner at first instance and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal before they reach a conclusion in each individual case.

As a result, I am satisfied that the State&rsquo;s refugee status determination processes provide sufficient safeguards to ensure that all issues related to the health, safety and well-being of an applicant, if returned to their homeland, are given full consideration.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>

Over 70 special educational needs organisers have been recruited throughout the country and are a focal point of contact for schools and parents. My officials have been advised by the council that an application has been received for special educational needs supports for the pupil referred to by the Deputy. The local special educational needs organiser has sanctioned five hours of individual resource teaching and five hours of special needs assistant support to the pupil. The school authorities were notified accordingly on 24 October 2005. The council will review decisions previously taken on such cases on foot of a request from the school, or from parents or guardians, when accompanied by relevant additional information that may not have been to hand at the time of the decision.

	<P>Civic, social and political education is part of the core curriculum for junior cycle students. It was introduced in September 1996 and first examined in the junior certificate examination in June 1999. As the Deputy knows, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment submitted to me its proposals for the future development of senior cycle education last year. This advice, which is based on extensive consultation and research, includes a recommendation that the range of subjects offered for leaving certificate should be reviewed to establish the new subjects which should be added. It specifies civic and political education as one of the first new subjects that should be considered. The national council is advancing its proposals for senior cycle reform. It has prioritised civic and political education by placing it in the first phase of subjects to be addressed. I understand that an education officer with a specific remit for civic and social education was recently appointed and that work has already begun on this aspect of the reform. There is a need to provide senior cycle students with opportunities to build on the foundations laid in the junior certificate civic, social and political education course and to further develop their knowledge and understandings of citizenship, based on human rights and social responsibilities. I will be advised on how to proceed in this regard in due course by the national council.</P>

	<P>Funding is provided to primary and secondary schools by way of <i>per capita </i>grants, which affords schools considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. This is in my view, in general, a preferable approach to putting in place grants for specific cost items such as insurance. I have previously made known my view that moving to a position where the Government covers the insurance costs of schools may encourage the insurance sector to keep increasing premia on the basis that the State would meet the cost. Such an approach would also reduce the incentive for school management to reduce risks.</P>
        <P>I draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to my announcement, in the context of the 2006 Estimates, of further significant increases in the level of funding for primary and post-primary schools. Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level has been increased from &euro;57.14 per pupil to &euro;133.58 with effect from 1 January 2005 and has recently been further increased by &euro;12 per pupil with effect from 1 January 2006 bringing the standard rate to &euro;145.58. This represents an increase of almost 155% in the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level since 1997.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At second level, the standard <i>per capita</i> grant which stood at &euro;256 per pupil in the school year 2001-02 has been increased by a further &euro;12 to &euro;298 per pupil from January 2006. Secondary schools will also benefit, under the school services support fund initiative, from further significant increases in the support services grant. The support grant that was increased for secondary schools from &euro;131 per pupil in January 2005 to &euro;145 per pupil, has been increased by a further &euro;14 per pupil to &euro;159 per pupil from January 2006. These grants are in addition to the <i>per capita</i> funding of up to &euro;40,000 per school that is provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. A <Col N="1181"/>secondary school with 500 pupils now receives annual grants of up to &euro;270,000 towards general expenses and support services as against annual grants of up to &euro;237,000 in 2002.</P>
        <P>These significant increases in the funding of the primary and post primary sector are a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.</P>

        <P>There are 21 new primary school projects incorporated in this announcement, including a new school project for Scoil Naomh Seosamh, Mell, Drogheda. It is intended that these schools will be built using innovative methods such as standardised design model or design and build process which have been successfully introduced by my Department in recent years.</P>

	<P>My Department is aware that the population of County Louth continues to increase and that this is causing some strain on existing educational provision at post-primary level.</P>
        <P>However my Department has undertaken a number of measures to address the current and future need for pupil places in this area in general and in the areas referred to by the Deputy in particular.</P>
        <P>An extension to Scoil U&iacute; Mhuire Dunleer is currently under construction and extension projects at Drogheda Grammar School and Dundalk Grammar School are in architectural planning. My Department is also currently examining applications for extensions at Bush post-primary school, Col&aacute;iste R&iacute;s Dundalk, St. Vincent&rsquo;s Secondary School Dundalk, Our Lady&rsquo;s College Greenhills, Sacred Heart Secondary School Drogheda, St. Joseph&rsquo;s CBS Drogheda and St. Mary&rsquo;s Diocesan School Drogheda.</P>
        <P>My Department has also had discussions with Louth County Council which has appointed consultants to draw up a master plan for three new residential neighbourhoods as identified under the local area plan for north Drogheda environs 2004. My Department received draft working papers on the planning strategy for this master plan and officials subsequently met with the local authority to discuss the plan. Following this, my Department corresponded with the local authority outlining its initial assessment of educational requirements at both primary and post-primary level for the area based on a proposal in the plan to deliver up to 7,500 new houses over the next ten to 15 years.</P>
        <P>My Department also received correspondence from Dundalk Town Council with regard to a proposed development plan for the south west sector of Dundalk. This correspondence outlined proposals for the development of three areas of residential development comprising of some 7,300 units. As a result, my Department outlined its initial assessment of educational requirements for this area based on the proposed development. The next stage in this process is the preparation of a draft development plan by the local authority which my Department will be commenting on when available.</P>
        <P>Apart from this, as the Deputy will also be aware, a new school planning model involving published area development plans is being piloted in five areas over the current school year. Drogheda is included in the pilot scheme as part of an overall plan for the north Dublin-east Meath and south Louth area. The need for additional primary and post-primary schools in the area will be further considered in this context. The purpose of this new approach to school plan<Col N="1183"/>ning is to ensure that, in future, the provision of school infrastructure will be decided only after a transparent consultation process. In this regard, parents, trustees, sponsors of prospective new schools and all interested parties from a locality will have the opportunity to have their voices heard in the process.</P>

	<P>The school referred to by the Deputy was listed among the 43 schools that I announced in March of 2005 to start architectural planning. The brief is for a new 16-classroom school. Apart from the civil or structural engineer, whom the Department of Education and Science hopes to have appointed in the near future, all other design team members have been appointed. The architectural service for this project is being dealt with in-house by the school building section and substantial works on the early stages of the design process have already been completed.</P>
        <P>The school authorities wrote to the Department of Education and Science in December 2005 requesting amendments to the brief and this is being examined by Department officials. When this is completed the Department of Education and Science will be in further contact with the school authorities as to the next step required to <Col N="1186"/>progress the project. It is not possible at this point to indicate when the architectural planning process will be completed. There are five stages in this process and the timeframe for completing these stages is contingent on various factors including any unexpected issues that may arise, the period of time for the granting of planning permission, and obtaining a fire certificate etc.</P>

        <P>The Department&rsquo;s school transport section is satisfied on the basis of the catchment area map held in the Department, which is the definitive map, that the children in question are not fully eligible for transport to schools in Wexford town. Furthermore, Bus &Eacute;ireann has informed the Department of Education and Science that there are not enough spare seats available on the buses to facilitate the pupils in question with catchment boundary transport to Wexford town.</P>
        <P>A number of families from the Blackwater area recently appealed the Department&rsquo;s decision to the independent school transport appeals board. The board upheld the Department&rsquo;s decision in the matter. The school transport appeals board is independent of the Department of Education and Science and it would not be appropriate for me <Col N="1187"/>to intervene in cases which have been considered by the board.</P>

	<P>The Registration Council is the statutory body in this country for the recognition of qualifications for the purposes of teaching in secondary schools. The council stipulates that a second level teacher must hold, in addition to the required teacher training, a suitable primary degree or equivalent award from a nationally recognised university or similar third level college, which is adequate to enable the holder to teach to the highest level at least one subject from the second level schools curriculum. The duration of such a degree programme must be at least three years of full-time study or equivalent.</P>
        <P>The qualifications of the person referred to by the Deputy were assessed by the Registration Council in 2001 and were deemed suitable for the purposes of teaching chemistry. She was advised that the qualifications had been recognised for this purpose. The council was not satisfied that these qualifications met its criteria for the teaching of mathematics and she was advised that recognition could not be granted for this second subject. A review can be undertaken by the Registration Council should additional documentary evidence be submitted that addresses the shortfalls identified by the council in respect of mathematics.</P>

	<P>As there is no postal system operating to or within Liberia, the Defence Forces have contracted a commercial courier to deliver Defence Forces post to and from the United Nations Mission in Liberia, UNMIL. This contract is for letter post only and is dispatched through this contract twice weekly &mdash; Monday and Thursday &mdash; throughout the year.</P>
        <P>Parcel post received by the Defence Forces for delivery to Irish personnel serving in UNMIL is forwarded to the mission on resupply flights. Personnel of the 94th Infantry Battalion were deployed to UNMIL in late November 2006. The first resupply flight following their deployment was on 17 January 2006 when parcels received by the Defence Forces, prior to Christmas and up to and including the flight date, were transported to UNMIL. The next such flight has been arranged for 7 February 2006. It is clearly understood by the deployed personnel that parcels can only be <Col N="1189"/>delivered on resupply flights and this has been the case since we first deployed to the mission in November 2003.</P>
        <P>All personnel deploying to UNMIL are advised verbally and in writing of the postal arrangements prior to their departure to the mission area. These briefings indicate clearly that there is no parcel post service to UNMIL and personnel are advised to inform their families accordingly. The situation will not arise again as we will be completing our participation in the mission in November this year and withdrawing with Sweden, our partners in the quick reaction force.</P>

While more or less free to travel anywhere, most personnel opt to return to Ireland on leave.</P>
        <P>When the Defence Forces initially deployed to UNMIL, representations were made to my predecessor regarding the excessive costs involved for personnel wishing to go on leave in the course of their tour of duty. The average cost of a return commercial scheduled flight ticket Dublin-Monrovia via Brussels is in excess of &euro;2,000 and involves a 16 hour journey. In response to these representations, arrangements were made by my predecessor to allow personnel serving in UNMIL, wishing to take leave, to avail of aircraft chartered for the deployment, consignment and-or repatriation of personnel, stores and equipment to and from the mission area at a cost of &euro;500 per head, a saving of &euro;1,500 on the commercial alternative.</P>
        <P>UNMIL is the only mission where this facility is provided. There is no obligation on personnel serving in UNMIL either to take leave in the course of their tour of duty or to use the facility of the return flights to Ireland. In the normal course, personnel going on leave when deployed on a <Col N="1190"/>mission pay their own costs in respect of annual leave flights.</P>
        <P>Regarding UN funding for these flights, troop-contributing nations are not entitled to reimbursement by the UN in respect of the provision of flights for personnel going on leave.</P>

	<P>My Department is not aware of any recent court case as referred to by the Deputy. In a High Court judgment given on 5 August 2003, by consent, the court found that my Department was not bound under the relevant leases to surrender any part of the leased lands at Ballincollig to the head landlord in question, is entitled to alienate the leased lands for the residue of the leasehold period and is entitled, without the constrictions which had been contended by the head landlord, to dispose of the entirety of the lands without consent of the said head landlord.</P>
        <P>My Department held and continues to hold part of lands at Ballincollig under leases dating back to 1805. Those leases are of 999 years duration, commencing 31 December 1804, and provide for payment of leasehold rent to a head landlord. My Department was notified by letter dated 7 October 1968 that the head landlord interest of the Wyse estate in the property at Ballincollig was sold and conveyed to Ballincollig Holdings Limited and that all future leasehold rent should be paid to Messrs. Joseph Morrisey, Solicitors, 17A South Mall, Cork. Ballincollig Holdings Limited remains the current lessors.</P>
        <P>My Department continues to make payment of the relevant remaining portions of the annual rents payable under the leases. No other payments have been made to the lessor.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Responsibility for enforcement of the Litter Pollution Acts 1997 to 2003, including enforcement of on-the-spot litter fines and the taking of litter prosecutions, is a matter for local authorities. I am satisfied that the penalties and enforcement powers under existing litter legislation are adequate.</P>
        <P>Since the introduction of the 1997 Act there has been a substantial increase in the number of prosecutions taken and on-the-spot fines issued by local authorities. Local authorities submit data to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government every six months on anti-litter enforcement action including the number of prosecutions taken, convictions secured and on-the-spot fines issued and paid. This data is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P><Col N="1192"/>
        <P>In response to inquiries from my Department, local authorities indicated that the level of litter on-the-spot fines payment is affected by a range of factors, including: provision by offenders of false or misleading information; offenders moving address with no forwarding address available; waiving of fines on appeal for reasons such as compassionate grounds; lapse of statutory period for pursuing non-payment; incorrect issue of fine notices; issue of two or more fine notices in respect of the same offence, such as to a number of occupants of a house, where the local authority subsequently deems it more appropriate to accept a single payment and annuls the other fines and fines being struck out in court.</P>
        <P>Every opportunity will continue to be taken to urge local authorities to enforce the litter laws as rigorously as possible, including appropriate follow-up action in regard to non-payment of fines.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>In accordance with section 52 of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003 the determination of waste management charges, and any associated waiver scheme, is a matter for the relevant local authority, where it acts as the service provider. Local authorities and central government are working together to comply with the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle, as this is a core element of national and EU environmental policy, including in the area of waste management. In accordance with this policy, all of society must be encouraged to reduce, reuse and recycle waste to the maximum extent possible.</P>
        <P>In order to encourage households, whether owner occupied or rented, to minimise their waste, all local authorities and private waste operators were asked to begin a switch to use-based charging arrangements from the start of 2005. These arrangements do not justify any recourse by persons in illegal waste activity and local authorities have the powers necessary to deal with such infringements.</P>

	<P>The Local Government Act 2001 modernises the legislative framework, supports community involvement with local authorities in a more participative local democracy and underpins generally the programme of local government renewal. The Act takes account of the recommendations of the 1996 report of the reorganisation commission, Towards Cohesive Local Government &mdash; Town and County, regarding improved accessibility, interaction and linkages for non-local authority towns within county council areas.</P>
        <P>Section 185 of the Local Government Act 2001 provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that qualified electors of a town having a population of at least 7,500 as ascertained at the last preceding census and not having a town council may make a proposal for the establishment of such a council. This figure <Col N="1194"/>was set in line with the figures mentioned in the 1996 report referred to above. The population of Blessington is less than this required population threshold.</P>
        <P>However, in line with the local government modernisation programme, Wicklow County Council has, with financial assistance from my Department, established a one stop shop civic office in Blessington. In addition, the interests of the Blessington community are represented at area committee and county council level by their elected council members.</P>
