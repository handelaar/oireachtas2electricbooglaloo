      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will give the reason for the withdrawal of the blind pension of 12/6 a week in the case of Mrs. Rose McKeown, of Annahale, Castleblayney, who was in receipt of a pension since 1944.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Mrs. McKeown was granted a pension of 7/- per week in 1943.  She applied for a higher rate in 1944 and her circumstances were reinvestigated. It was found that her means&mdash;half her husband's income&mdash; had increased slightly, and a higher pension was not granted.  Arrangements were then made, in accordance with long-established practice, to keep the case under review and reinvestigations were made from time to time.  A reinvestigation which took place in October last disclosed that owing to a substantial increase in her husband's earnings Mrs. McKeown's means exceeded the statutory limit of £52 5s. 0d. per annum and her pension was withdrawn.</P>
      <P>As it might be inferred from the terms of the Deputy's question that Mrs. McKeown was receiving 12/6 per week from 1944 onwards, I should like to make it clear that she received 7/-per week up to January, 1949, when in consequence of the general increases granted under the Social Welfare Act, 1948, the amount payable to her was automatically raised to 12/6 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMaguire" hpid="Dr. Maguire Dr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that at the time Mrs. McKeown received this <Col N="1428" /> blind pension in 1943 the means test operated?  At the present time, when we are led to believe that the means test is practically non-existent, the fact of her husband having earned £92 militates against her continuing to receive it.  Surely, if the means test does not exist she should get the pension?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The statements made by the Deputy are not correct.  Mrs. McKeown is aged 37 years and her husband, I take it, is approximately the same.  There is no family.  When she applied for the blind pension in 1943 her husband had no income beyond what he was receiving in the form of unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance.  In 1944, when she made a claim for an increase, her husband was in receipt of unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance only; the position in 1943 and 1944 was that her husband had no normal earnings.  Because the income was so low she was allowed the pension.  Now the husband is working.  She is dependent on him. The husband is maintaining the wife out of his wages, out of an income which he had not in 1943 and 1944.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMaguire" hpid="Dr. Maguire Dr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in 1943 the husband earned £26 from the county council, which brought his earnings to £52 and in 1944 he earned approximately the same?</P>

      <P>I am repeating now the information he received.  Mr. McKeown's earnings in 1943, if they may be so described, came from the receipt of unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance and they amounted to £42 11s. 0d.  That was the stated income of Mr. McKeown in 1943.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephPatrickBrennan" hpid="Dr. Brennan Dr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he is aware <Col N="1429" /> that on the 3rd February last, Mr. Rebert Brennan of 40 Eden Villas, Glasthule, was charged before a district justice with breaking a window in the offices of the labour exchange, Dún Laoghaire, that this action of Mr. Brennan's, who is married and the father of five young children, was taken as the only means at his disposal of registering a protest at his failure to find employment and thus provide food for his family; and that the district justice at the trial made certain remarks inferring criticism of the administration which denied the defendant his natural rights, and if he will state whether employment has been offered to and accepted by unmarried men in preference to Mr. Brennan, and if he will indicate whether any remedial steps have been taken in view of the remarks made by the district justice, and if Mr. Brennan may hope for employment in the immediate future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The man to whom the Deputy refers was duly considered for submission for any suitable vacancies notified to Dún Laoghaire Employment Exchange during the time he was registering at that office.  In the past two years he was submitted for employment on seven occasions, on five of which he was engaged, and he is at present working for Dún Laoghaire Corporation following such a submission.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the policy set out in the White Paper (P. No. 7053) issued in 1945 by the Department of Defence, Mr. Brennan is not eligible for submission for subordinate employment in the Government service if suitable applicants who served with the Defence Forces during the emergency are available.</P>

      <P>Mitchelstown.&mdash; Sanction was given to the County Cork Vocational Education Committee in April last for the erection of Mitchelstown Vocational School.  The original sketch plans submitted had to be revised and the revised plans are now being considered.  When they are approved, which it is expected will be very shortly, it will be necessary for <Col N="1431" /> the committee's architect to prepare working drawings, which must be approved by my Department before the committee can be permitted to seek tenders.  As I am not in a position to say when these preliminaries will be completed, I cannot say when the work of building may commence.</P>
      <P>Midleton.&mdash;As I informed the Deputy in reply to a similar question on the 2nd November, 1949, the question of Midleton Vocational School comes up for consideration in connection with the building allocation for 1950/51, which has not yet been determined. In the meantime, however, the revised sketch plans are being considered and when approval for this schools is forthcoming procedure similar to that outlined in the case of Mitchelstown will apply, so I cannot at this stage forecast when the work of building will commence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that a number of farmers in all counties in which the land project is in operation have in recent months made representations to have their holdings inspected mainly because they want to get on with the work during the slack season or to reclaim small areas of land in time for sowing this spring.  The Deputy will appreciate that faced with some 34,000 applications in respect of an area of over 300,000 acres of land, it would be impossible, without the appointment of an unwarrantably large staff, to meet all demands at the same time.  Inspections are being carried out in County Kerry, and will continue to be carried out as expeditiously as the staff available can cope with them.  It is expected that the land rehabilitation project will be in operation for at least ten years, and I cannot recommend the recruitment of staff on a scale sufficient to complete the programme in less than this period of time.</P>

    <P>As to the incident from which the protest arose, I should like to say that political charges have never been considered disorderly.  I have recollections <Col N="1445" /> of political charges being made against all Parties here.  The Chair has control over questions.  Over Minister's replies it has no control, except when a Minister is out of order, when the Chair will so state.  In the excitement to-day most disorderly statements were made on both sides of the House&mdash; most disorderly statements&mdash;for which Deputies should be expelled or named. Perhaps it is better to let them lie now and try to forget them.  We will now proceed with the ordinary business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question of order and what is permissible in the case of replies to questions, I submit that it is desirable that we should have, not now because it is obviously a difficult matter, but at some early stage, some statement from the Chair which would indicate to everybody within what limits a Minister should keep in replying to questions.  The parliamentary position is that question are addressed to Ministers to elicit information with regard to certain administrative matters.  You, Sir, have control over the questions that are submitted.  You can consider if there is any undesirable imputation of any kind, and unhesitantly refuse to allow such questions to be put, if you think there is. I think there should be some limit imposed also upon the type of replies to be given.  I think these replies should be confined to a statement of fact in answer to the questions asked. If Ministers or Deputies wish to make statements, because there are matters <Col N="1446" /> of a political character to which they wish to draw attention, there are opportunities for doing so other than through the medium of answers to questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would only say, in reply to what the Leader of the Opposition has said, that the fundamental task we have to fulfil is to do the nation's business.  In order to secure that that will be done it is essential that there should be order in this House.  The custodian of that order is the Ceann Comhairle and we, on this side of the House, while we are on this side of the House, will do what we have always done no matter on what side of the House we happen to be; we will take the order and obey the Chair.  I submit that the type of reply, and the question as to whether a Minister or anybody else has exceeded his duty in connection with that, is entirely a matter for your ruling.  When you so rule on any occasion we will obey it, as we have always done.</P>
      <P>I would give this warning to the Leader of the Opposition: the making of a general rule is fraught with danger.  The Ceann Comhairle can only act on precedent and on each question asked and answer given as they arise.</P>

      <P>This is not the time to continue a discussion on this particular matter, but I do not agree with the Taoiseach on the question of general rules.  We have Rules of Order here laid down in this book.  These rules have been carefully considered in order that they might be a guide, not merely for the Chair but for every member of the House.  I think a general rule for the guidance of Ministers in regard to replies to questions so that they would not transgress would be extremely desirable.  Since the change of Government I have spent a considerable time here listening to replies to questions and I do not think there is anybody who&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the grounds that he was discussing a matter that had nothing to do with the superannuation amendment scheme of 1948 or the Pensions (Increase) Bill, 1949.  It was an entirely different matter but, in so far as we are dealing in a practical way with this Estimate now, I would reiterate that the money being asked for is being asked for in relation to the Pensions Bill that this House dealt with a comparatively few days ago, increasing the pensions of teachers who were pensioned prior to October, 1946, and increasing the pensions of national teachers who retired so soon after that date that they did not get the benefit of having their pensions based upon three years of the new scales.  That was an amendment providing that they would get the benefit in their pensions of their being paid notionally on the new scale.  That was passed in the House on the 9th March, 1949, and this <Col N="1452" /> Estimate provides the money for paying these teachers the increased pensions. The Estimate is strictly and tightly related to the demands that arise out of these two things.</P>

    <Title>In Committee on Finance. - Transport Bill, 1949&mdash;Fifth Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we should allow this Bill to pass from the House without having a last look at its provisions and at the changes which it proposes to make in the transport situation in this country.  These changes are not of very great significance but they represent the sum total of the proposals which the Government has to make for dealing with that transport situation.  There is a change in the ownership of Córas Iompair Éireann.  The great majority of those who have stock in that concern are having their State guaranteed 3 per cent. debentures transformed into State guaranteed 3 per cent. transport stock.  So far as they are concerned the change is purely verbal.  The rest of the shareholders, the owners of the common stock of Córas Iompair Éireann, are also getting in replacement of that common stock State guaranteed transport stock, and they alone are securing an advantage because whereas in the past they were entitled to receive a dividend upon their stockholding only when the company made a profit sufficient to permit of dividend payments they are now being guaranteed by the taxpayers an annual return of 2½ per cent. on their holding, whether the company makes a profit or a loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the cost of £90,000 per year to the undertaking, underwritten by the taxpayer, we have changed the method of electing directors to the concern. Heretofore these directors, other than the chairman, were elected by the common stockholders.  Now all of them, including the chairman, will be <Col N="1453" /> nominated by the Government.  One must admit the possibility that a better board of directors will be chosen by the Government than was elected by the shareholders but it is difficult to convince oneself that that change in the personnel of the board, following upon the change in the method of selecting the board, will in itself solve any transport problem.</P>
    <P>Other changes in the transport situation which the Bill effects are also of no very great significance in relation to the situation.  Córas Iompair Éireann is being released from all statutory control over the charges it may make for transport services.  It has been released from all statutory control over the adequacy of the services it provides except to this extent, that it may not cease a service of trains over any branch lines upon which services are now run or abandon permanently a branch line on which services are not now run without the consent of a transport tribunal to be established.</P>
    <P>A sum of £7,000,000 may be advanced to the undertaking or raised upon Government guaranteed stock to meet its future estimated capital needs.  I doubt if there is any Deputy in this House who sat in during all the debate on the Bill who believes that it contains a solution of our transport problem.  Despite the changes in the policy of the Government which were announced since the Bill was first circulated, it is difficult to feel convinced that the Government have given serious consideration to the transport problem.  Córas Iompair Éireann's difficulties are, in the main, due to its railway services.  Its road freight services, omnibus services and other supplementary services, such as its hotels, all earn profits, but its railway undertaking produces a substantial loss.  The kernel of its railway problem is that the cost of operating the railway services far exceeds what, in our conditions, these railways are capable of earning in revenue.  If there is to be any solution to the Córas Iompair Éireann problem, other than asking the taxpayers to subsidise it, it must be applied in relation to its railway undertaking.  It must be a solution <Col N="1454" /> which will ensure either that its railway undertaking will be able to increase its revenue or reduce its cost. The prospects of increasing revenue are doubtful.  Everybody who has examined the transport position here has recognised the difficulty of expanding the business available to railway undertakings sufficiently to enable them to operate without loss.</P>
    <P>Various suggestions for forcing traffic back on to the railway have been adopted or recommended from time to time.  The expert, whose report prompted the Government into action, Sir James Milne, also considered that difficulty and made his recommendation for the limitation of private lorry transport, a recommendation which apparently has not been adopted. Despite the optimism with which he, in his report, considered the future, he was not able to hold out the prospect of the Córas Iompair Éireann railway undertaking avoiding losses in the future, even on the various assumptions which he made as to future costs and other factors, assumptions which time has already proven to have been unjustified.  If, therefore, there is to be any solution in the foreseeable future of the problem confronting the new Córas Iompair Éireann Board, it has to be found in re-equipment and reorganisation of the railway undertaking in such a way as to secure a reduction in operating costs and thereby permit of a reduction in freight charges which will attract a larger volume of traffic.  I feel certain, however, that neither Sir James Milne. any officer of Córas Iompair Éireann nor any railway expert, whose mind is brought to bear on the problem, will assert that it is possible to effect the re-equipment and reorganisation necessary in the Córas Iompair Éireann railway undertaking within a limit of £7,000,000 additional capital expenditure. Even for the reconstruction of the permanent way so as to permit of higher speeds being run, without considering at all the reopening of closed branches, we know that half the total capital sum provided by this measure will be required.</P>
    <P>The standardisation of rolling stock, <Col N="1455" /> the modernisation of carriages and wagons, the reconstruction of goods stations and the multitude of other changes which are recognised to be necessary will clearly involve over a period of time&mdash;five, ten or 15 years&mdash;a substantial capital outlay. The Minister, however, indicated in the opening words of his opening speech on this Bill that capital outlay on an adequate scale was the one solution which the Government was not prepared to try.  He informed the House that the former chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann had outlined to him a programme for capital expenditure on the undertaking, mainly on the railways, but also upon other branches of the undertaking, amounting to some £17,500,000, and so enormous did the Minister consider that figure to be that he described it as madly extravagant.</P>
    <P>If there is to be no fundamental reconstruction of our transport system, no getting down to the real cause of losses on railway operation, then we have to recognise that this Bill gives us at best a patched-up system which is bound to lose money, which is bound to involve as an offset of these losses a heavy annual subsidy from the Exchequer.  That the Government have in mind a patched-up system has been evident, I think, during the whole of this discussion.  It was evident in their attitude to the Store Street bus terminus and to other projects for the expansion of the railway organisation and productive capacity which were in train and which they killed.  I do not think that even with the complete re-equipment of the railway and the introduction of improved organisation and methods of working, the railway can entirely earn by itself sufficient to cover operating costs, but I think the gap between revenue and cost can be brought well within the limit of the profit that can be earned on the other branches of the Córas Iompair Éireann system.  If that is not so, if that does not prove to be so, then the solution must be found by permitting Córas Iompair Éireann to undertake other activities, even activities of a non-transport character, which would expand its total capacity to earn profits.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1456" /> I do not know why there should be any hesitation to recognise the substantial capital needs of the Córas Iompair Éireann system in view of the many references which have been made by members of the Government from time to time about the desirability of repatriating external assets, the utilisation for investment here of funds held in this country but invested abroad. There is surely no field for investment as large as the transport organisation, or capable of yielding as substantial a return in the efficiency of national production and the lowering of trade costs, whether internal trade or export trade.</P>
    <P>It was, in my view, no condemnation of the former chairman and board of Córas Iompair Éireann that they had intended to propose this substantial capital outlay.  The decision as to whether that capital outlay was to be facilitated by legislation did not rest with them.  They recognised the need for it and stated the need for it. They stated it to the present Minister and he decided against their recommendation. He has produced here a Bill which apparently involves only the minimum of capital expenditure necessary to keep the undertaking functioning, expenditure which is sub-divided under heads set out in the Milne Report to which the £7,000,000 figure in the Bill must be related.</P>
    <P>If all this talk about the repatriation of external assets is anything more than a weak excuse for the continuance of a deficit on our external trade, then those who are speaking of them should turn their attention to the possibilities offered by Córas Iompair Éireann's needs and Córas Iompair Éireann's opportunities.  We can, through capital investment in Córas Iompair Éireann's not merely increase the efficiency of our transport undertaking, not merely reduce the cost of public transport services to those who use them, not merely avoid a heavy annual drain upon the Exchequer through subsidy to Córas Iompair Éireann, but we can also build up important manufacturing activities which are not practicable in this country because of our limited market and size unless Córas Iompair Éireann is in some way associated with them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1457" /> The Bill, it is true, does give Córas Iompair Éireann the right to engage in manufacturing activities, but the action of the Government in closing down the various projects which were in train for the production here of motor chassis, steel wagons and other equipment required by Córas Iompair Éireann is an indication that the terms of the Bill which give it powers are not intended to be implemented and, if they are to be implemented, then clearly the capital provisions of the Bill are entirely inadequate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill will prevent them, because the capital sum made available to them through the Bill was related to the sum mentioned in the Milne Report and that was appropriated by him in that report to specific purposes.  It is inadequate even to enable those particular purposes to be fully met.  There is no provision for capital expenditure in any other direction.  Even that sum cannot be utilised by the company without the consent of the Minister for Finance and even the Minister for Finance could not increase the sum without fresh legislation.  We have, therefore, to recognise that the matters to which I am referring are not within the discretion of the Córas Iompair Éireann Board.  They are fundamentally matters of Government policy concerning which we may not have a clear statement, but we have a sufficient number of reliable indicators to enable us to reach conclusions.  The House will pass the Bill now and it is in some respects a better Bill than when it was introduced.</P>

      <P>But we cannot send it on its way with any confidence that it represents a solution of our transport problems.  During the progress of the Bill through Committee we had remarkably few divisions of the House. In fact, the few divisions we had related to two matters, one the attitude <Col N="1458" /> of the Government to the branch railway lines and, secondly, the matter of remuneration for the directors of the Córas Iompair Éireann and the Grand Canal undertakings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It was to embarrass the Minister.  In so far as the branch lines are concerned, I am sure I am speaking for the majority of Deputies in saying that the attitude of the Minister is completely unsatisfactory.  It is true that Party loyalties and Party Whips prevented that being expressed in the Division Lobby.  The Minister himself must be aware that, in relation to the branch lines, the attitude expressed by him has not been endorsed by any of the Deputies who participated in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did a bit of heel tapping on that in the <i>Irish Press</i> this morning.  That is an advantage that he has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as these branch lines are concerned, I have never changed my attitude.  I have always recognised that, with the development of road transport services, it would inevitably happen that some of these branch lines would be of questionable utility, that those who designed the Irish railway system were more concerned often with military necessity than economic development, in locating a number of our railway stations in relation to the areas and towns which they were intended to serve, and that, as soon as a proper road transport service developed, the public would cease to use some of these branch lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1459" /> I have argued in the past that, when the finance of branch line operation was referred to, we should consider our railway system as a whole, that we should try to devise a policy and method of operation which would make the railway system as a whole pay its way, and that we should not necessarily require each individual section or branch to pay its way.  If an economic need was served by some branch line it should not be closed merely because it was making a loss.  If, however, the railway system as a whole is not paying its way, if the railway system as a whole is making a heavy annual loss and is likely to continue doing so, then the position of these uneconomic branch lines must necessarily arise for reconsideration.</P>
    <P>I have argued, however, that it is unfair to the localities served by the branch lines which were closed during the war that they should remain closed under the authority of an Emergency Powers Order.  Before the war, when any railway company proposed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to discontinue a service on a railway branch line, it was open to every interest in the area served by that branch line to argue against the proposal and to advance considerations or suggestions which might lead to the withdrawal of the proposal.  It is not unknown in the history of Irish railways that branch lines which railway managements intended to close were kept open or were reopened because of assurances given by traders in the affected area, or because of additional information brought to notice of possible developments in these areas which might increase the volume of traffic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>That did not apply in the case of the Birr-Roscrea branch line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It did apply.  The traders of the area had a meeting with the company's representatives and as a result the company changed their mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>But they closed the railway line first with your consent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am trying to make is that it is possible that policy <Col N="1460" /> may change as a result of representations from an area, but what happened in relation to these branch lines that are now closed under an Emergency Powers Order is that they were closed because there was no coal, or other supply difficulties.  There was no consideration of the economic needs of the areas served by them and no opportunity was given to the persons affected by the closing to argue against that course.  The only thing they had was an assurance that the lines would reopen when the emergency passed, and that if there was to be any subsequent question of closing them down again the normal procedure would be followed and an opportunity would be available to the interests concerned to make their case against that course, and that the decision would depend on the strength of their case as against the railway company's case.</P>
      <P>But these branch lines are still closed, and they are going to remain closed.  There is nothing in the Bill which ensures that a service of trains over them will be resumed now or at any time.</P>

That is the situation which has changed.  Deputy Davin has side-tracked me successfully.  I repeat that this Bill, in so far as it relates to branch lines, leaves the unsatisfactory situation which existed for the past two years to continue indefinitely in the future.  It is unsatisfactory that these branch lines, closed during the emergency, have not been reopened before this.  It is much more unsatisfactory that there is now no prospect that they will ever reopen.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is obviously mixing up the steps that had to be taken during the war and the steps that were taken under the authority of permanent transport legislation.  I closed the branch lines in 1944 because there was insufficient coal to run even the main line services.  Deputies know that, over a period of that year, there was one train per week on the main lines in the country and no prospect whatever of trains on the branch lines, but I gave them an undertaking that they would reopen as soon as there was sufficient coal to operate the services over them, and they were reopened in 1946 when the coal supply situation improved, with the exception of, I think, two or three from which railway tracks had to be removed in order to patch up the main lines during the war period.  They remained open over 1946. They lost £300,000 in 1946.  Then, <Col N="1463" /> when the coal crisis developed in 1947, they were closed again.  They should have reopened in March, 1948, because in March, 1948, there were ample coal supplies for all purposes.</P>

      <P>In October, 1947, I crossed to London.  I saw the British Minister of Fuel and Power, then Mr. Emmanuel Shinwell, and asked him for an assurance that we would get 20,000 tons of coal per week for the winter period.  That was our estimate of the minimum quantity we required to keep our essential industries, our gas, our electricity and railway works in coal, and no one else.  He told me that he could give no such assurance.  We tried to make a trade bargain to secure even small additional supplies of coal and they said they could not undertake it, that there was no possibility of coal supplies to this country being improved in quantity or quality before 1st April, 1948.  That appears in the departmental records.  In January of 1948, quite unexpectedly, without any previous intimation from the British Ministry of Fuel and Power, without any reason to anticipate it, increased coal supplies arrived.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if Deputies are disturbed by the prospect that these observations of mine may be reported somewhere.  On the other matter on which we had a division, the compensation for the directors of Córas Iompair Éireann and the Grand Canal Company, I confess that I am somewhat disturbed in my mind.  I think that; to some extent, we allowed a bad precedent to be established by reason of certain features of that proposal.  I think that the principle that where an office of profit is abolished by an Act of the Legislature, compensation of some kind should be payable is a sound one. I think that departure from that principle might be quoted on some future occasion in support of a course of action which would be found unjust. We know that the stockholders' directors of Córas Iompair Éireann are not poor people, that they are not depending on the fees they get from that undertaking or from any compensation that may be payable to them. We know that the compensation which the Minister proposed to give them appeared rather generous.  We know that the Minister made no attempt to justify that compensation and that in consequence the proposal was rejected by the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but its absence from the Bill is, I think, a topic to which reference might be made.  I have no desire to press the Minister on any course of action.  I feel that there may have been in relation to the Grand Canal Company some discussions or negotiations as to the terms <Col N="1466" /> of acquisition, which included the question of compensation for directors. The Minister knows that.  I do not.  If there was given by him in his official capacity as a Minister of State any undertaking, expressed or implied, as to the course of action he intended to follow in relation to these individuals, I think that he should be very slow to allow purely political considerations to divert him from his purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no change of policy, but there was substantial comment by every Deputy upon two obvious facts.  One was the Minister's reluctance to make any case for his proposal and the other was the hope of Government Deputies, as was very clearly expressed in Deputy Larkin's speech, to have the section passed by our votes without any political consequences to themselves. Deputy Larkin spoke for half an hour, pleading with Government Deputies to vote against the section and pleading with Opposition Deputies to vote for it.  The section <Col N="1467" /> was the proposal of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I have nothing further to say about it.</P>
      <P>As I said already, I do not care what the Minister does but I am concerned that the sound principle upon which previous legislation of this character was based should be preserved and, even if we depart from it on this occasion, we should declare that to be due to the special circumstances of this occasion and not in any sense a precedent.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister well with his Bill.  I hope that he succeeds in getting for Córas Iompair Éireann a board of directors who can work it.  I hope that as a result of their work the heavy losses which the undertaking has incurred in the last two years will be avoided in future and that the amount of subsidy which the taxpayer will be required to contribute to meet such losses will diminish to vanishing point in a very short period of time.  I hope it will, but I do not believe it will.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleagues and I are gratified to find the Bill advanced to this particular stage.  Deputy Lemass says it is a better Bill now than when first introduced.  We certainly agree with that.  That is largely due to the constructive suggestions put forward by both sides during the prolonged debates on this matter and to the reasonable attitude adopted by the Minister when an overwhelming case was made in favour of a change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of us on these benches feel we have a special responsibility towards the staffs of the new national undertaking. In so far as it is humanly possible to envisage contingencies likely to arise as a result of the change over, I am bound to state that all reasonable precautions have been taken in this Bill to cover conditions of employment so <Col N="1468" /> far as the men are concerned in the new undertaking.</P>
    <P>May I refer to something in this Bill which has never before appeared in legislation here or anywhere else?  It has not even appeared in legislation on the other side where there is nationalised transport.  I refer to the fact that recognition has been given for the first time to a group of men described as temporary employees. The group is rather extensive in number. The men have three years' service. They are now covered by ample compensation within the terms of this provision.  I pay tribute to the Minister for that.  He did try to make the period four years, but he eventually conceded what we felt was the correct period of three years.  That concession will be widely appreciated throughout the new service.</P>
    <P>There is another feature of the Bill to which it is worth while adverting.  A most important change has taken place in the Bill since its introduction.  In its initial stages it contained provisions to allow the board a certain measure of freedom in so far as the striking of their own rates of merchandise was concerned.  To those of us who are associated with the transport industry that almost amounted to the liberation of the slaves.  Since 1924 it has been impossible for any transport undertaking to succeed on its merits, having regard to unregulated and uncontrolled transport throughout the country and because of the fact that a statutory undertaking like Córas Iompair Éireann had the obligation imposed upon it of going before a tribunal in connection with certain rates and certain traffics.  These traffics were bound to be lost to that institution because of the delays inevitable so far as the tribunal was concerned. The new Bill sweeps that aside.  That is one real germ for hope that the new Bill gives.  As a result of discussions in Committee, the Minister felt coerced, as he said himself, by the feelings of the House to alter that and depart from it to the extent of setting up the tribunal again.  I am glad common sense has prevailed.  In the early debates mistakes may have been made, but I am glad that Deputies have not <Col N="1469" /> been slow in setting them right.  The Minister was good enough to respond readily when the right course was indicated and he promptly restored the original position.  That is perhaps the most vital change that has been made in the Bill.  That gives the new undertaking a breathing space for a period of 12 months during which it will not be frustrated or hampered by the operations of the tribunal in so far as rates of merchandise are concerned. This gives a breathing space during which the undertaking can deal with the flood of competitive traffic which will surround it and which will be calculated in its effect to undermine the structure financially.  It gives that breathing space, but only for that period of 12 months.</P>
    <P>The main and vital defect in this Bill &mdash;we pointed it out in the earlier stages and the Minister recognises it&mdash;is the fact that one cannot have a sound national transport system until the whole question of traffic is properly regulated and controlled and until the same obligations are imposed on all persons engaged in transport as distinct from the obligations imposed on certain units.  Because of what I have said, this Bill is bound, in its effect, to cause losses over that period of 12 months. Those losses are inevitable.  They will only diminish and can only be curtailed in so far as the House and the taxpayer are concerned when the further measure promised by the Minister is introduced.  One of the gravest tasks confronting the new board will be to ensure that no time will be lost after its establishment in making a complete and comprehensive survey of the entire problem in relation to recommendations to the Minister for the preparation of the necessary supplementary legislation.</P>
    <P>There is also another valuable change in this Bill, thanks again to the foresight of the Deputies who suggested it. Despite the original intention, the fact now remains that the new board will be associated with the voice of this House.  I think that is a victory for this House and for the members who insisted that, since this was a national transport concern, there should be certain responsibility in this House for <Col N="1470" /> its control&mdash;that members should at least have, however limited, some opportunity of having a voice in its administration.  That has been conceded. I think it is a valuable concession. The one omission I would regard as, perhaps, unfortunate, but nevertheless understandable in the circumstances, is the fact that the Minister was not in a position to announce what was to be the future of the Great Northern Railway or the cross-Border railway.  I can only express the hope of a private member of this House, that whatever negotiations or talks may be going on in that respect are moving in the direction of a final and useful settlement and that it will be possible for the Minister at an early stage to indicate to this House the position.</P>
    <P>I desire to refer to an aspect of this Bill in which I am interested and in regard to which I was precluded from doing so on the Committee Stage.  I was unable to pierce the armour of the Ceann Comhairle on the Committee Stage to refer at length to it.  However, it is in the Bill.  This is the only opportunity I shall have as we are on the final stages and the matter has been referred to by Deputy Lemass&mdash; the question of the composition of the board.  On the Committee Stage and because it was not intended that there should be a discussion on it on that stage, there were certain loose discussions on the question of what the board should be like.  Some of us expressed the idea that because of past experiences there should be what is described as a whole-time board to operate this concern.  Since then I have examined the position, as I felt I was bound to do so.  This is the only opportunity we shall have of referring to it.  The Minister will soon be engaged on the task of selecting his board.  He may be guided by the views of this House as to how that will be done.  That is his responsibility.  I hope he does the right thing.  I am satisfied from what I know now of the position inside Córas Iompair Éireann that, in so far as there is a chairman who will be a permanent chairman in session throughout the whole week and the 52 weeks of the year, the new concern is assured of continuity of policy.  I want to suggest to <Col N="1471" /> the Minister that in his warrant there might be an indication that he would be the responsible officer, in addition, between meetings of the board.  I think that is important and I do not think it operated in the case of the company heretofore.  The individual in the position at the moment has given evidence that he is ideally equipped and suited for that particular position.</P>
    <P>It will interest the House that for some time past the machinery in operation by the board is as follows.  It will allay any fears that may operate in the minds of certain individuals that it will be a one-man show.  The chairman calls together a staff conference, consisting of his chief officials, at regular intervals, I understand once a fortnight.  It is open to each of these officials to initiate and develop major policy in so far as their respective departments are concerned.  They are entitled to table previous notice of developments of that character, to have them sifted and examined and, at the staff conference, to have the voice of the staff conference as a whole. They will be either accepted, amended or rejected as the case may be, but in whatever form they appear at that conference they move to the board proper, and the board proper having the views of the officials before them, now decide policy.  There is, therefore, the guarantee that in a matter of policy there is initiation and development from the points where they should operate, namely, from the officials of the company right up to the chairman of the board and on to the board itself&mdash;and, bear in mind, that in this case the chairman of the board is there in his capacity of one ordinary member with no special qualifications other than that he may have a casting vote. There is that security, therefore, in the new undertaking.</P>
    <P>On the question as to whether there should be a board of part-time directors or whole-time directors, in the light of the machinery and procedure to which I have adverted, I would say that the ideal system would be a part-time board with a whole-time <Col N="1472" /> chairman.  When I say a part-time board everybody knows that in a business of this character there will be committees and sub-committees.  Inevitably members of the board will, in fact, be whole-time, whether they like it or not.  It remains for the Minister to select his board.</P>
    <P>I suggest that in so far as the main services will be to the agricultural community there should be on that board for preference a young farmer who has given indication of business ability. There are hundreds of them in the country.  I would place him as one member of the board.  Alongside him I would place a young business man, because this new institution will have tremendously wide powers so far as finance is concerned, who would have a flair, say, for finance.  My fourth representative&mdash;do not forget that I put the chairman as number one&mdash; would be an official of the existing company, an officer of that company, preferably from the traffic side.  Those who are experienced in railway work will readily understand why I say that the officer should come from the traffic side.  He is in a position to assess in broader lines than perhaps any other officer the position of the company as a whole from one time to another.  I suggest, with all respect, that there is such an individual available.  Again, as on the Committee Stage, and so that there will be no misunderstanding about the position, let me say that I am speaking in a disinterested manner. It will be neither Deputy Davin nor myself.</P>

      <P>There must be Deputies in this House who, on the Second Stage and the Committee Stage of the Bill, when they saw the number of amendments down and realised the lengthy road we had to travel, felt that we would not reach the Final Stage of the Bill as early as we have succeeded in doing.  I think on the Second Stage I indicated the view of some of us that it is not from our point of view an ideal Bill.  It is not a Bill in the form in which we would like to see it.  It does not represent a perfect solution, but we feel that the Bill must be supported because it is an improvement on the existing position and provides better machinery for the operation of transport services in this country than exists at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcome the principle enshrined in the Bill, that the transport undertakings are now coming under public ownership and control.  What a Deputy can say at this stage of the Bill can serve no very great purpose except in so far as he can hope to influence the Minister's mind, to the extent that the Minister will be concerned with the administration of the provisions embodied in this piece of legislation, but may I be permitted to say that the Minister would be very unwise if he considers that this Bill represents the last word that has to be said in transport legislation, or that it provides a final solution for all our transport problems.  I think it would be well for the Minister, even at this early stage, to condition his mind to <Col N="1474" /> the fact that in all probability he will have to come back to the House with an amending measure or, at least, with some new piece of transport legislation to deal with some of the problems left untouched by the present Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Martin O'Sullivan adverted to the fact that this is a better Bill now than when it first came before the House.  I think that there is general agreement on that point.  While it is true that the Minister got assistance from both sides of the House, I think that it is a pity that he did not get more assistance, because there were times, particularly on the Committee Stage, when the Minister did not receive all the help and assistance he is entitled to expect from the House.  It is a pity that, on practically every stage of the Bill, the deputy Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Lemass, utilised the debate for the purpose of justifying his own transport policy during the period he was Minister. That did not help the House and did not make for useful debate.  It did not assist us in rounding off this Bill in the best manner possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass referred to the fact that there had been divisions on only two major questions in the course of the passage of the Bill.  He then went on to make his <i>apologia pro vita mea</i> for his policy on the branch lines.  I do not know how Deputy Lemass could come to this House and attempt to pose as a protagonist of the railway transport system because, even in the course of his rather brief remarks to-day, he let slip inadvertently a phrase which really represents his mind when he referred to the question of the inutility of the branch lines. Deputy Lemass's attitude, when he spoke this evening, was one which I do not think any reasonable individual could expect this House to accept. Can he expect the House to accept that it became a crime for the present Administration not to reopen branch lines in March, 1948, whereas it was good policy to keep them closed in January, 1948?</P>

The case Deputy Lemass made here this evening was made purely in an effort to score a minor debating point at the expense of the Minister or at the expense of some of us at this side of the House who generally believe in the necessity of maintaining a branch line system.</P>

      <P>I find myself in the position in which I have often been in <Col N="1476" /> this House before, and that is to balance one little evil against a greater evil.  I would consider it infinitely more detrimental to the interests of the development of a better transport system and the interests of this country as a whole to give the Party opposite another opportunity of occupying those seats than let the Minister have his way for the time being in his attitude as indicated last night.  Let Deputies opposite make no mistake about that. There are many points on which we differ fundamentally from the Deputies who sit in the benches opposite and we recognise that there is one evil to be avoided and that is that until such time as those Deputies have learned their lesson, there can be no question of ever letting them back to these benches.</P>
      <P>I will pass from that.  The Minister's attitude throughout the course of this measure was most co-operative.  I should like to pay a tribute to him for the manner in which he met the representations made to him by Deputies on this side.  Deputies O'Sullivan, Hickey and myself expressed rather vehemently a certain point of view to the Minister with respect to the rights of Deputies to have information made available in so far as major matters of transport administration and policy are concerned.  I sympathise with the Minister's attitude in not wanting to give Deputies that right.  I could quite sympathise with him in his desire to withdraw from the prospect of the day-to-day workings and details of administration of Córas Iompair Éireann being made the subject matter of question and answer in an adjournment debate. I could sympathise with his desire not to open the door even a little bit for fear that having once opened it he might not be able to keep out the flood. I know his apprehensions on that score were very real.</P>
      <P>I would like to pay a sincere tribute to the Minister who, I would say, very much against his will but in deference to an attitude of mind that he knew was shared by many Deputies, agreed to the insertion of Section 15.  I think the Minister is entitled to that tribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1477" /> Deputy Lemass referred to the uneconomic sections of a transport system being possible of maintenance while the transport system as a whole was making money, but that when it was making a loss it became necessary to close such uneconomic sections.  I think that remark displays the fundamental difference of approach on the part of Deputy Lemass on the one hand and many Deputies on this side of the House on the other.  I make no apology for holding the view that the provision of a proper transport system, whether it can be done at a loss or at a profit from a purely commercial standpoint, is a national necessity, and it is in that light it must be regarded. I hold, and I think from what Deputy Lemass said he would not dissent violently from this point of view, that it should be considered not by itself as one would consider an ordinary money-making concern, but that it should be considered as an integral portion of the whole national economy.</P>
    <P>This may sound repetitious, but I would like to warn the Minister that if he thinks that this Bill provides the last word on our transport problems he will find he is making a mistake.  To my mind it is inevitable that he will have to come back to the House at some period, be it long or short, and ask for amending legislation, if not additional legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to endorse the statement made by Deputy Martin O'Sullivan, especially with reference to the formation of the board.  Having endorsed his remarks, I will leave it at that.</P>
      <P>I now want to make an appeal to the Minister on behalf of some clerks about whom I had an amendment down that I was compelled to withdraw. I hope that when the board will be formed, should any superior officer recommend any of these clerks for promotion, no legal clause in the Bill will prevent them getting the promotion they richly deserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must pay a compliment to the Minister for the co-operative way in which he has acted throughout the passage of the Bill in the Dáil and, <Col N="1478" /> like other Deputies, I wish him every success in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to say that while the Bill was going through the House the Minister endeavoured to meet the view-points put forward from all sides of the House.  As I said on earlier stages, I fear the Bill, having now gone through its main stages, will not put the transport of the country on a satisfactory basis.  To some extent this Bill is only touching on the problems that confront us.  Until the unlawful and illicit competition with which Córas Iompair Éireann has to deal is dealt with, I see no hope of this Bill bringing any satisfactory results or making the transport situation much better than it is.</P>
      <P>Quite a good lot of discussion has taken place in regard to railway traffic and road traffic.  The Minister must realise that all the equipment&mdash;for instance, the carriages on the railway &mdash;is, most of it, antiquated.  The carriages are uncomfortable and unsuitable in modern conditions.  So far as passengers are concerned, if the railways are going to be put in a position to increase their traffic they must be provided with up-to-date facilities.</P>
      <P>Those up-to-date facilities will involve a capital expenditure of much more than the £7,000,000 that is permitted under the Bill.  That is one of the fundamental defects that I can see in the Bill, that it does not face up to the capital expenditure that must be met if the rail section is to be in a position to attract passenger traffic. Not only have the railways to meet the competition of the bus section that has been mentioned, but they have the competition of the private motor car. If people find it more comfortable to travel to Galway or Cork in a private motor car than to travel by train, then they are going to travel by private motor car.  I feel that the Bill is unsatisfactory in not making provision for adequate capital expenditure to modernise the railways and rail equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally, I think the Bill is unsatisfactory in so far as it has made no <Col N="1479" /> provision for the completion of the bus depot in Store Street.  That matter was dealt with by amendment in Committee. The section which it was sought to put into the Bill to have the Store Street station completed was not inserted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Minister will have to face that issue in the Seanad as soon as we are finished with the Bill, and elsewhere. Some remarks were made here in regard to Section 15 in the Bill which obliges the Minister to give information to the House on certain matters. The line has been taken that the Minister's objection to that section could be understood, and that its insertion raises the possibility of all the day-to-day administrative details of the company being open in this House to question and to debates on the adjournment.  May I say that I do not accept that position at all? Under the Defence Forces legislation everything that happens in the Army is done by order of the Minister for Defence.  Therefore, everything that occurs in the Army could be raised in the Dáil and in debates on the adjournment, but it is not done.  The same thing applies in the case of the Post Office and, to a large extent, to the Garda under the Department of Justice; but it is not done because Deputies have a sense of responsibility. Why then should the point be made that if the Minister is obliged to give information it would involve the possibility of answering innumerable questions on day-to-day administration and of debates on the adjournment?  I think that is not the approach that should be made to the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of a concern like Córas Iompair Éireann to which we have recently given £4,000,000, and to which we will be giving for some years at <Col N="1480" /> least a sum of probably £1,000,000 a year in round figures&mdash;it is described in the Bill as a national transport undertaking&mdash;it is only right that this House should have substantial control over it.  I think the House was right to insist on having that control and that there ought to be no apologies made by anybody for insisting on having Section 15 written into the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am not going to follow the suggestion made by Deputy O'Sullivan in regard to what type of board the Minister will establish.  I take it that what we require the Minister to set up is a board that will run this concern efficiently and in the national interest, as is laid down in the Bill.  If the Minister were to limit himself and say: &ldquo;I am going to get a young farmer; I am going to get a young business man; I am going to get an ex-official of the company, and I am going to get someone to represent Labour&rdquo;, he might, and he might not, be getting the most efficient board. The responsibility is on the Minister to get an efficient board.  Every Deputy knows that that is a serious responsibility, and that in the selection of that board the Minister is going to have a good number of headaches. Every Deputy knows that, if the Minister makes an unwise choice, he will be subjected to severe criticism here, and that if he selects persons who are incompetent or inefficient, he will have to carry the burden of answering for that incompetency and inefficiency not only in this House but, perhaps, on the hustings through the country.  That is a very serious responsibility.  I think that, having placed it on the Minister, while we may, as Deputy O'Sullivan has done, make suggestions, we should not in any way endeavour to curb or to limit the Minister in the exercise of that responsibility.  The Bill has done very good work in so far as it has afforded protection to the employees of Córas Iompair Éireann.  I think the Minister's response to the case put up to him was most satisfactory and no employee of Córas Iompair Éireann can say that, while this Bill was going through the House, their interests were neglected by anybody, and certainly that their interests were neglected by the Minister.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1481" /> Like other Deputies, I sincerely hope that this Bill in its operation will be more successful than I have reason to think it will.  I hope it will be satisfactory and that the board the Minister will appoint will make a success of it.  But the Minister must realise, as the board will soon realise, that the powers the board have obtained in this Bill, the powers the Minister himself has taken, are insufficient to enable the Bill to be entirely satisfactory. This Bill was intended to deal with a very serious problem.  A transport undertaking is a national undertaking. It is an undertaking to provide for the conveyance of people and the carriage of goods from one part of the country to another at the cheapest rates and in the quickest time.  At the moment, that is not happening in certain areas. I think, Sir, you would hardly permit me to make any reference to the bus stoppage.</P>

      <P>I should like to support Deputy Lemass, Deputy Cowan and Deputy Lehane in their remarks about the adequacy of the capital provided. I have one project in mind which I think might have been envisaged by the Minister, because it is a matter of which the railway administration have had practical experience.  I refer to the singling of the main line between Clonsilla and Galway.  It seems to me that that is a project that might have been provided for in the provision of capital, I believe the railway authorities satisfied themselves after a number of years that the singling of that railway line was in fact a mistake.  It retarded traffic and it did not cut down overheads to a proportionate extent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall pass from it, but I think it is the type of project which the Minister might have handed over for attention to the new railway authority.  I think that the statement made by Deputy Lehane that Deputy Lemass's insistence on justifying his own transport policy prevented this Bill from being as good a measure as it might otherwise have been is a very unsubstantial argument.  We all know that with the development of the internal combustion engine and the use of tar on the roads railway problems were created.  I think that when the first amalgamation of the railways took place and the Great Southern Railway Company was established it was because of the problems which were then appearing for the reasons I have stated. That was not successful and we got Córas Iompair Éireann No. 1.  I take it that it is because of the experience in operating Córas Iompair Éireann No. 1 we are now getting Córas Iompair Éireann No. 2.  We all have as high hopes for the success of Córas Iompair <Col N="1483" /> Éireann No. 2 as we had for the success of Córas Iompair Éireann No. 1. The Minister, when he was not able to accept the suggestions of Deputy Cowan and some others that there should be still further restrictions on the private carrying of goods, had to introduce the principle into this Bill of fairly and squarely facing up to the loss made by the railways and coming to their aid annually, as we do in connection with other.  Departments of State.  There are two views on that. In the present circumstances I think the Minister has chosen the least troublesome solution.  We all know that the question of still further monopolising the carrying of goods, particularly private goods, is one which would not be as easily accepted as this. As we are going in for a bigger dose of nationalisation, the thing to do is to let the public purse stand in, as has been done for the hospitals by the hospitals' sweepstakes money.</P>
      <P>I would like on behalf of that very important part of our national territory to say that national policy in any event will not be prevented from being voiced in this House in relation to transport, even under this Bill.  The West of Ireland has not got the largest or the wealthiest population and for that reason it has transport problems that do not exist in other parts of the country.  We have now a further degree of nationalisation even though it is going to be perhaps more bureaucratically exercised by excluding more important matters.  I make a plea to the Minister for that part of our national territory in the West of Ireland.  I appeal to him to ensure that in formulating a transport Bill more attention is given to that area than has been given to it in the past, when it was seen fit to close down the main line to the West.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise one small point so that the Minister may consider it between this and the time the Bill comes before the Seanad. The Minister was good enough to include a particular section in this measure.  I refer to Section 56.  I hope that section will enable Kildare County Council to do some work that is badly needed on a canal bridge <Col N="1484" /> going out by Naas over which those travelling to the South must pass.  For many years the Kildare County Council has been abused because of the condition of that bridge.  The fault was not really ours.  For a long time we had been urging the appropriate Departments to enable the canal company, in conjunction with the county council, to carry out the necessary work.  In Section 56 the Minister has included a provision by virtue of which, where a canal has not been used for public navigation for three years, an application can be made to the tribunal for the closing of the canal for navigational purposes, while, at the same time, keeping it open for water-supply purposes. For years the Grand Canal Company has been quite prepared to agree that that part of the canal which runs out more or less towards the Curragh and Athgarvan should be closed.  Under Section 45 of the Canal Traffic Act, 1888, they were not empowered to close it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has been good enough to include this section at the request of the Kildare County Council, conveyed to him by me.  Unfortunately the words &ldquo;public navigation&rdquo; are not quite clear in their meaning.  No barge or boat for the transportation of goods as such, whether belonging to the canal company or to any by-trader, has passed over that canal for about 15 years as far as I can ascertain. But a boat has regularly passed down that canal purely for cleansing purposes and I understand it is a matter of some doubt as to whether, once the canal company dredging boat has gone down, that fulfils the provisions of the section or whether it does not.  Presumably, it is a matter for the parliamentary draftsman.  I am quite sure the Minister knows what is intended, but I would ask him between now and the time the Bill is considered in Committee in the Seanad to make quite certain that the term &ldquo;public navigation&rdquo; will not include a mere dredger going through for cleansing purposes.  If it were to include that, then the section as it stands would not achieve the very proper purpose the Minister has in mind of enabling the road authority to take away that extremely dangerous bridge and <Col N="1485" /> thereby provide better facilities on one of the main arterial highways in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my appreciation to the House for the manner in which this Bill has been debated here during all its stages and, with some reservations, I extend that appreciation even to Deputy Lemass. I would like to say, again with one or two reservations, that I agree that the Bill is now emerging from the Dáil a better Bill than when it was introduced. For that I am indebted to many members, including Deputy Lemass.  It might be an even better Bill if I had got a little more assistance and if it had been approached solely from the point of view of a transport concern.</P>
      <P>I rather regret the line that Deputy Lemass took to-day.  Again, he was back on the hustings.  Again, he was making a further vain attempt to whitewash himself.  I can assure the Deputy that it was a very vain attempt and no matter how often&mdash;perhaps I should say the more often&mdash;he makes the effort the less effective it will be. The Deputy to-day belittled the Bill. He said it contained nothing beyond a change in the method of election to the board of directors and a guarantee to the stockholders.  How the Deputy could talk so much about what was supposed to contain so little amazes me. He said the Bill provided only for the stockholders and for a new method of electing the directors; he said that was the sum total of the Government's contribution to the solution of the transport problem.  Nobody but Deputy Lemass believes that.  Not even Deputy Lemass believes it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Con Lehane warned me that I should not make the mistake of thinking this was the last step in transport and that he was not prepared to accept this as the ideal solution of the problem.  Deputy Cowan travelled along the same line.  There is no need to warn me about that.  I never pretended at any time that this Bill would provide an ideal solution for our problems. In that I differ from Deputy Lemass in his approach to transport legislation in this House because Deputy Lemass every time he came to <Col N="1486" /> the House with a transport measure always said it was the ideal solution and the solution that would enable us to put behind us all our transport problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  I never, during any stage of the progress of this Bill, claimed that it was much more than a machinery Bill.  Deputies ought to realise that we are talking about and dealing with an organisation or concern that is up to the present moment the property of private individuals.  I did not understand Deputy Lemass's references to the stockholders' being guaranteed 2½ per cent. and repayment at the end of the appropriate period whereas, heretofore, they were only entitled to dividends when profits were made.  The money they are going to be paid and the interest which they will be paid pending 1985 is the sum which was assessed as being the fair compensation that was due to them for the property we are now proposing to take over.  The Deputy did not challenge that it should not be paid.  He would not suggest that we should give them less than the fair value.  He would not suggest that we should confiscate them.  He would not suggest that we should not pay interest on the money. Therefore, as I say, I did not understand the reference.  We are told that we have given no serious consideration to this problem.  This Government was the first Government that faced up to this problem in a real way and in an intelligent way.</P>

    <P>The Deputy made a lot of play about the £7,000,000 in the Bill and my rejection of the £17,500,000 project which the previous chairman and board of directors had submitted.  Will Deputy Lemass tell me by whom that programme was assembled?  Who were the experts who advised as to the £6,000,000 worth of railway replacements? Who were the experts who, under that £17,500,000 project, decided in favour of diesels as against other locomotives?  Will the Deputy tell me who was the expert who purchased the diesels and who actually went across to make the purchases?  What confidence, what faith could I or anybody <Col N="1487" /> in my position have in a programme of purchases likely to run into the region of £20,000,000 submitted to me by a board&mdash;including the chairman&mdash; particularly on the railway side, who had no chief mechanical engineer; who, so far as I know, did not seek the advice outside of any expert and in so far as expert advice was available within their own organisation, it was not consulted.</P>
    <P>I was not frightened by the £17,500,000 expenditure or the £20,000,000 expenditure.  But even in these days it is an enormous sum of money for this country.  Personally, I should have to be very well satisfied and I should have to get very clear documentary proof as to the soundness of that investment of £17,500,000 before I would come to this House and ask for it.</P>
    <P>There is one matter with which I must deal.  Right through this Bill and from the first day of the first debate we had on it&mdash;down to and including his final speech to-day, in which he repeated it no fewer than six times&mdash;Deputy Lemass has thought fit, as he was perfectly entitled to, to stress and to restress and to repeat over and over again the fact that the losses of this company would have to be made good by the taxpayer, that subsidy would have to be provided.  I have challenged the Deputy on more than one occasion to tell me or to tell the House how the losses are to be met otherwise than through the taxpayer paying for them.  The Deputy has never attempted to do that.  Why should the Deputy be so indignant at the idea of a subsidy for this company? Is this the first State company that was ever subsidised?  The Deputy knows that it is not.  The Deputy knows that there is another transport concern, another transport project, that has been subsidised very substantially.</P>

      <P>The air services, and the Deputy knows the extent to which those have been subsidised.  He knows that we are, up to the present moment, heavily subsidising not an Irish transport service such as Córas Iompair <Col N="1488" /> Éireann but foreign transport services which are using out airport at Shannon.  The Deputy knows that that subsidy is costing the taxpayers of this country close on £1,000 per day in addition to the other millions of pounds that were put into its construction.</P>

      <P>We have 22,000 employed in Córas Iompair Éireann and the service is for their own Irish community.  Now I come to Store Street.  All I have to say about Store Street is that Store Street and particularly its five storeys of offices is not required by Córas Iompair Éireann. That is the first point.  The second point is that they have not the money to pay for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the problem of the Department of Social Welfare. That is like the Deputy's suggestion that all this is to pay for the losses incurred in the last two years.  The Deputy knows that that is not so yet he goes on repeating it.  I know the reason.  It is because it will be published in one newspaper.  It is because the people who will read that will not read anything else and they will accept that as gospel.  It is because no contradiction of that statement will be published.  Deputy Lemass has a peculiar outlook on all this business.  He has no faith whatever in the future of railways.  He cannot see a railway system under any circumstances paying its way in this country.  No matter what the reorganisation, no matter how modernised the methods, no matter to what extent the obsolete rolling stock is replaced&mdash;even under those conditions&mdash;he has no faith whatever in its paying.  That being the Deputy's opinion, I am not one bit surprised that he allowed the railway side of Córas Iompair Éireann to get into the extraordinary position <Col N="1489" /> in which it was when we had to take it over.</P>

      <P>I am not saying anything about that.  Perhaps if the Deputy had used it on the branch lines, I would not have the headache I have had ever since in trying to dispose of it.  The Deputy succeeded far better than he knew when he went to London.  He had, apparently, one of those bombs that during the war were called delayed action bombs.  The Deputy went over there in October and put up quite a good fight but they told him that they could not give him even 20,000 tons but, lo and behold! in the <Col N="1491" /> following January, they were able to give him coal at the rate of 1,600,000 tons a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>If all the members of the House were as relevant as the Minister, I would have the Bill, not merely through the Dáil by now but through the Seanad as well.  Deputies will have to reconcile themselves to the fact that while the Minister has to sit down and listen to all sorts of speeches, and offer himself as a cock-shot, the Minister, strange as it may seem, still has the right to report occasionally and hit back.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I do want to say again sincerely that I appreciate the manner in which this measure was debated in the House.  I believe, notwithstanding some of the things that have been said, that Deputies on all sides are anxious, if for no other reason than that it is a national matter, that it should be a success.  I want to make it perfectly clear that I am not holding this out as an ideal solution for all our transport problems but we are going to acquire this property, and we are going to appoint, first of all, a national board to operate this concern on behalf of the Irish people.  In so far as it is humanly possible, it will be my function and the function of the Government to select the best board we can get.  I know quite well that is not going to be an easy matter.  I know quite well in advance that no matter what board ultimately emerges, it will be open to criticism. It will be criticised and the Minister will be criticised but that does not worry me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are going to see that as far as possible the board will have at its service, both on the railway side and the road side, the most expert technical <Col N="1492" /> assistance that it is possible for us or the board to secure.  That board, with its advisers, will be charged with the responsibility of operating this national transport system.  It will be charged with the responsibility of examining the whole transport system, road and rail, of this country, and making whatever recommendations it thinks proper to the Government to decide whether to accept or reject these recommendations. It will be for the Government to decide if it requires legislation to implement any of the recommendations made by this board.  If it comes to the point when such legislation is introduced it will be for the Oireachtas as a whole to decide whether or not it is acceptable.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured during the passage of this Bill through the House to secure that it would emerge on the Fifth Stage from the Dáil, not a Government measure but a Dáil measure. I think I can say we have achieved that.  I think I can say further that the Dáil has approached the consideration of it as a deliberative Assembly and not just purely to record decisions already taken.  There were certain points put up and certain amendments put forward which I felt I had to resist and I did resist but, wherever I could meet Deputies from any part of the House without imposing an unfair burden on the new board or on the Córas Iompair Éireann organisation, I certainly went as far as I possibly could go to meet them.  We have tried in this measure to be fair to the people primarily concerned and most closely concerned.  We have tried to be, and, I think, have been, fair to the stockholders whose property we are acquiring and we have tried in, I think, a fuller measure than was ever attempted before, to safeguard the interests and the future of the various grades of employees in this very big employing concern.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything else I can say at this stage, except to emphasise that to make a success of it requires more than the mere passing of a Bill.  Having met the House to the fullest possible extent and having provided <Col N="1493" /> in the fullest possible measure for security of employment, for fair conditions, for fair wages and for fair superannuation or pension when retirement comes, I think it might not be out of place for me to make an appeal to the 22,000 persons employed in this great concern, from the top to the bottom, that they ought to give us their fullest possible co-operation in making this a success.  That is necessary not merely from a national point of view, but even from the consideration of their own future welfare and the security of their own livelihoods. I believe that if we got that enthusiastic whole-hearted interest in Córas Iompair Éireann from the 22,000 employees which I think we have a right to expect, they could themselves do a considerable amount to attract to that service much more traffic than it is carrying at the moment.  On the management side, all I have to say is that it will be the desire of the new board, I am sure, to see that any cause of friction that may exist will be removed and also to see that there is that harmony right from the top to the bottom which is so essential for the successful working of a very big undertaking such as this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Keyes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The explanatory memorandum circulated with this Bill gives a brief outline of the history of rate remission on residences of the type to which the Bill applies. When the previous Bill in this series was before the Dáil and Seanad in 1948, the late Minister for Local Government undertook to make a memorandum of this nature available in future to facilitate Deputies and Senators in understanding the scope of the measure, as this is not readily <Col N="1494" /> apparent on the face of the Bill.  I do not, therefore, think that it is necessary for me to deal in any greater detail with the background of this legislation.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not embody any new principle.  It merely proposes to extend for a further two years, that is to the 31st March, 1951, the period within which the erection, enlargement or improvement of certain residences must be completed in order to qualify for remission of two-thirds of the rates for five years.  The Bill does not increase the period over which the remission of rates will be given.  That period will remain the same as it has been since the Local Government Act, 1927, namely, five years.</P>
      <P>The amendment of the definition of the word &ldquo;residence&rdquo; being effected in sub-section (1) of Section 1 is merely a drafting amendment, its purpose being to bring up to date the reference to the collective title of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts, and thereby continue to exclude from the scope of the Rates Remission Acts residences in respect of which grants are paid under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts and the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, this legislation has never been on a permanent basis but has been continued from time to time by Acts whose duration is limited.  The reason for this is that a concession of this nature, which is paid for by the ratepayers, must be subject to periodical review lest in changing circumstances it might be imposing an unnecessary burden on the ratepayers. On the other hand, I do not think it would be fair if the concession which has been in operation since 1925 were not continued.  It is reasonable to assume that there are persons who have completed dwellings of the type to which this code applies, after the 31st March, 1949, and who entered into commitments on the assumption that the period for completion would be extended as in the past.  Such persons would be subjected to hardships if the concession which they expected were not made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle of this Bill has received the approval of the House on many <Col N="1495" /> occasions.  I am sure, therefore, that the House will again agree to its continuation for the further period specified, and so enable rates remission to be applied in respect of houses, the erection, enlargement or improvement of which is completed not later than the 31st March, 1951.</P>

The 1925 Act in Section 69, and the 1927 Act in Section 12, provided that where an effort was being made to modernise a premises, certain assistance would be given towards such modernisation not by way of State grant, as of course that could not be dealt with, but by way of rates remission, so that an inducement would be given to the persons concerned to bring their premises up to date.

      <P>The section concerned was included in the 1925 Act and included again in the 1927 Act, and for the first time the section was removed in the 1940 Act, which is the one that we are asked here to extend.  Up to that time, the provision had been that where buildings were reconstructed, enlarged or improved and in consequence of all that, the valuation was varied, there was, after such valuation was varied, a remission for rating purposes alone of two-thirds of the additional valuation, for a short period after the new valuation was struck. That was removed by the 1940 Act, which we are now here extending in point of time.</P>

      <P>If this amendment is to be submitted, and confining myself strictly to Deputy Sweetman's remarks, there is one question I would like to raise.  If I understand the Deputy correctly, he is, in effect, suggesting that this Bill be so extended that remissions of rates would apply to business premises reconstructed and improved, in addition to dwellings.  I am acting on that hypothesis and I hope I have interpreted the Deputy correctly.  I wonder if Deputy Sweetman has adverted to this problem, and I merely mention it as a problem. Since the matter comes from the Deputy, I would like to put this point back to him.  Take the rates of the City of Dublin.  In the city, there is a very large number of business premises occupied by a very large number of firms and many of those business premises are highly valued and, therefore, are paying very high rates.  If any such proposal were accepted, would it not mean that the rate return to the Dublin Corporation would be deficient by the amount of the remission which the Deputy contemplates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because the effect of the remission would be to get more people to go in for reconstruction.</P>

      <P>I am advised that the suggested amendment by Deputy Sweetman is completely outside the scope of this Bill.  The Bill in its Long Title sets out &ldquo;An Act to Amend and Extend, with Restrospective Effect, the Local Government (Remission of Rates) Act, 1940.&rdquo;  Deputy Sweetman suggests that the word &ldquo;extend&rdquo; may mean to extend the scope.  The previous Acts leading up to this one had the same wording but definitely were intended only to extend the date of their application. Since the 1940 Act, the one we are dealing with, there have been various Acts extending the date, but not the principle.  The principle proposed by Deputy Sweetman is a completely new principle and I am advised it is not possible to consider it in this Bill. The Chair may take the same view.  The Act that we are amending is the Local Government (Remission of Rates) Act, 1940, an Act to give partial relief from rates in respect of certain new enlarged and improved residences.  In all the supplementary Acts since then, &ldquo;residences&rdquo; has been stressed and there was no question of extending the principle of the Act, as enunciated here. All we have been doing in the House for several years past is to continue to give rates relief to certain cases which do not get grants from the State.  If the Chair accepts the amendment, I will have to abide by that, but I am advised that it could not be inserted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the cases referred to by Deputy Beegan would be under Section 17 of the Act of 1940.  There is a weakness in the interpretation of Section 17 owing to the omission of a word or something of the kind, and I intend, in the forthcoming Housing Bill, to consider meeting that and having it remedied.  We could not deal with it now.  We could not do it in this rates remission.  This is dealing with houses that do not get grants.  Whatever weakness is in the other Act is in relation to those that do get grants. Whatever weakness is there, I propose <Col N="1500" /> to have removed in the Housing Bill which will be introduced shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill is, in effect, a Bill to do now what the 1947 Flax Act, 1936 (Suspension) Act then did, with this additional feature, that the Flax Act (Suspension) Act, 1947, suspended the 1936 Act for a limited period, while this Bill would suspend the 1936 Act for an unlimited period and the 1936 Act would not come into operation hereafter unless and until an Order to that effect was made by the Government for the time being.  The purpose of the original Act in 1936 was to promote the cultivation of flax in the country. It fixed the minimum prices and it was hoped thereby to evoke in certain areas of the country about 5,000 acres of flax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1502" /> In fact, the provisions of the 1936 Act never functioned because the minimum prices which it was thought expedient to fix under it never reached market prices, which were consistently in excess of the minima fixed.  Then, with the outbreak of war, a variety of factors operated which made it highly unlikely that the provisions designed to promote the cultivation of flax would be necessary and it was deemed expedient to suspend the Act.  That situation obtained until 1948, which was the last year in which the Board of Trade in Great Britain made itself responsible for buying the entire flax crop of this country.  When the Board of Trade in London withdrew, the future market of flax grown in this country by our people became a matter between the growers and the Northern Ireland spinners.  The Northern Ireland spinners, as the House will remember, suggested that a lower price than had been paid in 1948 should be acceptable for our growers in 1949.  Their final offer was to buy 2,000 tons of flax at 32/6 per stone for grade 5.  That was a reduction of 2/6 on the prices paid for the 1948 crop.  I advised the spinners that that was not a proposal that I considered myself justified in recommending to the growers in this country in view of the fact that contemporaneously the Northern Ireland flax spinners not only proposed to maintain but to raise the prices payable to the growers in Northern Ireland.  Subsequently the Association of Flax Spinners in Northern Ireland met representatives of the growers and agreed to purchase 3,000 tons at prices ranging from 26/6 for grade 6 to 34/- for grade 1 with an additional 1/6 a stone for turbine scutched flax.  Arrangements, I understand, have been made in respect of 1950 for the sale of 3,000 tons.  The prices agreed on show a further reduction of 3/- on the prices ruling in 1949 and are 10/- per stone less than the growers in Northern Ireland will receive.  The House should know that in respect of the flax crop in Northern Ireland an arrangement has been arrived at whereby the spinners will pay a basic price and the Northern Ireland Government will pay a subsidy under the Flax Act, 1949. <Col N="1503" /> I have a copy of the Flax Act (Northern Ireland), 1949, and in the First Schedule to that Act there is an interesting declaration.  The First Schedule contains the growers' agreement.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whereas the cost of growing flax in Northern Ireland exceeds considerably the world prices of flax of equivalent quality and whereas it is important that the growing of flax in Northern Ireland should be encouraged and the quality improved...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It then goes on to set out that a subsidy shall be made available to the growers by the Government.  Inasmuch as the Government of Northern Ireland, recognising that the price provided by the spinners is inadequate to give the growers of Northern Ireland a tolerable and acceptable standard of living and that the growers could not be expected to accept it, feels constrained to subsidise the crop in order to produce the raw material of one of its principal industries, Deputies of this House will readily recognise that an Irish Minister for Agriculture could not accept the implication that growers in Ireland should gladly accept from the spinners of Northern Ireland a price 10/- lower than that which the Government of Northern Ireland considers to be a reasonable price for the growers of Northern Ireland. In those circumstances, as I do not anticipate that the fixing of minimum prices is likely to be requisite in the early future because I would not recommend a flax crop to our people except on the basis of their receiving from it a standard of living and a measure of reward for their effort in its cultivation commensurate with the minimum which is thought suitable for the farmers of Tyrone, Fermanagh, Armagh and Derry, I ask the House to suspend the Flax Act of 1936 unless and until at some future date it appears necessary to invoke the powers of that Act in the interests of such sections of our people as may desire to engage in the business of growing flax in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In the review of the flax situation&mdash;I would say the misleading <Col N="1504" /> review&mdash;to which we have listened, the House has not had from the Minister any statement showing whether or not he accepts as Minister for Agriculture the responsibility of negotiating with the Six County spinners the price that flax growers in the Twenty-Six Counties will receive for their crop. He has stated that when the fixing of prices was a matter for the British Board of Trade such a discussion took place between our Department of Agriculture and that British Ministry. When, as he states, in 1948 the prices to be paid for flax became a matter for the Six County spinners talks apparently took place between officials of the Minister's Department and the flax spinners regarding last year's crop. I take it that the fact of these discussions between our Department and the flax spinners being initiated was an acceptance of the responsibility by the Minister and his Department to continue the practice that had been in vogue when the fixing of prices was a matter for the British Department.</P>
      <P>Following the failure last year of the Minister and his Department to reach an agreement with the Six County spinners, we had a discussion here.  In the course of that discussion I said what I will now repeat, that there was no justification whatever for the Minister's failure to reach agreement on that occasion.  At the time I was conscious of the fact that, from the way in which the negotiations opened up, a certain difficulty was presented to the Minister and the Department inasmuch as the Six County spinners made their first offer for the 1949 crop prior to making any agreement in regard to the price to be paid to Six County growers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will concede this much, that any man who is charged, as the Minister was charged then, with handling that matter for the growers here, would naturally be entitled to be suspicious that he was being used by the Six County spinners to effect an agreement in the Twenty-Six Counties that would prejudice and that would reduce the price they would be obliged to offer to the growers in the Six Counties and, as a result, he would naturally conclude that he and his Department should not allow themselves to be put <Col N="1505" /> into the position of negotiating with the spinners and accepting a price that would then be used by these spinners, who are keen businessmen and who want to get the raw materials as cheaply as possible, against the Six County growers.</P>
    <P>I would say it was because of that fact that the spinners agreed to take 4,000 tons at the rate of 31/3 for grade 5.  The Minister, in his wisdom, decided to reject that offer and before any further negotiations took place the spinners arrived at an agreement with the Six County growers which provided, as has been explained, for a price to be paid by the spinners, plus a bonus to be paid out of taxation by the Northern Government.  Having secured an agreement with the Six County growers for a larger quantity than they perhaps originally anticipated, the spinners came back with an offer to our Minister here, not of 4,000 tons of flax, but of 2,000 tons at a slight advance in price.</P>
    <P>I will concede that any man as responsible as the Minister was might fall into that mistake, might fall into failing to make an agreement on the original offer, suspecting that there was behind the offer the purpose which I have stated.  If he did fall into that trap, could he not have come back to the growers, the people concerned in this business in the four counties, have some discussions with them, place his cards on the table, show the way in which he had been endeavouring to do his best for them and try to find a reasonable solution out of the new situation which had arisen?</P>
    <P>What approach was made instead of, as I suggest, that reasonable line of approach?  The spinners came back with the renewed offer reduced by half to 2,000 tons with a slight increase in price.  The Minister then flew into a temper.  As he explained in this House, he was not prepared to do business with three gentlemen from the Six Counties with Lancashire accents.  As a matter of fact, he admitted here&mdash; as will be found in the records&mdash;that he told these gentlemen to go to blazes. It was after that display on his part that the growers decided they would <Col N="1506" /> do something themselves&mdash;the growers and the millers with the spinners of the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>As you have been told, an agreement was reached covering 3,000 tons of flax. Every Deputy realises the importance of an agreement having the backing of a State Department.  Every Deputy realises that a flax grower will place much more value upon an agreement made between his own Department and the Six County spinners than upon an agreement arrived at in a loose and casual way, with no powers of enforcement behind it, and arrived at in the manner in which last year's and, as we have been told now, this year's agreements have been made.</P>
    <P>But it was not enough, apparently, to give this demonstration of failure. The Minister, having failed, was too proud to admit his failure and, following that demonstration, in every conceivable way he set out to depress the growing, to discourage the growing, of this crop, not only in his own constituency, but in the whole area in which flax has been a cash crop for many years.</P>
    <P>I was reading at the time, following the discussion here, a statement made by the Minister and reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 26th March, 1949, at a meeting in connection with the parish plan.  The Minister is reported as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Warning to farmers.  Beware of crops for which there is only one market,&rdquo; the Minister continued, &ldquo;for if those who control that market desire to exploit you, they can present you with an ultimation any day they like that you must take for your crop less than its value, and if you reject that offer you have nothing else to do but be at the loss of it all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That advice to the farmers, coming from the present Minister for Agriculture, is surely interesting.  I would like the Minister to say is the advice consistent with his many other statements in connection with quite a lot of other agricultural products for which he has committed us, so far as it is possible for him to commit us, to one purchaser?  In what way does he <Col N="1507" /> contend that the argument holds good that, because we were offered a lesser price here for our flax, such price should not be accepted here?  Is it not a fact that, in relation to quite a number of other items of agricultural produce, we receive a lesser price than the farmers of the Six Counties?</P>
    <P>But the Minister having failed&mdash;he was a businessman, of course, and was trying to make the world, and this little world especially, believe that he was competent to handle all these business problems thoroughly&mdash;was not the type of person who would admit failure, and he set himself out to ensure that, as far as possible, the area under flax for 1949 would be considerably reduced.  Mind you, I do not think that he actually stopped at making statements which would result in that position.  During the sowing season I happened to pass through his constituency, which adjoins my own. The one thing I noticed during my travels was that on every hoarding in the County Monaghan, in every town and village and at every Garda station, there were flashy notices displayed, headed &ldquo;Warning to Farmers&rdquo;.  The warning to the farmers was this: that if, as a result of action on their part in releasing water from the retting pools, damage was caused to our fisheries, they would render themselves liable to the penalties set forth if such a charge could be established against them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am raising it in order to indicate, briefly, the efforts that followed the Minister's failure.  Those who had been growing flax for years and had been receiving for it a price that was negotiated for them by their own Department were being intimidated by the Minister so that he would be able to say at the end of 1949: &ldquo;Did I not tell you that the farmers would not grow flax at that price?&rdquo; But, in spite of all those efforts, it transpires anyhow that the farmers of Monaghan grew somewhere around 5,000 odd acres last year; that the farmers of Donegal grew somewhere in the neighbourhood of a little less than 6,000 acres; that the farmers <Col N="1508" /> in my own county grew roughly half that quantity and that the farmers in County Cork grew somewhat less than 2,000 acres.</P>
      <P>I want to ask in all seriousness the Deputies who are supporting the Government, is it going to be contended that, in the case of those farmers who are growing flax, a crop which they grew last year in spite of all the obstacles that were placed in their way and in spite of the uncertainty arising out of the way in which this matter was handled, it is reasonable that our Minister and the Department of Agriculture should wash their hands completely this year of responsibility for the initiation of discussions again, even though they failed last year, with the representatives of the flax spinners in the Six Counties, in the hope that these small farmers who grew 15,000 odd acres of that crop would at least have behind their effort the security of an agreement as to price and quantity negotiated for them by a State Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought, in fact we were told that when the Minister for Agriculture declared the Republic on his holidays in Paris some time ago, a new situation was going to exist here, a new approach to such matters as those which we are now discussing, and that we were going to have closer relations with our neighbours.  I thought that our Minister for External Affairs was going to see to it that in matters of trade and business, of education and all the rest, we were going to have friendly talks and discussions with our neighbours, that we were not going to talk to them in such terms as: &ldquo;Go to blazes, I do not want to talk to you about flax or anything else because you have a Lancashire accept and you are only a Quisling.&rdquo;  We were led to believe over the last two years that our approach to problems such as this, which is a purely business matter, was going to be altogether different from what it had been in all the years that have passed.  In the demonstration given here to-night by the Minister in his misleading review of the whole flax situation, we had the admission that not even once this year did he attempt, on behalf of the growers of these 15,000 odd acres of flax, to make <Col N="1509" /> contact with out northern neighbours to see whether any agreement of the type I have referred to could be reached.</P>
    <P>There are times in this House when men speak here perhaps not with that full feeling of conviction with which I am now speaking as to the manner in which this matter has been handled.  I am not going to contend that the flax crop, some time or other, might not prove profitable or that world conditions and circumstances might not force our farmers out of the growing of it.  I am not contending that it is possible for a Minister or a Government here to ensure that this crop will last for all time and will provide for those who grow it a remunerative market; but I do contend that it is a crop which is suitable to our farmers; they have a knowledge of it, they have been at it for years, and it has been regarded by them as a paying crop.</P>
    <P>The fact that the reduction in the acreage as between 1948 and 1949 was only a matter of 5,000 acres, in spite of all the bungling and mishandling to which the business was subjected last year, is proof, in my opinion, that if our farmers were given a reasonable chance and reasonable encouragement, they would continue to grow it as a cash crop, and that it is very valuable to them from that point of view.  I want to say that the farmer-Deputies who know this problem, as I know it, and who are supporting the present Government have a duty imposed on them to see that this method of handling their business will cease.  I am sorry that none of the Deputies to whom I am addressing my remarks are now in the House, but for many years they showed great interest and great enthusiasm for this industry in the counties that I have referred to.  The growers have their own organisation and they were always alert, led by some of those here who now claim to be farmer spokesmen. I am amazed at the silence which has prevailed in their ranks in this House for the last 12 months in regard to this question.  I do not expect that they should go along and say to the Government: &ldquo;We are not giving you our support any further.&rdquo;  I think, however, <Col N="1510" /> that they should be able to secure by legitimate pressure that a different sort of approach would be made to this matter.</P>
    <P>We would have liked to get from the Minister much more information than he has seen fit to give us on this subject. I have here the figures of the acreage of flax grown last year.  I have told you of the reduction of roughly 5,000 acres which took place as between 1948 and 1949.  The Minister took advantage of the Agricultural Workers (Holidays) Bill yesterday to tell the House of the enormous improvement that has taken place in the yield of crops since the advent to office of this Government.  I should like to hear in what way that result has shown itself in regard to the flax crop.  I should like the Minister, if he is really interested, to tell us what was the average yield last year and what are the prospects; to give us a general review of the seed position and what he has been doing in that regard; to tell us what has become of the flax board which was in existence in the Department for many years, encouraging our people to grow that crop, helping them in many ways, and helping the owners of mills to equip these establishments in order to handle the crop grown by our farmers.  That is what we should like to hear and are entitled to hear from the Minister responsible, not the sort of review that is designed, as far as he is concerned, to depress still further this business of flax growing.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose that anything I say would induce the Minister even now to change his attitude towards flax growers.  As I say, it might fade out in the ordinary way if world conditions changed to such an extent that flax would no longer prove to be a paying proposition.  It is regarded as such even yet by many farmers in those districts who will continue to grow it this year even at the price to which the Minister has referred.  I want to say in that regard that, when I was Minister, I was obliged to accept a price in respect of the 1948 crop less than the price available to Six County growers. I tried to get the same price as they were getting for our flax growers and I struggled mighty hard to secure it <Col N="1511" /> for them.  Prior to 1948, there was a differential of 2/6 per stone.  I succeeded only to a limited extent in reducing that differential to 1/6.  But because I was not able to secure the same price as was being offered to the Six County growers it did not follow that I was going to say to these people: &ldquo;Go to blazes.  I do not want to do business with you because you have the wrong kind of accent.&rdquo; Because we are not able to secure from the Six County spinners prices equal to those offered to the Six County growers, plus the subsidy or bounty paid by the northern taxpayers, is no reason for the Minister's refusal to face up to his responsibility to a section of our farmers.  If he refuses to face up to that responsibility because that situation exists, then he will have to admit that, not only does it exist in relation to flax, but in relation to eggs and a great quantity of the agricultural produce we are selling in the British market.</P>

I will, when reminded by the Chair, try to make myself amenable if I have transgressed in any way.  I say then to Deputies from Cork, Donegal, Monaghan and Cavan that we should provide the best possible opportunity we can for those who grew 15,000 acres of flax last year.  Why should we try to rob them as a result of our pride or prejudice?  Why should the Minister or the Department try to rob them of the opportunity they have had all down the years and that they will continue to have if there is a proper approach?  On coming into office, the Minister accepted the responsibility in the new situation that arose of discussing with northern spinners the fixing of the price of the flax crop.  He failed in that, but his failure in that year does not in any way justify his refusal this year to open up the discussion again in the hope that he will do better.  He has <Col N="1512" /> failed to do that.  He has, as it were, bowed himself out of the whole business. He has tried to depress and discourage by word and action those who want to continue to grow flax in spite of the policy of his Department, and the manner in which this little industry has been handled within the last two years is deplorable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Smith seems to be very apprehensive because of the flax-growing situation in Cork.  I represent a constituency which has been a very considerable flax producing area over a period of years.  I have not fallen into the error into which Deputy Smith has fallen of either deliberate misapprehension or arrogant stupidity. The flax growers in my constituency appreciate in no uncertain fashion, because of their experience during the first world war, that flax-growing is primarily a war-time crop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My purpose in intervening to-night is not to follow in the wild flood of misrepresentation of an irate ex-Minister, but rather to put what I consider to be reasonable suggestions to the Minister. Deputy Smith has described in his own inimitable way the spectre of depression that the Minister is casting over the flax-growing industry.  On the one hand, he charges the Minister with responsibility to the farmers.  On the other hand, he discredits the Minister for facing this responsibility.  In some extraordinary way he tries to make capital out of a statement to the effect that the Minister has suggested to the farmers that it is, at least, unwise to grow a crop for which there is only one market, particularly when the people in control of that market can quite deliberately depress the price.  I can see no difficulty in accepting that proposition. I think the Minister was facing his responsibility when he adverted to that fact as far as flax was concerned. What could the Minister do?  He could not buy it.  He could serve no purpose in buying it.  He did, however, take the very necessary step of doing his duty as a Minister.  On the one hand, Deputy Smith says he does not do it and, on the other hand, he castigates the Minister for doing it.  The Minister did take the responsibility of pointing out to the farmers the difficulties that <Col N="1513" /> existed in the situation.  It may be that the Minister's own temperament led him to make an emphatic and dogmatic statement to the northern spinners. I think if we were a little bit more reasonable in our analysis of the principles that underlay that statement, we might not find quite so much in it with which to contend.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Smith could eradicate from his soul the deep personal bitterness that he feels against the present occupant of the office of Minister for Agriculture, he might not be so unrealistic, so nebulous or so unconvincing in the arguments that he propounds and tries to put across in the House. The situation with regard to flax is quite a simple one.  The Minister has to face either of two problems.  He must either get the farmers into something else that will pay them better or provide them with something in the nature of an established linen industry to act as an absorbent for the flax that is grown.</P>
    <P>I represent a constituency that has made a considerable amount of money out of flax.  I urge upon the Minister to encourage, direct and advise the farmers to get out of flax unless he, as a responsible Minister, can find for them and their goods a safe, secure and profitable market.  I want uncertainty removed once and for all.  I do not think contributions, such as those made by Deputy Smith, are helpful.  I think the efforts made by Deputy Mrs. Rice and Deputy Dr. Maguire last year were ill-timed, because we were left in the position of having the crisis break too soon and in a manner that could not react favourably to the Minister who, at that stage of the operations, was at least actively negotiating a price.  I do not subscribe to the beliefs to which Deputy Smith subscribes. I believe there is as much contractual obligation between growers and spinners as there is between the spinners and the Department of Agriculture should they see fit to enter into a contract.  I do not think Deputy Smith has succeeded in making any case.  He has only offered us further evidence of his own stupidity because a contract, whether it is entered into by the State with the northern spinners or by the growers with the <Col N="1514" /> northern spinners is equally a contract and equally enforceable.  I think Deputy Smith is transgressing in his misguided enthusiasm upon a field of contractual obligation which he does not understand and to which he should not advert.</P>
    <P>The flax situation is one in which the Minister has a duty.  It is his duty to indicate clearly, succinctly and deliberately to the farming community the difficulties inherent in the situation and to warn them of the perils they may face if they continue to grow the crop.  On the other hand, if the Minister can envisage the possibility of a permanent flax-growing industry I urge upon him the desirability of reporting to his Government with a view to establishing a proper linen mill to absorb the flax we grow.  It must always be remembered that we can grow in this country flax as good as that grown anywhere in the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMaguire" hpid="Dr. Maguire Dr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not make the same mistake as Deputy Smith did by expressing amazement at the Minister's callous treatment of the whole flax business because, since the first occasion on which he had an opportunity of dealing with it, his attitude has been one of complete indifference. In fact, he has encouraged flax growers to cease growing the crop.  Deputy Collins has referred to the question raised by Deputy Mrs. Rice and myself. He said that we intervened a bit late in connection with the negotiations in relation to the price for the 1949 crop.  I want to assure Deputy Collins that the question in connection with this matter was put down quite innocently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMaguire" hpid="Dr. Maguire Dr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.  What amazes me is the fact that the Minister, who himself represents a constituency in which flax is a traditional cash crop, should not appreciate that we also represent that constituency and are entitled to evince an interest in the price for that crop.  Why should we not evince such an interest?  What amazes me even more is the fact that the Minister, finding himself confronted with only one buyer for our flax, <Col N="1515" /> practically told that buyer in so many words to &ldquo;go to blazes&rdquo;.  I think he actually amended that expression later by saying that he told them to &ldquo;go and take a running jump at themselves.&rdquo; That is all very well.  Admittedly, in the intervening period, he changed his political outlook and he was trying, perhaps, to lead up to that change. What I should like to know is why, in connection with the original negotiations for the price of the 1949 crop, they commenced in June and why did we hear nothing further in connection with them until December?  What was the Minister doing from June to December in the matter?  I admit, of course, that he was very usefully employed in America advising the American people on the best way to achieve the invulnerability of Britain. The Minister completely omitted to cater for and to protect this cash crop which, unlike the flax crop in West Cork to which Deputy Collins has referred, was not a wartime crop but one on which the people of County Monaghan depended to a very great extent for the payment of their annual bills.  It was the duty of the Minister to foster this cash crop in County Monaghan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>They may have been less&mdash;3,000 or 4,000 acres.  The price of flax will require to be a lot less before it ceases to be a traditional crop in County Monaghan and even then, as Deputy Smith pointed out, a number <Col N="1516" /> of people will be prepared to grow it. Instead of fostering it, as it was his duty to foster every branch of agriculture in the country and particularly the crop which counted so much in the constituency which he represents, he sabotaged it.  But, of course, that is typical of the attitude of the Minister in the Department which he governs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Dr. Maguire must be under some illusion if he thinks that flax has in recent years been a customary cash crop for his and my constituents prior to the advent of war.  Perhaps the Deputy has forgotten the acreage of flax in the whole of Ireland in the years 1931 to 1934.  The average flax crop in the whole of Ireland where the writ of this Government runs, for three years, was about 700 acres.  The Deputy has, I think, overlooked what happened.  Up to 1936 flax was practically not-existent in this part of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Twenty-Six Counties.  The Government of that day &mdash;inasmuch as beet was a subsidised crop and wheat was a subsidised crop and that these crops were not readily available to many people who were engaged in mixed farming in North Monaghan, parts of Cavan and traditional areas where flax used to be grown&mdash;conceived the scheme of promoting the growth of flax in those areas as in some degree compensating farmers in those areas for their inability, owing to the nature of their soil, to avail of the other subsidised crops.  But the Deputy may take it from me, as I have no doubt our colleague Deputy Mrs. Rice well knows, that in 1933 there was virtually no flax. It had all disappeared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the facts.  As Deputy Collins has pointed out, during the war there was an artificial stimulus given to flax.  Prior to 1914 flax had been a crop which was extensively <Col N="1517" /> grown in Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan and West Cork&mdash;but that is going back a long way.  I am quite at a loss to understand the outlook of Deputy Smith.  I was approached by the Northern Ireland spinners.  Deputy Smith says that in his last negotiations with the British Board of Trade he disliked having to accept a price for Irish flax lower than that which the Board of Trade was prepared to pay for Northern Ireland flax but that he made the best bargain he could and that he succeeded in reducing the disparity from 2/6 a stone to 1/6.  Deputy Smith seems entirely to have overlooked what I have repeatedly told the House. When the Northern Ireland spinners came to me in the autumn of 1948 the proposal they had the impudence to make to me was that on the same day that they wanted to reduce the price for our growers they were going to raise the price for the growers in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to prolong unduly this discussion, but I want to put this point as an essential point and I do so merely on the construction of the section as it stands.  I personally have not enough experience of the problem to express any view as to what should be done, but I am commenting on what, in effect, this section so far as I can see would do, if it were law.  These are two different things. The point I was making when the discussion was adjourned last night was that it seemed to me&mdash;and I have since made inquiries from people who have some experience of these congested areas&mdash;that a rearrangement scheme could be such as to involve a rearrangement of lands in rundale or intermixed plots in a congested area in such a way that some of the people there involved would be removed to land elsewhere to facilitate the rearrangement in the congested area.  Let me be more specific about that.  In the Minister's own constituency, it is possible, so far as I can see, that there will be a number of people involved in these intermixed plots and that a rearrangement there will be desirable. <Col N="1524" /> Being congested, merely rearranging them amongst these people, I understand, will not be very much of a solution.  You can only get a practical solution in these cases if you remove some of the people and transfer them elsewhere and rearrange what is left. That whole scheme in its broader outline will be a rearrangement scheme. As I read the section, it means that in the allocation of lands in, say, Tipperary or Meath, to facilitate the rearrangement scheme contemplated in the Minister's constituency, the Minister, if these words which Deputy Cogan and Deputies on this side seek to have deleted remain, will have complete power.  He will also have that power in relation to the determination of the price, because I think we are taking these two amendments together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I did, but I could not follow you, and I cannot follow you in print still.  It is in print and I throw myself on the mercy of the House as a jury to decide, reading the report, who is intelligible and who is not.  I will let Deputies decide that for themselves. The point I am making in the net, however, is that, in connection with a rearrangement scheme, in order to facilitate the arrangement, a question may arise of allotting land which has been acquired or otherwise has come within the power of the Land Commission in Tipperary or Meath, that being land, to use the words which we seek to delete, &ldquo;arising in or being part of a rearrangement scheme.&rdquo;  It seems to me that the Minister has power not only to determine the allocation and the price in regard to the actual plot in the congested area, but that, through that loophole, he gets complete power <i>qua</i> Minister in respect of the price and the allocation of the land in County Meath or County Tipperary or anywhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1525" /> I am not questioning the desirability or otherwise at the moment of the Minister having that direct power.  I have heard theoretical reasons why he should not.  I think it would be wiser for himself not to put himself in the position of attracting political odium and of being charged with corruption by taking such powers.  I am not dealing with that aspect at all.  Other Deputies who know the situation better than I can do that.  From the point of view of the content of this section, there is a problem to be faced, and the wording of the Bill as it stands&mdash;and now I come to the last paragraph, to which Deputy Collins and the Minister referred me&mdash;as far as I can read English, more than confirms me in that respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick) Joseph Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>The paragraph I referred the Deputy to is paragraph (f) of Section 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the determination of the new holding which is to be provided for a tenant or proprietor whose holding has been acquired or resumed by the Land Commission;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the determination of a new holding which is to be provided for a tenant or proprietor whose holding is being acquired or resumed by the Land Commission is a totally different thing. I will deal with that now, though it is out of sequence with my argument.  The Minister will be aware, through his legal advisers, that in the construction of an Act of Parliament the courts will first of all endeavour to make sense of it and try to give some force to each particular provision, and will be very loath to construe a section as being redundant or merely repetitive.  If there is any point where they can reconcile such sections that seem to overlap and give separate meanings, the court will seek it out.  Here is the distinction and here is what possibly could be held&mdash;that that determination of a new holding which is to be provided for a tenant or proprietor whose holding is to be acquired or resumed by the Land Commission simply means this.  We have had all over the country cases where people had got holdings and were not <Col N="1526" /> working them and where the Land Commission was resuming them.  That is one case, happening all over the country.  Another case is where the Land Commission has acquired simpliciter without any rearrangement scheme.  They are concrete cases upon which paragraph (f) to which the Minister referred can operate and it still leaves the peculiar qualification of rearrangement standing alone as it is in the first paragraph.</P>
    <P>I come back to my argument on this. I would have great sympathy with the Minister in the interpretation he puts on it, were it not for the words at the end of sub-section (1):&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In this sub-section, the expression &lsquo;rearrangement scheme&rsquo; means a scheme which is framed or approved by an officer by virtue of sub-section (2) of this section for the rearrangement of lands held in rundale or intermixed plots&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It may stop there&mdash;I would not be so sure of it myself, but you go on and say explicitly:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;whether with or without the distribution of other lands to facilitate the said rearrangement.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying it is a crime.  I am merely pointing out the legal effect of this section on what you will be doing.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying it will be this, that by virtue of the paragraph which we are now seeking to delete, coupled with the definition of the rearrangement scheme at the end of the paragraph, taken in conjunction with the fact that sub-section (2) is a completely new departure in this Bill, radically different from the corresponding section in the 1933 Act, which is repealed, coupled with the fact that later on in the section, I think it is sub-section (5) (a) and other provisions <Col N="1527" /> in the section generally which have the effect of giving the Minister power to direct both his servant and the officer of the Minister under paragraph (b) of sub-section (2) and the Land Commission generally under sub-section (3), coupled with all these powers, the net effect of this enactment, as it stands on its present draftsmanship, is simply this, that the Minister simpliciter can deal with rearrangement of rundale or intermixed plots in the congested area and has only got to tie up in that scheme, as has frequently, I understand, been done to date, the allotment of land in any other part of the country.</P>

I understand&mdash;and I would be grateful if the Minister would categorically contradict me, as I am completely in his hands on a matter of fact, if I am wrong&mdash;that there has been no rearrangement scheme where these arrangements have been facilitated and made possible by the removal of certain tenants or persons involved in the holding from the congested area, leaving their land to be redistributed and rearranged as part of a scheme in the congested area, and these people taken and allotted land elsewhere.</P>

      <P>Well, if that has been done, the connection is this, that not only has the Minister complete power in the determination of who are to be selected as the allottees and the price in regard to all the parcels of land in the congested district but, by virtue of the draftmanship of this particular section and the Bill as a whole, he secures similar power over the lands in the other counties, the land from which these have been turned. In other words, he finds himself in the <Col N="1528" /> position that, having got a rearrangement scheme, he can dictate or decide the price and the persons to be allocated, both in regard to the lands in the congested area and the lands outside.  In other words, he has the power, without fetter from the Land Commission, and as a matter personally to himself, so to speak, <i>qua</i> Minister&mdash;I do not mean personally, but in a purely ministerial capacity&mdash; to allot these lands and to fix their price without relation to the Land Commission as it stands there.</P>

If that be the sense of his motion, I will accept it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is its interpretation, then I oppose the motion.  I think the House, on reflection, will realise that at the present time, in order to maintain the domestic price for butter, the Treasury is providing a sum of £3,000,000 per annum but we are now on the threshold of a period in which, having reached the maximum point of consumption, taking the country as a whole, increased production will produce butter surplus to our own capacity to consume and we will have to ask ourselves: Are we prepared to pay the people of other countries 70/- per cwt. to eat our butter?</P>
      <P>I have had occasion to direct the attention of the House to the gratifying increase in the number of milch cows, in the number of heifers in calf, in the number of gallons of milk delivered to our creameries and in the number of cwts. of butter produced by our creameries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1530" /> Deputy O'Reilly, in commending this resolution to the House, said that he felt constrained to rest on the facts of which he had personal knowledge and they were the statistics relevant to the Killeshandra Creamery.  He recorded faithfully that there was an increase in the total milk supply reaching that creamery, but surmised that that was in large part due to the diversion of milk in that area from farmers' butter to the creamery and added that the average milk yield, measuring yield by the amount of milk delivered to the creamery, ignoring whatever was consumed in the home, was in the order of 265 gallons per cow.</P>
    <P>We might as well face the fact at once that we cannot build a successful creamery industry in this country on the basis of a 265-gallon cow.  Neither I nor any other Minister for Agriculture in the world can pretend to dairy farmers that there is any prospect of remunerative employment for them in producing butter for sale in the world market from 265-gallon cows.  Therefore, I do not feel that I can materially contribute to the useful examination of this problem by pursuing the comparisons which Deputy O'Reilly proceeded to make between the cost of producing milk in County Cavan from 265-gallon cows and the cost of producing milk in Grangegorman Mental Hospital where labour costs 7d. a gallon, health maintenance 2.34d. per gallon, miscellaneous expenses 6.4d. per gallon and where it costs 1/8.37d. per gallon to feed each cow.</P>
    <P>If we are talking about milk which is fated to be sold to-day at 1/2 per gallon in summer and 1/4 in winter, it seems to me to be a profitless occupation to dwell on a cost of production which stipulates that feeding a cow, before you do anything else, costs 6d. per gallon more than you can hope to receive for the milk.  I would prefer to turn to a more realistic picture of dairy farming in rural Ireland and I quote from the <i>Nenagh Guardian</i> of the 11th February, 1950.  The supervisor of the Nenagh and District Cow Testing Association was making his annual report and he commented on the fact that the cows in the society showed a satisfactory increase in their yield which he attributed largely to <Col N="1531" /> the superior fertilisation of the pastures and the growing practice of feeding ensilage to the cattle in the winter. He presented a return of the ten best cows in the area and gave the milk yield, the butter fat content and the actual money received by the cow's owner from the creamery in respect of the milk delivered from that cow.</P>
    <P>Number one produced a cheque of £65 16s. 4d. for milk delivered to the creamery and there was a calf which sold for somewhere between £5 and £10.  Frankly, I am not in a position to tell whether in arriving at that figure regard was had to the value of the separated milk returned, but I think it was valued at 80 per cent. of the volume of the whole milk delivered, valuing the skim milk at 2d. per gallon which, to say the least, is a conservative valuation.  I would put it at something nearer 3d. or 3¼d.  The second cow yielded its owner £64 14s. 11d.; the third, £64 12s. 10d., and the rest, £64 8s. 9d., £62 7s. 7d., £62 3s. 0d., £61 15s. 0d. £61 12s. 1d., £58 2s. 6d., £56 1s. 4d. and £62 3s. 6d., and in each case there was a calf which was worth anything from £5 to £10.</P>
    <P>I want the House to understand most clearly that those were the ten best cows in a cow-testing society and it would be utterly mistaken to imagine that those figures are anything like a representative average.  They are the result of skilful farmers giving their best attention to a highly specialised job and producing what are unquestionably exceptionally magnificent results, but they are the results of ordinary dairy farmers who do not go in for pedigree stock, artificial feeding or any exceptional procedure other than that which is readily available to any farmer in Ireland whose land will grow grass and on whose land there is room for a pit in which to store silage for the winter maintenance of his cows in health during the period of their calves' gestation.  I do not pretend that I believe for one moment that figures like those are a practical possibility for the bulk of the dairy farmers of the country, but I do say that 400 gallons in a lactation is the lowest level at which a <Col N="1532" /> farmer can reasonably expect to participate profitably in the creamery industry.  We should resolutely aim at, nor be content until we achieve, an over-all average of between 500 and 600 gallons.</P>
    <P>In comparison with the figures I have read out such an average may seem to be a relatively modest aim, but I can assure the House that if we could realise an over-all average of between 500 and 600 gallons we would have no reason to blush in the presence of any dairy industry in the world and we would have every reason confidently to look forward to a solvent and prosperous industry.</P>
    <P>I know that the view which it is undoubtedly my duty to communicate to the House now may not correspond with the popular tenet of the time, but I believe that it is the duty of any public servant to speak the truth when the truth is relevant and vital and to take the consequences.</P>
    <P>The dairy industry in this country is the foundation on which the whole system of mixed farming which we operate is ultimately built.  I think it is wholly illusory to attach primary importance to the ability by pressure exercised by a group to force from the Government or the community a price above what is truly economic.  What I consider to be vital to the dairy industry is what it has never had to date, and that is the assurance that for the economic life of a cow the farmer will know, not the price that he will get for every gallon of milk, but the price below which a gallon of milk can never fall.  Mind you, there is a great distinction between a minimum price and a fixed price.  I want to banish out of the language of the dairy industry the word &ldquo;surplus&rdquo;.  I want to be able to say to the dairy farmers: &ldquo;From this day forward there is not such a word as &lsquo;surplus&rsquo;.  Your job as owners of your land is to produce from that land the last ounce that skill and industry can extract, while leaving your land in autumn a little better than you found it in the spring, with the certainty that, however great a measure of success attends your effort and that of your neighbour, the price you obtain for your product can never fall below an ascertained level.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;A guaranteed minimum price, but with the assurance that, should circumstances change and you are able to convert your product into some more remunerative commodity, or should world price levels rise, no one will be happier to see the dairy farmers or any part of them enjoy that rise.  But, whatever way the cat jumps, you will never know again the desperation of having pledged your credit to buy cows and, long before their economic life was spent, having to face the horror of selling them to the canneries because the milk they produced was not sufficient to pay the interest on your debt.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have often pointed out to Deputies in this House that we cannot subsidise the land out of the land.  In industrial countries the national income derived from industrial occupations may provide a surplus out of which the land and its output may be subsidised, but in Ireland everybody in the last analysis gets his living from the land and, therefore, if you charge the Exchequer with heavy subsidies for agricultural produce you are, in fact, taking money out of the farmer's right-hand pocket in order to compel him to doff his hat and take back his own money to put it into his left-hand pocket.</P>
      <P>I believe that if I could get the creamery industry to-day to see their true interest as I see it, I could secure for our dairy farmers an assurance that for five years from the 1st of April next the price of milk in this country, delivered to creameries, need never fall below 1/- a gallon and, contemporaneously with that assurance, it would be possible for me to decontrol the rationing of butter and to say to the farmers: &ldquo;Eliminate the word &lsquo;surplus&rsquo; from your vocabulary.  The more you produce the better you serve the interests of yourselves and your families and the better you serve the interests of the State as a whole.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I doubt if the opportunity to do that will ever occur again.  I believe if we could do it now and see the immensely beneficial consequences to the whole <Col N="1534" /> country, succeeding generations would remember us favourably for having had the wisdom to embark on that enterprise. But I do not conceal from the House&mdash;it has a right to know&mdash; that I am very conscious of the fact that it is terribly difficult to carry conviction to everybody's mind that the wise thing is to take the long view, that it is wise to forgo the proximate advantage for the assurance of longtime security and freedom profitably to make one's best endeavour.</P>
    <P>There is no future for any branch of industry, agricultural or otherwise, in this country, which works for ever under the shadow of that tragic word &ldquo;surplus&rdquo;.  Tell any body of farmers to beware lest by increasing their production they bring disaster on themselves and you enter on that sterile spiral of diminishing returns.  Reverse the process, fix your eye upon the far horizon and say: &ldquo;Here is the opportunity to earn, not wealth but comfort,&rdquo; and every man whose industry and skill and enthusiasm are such as that of those the record of whose cows I just read out, can purchase for himself even wealth by exceptional endeavour.</P>
    <P>Think of what it would mean in this country now if we had it to tell to every farmer in Ireland: &ldquo;The word &lsquo;surplus&rsquo; has no meaning any more; double, treble and quadruple your production you can sell it all; use the byproducts for the multiplication of the pig population of this country, all of which can be profitably sold; double, treble and quadruple the number of our live stock; the more we ship the safer we make the market where profit is to be earned; treble, quadruple and double again every article the land of this country is capable of producing, and, remember, that from the soil of this country we can produce all the raw materials, without exception now, for every branch of the live-stock and live-stock products industry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was a time when that general statement had to be qualified by the recollection that the protein element for animal diet might not be adequately catered for without the importation of equatorial produce, such as oil cakes, ground nut meal or some <Col N="1535" /> commodity of that kind, but, with our capacity now to manufacture in our own silage pit, or silo, good grass silage, we have, from our own soil, a protein feed superior to anything that money can buy from any corner of the earth: with oats, barley, potatoes and grass this country can produce meat, milk, butter, fowl, eggs, pigs and bacon and, in a hungry world, a nation so equipped can command whatever it may wish or desire.</P>

      <P>All this I see in the price of milk, but, if my vision in this matter <Col N="1536" /> has exceeded the scope of order, let me most gladly say that I constrict the wide horizon of my vision <i>instanter.</i> The motion is, I understand, as interpreted by the mover, that we ought to raise the price of milk.  We can.  That is the answer, but we have got to find a market on which to sell the resulting butter, and there is no one abroad prepared to pay us a price which will enable us to raise the actual price of milk unless we are prepared to pay them to take our butter away.  But, if I might interpret the Deputy's motion as meaning that he expresses the hope that the reward of the dairy farmer for his labour will be enhanced, that I cheerfully accept and not in any vague or uncertain atmosphere, but in the atmosphere of a proposal which, given the requisite support, I think I could carry now and which would entitle me to say to every dairy farmer in Ireland: &ldquo;For five years hence in any case the sky is the limit.&rdquo;</P>

I wonder is Deputy O'Reilly still capable of dreaming dreams with me, or are his feet so firmly fixed on mother earth that he can think of nothing but the Killeshandra cow?  Perhaps he will say to me that, if he dwells unduly on the Killeshandra cow, my Utopian bovine is equally remote from average experience. If both of us came half way from Killeshandra and Utopia and met in the middle of the road, we might start together on a great adventure.  I do not so far despair of the power of words as to give up the hope that I <Col N="1537" /> shall have such an agreeable companion. I am very apprehensive that, if he will not come, we cannot go at all.  Hope springs eternal in the human breast and, in the light of that, I hope he will accompany me.</P>

      <P>I regret I had not the pleasure of hearing the Minister's entire speech, but with what I heard I am in a great measure in agreement. Everybody realises that the income of the farmer is low.  I gave a figure of £3 4s. 0d. per week as being the average income in the agricultural industry. Everybody in this House, I think, will agree that it is desirable to raise that standard.  It is desirable from every point of view, not alone from the farmers' and farm workers' viewpoint but even from the viewpoint of the overcrowded people of this city upon whose toes the rural population are tramping, because every day the best of our people are drifting into this city.</P>
      <P>This motion has not been put down from any narrow or short-term viewpoint. The fact that it was put down over 18 months ago and is still relevant to the present conditions shows that we were looking a fair distance ahead. It is fundamental in the agricultural industry that the progressive farmer should be assured of a reasonable price for his produce.  With such an assurance, the progress of the farmer can go forward from the despised Killeshandra cow to the distinguished and illustrious Nenagh cow.  The task is a fairly long and strenuous one and requires the application of skill and industry.  In addition to that, it requires a very considerable investment of capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very much impressed by the report on post-war agricultural policy issued by Dr. Henry Kennedy dealing with milk production.  He made a comparison between this country and New Zealand.  He said that, from an investigation carried out in North Cork, the yield of butter fat per acre in that district was 40 lbs.  The average yield found as a result of a similar investigation in New Zealand was 105 lbs. The average butter fat produced by one cow here in Ireland, according to this investigation, was 160 lbs.  The average output of butter fat in New <Col N="1538" /> Zealand per cow was 227 lbs.  He also showed that the average amount of butter fat per unit of workers engaged in the industry was 1,000 lbs. in North Cork and 4,560 lbs. in New Zealand. He acknowledged that New Zealand farmers enjoyed some slight climatic advantages, but he felt that the gap between output here and in New Zealand was far too wide.</P>
    <P>The question that we have to face, if we are dealing with this matter in a long-term way, is how we are to raise the output per cow, the output per acre and the output per unit of workers employed here.  I believe that one of the first essentials is to create confidence in the industry by an assurance of a decent reward and a definite assurance to the farmer that he shall have behind him the sympathy and support of his own agricultural Department, that no hindrance will be put on him because he has increased his output or because external markets have militated against prices.  That is the first essential, and that is the essential outlined in this motion.</P>
    <P>There are other things which are equally important.  It is important that the quality and capacity of our dairy cows should be stepped up.  There are two ways of achieving an improvement in the milk-yielding capacity of our cows.</P>
    <P>One is to go in exclusively for milk producing breeds and for the heavy milk yielding strains.  I suppose that is really the quickest way to get a high yield.  But I think that, taking the long term view, that may not be the wisest course.  In our economy we have to depend upon the store cattle and beef trade as well as on our dairy produce.  I cannot speak, perhaps, with quite the same authority as some Deputies, but I believe that with concentration upon the task we could raise the milk producing capacity of the dairy shorthorn cow to an economic level.  In that way we would have a breed producing a high average milk yield while at the same time providing for the store and fat cattle trade. From the outset I have acknowledged that that particular line of policy would not be as capable of such rapid development as would be the exclusive development of purely milking breeds. <Col N="1539" /> It is a line of policy that will require close application and attention over a period of years.  I was somewhat depressed some time ago when a very progressive farmer said that he had been testing his cows for 30 years, that he had started with a good herd, that he still had a fairly good herd but that it was no better to-day than when he started.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why cow testing has not proved successful, apart from the fact that it has not been universally adopted, is because the elimination of inferior cows is slow.  The farmer who goes in for cow testing and who wants to make his cow testing a success gets rid of his low-yielding cows.  How does he do it?  He goes to the market or the fair and passes them on to some other farmer.  That farmer has to take a chance over a year of cow testing before he can find out whether he has been sold a dud.  We have, too, the difficulty that accurate recordings of the progeny of high-yielding cows are not kept.  We have the example of the heavy-yielding cow who produces 600 or 700 gallons in the year.  All those factors militate against an improvement in our dairy shorthorn cows.  If we are to succeed in eliminating the low-yielding cow and if we are to succeed in stepping up the milk producing capacity of our cows we must see that honest and accurate records are kept, not only of the cows but also of their progeny.  The whole thing must be done in a business-like way from one end of the country to the other.  That is the first essential.  It may take some time to achieve our object, but it can be achieved.  Next to improving our breed of cows we must improve the quality of our land.</P>
    <P>I heard an expert&mdash;I think he was an expert of the Department of Agriculture&mdash;state recently that 80 per cent. of our agricultural land is deficient in fertilisers.  That proportion of our land is impoverished.  It is incapable of producing either the grass or the crops it should produce.  There, again, is a wide field for improvement and expansion. These two objectives, combined with a reasonable improvement in byres, housing, equipment, and so on, on our dairy farms, are the three <Col N="1540" /> essentials to increasing output in the dairying industry.  Will anyone suggest to me that those three vital improvements can be carried out without a fairly considerable capital investment in this industry?</P>
    <P>It is very easy to laugh at the low-yielding cows in some creamery areas. I know there are areas where the yield per cow is low.  That is due to the fact that over a long period of years our live-stock policy has been an injudicious one.  We have not got the best type of milking stock.  It is due also to the fact that our land is impoverished and that agricultural policy generally over a long period of years has tended to rob the soil of its fertility.  We can remedy these two great evils of infertile soil and low-yielding dairy stock if we set ourselves to the task in a business-like way.</P>
    <P>Over a long period of years the Department of Agriculture has been responsible in the main for the unproductive breeds of dairy cows that we have to-day.  Those of us who remember 25 and 30 years ago know that there were in the country then better dairy cows than there are to-day.  They may not have had the beautiful lines of conformation, as Department of Agriculture officials call it.  They may not have been so handsome, but they certainly did produce milk.  With the introduction of the beef shorthorn we have improved the quality of our store cattle to some extent, but we have not improved the milk-yielding capacity. We must try to remedy that state of affairs.  We must try to maintain the store qualities of our shorthorns while at the same time stepping-up our milk production.  That will require accurate registration and accurate recording of every shorthorn cow in the country.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is prepared to assure the House that he accepts the point of view I have expressed and that he realises the necessity for an increased capitalisation of agriculture he will go a long way to meet our demands.  The task is a heavy one requiring both application and efficiency, plus cooperation on the part of the farmers generally to improve the milk-yielding quality of our cows without destroying the store and beef trade.  But it can be done.  It should be done.  I think <Col N="1541" /> a united effort on the part of all concerned will achieve it.  I was glad to hear the Minister say that we can eliminate as far as the future is concerned the problem of a &ldquo;surplus&rdquo; in agriculture.  There is no greater bugbear to the farmer than the argument that intensification of production by means of improved methods will result in his finding himself with a product that he cannot sell.  I should like if the Minister would convey that message about the elimination of &ldquo;surplus&rdquo; to those who are engaged in supplying milk to this city.  They know occasionally the meaning of that word and they know it to their intense dissatisfaction.</P>
    <P>I have outlined briefly what ought to be done.  Money has got to be put into this industry&mdash;not given as a dole or a sop but invested in it&mdash;and if that is done I am satisfied that the return will be adequate.  As far as the supplying of milk to the city is concerned, there is a grievance in regard to the month of April.  It has been mentioned in this House before.  For some reason the Minister has included the month of April amongst the summer months.  I do not know why he has done so but it has been a grievance for the past couple of years.  I hope that that will be remedied and if it is remedied by giving the milk producer the same price in April as in March I think that it will be appreciated.  I feel that that concession can be made without raising the price of milk to the consumers in Dublin.  There is still a very wide margin between the price the farmer gets for his milk and the price charged to the consumer in the city.</P>
    <P>I hope, therefore, that the Minister will accept this motion as courteously and as graciously as he accepted the motion which was before this House in regard to the price of pigs.  I think we are going in the right direction if we establish confidence in the dairying industry and if we give the people engaged in that industry a feeling that they are not going to be let down or betrayed.  They, on their part, will put their best energies into the industry <Col N="1542" /> and I am sure that after a time costs of production, owing to the increase in output, will be lowered so that eventually it will be possible to give the people cheaper milk in the cities and that, in turn, will have a beneficial effect so far as the butter supply position is concerned.</P>
    <P>The raising of the consumption level of milk in all our towns and villages and in our cities also is a matter to which the Minister should give his earnest attention.  We want to see milk not only produced under the best possible conditions, but sold under the best possible conditions, and we ought to encourage people to drink milk instead of stout.  I think we can do that if we assure them that all through, both in its production stages and in its sale, milk is provided under the best possible conditions.</P>

      <P>This motion will, I am sure, be received with goodwill and benediction by Deputies on all sides of the House.  I have no doubt that Deputy Cogan's colleagues of the Farmers' Party will give full support, just as the other Deputies of the House, to this motion.  This matter as to whether the farmers were getting a fair price for their production or not, an economic return, has been a burning question before Dáil Éireann for many years, and I am sure Dáil Éireann will agree that the farmer producer of milk, butter and such other commodities is entitled to his costs of production plus a reasonable profit.  I doubt if it will be challenged or if it can be challenged by anyone that he is not getting that at present.  The last time the price of milk was fixed&mdash;whether milk being supplied to creameries or milk being sold as liquid milk in the towns&mdash;was by the Minister's predecessor in the spring of 1947.  Subsequent to that, those who are now the Minister's colleagues and who are sitting behind him moved a motion in this House protesting against the inadequate price that the then Minister for Agriculture allowed for milk&mdash;both milk supplied to creameries and milk sold for liquid consumption in the towns.  Many things have changed since that time. The farmers' costs of production have not been reduced.  They have gone up <Col N="1543" /> very considerably and very substantially in the past two years since milk prices were last fixed.</P>
      <P>I understand that to-night the Minister for Agriculture raised a question of doubt as to whether the present price can be maintained or not.  I am sure it was a bombshell to many Deputies to hear that there was any suggestion that the present prices should not be maintained and should not be increased.  That information would be received as an absolute bombshell in the country.  Surely the Minister was not serious in making the suggestion that the price of milk should be decreased to the producer? It just cannot happen.  The farmer has had to meet many other increases&mdash; wages, both central and local taxation, and an increase in the cost of his machinery.  The costs of production in creameries have gone up also and their interests must also be taken into consideration.  There is the question of fuels of all kinds and, in addition, creameries have had to face increases in wages.  It is important that these matters be considered because if prices have gone up to the creameries in the matter of fuel, oil, petrol, coal, salt, boxwood, labour costs, increased machinery costs and so on, the costs of production to creameries must be higher to-day than they were two years ago.  The farmer, therefore, must be getting less in some way from the creameries than he was getting two years ago.  There is no doubt about that.</P>
      <P>Another very important class not mentioned in this motion but it is a class which, I am sure, Deputy O'Reilly and Deputy Cogan, who introduced the motion, will agree is part of the dairying industry, are the producers of farmers' butter.</P>

They are an important section of the community and they are being badly treated whether they live in Wexford, Cavan, the Midlands, the West or any other part of Ireland.  No matter where they may live they are being very badly treated by this present Administration and by our present Minister for Agriculture.  He has not given them a moment's thought.  They are out in the wilderness but other dairying sections who send their milk to creameries get a subsidy.  The home producer of butter has been left out in the cold.  I hope he will be considered when this motion comes before the Minister for consideration.</P>

      <P>In concluding this debate, I have very little to reply to, apart from figments of the imagination of certain Deputies.  Let me preface my remarks by saying: &ldquo;Truth may be blamed but it cannot be shamed.&rdquo;  It may be ridiculed but it cannot be shamed.  In introducing this motion, I took care to assemble the facts as far as it was possible for me to do so.  I traced them from the period when milk prices to creameries were fixed in the spring of 1947.  I traced the increased milk yields as a result of favourable weather.  I even traced the increased value of the dropped calf so that I did not put any figure before the House over which I could not stand.  Furthermore, I did not put figures of my own before the House.  I put the figures of others, for and against the proposal to increase the price of milk.  If any of these figures are wrong, nobody has challenged them so I think the House may take it that they are unchallengeable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps it is as well for me to deal with the matters raised by the Minister <Col N="1545" /> first.  The Minister more or less ridiculed the Killeshandra cow.  Again let me say truth cannot be shamed. These are figures that can be discovered in the accounts of that cooperative society.  I think I would not be wrong in saying that the Minister has these figures in his Department so that, if they are wrong, there is a chance to correct them.  That is a true picture of the average yield not alone of the cows in Cavan but of the cows in Leinster, Connaught and Ulster, for the milk supply, as I mentioned, is drawn from the three counties of Longford, Leitrim and Cavan. Of course the law of averages governs everything.  Why should it not also govern the price which the farmer realises on whatever line of work he takes up on his farm?  The Minister has given us the figure of the cow testing association at Nenagh where the average cash return for the past year has been anywhere from £52 per cow to £65.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>We will accept it as that.  However, can the Minister put up the average for cows supplying other creameries throughout the country and compare it with the figures I have put up for the creamery about which I am in a position to ascertain the figures?  It would be interesting if he did so.  It would give us some basis to work on, rather than telling us what is possible of achievement in the matter of an increased yield from cows in the years to come.  That is a policy of &ldquo;live horse and you will get grass.&rdquo;  Do we adopt that policy with other sections of the community?  I am quite prepared to admit that the average yield per cow in 1949 of 265 gallons of milk supplied to the creamery plus my estimate of 25 per cent. more retained at home&mdash;it is only an estimate because I have no chance of finding out definitely what amount is used at home&mdash;which would bring the total yield up to 331 gallons per cow, is a low average.  I am quite sure that the average was not so low 20 or 25 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had an early and active association with cow-testing so far back as the <Col N="1546" /> year 1924.  The average on the farm on which I was born and reared was then well over 500 gallons, from a stock of cows that had been on the farm and which had been bred off from the year 1899.  I retained that stock when I got control of the farm and continued breeding from them.</P>
    <P>What was the result?  One by one I had to let them go because they were no use.  What brought that about? The bulls licensed by the Department of Agriculture under the Live Stock Breeding Act of 1925.  There was a good stock of milking cows to begin with but the yield of each generation was falling off until, in the case of some of them, I am quite sure it was lower than 200 gallons.  I made an effort to make use of the dairy bull in the district.  At great inconvenience I travelled six or seven miles with the cows even in the busy period of the year, summer and harvest, and what did I get?  The bull calves bred off these bulls I had to sell at £3 each less at a year old than if I had bred them off the non-pedigree bull in the same townland in which I lived.  I got one heifer calf and what was the yield from her?  Two hundred and twelve gallons in the first year as a heifer and 225 gallons on her second year as a milking cow although her dam had registered in over 600 gallons. Can we say then that cow-testing of itself is ever going to bring us into a strain of high-yielding cows?  I do not say that cow-testing is useless by any means but it affords no guarantee that there will be an all-round increase in yield.  Unless we get proven dairy bulls to breed from I claim that the Live Stock Breeding Act of 1925 has virtually ruined the dairy shorthorn cow for milk production.  It has resulted in the production of better stores but it has taken much more away in the milking qualities of the cows than it has put into the store cattle.</P>
    <P>The farmers supplying milk to the Killeshandra creamery do not want, as the Minister for Justice said, everything handed to them on a plate.  They realised the low milk yield of the cows in the area and they made an effort to improve it.  I was deputed to approach <Col N="1547" /> the Minister for Agriculture in 1948 to ask him to locate a proven dairy bull in the area and to establish an artificial insemination centre, so that as many as possible could avail of the services of that bull with a view to improving the milk yield of the cows in the years to come.  That, I think, showed that the farmers in the district were anxious to improve the position.</P>
    <P>They hope that that may be done yet.  Furthermore, realising the poverty of the land and the miserable grass available as a result of the impoverishment of the land, due to its cultivation during the emergency without a sufficiency of farmyard manure and practically no artificial manure, the creamery society gave out on credit almost 1,000 tons of North African phosphate for putting on the grass lands in an effort to increase the milk yield.  It did increase it.  The average milk yield for 1949 was, I think, 30 gallons per cow higher than in 1948, so that I do not think anyone can cast any reflections on the farmers of that area. It is as good a demonstration of an effort at self-help as it is possible for any district in Ireland to give to-day.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice made some remarks to which I think I should reply.  He dealt with my quotation of the figures of the cost of producing milk on the farm attached to Grangegorman Mental Hospital and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I notice the Deputy did not give the reference to the Dáil Reports from which he was quoting when he said the Minister for Health told us what Grangegorman had to pay for the production of milk.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reason I did not give the reference was my belief that it was so fresh in the minds of everyone that nobody needed to be reminded of it, but I will give it now.  The first question was put to the Minister for Health on 21st February at column 323 of Volume 119 (3).  There was a further question put to the Minister for Health on 28th February asking for items of costing and it is to be found at column 799. There is no secret behind it&mdash;anyone can investigate and find out if the figures are correct.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1548" /> My reason for quoting that figure at all was my desire to make the point that the present price of milk, as well as the prices of other agricultural produce, does not enable the farmer to get a labourer's wage for his work.  That was the only definite figure I had and I made use of it.  I expect that the farm attached to that hospital is not uneconomic in size.  It is not run by inefficient farmers or lazy farmers, or any farmers to which the epithets we have heard in the recent past can be applied.  I expect it is run by hired labour and there is a chance that there may be a good deal of free labour from amongst the patients.  It is labour which, I expect, is working under trade union conditions and it is evident that it cost 3/1 a gallon to produce the milk under trade union conditions and an estimated 2/10½ in 1949.</P>
    <P>I do not want to reduce the conditions of employment of anyone, but I would like to raise the standard of the farmer and his unpaid family labour at least to the level of the agricultural worker.  It is not a very high ambition and is not an extravagant ideal. It is obvious that on the present price of milk that is not possible, but even the Grangegorman institution is not an isolated case.  We saw in the past year another farm of between 300 and 400 acres being worked entirely by hired labour, and the loss on the working of that farm in 1948 was £1,371.  I do not want to make any statement without substantiating it.  That was the farm at Lloyd, belonging to the urban council at Kells, and that was the report of the county manager in April of last year.  The figures can be checked up in the local papers of 12th April.</P>
    <P>As it is worded, the motion means that, on present prices, the farmer has not got the cost of production, but the question will arise of what is the cost of production.  If I give a figure, it will be ridiculed, but we have the figures under trade union labour.  I am not competent to say whether there was efficient production by that trade union labour or not, nor do I propose to examine it, but it brings us to the point at which we must regret greatly the fact that we have no authoritative <Col N="1549" /> statement as to the cost of production. If the motion put forward by Deputy Cogan and myself last year, which asked for the setting up of a number of farms in each county to ascertain the cost of production, had been accepted, we would now have it; but I maintain that the present price is not the cost of production, and I appeal to the Minister to set about increasing that price and to do so to such an extent as will give the farmer something approaching a labourer's wage.</P>
