      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he is aware that in 1948 the Ministers for Local Government and Health approved revised salary scales for certain grades of officials employed by local authorities and, in addition, sanctioned the payment of a 7½ per cent. bonus under the Temporary Allowances Order, 1948; that some analogous grades such as assistance officers, whose conditions of employment are governed by his sanction, have not been paid this increase; <Col N="1421" /> and, if so, whether he will remove this inequity by sanctioning the payment of a 7½ per cent. bonus to these officials, with effect from November, 1948, and also allow such officers compensation for the loss of house, fuel and light allowances and fees retrospectively to 1946.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy's question refers to the position of assistance officers in the Dublin Board of Assistance.  The position there is that the officers had their salaries revised with effect from the 1st November, 1946, at the time of the general revision of the salaries of officers of local authorities.  A revised salary scale of £300 by £10 increments to £400 a year was given to the small number of permanent officers then employed, a deduction of £40 a year being made in two cases where officers were supplied with house, fuel and light.  The unestablished officers, who outnumbered the permanent officers, were given a fixed salary of £325 a year.  In both cases, fees for extra assistance work were paid at amounts varying between £8 and £26 a year.</P>
      <P>In December, 1948, I approved a revised inclusive salary scale of £300 by £15 to £450 a year for these officers, to operate with effect from the 1st June, 1948, with the same deduction of £40 for living accommodation in two cases.  In addition, I approved of the permanent appointment of the unestablished officers retrospectively to October, 1943, and agreed that their salaries should be increased to the correct point on the salary scale.  Later, I approved of a proposal to give those officers credit for previous temporary service in determining higher points of entry on the salary scale.  A few other officers, who are temporarily employed as substitutes, have been allowed increments on the salary scale for each completed year of their service, instead of remaining on a fixed salary.</P>
      <P>The Dublin assistance officers have gained substantially more than 7½ per cent. increase on their 1947 salaries and they have the added advantage that the increase is a permanent and pensionable one.</P>

      <P>The restrictions on emigration to employment which were in operation during the period of the recent emergency have not been completely removed.  So far as they applied to women and girls, restrictions ceased to have effect on the 1st July, 1946, but they continue to operate in the case of men and boys. I should perhaps mention that persons of either sex who are under 21 years of age are required to produce the written consent of their parents or guardians in support of applications for travel documents.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission as the competent authority allotted a parcel of land to Mr. Patrick J.

      <P>This is the second week in succession that I have raised this matter.  I have raised it this week in response to an invitation by the Minister, which is to be found in the Official Report, column 1113, where the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I invite the Deputy to put down a separate question on this subject.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was as a result of your ruling.  I now find myself in the same position as Deputy Madden, that I have not got the information required.  Would <Col N="1426" /> the Minister state what factors influenced the Land Commission to give additional land to Mr. Patrick J. O'Brien, who had got a holding from his mother which, under the Land Commission regulations, was supposed to be economic, while uneconomic tenants, married men with seven and eight in family, were not given a holding on the Monaghan estate, Grange, Turloughmore?  Mr. O'Brien got 68 acres from his mother and he has now got 33 more and the Minister cannot say what influenced the Land Commission in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>First, let me say he did not get 33 acres, but considerably less. He got an addition, all right.  I invited the Deputy to put down a question but I did not expect this question from him&mdash;&ldquo;if he will indicate what factors influenced the Land Commission&rdquo;. The Deputy was here for a considerable time during the discussion on the Land Bill and I am sure he is not unaware of the very strong part his own Party played in making sure that certain functions were given to the commissioners and the commissioners alone.</P>

      <P>Deliveries of milk to creameries during the first four months of the year in 1947, 1948, 1949 and 1950 respectively, were 9,897,000 gallons, 10,871,000, 15,581,000 and 20,023,000 gallons.  This indicates that butter production in the coming season will be sufficient to meet the requirements of the home market; and leave a substantial surplus.  At the present prices for milk, every cwt. of butter produced involves a payment by the Exchequer of approximately £4 by way of subsidy. This makes the cost of butter so high that it cannot compete in foreign markets with butter offered by other countries, and so precludes the possibility of marketing an exportable surplus unless at a heavy loss.  The Deputy will realise that these conditions are not propitious for expanding the creamery industry, but markets for cheese, cream, chocolate crumb, evaporated milk and other alternative milk products are being cultivated with a view to mitigating the difficulties arising from the present price structure.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is a decline in the market for farmers' butter?  Is he further aware that there are many areas which are not served by a creamery industry? Can the Minister indicate what steps his Department proposes to take to give these farmers an alternative method of disposing of their butter?</P>

      <P>I would be much obliged to the Deputy if he would give me some suggestion as to what he thinks could profitably be done to get a market for farmers' butter.  I have tried on occasion to warn the House and the country of the growing difficulty of getting any market at all for farmers' <Col N="1431" /> butter and I am bound to inform the House now that, stringent as these difficulties were last year, they have every appearance of being infinitely greater in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the whole of north Clare and south Galway has been provided with creamery facilities.  A survey of the whole of County Wexford has been made with a view to establishing a satisfactory network of creameries in that county.  In any area where there is the slightest prospect of a milk supply developing sufficient to maintain either a separating station or a creamery the Dairy Disposals Board is both willing and anxious to survey any such area with a view to providing facilities; but all such developments have to be contemplated in the light of the major problem to which I referred in the first part of my reply.</P>

      <Col N="1435" /> As regards the figures for 1949, pending completion of pay adjustments consequent on the Civil Service Pay Agreement of 22nd October, 1948, it was not practicable to take the 1949 census at the normal time. As the adjustments took a considerable time it was eventually decided to take the 1949 and 1950 censuses simultaneously. Analysis of the censuses has not yet been completed.  Accordingly, the figures of numbers and costs for 1949 are incomplete, and the figures for both years are provisional and subject to adjustment when final figures are available.</P>
    <P>The figures do not include numbers and costs of (a) persons employed on relief schemes, (b) persons employed on a fee basis, and (c) artisans, labourers, etc., employed on schemes or works of a temporary nature (other <Col N="1436" /> than relief schemes) who are not regarded as civil servants.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the reply, would the Parliamentary Secretary consider reviewing any decisions already taken with regard to the erection of the Leinster Lawn memorial so that the memory of all those who gave their lives to break the connection with England may be commemorated? Will he further have regard to the fact that there are many people in the country who are not actuated by a desire to perpetuate bitterness, as is the Party opposite, but who view this as a national matter?  For that reason, would the Parliamentary Secretary say whether it is proper that such a memorial should be erected.</P>

      <P>A provision of £2,500 was included in the Vote for Public Works and Buildings for 1948-49 for the erection of a cenotaph on Leinster Lawn.  Instructions were given on the 7th May, 1948, by the present Government to proceed with the work.  A sketch design, prepared by the principal architect to the Commissioners of Public Works, was approved by the Government on the 26th July, 1948, and the working drawings on the 2nd March, 1949.  The design is in the form of an obelisk, including portrait plaques.  The work commenced on the 23rd September, 1949, and is due for completion in August, 1950.  The cost, estimated at £20,000, will be met out of the Vote for Public Works and Buildings, and charged to revenue. Expenditure to date is approximately £6,700.  This does not include any <Col N="1441" /> charge in respect of salaries of the architectural staff of the Office of Public Works, who prepared the design, working drawings and specifications. It is not the practice to apportion such charges against the individual works undertaken.</P>

It is hoped that the provision of this accommodation will remove any cause for complaint by tourists.

      <P>The State does not hold a financial interest in the Galway Bay Steamboat Company.  This company receives a subsidy in respect of services which it provides between Galway and the Aran Islands under an annual agreement with the Ministers for Finance and Industry and Commerce. The vessel used on the service was originally purchased by means of a loan from the Congested Districts Board.  Following the waiving of the sums outstanding on the loan, agreements were made with the company under the Aran Islands (Transport) Acts, 1936 and 1946, which provide that in the event of the company ceasing to use the <i>Dun Aengus</i> for the Aran service, or on the termination of an existing agreement, whichever is the earlier, the company shall transfer the vessel to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in good order and repair. Now that the main rail and road transport system is being entrusted to a State-sponsored board it would, in my view, be more appropriate if the steamer service for the Aran Islands were undertaken by Córas Iompair Éireann.  Discussions are proceeding with a view to the future operation of the Aran service by the new board.</P>

      <P>From information received by the Consultative Cancer Council in the course of its investigations the quantity of radium element available in the country is 1450.7 milligrams.  It is difficult to give an accurate estimate of the present value of this radium as it is held in different forms, and has been acquired over a period of years.  It would probably cost at current prices about £13,050 to purchase the quantity mentioned.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to state the amount and value of radium used in each of the last five calendar years. Radium element, however, does not deteriorate appreciably in use.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>Much discussion has taken place here on this Estimate in connection with the congestion problem. No doubt it is understandable why so much attention should be paid to that grave problem.  I think everybody who has any experience at all of it must come to the conclusion that it is a very difficult problem to solve. The Minister seems to be rather optimistic as to the possibility of solving it over the next ten years, but whether he has any material at his disposal to justify that optimism is another matter.  We have been told that there are about 23,000 congests in County Mayo alone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know from the Minister whether that is correct.  If it is not correct, how far <Col N="1454" /> is it from being correct?  In my humble estimation, having regard to the amount of land available for acquisition and division in the country, it would take nearly the whole amount of it to solve the problem in Mayo alone, and if there is any attention to be paid to the requirements of other counties, in which congestion also exists, it is hard to know where the land is to be got, unless, of course, the Minister makes use of his new machinery to go into the open market and bid for land against would-be private purchasers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would allow me, I was just going to point out a certain danger which I see in that.  I know, of course, that this has been debated well enough already, and I do not propose to elaborate on it; but, if the Minister does that, if he goes into the open market to purchase land for the purpose of solving the problem of congestion, it could transpire that his agents would be bidding against private bidders, people who have made money out of land in the ordinary way themselves, and would naturally want to invest the money in land, and it may be in the long run that such a practice would not have a very good effect.</P>
      <P>It usually is the ambition of the holder of a medium-sized farm to make some money for the members of his family whose inclinations are towards settling on the land.  Only one member of the family can get the home farm, and it is the ambition of the father of a family in these cases to purchase land for the second member of the family.  If such a person finds himself up against the agent of the Land Commission, it is possible that he will not be able to purchase land at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>And so the custom, to which I have referred and which has been in operation here for a number of years, will be upset.  I am just posing <Col N="1455" /> that side of the question to the Minister and to the House.  Before I go away from it, I would say that a great deal of caution should be exercised in regard to that particular matter.</P>
      <P>The record of the Land Commission for the past year has not been a very encouraging one.  As has been pointed out here, the amount of land divided does not exceed by very much the average figure for the war years.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins can speak after me if he wants to.  I am putting some points to the Minister which I consider should be put to him. As I have said, there is congestion in my county, and the extraordinary thing about it is that certain landholders there have offered their land to the Land Commission, and I find that the <Col N="1456" /> Land Commission are very slow in taking it, and for what reason I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>They might not take it at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>If they do not want to take it at all, we would like to know what is the policy of the Land Commission so far as those people are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not their policy to take everything that is thrown at them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I say there are landholders there willing to give their land to the Land Commission&mdash;and in some cases sizeable holdings&mdash;for an exchange in one of the eastern counties. Not alone is it, in my opinion, wrong to refuse to consider these cases, but it has a bad effect in another way which I propose to point out to the Minister.  There are certain small landholders on the fringe of the Gaeltacht who have made applications for housing grants, and these applications have been held over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the Land Commission point out that a rearrangement scheme is being prepared, that certain holdings are to be vacated and in some of these cases the landowners have offered their holdings to the Land Commission for an exchange of holdings in other parts of the country.  The building of houses in these parts is held up because of this.  I would like to know from the Minister when it is proposed to give a decision in these cases, so that people who want to build houses in a locality where a rearrangement scheme is under consideration will know when their applications for new houses will be considered, or if they will be considered at all.  I think it is wrong to prevent people from building new houses in these localities, where they need them badly.  It should be very easy for the members of the Land Commission to make up their minds as to who would be likely to be migrated from such places and who would be likely to be left at home.  I would ask the Minister <Col N="1457" /> to bear that matter in mind.  I have written to the Land Commission myself about it, but so far nothing has been done.</P>
      <P>It is very important that if people who reside within a reasonable distance of a congested district, like, say, the Gaeltacht, offer their holdings to the Land Commission in exchange for other holdings in another part of the country, their offer should be very sympathetically considered by the Land Commission.  It is easier, indeed much easier, to take land when you get it like that, than to try to acquire it compulsorily.</P>
      <P>Another point which I would like to bring to the Minister's notice is the repair of embankments.  The repair of embankments is a very important matter in my constituency. I know very well of course that the Minister will tell me as he has told us in the past that the Land Commission have no responsibility for the repair or upkeep of embankments, but even though in the strict sense they have no responsibility, still my opinion is that it is their duty to make sure that the land of the country is not allowed to deteriorate because of flooding caused by breaches in river or sea embankments. As the Minister knows, when breaches occur in the first instance it is comparatively easy to repair them, but when they are left there to get wider and wider over months, and sometimes over a couple of years, their repair presents an engineering problem and a problem of increased expenditure.  I think it would be a good thing if Land Commission inspectors down the country were instructed to make a survey with a view to having a scheme carried out to repair breaches everywhere they exist. This is a problem which has not got the proper attention of the Land Commission so far.  I know of course that a certain amount has been done. Repairs have been carried out by the Land Commission here and there, but only in a very restricted way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing that affects my county is the division of turbary.  There is a lot of turbary to be divided in my constituency still and I do not know what measures are being taken by the <Col N="1458" /> Land Commission to divide it.  It is an extraordinary thing that there are places down there where even small farmers have not turbary, not to mind cottiers and other people, while broad acres of turbary lie idle waiting to be acquired and divided by the Land Commission. That is a job which should engage the serious attention of the Minister and the Land Commission.  It is very important that the people should be provided with fuel, especially when it abounds so plentifully in those regions of which I speak, and very little has been done in that direction during the past few years.  Earlier on, I must say, the Land Commission did divide a good deal of turbary but a lot still remains.  Of course I need hardly remind the House that apart entirely from providing the people with fuel the division and development of turbary provide a great deal of employment which is very badly needed indeed at the present time in these parts of which I speak.  I would therefore urge upon the Ministry the importance of acquiring and dividing turbary.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given an undertaking to the House that under the new Bill he will be able to go ahead with tackling the problem of congestion at a much more rapid pace than hitherto. I would urge upon him the necessity of turning the Land Commission's attention towards the problem in Kerry and making sure that the offers of land, to which I have already referred, by people who live adjacent to the congested areas will be considered sympathetically. It is, as I have said, difficult to understand why the Land Commission are so slow in considering these offers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather a strange thing that after almost 30 years of native Government this House should still be debating the acquisition and division of land and it seems stranger still that members of the Party opposite should think that the present Government or the present Minister for Lands should within two years settle the whole problem whereas they themselves had 16 years in which to do it and after that period it was found to be as big a problem as when native Government was set up.  When the <Col N="1459" /> present Government took office inspectors from the Land Commission went here and there through the country surveying certain lands and it looked as if Fianna Fáil clubs had given the names of certain landowners whose land they wished to divide unknown entirely to the people concerned.  After all, it is a strange thing that anybody should endeavour to acquire land from a person who is not anxious to give it to the Land Commission or to anybody else.  In all these cases it has been shown, I think, that there is too much greed to acquire land.  I could never agree with a policy that would take land from any individual even to relieve congestion, provided of course that he is making proper use of it, or rather making use of it to the best of his ability because it is not always possible for landowners, perhaps because of want of proper help, to make the best use of their land to the benefit not only of themselves but of the community generally.  Allowances must always be made and it would be entirely wrong of the Land Commission to step in and take over lands indiscriminately.  We have always seen that in cases where land is offered in a congested area, there is such a scramble for the piece of land available and so many applicants for it that it gives rise to a great deal of local dissension and dispute, with the result that very often the Land Commission, in their wisdom, refuse to acquire that land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I personally am not so much concerned with the acquisition or division of land as with the Gaeltacht Services Vote.  We continually hear that everything should be done for the welfare of those living in the Gaeltacht in order to induce them to stay in these Gaeltacht areas where Irish is the spoken language of the people, and yet I must confess that, in that portion of my constituency which comprises the Gaeltacht, practically nothing at all has been done all down the years by any Government to improve the conditions of the people there.  When recently in Donegal, I noticed that some very important steps had been taken to set up local industries, cottage industries, which seem to have been very successful. <Col N="1460" /> The Minister, I am sure, knows about these.  Some of the people work in their homes and some in local factories and they work in very good conditions.  Representations have repeatedly been made to the Land Commission and to the Gaeltacht Industries Department with regard to the setting up of some industries in the Iveragh district of Kerry where there is the possibility of a net-making industry, a toys and doll-making industry, and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have said about Gaeltacht services will do when the Vote comes up later on.  The matter to which Deputy Kissane referred, breaches of embankments, is one which deserves the immediate attention of the Minister.  Even though very little has been done in that respect, it is not for want of putting it before the Land Commission.  However, I must say that the present Minister has come to the rescue of the people concerned in certain areas in South Kerry, where breaches of these embankments have occurred, but there are still hundreds of acres being flooded.  If, when these breaches occurred some nine or ten years ago, they had been repaired, the work would not have cost one-twentieth of what it will cost now. There is in South Kerry the Maine valley, where the lands are amongst the richest in the country.  These lands are continually flooded because of breaches in these embankments.  I realise that, within a reasonable time, the Maine will be drained, but, pending that drainage, it is a pity that some money is not provided for the repair of these embankments which are causing this flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1461" /> With regard to the division of turbary, the Minister has done something in my area, but there are tenants who were to have a right of turbary in connection with the purchase of their lands for whom nothing has so far been done.  I am sure, however, that, with the passage of time and in view of the fact that surveys have been made, all these matters will eventually be amicably settled.  I know the Minister is doing his best and there is no grievance put before him that he does not do his best to remedy.  We must be reasonable and understand that these difficult problems cannot be settled overnight.  The Minister's Department is one of the most important in relation to the congested areas, and I hope the Minister, in his goodness and wisdom, will do everything possible to bring about such a situation as will enable the people in these districts to live in some kind of decency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>A question was raised last week with regard to expenditure in different counties and I find that, under the heading of &ldquo;Estates Improvements&rdquo;, up to March, 1949, Kerry received £28,198 and Galway £48,834.  On the basis of Galway and Kerry being analogous, so far as valuations and populations are concerned, I claim that Kerry should at least have been put on the same footing as Galway. Under the heading of &ldquo;Estates Improvements&rdquo;, we have schemes in Kerry as referred to by Deputy Palmer in relation to river embankments, division of turbary and so on.  Time and again I have raised this question of embankment works and the Minister has made it quite clear that he has no liability in regard to them.  That is correct.  It is not the responsibility of the Land Commission to repair these embankments, but can any native Government stand aside and leave these people, so to speak, at the mercy of the waves?  Large areas of valuable land are being destroyed and washed away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are informed that because of some legal technicality in the old landlord days when these lands were being purchased the responsibility was on the tenant and on trustees appointed under these Land Purchase Acts.  That is a <Col N="1462" /> very easy way out of a serious difficulty at the moment, but I suggest to the Minister that that approach is all wrong.  Even though there is no legal commitment in relation to the repair of these embankments, why does the Minister not do as the Minister for Agriculture did when he made £40,000,000 available for rehabilitation work?  Why should the Minister not approach the head of the Government and say: &ldquo;I am anxious to get finished with this business once and for all. Give me £500,000 to get finished with it.&rdquo;  Some arrangement could be made by which the people concerned, where they could do so&mdash;as they have done&mdash; would pay some percentage of the cost. If that money could be capitalised and consolidated with the land annuity so that they would pay a certain percentage of it back to the Land Commission every year it would be a good day's work for the Government and for the farmers concerned.  In my own native parish of Milltown, County Kerry, recently the farmers paid a contribution of one-fifth of the total.  I am speaking of one section of the people on the Marshall estate.  The other section, owing to their circumstances and the fact that the land had been flooded over a long period, could pay hardly anything.  The Minister has done great work for us in certain sections of that district, but the work is incomplete.  There are other important areas to be attended to and a great deal of this embankment work is unfinished.  On behalf of the people there, I would certainly appreciate it if the Minister would ask the Government to find the ways and means to meet us in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister's inspectors prevented the local people from grazing Rossbeigh Island and from removing straw from that island.  For the last 40 years it has been the practice of these tenants to utilise this white straw, as they call it, for the thatching of houses and outhouses.  They are now being prevented from taking it away because of the danger of drifting sand and of causing erosion. Except at one very restricted point, there is no erosion so far as I can see. As the Land Commission have instructed the Garda authorities to <Col N="1463" /> prevent these people from going on to that island, I would ask the Minister to examine the position to see if he could not allow these people to graze the island as they have been doing for 40 years, and at least allow a number of them to remove this straw, which is very valuable to them.</P>
    <P>I should also like to call the Minister's attention to the question of Land Commission housing work in my constituency.  Even though no blame can be attached to the present Government, and no question could be raised as to their indifference, I am anxious to raise a question with regard to a farm in the Gaeltacht district of Ballinskelligs.  Some 12 or 18 months ago I brought up the question of that farm, from which a man had been migrated.  For seven years under the last Government no houses had been provided for the people who were to get that land.  I was informed at the time that the matter would be considered.  Subsequently I was informed that the land might be given over to these men this year.  I accept the Minister's reply that the matter will be attended to this year, and I hope that it will be done.</P>

      <P>It is a place called Lehid, the Glen, Ballinskelligs.  The land was to be apportioned out between three tenants.  The dwelling-house has now become derelict, and is not worth taking over.  I am just bringing the matter to the Minister's notice.  Then there is the question of sluice gates.  In certain of these areas the farmers are prepared to pay a portion of the cost of these sluice gates so that a scheme could be worked out somewhat similar to the farm improvements scheme.  The cost of one of these sluice gates would be from £60 to £100, and I suggest that the tenants should pay one quarter of the amount and that the Land Commission should provide the remainder. It is not a question of one sluice gate, because in some areas a number of them is required.  That is why I suggest that a scheme should be formulated <Col N="1464" /> somewhat analogous to the farm improvements scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>I often think of the long struggle with which I, as a young man, was associated&mdash;the struggle of the Irish people and the strenuous and great battles that were being fought by the Irish Parliamentary Party in an alien Parliament to eliminate the greatest tyranny that ever afflicted a fair land and to give to the tenant farmers of Ireland fixity of tenure, free sale and a fair rent.  Many of those who were associated with me in that struggle have passed on.  Lately I have been asking myself the question: What is the position?  I am afraid there is something wrong about the whole thing.  One is often asked, when talking in a general way, to state something specific to substantiate and clarify the case one may be making.  I hope to do so in a minute or two.  I must certainly say that the Minister deserves to be congratulated in respect of certain remedial sections which he has recently introduced in land legislation. I did not hear any speaker in this House advert to the fact that the Minister has introduced a section in that legislation which removes a cancer which previously existed, namely, the problem of dual ownership.  I think that there are not many cases of dual ownership and that they are mostly to be found in the South of Ireland but the change which the Minister has made in our legislation in that respect is unquestionably to his credit.  Then again, under the Bill which was recently passed by this House, the owner of land which is to be acquired will receive the market value.  There has been some discussion in regard to the determination of &ldquo;market value&rdquo; but I shall not go into that aspect of the matter now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have here a letter dated 7ú Bealtaine, 1949, from the Land Commission. I am afraid I shall have to say some <Col N="1465" /> pretty hard things but my remarks will not apply to the general staff of the Land Commission.  I am happy to be able to say that I have found the officials in all the Departments of State most helpful, most co-operative and most sympathetic in every conceivable way.  Here, I am going to attack the hierarchy of the Irish Land Commission and, before I have finished speaking, I shall be able to establish my charge.  The letter begins as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am desired to refer to your offer to sell an area of 164 acres of your registered holding in the townland of Garryduff, the subject of folio 14936, County Limerick,...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Just imagine 164 acres of reasonably good land being sold to the Irish Land Commission for the munificent offer&mdash; which was increased afterwards as a result of considerable and consistent pressure&mdash;of £320, less the cost of redemption.  Can you imagine giving 164 acres of reasonably good land in the County of Limerick for £320, which sum, after the deduction of legal fees, would be reduced to £240?  What a generous, munificent, Christian offer to a man with seven children&mdash;£240 for 164 acres.  Is it not a good thing that we have lived to see the day that a Minister has remedied that catastrophic economic state of affairs?</P>
    <P>With regard to fixity of tenure, I may say that I agree with Deputy Palmer's remarks in that there is a feeling of insecurity and timidity amongst the farming community at the moment. They have been visited over the past two years by inspectors from the Department.  These, in turn, have gone to prospective allottees and others in the area and told them that very soon they expected that the lands of Mr. A. or Mr. X. or Mr. Y. would, or may be acquired for subdivision and that new people, in turn, would get portion of it. The prospective allottees in my area&mdash; not far from where I live&mdash;came to me in some cases singly, in some cases in groups, and told me about the position and asked me if I would use my good offices with the Land Commission in connection with the division of these lands.  Can you fancy fixity of tenure? How many times have I heard the present Minister and others in this <Col N="1466" /> House, and on public platforms, give an assurance that no farmer would be interfered with in his land so long as he farmed his holding satisfactorily&mdash; so long as he gave employment and gave evidence of working his land primarily for the benefit of himself and his family and, after that, for the general good of the community.</P>
    <P>I know some farmers who come in that category.  I brought them to the Minister.  Not long ago, I brought a young man, about 30 years of age, married, with a rising young family of four or five.  He had knocked down an old thatched house and built instead a two-storey, five or six-roomed house, taking advantage of the Acts.  He was a modern, energetic, industrious, progressive young farmer, milking about 40 cows and with five men regularly employed.  He had an outside farm which was bought by his great-great-grandfather. Inspectors from the Department, like locusts of India, were on the trail of that farm, to seize it. The Minister is listening to me now. I am not exaggerating, but am repeating here and now a statement that I made in his presence with the individual concerned.  That is No. 1.</P>
    <P>I had Nos. 1, 2 and 3.  I think we have succeeded in two of the cases, after a long, not embittered, but argumentative struggle with the Land Commission.  The first case I mentioned has yet to be determined by the Land Commission.  I ask the Minister to-day where is fixity of tenure now.  Where is fixity of tenure, when a young man builds a house, succeeds to his great-grandfather's outside farm, gives regular and continuous employment and is being threatened?  He has been in and out to me every other week and I brought him to Dublin.  I want to relate that, now, to the case about which I put a question to-day.  Because I would have been out of order then, I have to use the less restricted atmosphere of this debate to talk on it.  It is not far from these cases that I have mentioned, without giving names, cases that must be clearly before the mind of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The question to-day was about an estate near my town where a lady <Col N="1467" /> owns 300 acres.  She gave little or no employment ever, except to a herdsman, and he was dismissed in about a week, without sympathy or consideration, and he in turn had to come to me to look for home help.  For a quarter of a century these lands have been set on the 11 months' system.  I can testify to that, as I know it for 25 years.  The Land Commission held an inquiry, and an inspection was made of those lands.  Having satisfied themselves, they decided that they would acquire 140 acres for subdivision, to be given in part to those uneconomic and other holders who had been taking grazing for the last 20, 25 or 30 years.  This lady took it to the courts.  I have here a cutting from the Dublin <i>Evening Herald</i> of the 2nd March, 1950.  The portion in leaded type reports that the chairman of the Land Commission tribunal stated he would</P>
    <P>&ldquo;adjourn the proposed acquisition for two years in order to give the owners a chance to rehabilitate themselves.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What has the lady done since?  She has been setting the grass at 17/6 per beast per month, and the money had to be paid to her before they were allowed to go inside the gate.  I have with me documentary evidence about that, drafted by myself and signed by some of the people who paid this lady for the grazing since this decision was made by the Land Commission.  Some of these people were with me late last evening.  I asked them if they were prepared to sign the documents, as I knew nothing about it.  A Captain X and others in turn signed.  I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;You know what you are signing; the Minister may ask me to produce this evidence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We will bring you 20 more who must pay 17/6 for a cow or two-year-old&mdash;under two-year-old it is 16/&mdash; each month and every month.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The grazing is being set for this year and the money collected, and the recipient of the money is bound for Switzerland, to enjoy the benefits of <Col N="1468" /> that bracing air, while the local rustics slave to pay 17/6 per beast to give her plenty of money to enjoy herself.</P>
    <P>I have given two specific cases, of three farmers who are working their land properly and of this lady, where there is no analogy.  I draw this to the attention of the Minister.  I exculpate from all blame the general staff of the Land Commission.  I think the higher staffs should be cleared out, in the hierarchy of the Land Commission, which is exemplified in this action.  I trust the Minister will take serious cognisance of the fact that some of his officials in various parts of the country are irritating and tantalising progressive farmers in this sickening and disgusting way by preferential treatment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my dissatisfaction at the meagre amount of money being provided by the Minister for the working of the Department of Lands, and to compare what he proposes to do now as Minister with what he stated should have been provided, when he was sitting on this side of the House.  The Minister used to state that the land problem, particularly in relation to the relief of congestion in the West of Ireland, was one of the most important problems that this Parliament had to solve.  He used to suggest that a great deal more money should be provided by the Oireachtas for the Department of which he is now the head.  But, when the responsibility is placed on him, we find that he is not now tackling the problem as he had envisaged it should be tackled when he was on this side of the House.  I maintain that the Minister is not exerting sufficient authority in the Cabinet to get money for the relief of this particular problem.  His introductory statement on the Estimate last year was very brief and this year it was not much more explanatory of the problem that confronts the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know, and it has been admitted during this debate, that the Minister can tour the country and visit constituencies such as Roscommon, to see, as he said himself, the plight of the poor congests there.  Whether it was for another purpose, whether he offered inducements to take them out <Col N="1469" /> of that plight, or whether it was done for political purposes, as has been alleged, is another question.  He has admitted that he did go there to see the plight of the congests in County Roscommon, at the invitation of a Deputy on the Government side of the House.  If the Minister is touring the country at the expense of the State, it is not to the congested areas that he should go, because he comes from the congested areas and, without visiting the farms and houses of the congests, he, like myself and the other Deputies from the congested areas, should very well know their plight, if it was not for some other purpose that he was making these visits.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were doing his job rightly, it is to the people with 500 acres, and over, that he should go, the people on whom Deputy Giles said the bloodhounds should not be let loose, the people with the 1,000 acres, the Aga Khans, and such like, that came and are coming in and buying up the big ranches.  These are the people that the Minister should visit.  That is the sort of farm he should view, to find out what use they are making of the land, whether they are using it according to proper methods of husbandry or not, by how much he will reduce these big ranches and how much of the land the Government will be prepared to acquire for the relief of congestion.  I maintain that it is not to the congests the Minister should go but that, if he were doing his duty rightly, if he wants to pay these visits, he should adopt the method I have suggested.</P>
    <P>I am completely dissatisfied with the position in regard to the division of land, with reference, at any rate, to my constituency.  Last week I put down a question to the Minister for Lands. I am sorry he is not in the House at the moment.  The question was in connection with the division of Monaghan's estate, Grange, Turloughmore. As far as we can gather, the people in the locality, some of them who got additions of land and particularly those who did not get land, were completely dissatisfied.  As a result, as one of the Deputies from the county, <Col N="1470" /> I got an invitation to attend a meeting in Galway to meet the people of the locality, to hear their grievances.  I duly went there and I was given a list made out, not by me but by some of the tenants who got land and some of those who were left out.  They gave me and the other Deputies present an idea of the amount of land that the tenants had before the estate was divided and the additions they received on division.</P>
    <P>As far as I could gather from them, the new method of dividing land in my constituency appears to be on the principle that the more land you had, the greater your valuation had been, the more land you got.  An innovation had been introduced that, if a person had a big holding of land and wanted to get an addition for a son or daughter, he gave portion to the son or daughter, to create another congest, and then the son or daughter got an addition in the division of the estate to be divided.</P>
    <P>I was surprised when I heard that that had happened and I put down a question.  I believe that in two cases there was subdivision on the Monaghan estate.  I put down a simple question on 26th April, 1950.  I asked the Minister for Lands if he would state whether Mrs. Margaret O'Brien, Grange, Turloughmore, applied to the Land Commission to have her holding subdivided in order to give portion of it to her son, Patrick J. O'Brien, and, if so, whether he will state (a) the date on which the application was made, (b) the date on which it was sanctioned by the Land Commission and (c) the ground on which consent to the subdivision was given.  The Minister replied that it is not the practice of the Land Commission to disclose confidential information of this description. I hold that if there was not something wrong the Minister should have given me the information.  If this woman, Mrs. M. O'Brien, was allowed to subdivide her holding and to give part of it to her son in order to create an economic holding for him, there was nothing wrong in that.  The Minister should have told me when she applied to have that subdivision granted, when it was sanctioned and the grounds on which it was sanctioned.  I would have been <Col N="1471" /> quite satisfied if the Minister had told me that she was allowed to subdivide in order to provide an economic holding for her son.  I presume the reason why the information was not given was because the holding she gave her son was not an economic one.  That was clearly demonstrated because in the subdivision of this estate to which I have referred, a further 33 acres were given to him by the Land Commission. Yet another man in that area with a valuation of £6 15s. 0d., Mr. John O'Malley, Costelloe, was left completely out and got no addition in Monaghan's estate, Grange, Turloughmore.  This man has three in family.  Mr. Tim Rabbit of Cahertymore, Athenry, has a valuation of £6 5s. 0d.  He is a married man with seven in family, four sons and three daughters ranging from two years to 14 years; he got nothing.</P>

      <P>In order to show how this land was divided, 23 people got land <Col N="1472" /> on it.  Five people within a mile or so of it got nothing.  One of those was Tim Rabbit, to whom I have already referred.  John O'Malley, Costelloe, with a valuation of £6 15s. could throw a stone from his fields into the estate. The longest distance he is from it by road is a mile and 40 yards or so. There were three others who got nothing at all.  The position seems to be that the more land one has and the higher the valuation, the more land one gets. I shall give a few examples of that.  A man named Patrick J. O'Brien got 33 acres to add to the 68 acres he already has.</P>

His brother, a bachelor, got 19 acres 3 roods to add to the 25 acres he already had.  We have people with 21 acres who got an addition of four acres; we have people with 30 acres who got an addition of 14 acres.  We have people with 27 acres who got an addition of 4 acres and 3 roods.  The land is the same in every case.  Therefore, the more land people had the more they got.</P>

      <P>The higher the valuations the more land the people get.  We have a &ldquo;new look&rdquo; in the Land Commission. A parent is now allowed to subdivide a holding and give portion of that holding to a son.  That son will then get an addition while other landholders, who are tenants of the Land Commission and have large families, get no addition to their existing uneconomic holdings.  The Minister, when he was in opposition, raised this matter at column 2635 of Dáil Debates, 9th May, 1946.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;They should not allow subdivision. I have repeatedly stated here that the main purpose of the Land Commission should be to bring up uneconomic landholders to a certain economic level and prevent subdivision of the holdings such as happened <Col N="1473" /> in the old landlord days, resulting in the rundale system and the uneconomic plight of many landholders along the western seaboard.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister was right when he said that.  That has always been the general practice of the Land Commission in the past.  There is grave dissatisfaction in my constituency as a result of the division of this estate.  The Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Donnellan, knows that.  I tried to raise this matter by means of parliamentary question both last week and the week before. On neither occasion did I get a satisfactory reply.  I gave notice to-day that I would raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I have now received a note from the Leas-Cheann Comhairle stating that I shall not be allowed to raise it on the Adjournment.  Therefore, I take this opportunity of bringing the matter before the House in order to show that grave dissatisfaction exists in my constituency because of the division of this Monaghan estate. I notice this practice with regard to subdivision is becoming very prevalent of late.  I would appeal to the Minister not to allow it to continue.  I have pointed out two cases where it has occurred.  A few weeks ago I had a question down about subdivision.  A man was allowed to sell 67 acres at Winfield, Menlough.  Now, that is a congested area.  On that occasion the Minister informed me that the Land Commission allowed the subdivision, but he added that the Land Commission had before their mind the object of relieving congestion in that area.  I must say it seems to be a funny way of relieving congestion if a big farmer is allowed to sell portion of his holding by private treaty to already fairly substantial landowners while tenants living on uneconomic holdings are left without any relief.</P>
    <P>I would urge on the Minister that his Department should initiate some scheme of resettlement for the people in Winfield Lower, Menlough, Ballinasloe. Some of them will have to migrate to other areas.  There are big farms in that locality, some of which are non-residential, and they are being bought up by already substantial landowners <Col N="1474" /> and others.  The Land Commission should stop that and should take over these farms themselves for the relief of congestion in that area. Deputy Killilea referred to the Daly estate, Knockbrack.  In that case the smaller the valuations the less land the people got.  Some were left out altogether.  The Minister will have to tackle this problem.  He will have to spend more money on its solution than he proposes to spend under this Estimate.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I would refer.  I raised it last year on this Estimate too.  The Land Commission has a habit of making a road half way on one side of an estate and one-third of the way on the other side. They leave a little portion in the middle over which no road runs.  I referred to one road in particular last year, Fohenagh to Kilconnell.  There is only a short distance, actually the breadth of one man's farm, left out. The two parts that have been made are in fairly good condition and if the road were completed the county council would take it over and maintain it.  I understand that at the moment a farm is being divided in the Clonbrock-Ahascragh area and that a road is to be made through the estate to link up these two areas.  I hope that road will be completed, otherwise it will create a big difficulty for the local authority later on.  When the road is being made at all, the few hundred pounds necessary to complete it should be provided and a right job made of it.</P>
    <P>Another problem that confronts the people of my constituency is that of getting a sufficient supply of turbary. As well as having large tracts of land there, we have some very large bog estates.  I asked a number of questions here during the year, particularly about two bogs, the Bellews bog and the Clonbrock bog.  Under the system that prevails there at the moment, the tenants have to take bog in conacre. There is an agent for the landlord who sets so many perches of bog to each tenant for the year.  These bogs are not properly developed and there are no roads into them.  Even though one may think that we have plenty of turbary in the West of Ireland, there <Col N="1475" /> are some people at the same time who have to pay rent for bog taken in conacre every year.  I would suggest that where there are large tracts of bog, such as the Bellews and Clonbrock bog, these should be taken over by the Land Commission and divided amongst the tenants in these localities.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with that question and registered my protest against the manner in which certain estates were divided recently in my constituency, I would urge on the Minister&mdash;I think he has referred to it himself&mdash;that it may be necessary to bring in a Supplementary Estimate during the year.  I think that it is certainly needed.  So far as the relief of congestion is concerned, he will certainly meet with no opposition from us in any Supplementary Estimate he wants to introduce.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to detain the House very long but sitting on this side of the House, listening to Deputy Kitt, one could not come to any conclusion but that Deputy Kitt and members of the Fianna Fáil Party have faces of brass.  For the past three weeks, a Land Bill, brought before the House by the Minister for Lands, has been under discussion. In Section 11 of that Bill the Minister tried to get a little bit of freedom&mdash;so far as I was concerned I thought it a very small bit&mdash;so that the Land Commission could not be in future the great dictators they have been for many years.  Into the Lobby against the Minister and Deputies on this side of the House on that section trooped the very same brass-faced individuals who stand up here now and say that in Galway the Land Commissioners did so-and-so and it was wrong.  In Knockbrack and Turloughmore, they say it was wrong.  They go to Turloughmore and they condemn the Land Commission and Land Commissioners and then they come back and troop into the Lobby here against that big-hearted Minister when he tries to get some little authority and some little freedom against the commissioners who held down the uneconomic holders of this country for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1476" /> I should like Deputy Kitt to go to Turloughmore and to explain his attitude in walking into the Lobby after the Leader of his Party to support all these grand fellows who never did anything wrong, according to Deputy de Valera.  We heard the cry: &ldquo;If the Minister gets any authority, what is going to happen?  It is the Clann na Talmhan fellows who are going to get it.&rdquo;  I wonder is this Mr. O'Brien a Clann na Talmhan supporter?  I do not think he is.  The day is at hand, thanks be to God, when every citizen will get what he is entitled to as a citizen of the State and it will not make any difference for the future whether it is Turloughmore, Knockbrack or any place else that is in question.  Uneconomic holders under the new Land Bill, well piloted through this House by the Minister, will ensure fair play for all sections of our people.  The Minister is blamed by Deputy Kitt because he happened to go into an area where there are uneconomic holders. Deputy Kitt says that the Minister should go amongst the big ranchers and the graziers.</P>

The one fact is that for the past year the Minister and the Land Commission have acquired 32,544 acres and relieved 1,250 uneconomic holders in this country.  In previous years the highest figure was 8,000 acres acquired.  I do not need to be a national teacher to say that these figures represent four times more land acquired than in any previous year.</P>

      <P>On that side of the House.  The one thing that impresses me is that the Minister has acquired over 32,544 acres of land for the relief of congestion against an average of 8,000 acres acquired in previous years. These figures explain themselves, and I need not go into them.  I am quite sure that the Minister will not allow that work to be held up as happened on previous occasions.  Reading Deputy Killilea's speech last week and trying to put it together&mdash;it is a very hard job&mdash;I note that he says the Land Commission has land on its hands for the last ten years.  It has, and for 15 years, and in some cases for longer.  The Minister has been in power only for the last two years, and is he responsible for the Land Commission having land on hands for the past ten years? I know they have.  I know that in my own area nest eggs have been left on the Minister's hands that, I am afraid, he can never tackle.  Beside my place there are, roughly, 50 acres which have been for the past 15 years in the hands of the Land Commission and no division has yet taken place.  This land has been promised to so many people that, if they all got some of it, it would not give them a grave apiece.  They have been kept in a state of expectation for the past 15 years, all of them seeking a portion of that land.</P>
      <P>May I congratulate the Minister with reference to Grange, Turloughmore?  I join with Deputy Kitt there.  I am not satisfied with what the Land Commission inspectors did there, and that is one reason why I voted to give them full authority so that they would not repeat such a thing.</P>

      <P>You will soon be as bad as Deputy Burke with his widow. The land at Grange, Turloughmore was taken over in 1949 and it was divided in March, 1950.  That represents a change. I appeal to the Minister that as regards the 32,544 acres he has taken over, he <Col N="1478" /> should hold it for as short a time as possible.  Divide it at the earliest moment amongst the people.  This practice of holding land and setting it in conacre in such a way that in the end it would scarcely feed a worm, much less giving a holding to a poor congest, should be stopped.  It would be much better to give a man a bag rather than a holding of outworn land. I am sure that Deputy O'Rourke will agree with my statement.</P>

      <P>In the Parliamentary Debates, Volume 120, No. 9, column 1312, Deputy Killilea is reported:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I will give the Minister a case in point at the moment.  I will prove to the Minister also that this is a case where assistance has been given to an individual I know to hold the land by a pal of the Minister.  It is what is known as the Flannery estate in a place called Corralea in the County Galway.  I have asked a number of questions about that land over a number of years.  The Land Commission had instituted proceedings before the Minister came into office and a scheme was prepared for those lands.  The land was all ready to be dished out although the Minister denies that completely.  The Land Commission had a scheme ready and I asked the Minister a question on the 28th February last why the Land Commission were not putting into operation that scheme. The Minister replied: &lsquo;The Land Commission are not in possession of this estate and consequently cannot divide it.&rsquo;  Of course, I know what was wrong.  I knew that this individual, this Flannery man, was a particular pal of a certain Parliamentary Secretary in this House and I knew that there was something going on behind the scenes....&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some will say &ldquo;A guilty conscience&rdquo;. Any representations that I ever made to the Land Commission were for the purpose of acquiring land and dividing it among uneconomic holders.  I made representations in this case.  This is a case where, only last year, the present <Col N="1479" /> Minister and the present Government brought this individual before the court and acquired his land from him in Galway.  The price is not yet settled, I understand.  Just imagine that there was a scheme prepared years ago, according to the Deputy, even though it was only last May that this Government brought this man before the court and acquired the land from him.</P>

      <P>We know what must have been happening then.  It is a strange thing that you could divide land, give it to others, without being in possession of it.  If it was my land and if any Deputy, or anybody, came down to interfere, when it had not been acquired, I would put the dog after him.  I join with Deputy Kitt in saying I am not very well pleased with the division in Grange, Turloughmore.</P>

      <P>The Minister is not responsible.  I believe it is the Land Commission.  I hope that in the future Deputies will try to stand behind the Minister and help him in undoing some of the things that have been done.  The Land Commission are about to acquire some land near Glenamaddy.  A certain uneconomic holder came to my home and he asked me to make representations on his behalf for an addition. He said he lived near the land, mearing it, and his valuation is £3 10s. &mdash;a very low valuation.  I told him he would get land without my assistance, if those were his circumstances.  I told him he was certainly bound to get land without any help.  He said: &ldquo;The other crowd were going round last night.&rdquo; I asked him what other crowd he meant and he said it was the secretary of the Fianna Fáil club.  I will give his name if you want me to.  He is a ganger of mine, I regret to say, and he is spending more of his time following up politics than anything else.  By this individual joining the Fianna Fáil <Col N="1480" /> club, of course he was going to get a holding.  They knew this man would get one, no matter what his political views were.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to make sure that for the future politics will not count.  Give every citizen his God-given rights, and make it plain to the people that for the future, no matter what their political views are, their cases will be treated on their merits.  If they are Fianna Fáil they are entitled to think that way; if they are Fine Gael, Clann na Poblachta, Labour or anything else they are all our citizens, and there is one thing they expect and should get, and they will get it from a good, decent, honest Minister&mdash;and that is, a fair crack of the whip.</P>
      <P>There was another statement by Deputy Killilea when he said: &ldquo;I put down a question about Satchwell's land at Creggs.&rdquo;  In the last general election that man was in the street at Creggs and he was defending Satchwell. He said that Satchwell's 700 acres should not be acquired, and that he was a good farmer; that there was not in Creggs as good a farmer, and why should his land be acquired?  Now he puts down a parliamentary question although he well knows the position at Creggs and the position of the uneconomic holders there.  Does Deputy Killilea want this done or not?</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to carry on his land work regardless of politics. I am sure that politics will not deter the Minister in giving to all our citizens a fair crack of the whip.  It was a bad day and it ruined things in the past when land was given out to people other than to those who should get it. During his term of office, whether it be long or short&mdash;and I have not the slightest doubt that it will be long&mdash; I hope the Minister will never have to bring into operation the 1946 eviction Act.  It was politics caused that Act to be put through this House.</P>

      <P>It so happens that there are many other places besides Galway.  I am not going to criticise the Minister.  He has not been a very long time in office.  He came in when there was not very much land on hands.  I am not going to blame anyone for that either.  When we were trying to fight for our existence in a war situation, nobody could expect us to turn our attention to the division of land.  The position with regard to housing just made it impossible to build houses.  I do not think anybody can blame the Minister or his predecessor or the Land Commission for a certain slackness in the war years. We must take the situation as we find it.</P>
      <P>There were, undoubtedly, some fairly large farms on hands for a number of years.  The Parliamentary Secretary seems to think there is no excuse whatever for holding up these farms.  On the face of it, that might appear so, but there are certain circumstances which, I would say, render it advisable to hold over certain farms, or small estates, for a time. May I explain that by saying that if there were other holdings in the immediate neighbourhood that were likely to be acquired I, at any rate, would think it a very foolish thing to start dividing a farm of 200 or 300 acres, giving a number of people patches, because that is what would happen in some cases?  If such a thing were done, it would really mean that you would have a patchwork job made of the district.  To avoid that, and it has been avoided in certain cases, the Land Commission hold over certain lands until they have acquired other adjoining lands.  When these other lands are acquired you can have a proper scheme of division in a district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all, land division is something which we hope is going to last for a very long time.  I think there are certain circumstances in which the Land Commission would be quite justified and in which the Minister would be quite justified&mdash;I do not care who the Minister is&mdash;in deciding that certain holdings should be held over for a time.  The war situation made it impossible to divide certain lands.  I <Col N="1482" /> do not think that either the Minister or his predecessors should be blamed for that.</P>
    <P>I think that, on the whole, the position with regard to Land Commission work is fairly satisfactory.  Of course, I know very strong denunciations have been uttered about the Land Commission. On the whole, I think they have done a pretty good job.  In my opinion the great fault of the Land Commission is that it is too slow.  If what Deputy Kitt has said is true, you can, I agree, go a bit too fast.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanielORourke" hpid="Mr. O'Rourke Mr. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the place at all.  The division of lands is a thing that requires great study, and all that I am saying is that it would not be wise to rush too fast.  I suppose we may take it that the West of Ireland is the worst part of the country so far as congestion is concerned.  I believe there are parts of Donegal which are very congested, too.  In connection with that, we have to face the fact, whether we like it or not, that the large areas of land available for division have almost disappeared.  We really have not any large areas of land for division, certainly not in the County Roscommon.  I think, in all fairness, we must say that, taking the size of the county for what it is, there has been more land divided in the County Roscommon than in any other county. It was done in the time of the Estate Commissioners, by the Congested Districts Board and on a very large scale by the Land Commission since they took over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think someone made the remark that certain areas were left in a deplorable condition by Fianna Fáil.  I know some districts myself where congestion <Col N="1483" /> is very bad, but that does not take away from the fact that a great deal of work was done between 1932 and 1939, particularly.  In fact, I do not know how more work could have been done in that period.  Certainly, in the County Roscommon an enormous amount of work was done.  I do not know how far ministerial policy affects the work of the Land Commission, but between 1932 and 1939, 33,400 acres of land were divided.  I am not able to give the number of allottees, but the number must be very big.  In addition, new houses were built in practically all cases where full holdings were given and grants were given for the reconstruction of houses.  I think that anyone with a fair mind would leave politics out of it altogether where the work of the Land Commission is concerned. I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance that there should not be any politics in it at all.  As far as I know, the Land Commission have not allowed that factor to enter into it at all.  I think that any fair-minded person going through north and south Roscommon&mdash; through the heart of the county&mdash;must see that there has been an enormous amount of work done there.  Perhaps that work could have been done in a shorter time.</P>
    <P>What I feel about the Land Commission is that they are too slow in taking proceedings for the acquisition of land. I have in mind a number of cases in which the land was either offered for sale or the occupying tenant had died without leaving any immediate heir. I know, too, of a case where you had congests living in a townland surrounding a farm where a tenant died.  The tenant had nobody but an old sister who was not depending on that land. Representations were made to the Land Commission on behalf of ten of these congests.  I was assured at the time that an inspection would take place.  I believe it was ordered.  That went on for a considerable time.  First of all the land was put up for sale. It was not sold.  Then the Land Commission asked for a report, but there was such a long delay that an outsider came along and bought up the land. <Col N="1484" /> He could well afford to go to some other district which was not congested and buy land there.  In the course of time he was duly registered as the owner.  Nothing has been done since to relieve congestion in that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That can be remedied under the new Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielORourke" hpid="Mr. O'Rourke Mr. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not blaming the Minister, but I am referring to the tardiness of the Land Commission in dealing with such cases.  That was bad enough, but I think something worse happened in another townland which was only a few hundred yards away from the one I have mentioned.  An old man died there.  He had 70 Irish acres which, if acquired, would have given seven acres of an addition to each of the uneconomic holders in the area.  The same procedure was followed there as in the previous case.  We are told that the matter is still under consideration. That has been going on for years.  The valuations of the poor tenants living there range from £5 to £7.  If that land had been acquired and distributed amongst them their position could have been relieved. There is something wrong when cases of that kind occur.  I attribute a lot of the fault to the procedure followed by the Land Commission.  They first of all send for a report.  They get a preliminary report.  One would imagine that, when they get it, it would be enough to enable them to take proceedings. But no, they then ask for a detailed report, and while they are waiting for it somebody comes along and buys up the farm that is under consideration. Surely, there is something silly about that.  That sort of procedure is not calculated to relieve congestion.</P>

      <P>I know there is not. I have referred to these two cases because what I have described has occurred again and again.  I am sure there are many Deputies aware of the same thing happening in their areas. If the Minister speeds up the acquisition of land, I certainly will be the first to congratulate him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1485" /> I know that a lot has been said here and elsewhere about the size of economic holdings.  I know that within the last few months small-holders in my neighbourhood have been allotted small parcels of land which still leave their holdings uneconomic.  I do not know what steps the Land Commission can take in cases of that sort.  If there was more land available in the district, well and good.  I think the first consideration with the Land Commission should be to give economic holdings to people in a neighbourhood where land is being divided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>They do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielORourke" hpid="Mr. O'Rourke Mr. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  I know of cases in which they have given small additions of land, but despite that the old holding is just as uneconomic now as ever it was.  The small additions given made very little difference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielORourke" hpid="Mr. O'Rourke Mr. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>This year.  The scheme was made out last year, I would say, and about the beginning of this year it was parcelled out.  I suppose they think that they are doing a good job&mdash;they are giving a certain amount of relief&mdash;but they are not making economic holdings.  Either Deputy Beirne or Deputy McQuillan said that the people in the neighbourhood, or even some distance away, should get first preference when land is being divided.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy McQuillan that there are areas in County Roscommon which are in a bad way and are highly congested.  The Land Commission inspectors should go to them first and try to relieve congestion, but that has not been the practice.  I am very fond of Galway people and Mayo people, too.  We have got splendid tenants from County Mayo and nobody can find fault with them.  I was surprised to hear some adverse criticism of them when they went up to the plains of County Meath but it was not justified.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DanielORourke" hpid="Mr. O'Rourke Mr. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>They always made a success of their holding and there was hardly a single exception.  While they make splendid migrants, in our county preference should be given to local congests.  The Minister, I hope, will at least indicate that the Land Commission should take up that attitude.</P>
      <P>I am very much at sea as to how much, if any, land will be given to landless men.  I asked the Minister last year if landless men were to be debarred altogether and he said: &ldquo;Certainly not&rdquo;, but I am afraid that in practice they are and I do not think that is entirely right.  Naturally people with small holdings must be catered for first, but where there is a good man who has stock and takes land by the 11-months' system or otherwise and if during the crisis he tilled land&mdash;land held by the Land Commission, perhaps &mdash;I do not see any reason, particularly if he is a married man, why he should not be given the chance of a new holding. Others may be taken who are not nearly so suitable.  In most cases they are not able to buy a holding.  If they were I would not have any sympathy for them.</P>
      <P>I would like to reiterate what Deputy Kitt said about making roads into estates.  I was interested in that last year.  The Minister knows as well as I do that the practice now exists of making roads into farms and estates and leaving them as <i>culs-de-sac.</i>  We have a terrible problem in Roscommon County Council.  The position is and has been all the time that we cannot legally do anything about them.  They are not regarded as public highways and therefore we are debarred.  The Department of Lands, therefore, should ensure that those roads are connected with other roads, otherwise it is a foolish and a wrong thing.  They look all right for five or six years&mdash;the Land Commission makes them well&mdash;but then they get full of holes and it is nobody's business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same applies to water supplies. In many limestone counties there is very little surface water and very few spring wells.  The people in those areas&mdash;I know great numbers in some districts in County Roscommon&mdash;have <Col N="1487" /> not a drop of water to drink, but must cart it for long distances.  The Land Commission should make a genuine attempt.  It would not be costly.  The cost of boring by the county council is between £200 and £400.  It would be more now, probably nearer the £400 mark, but I think it should be done. In most cases the boring is successful. If a boring of 300 or 400 feet is made &mdash;sometimes much less&mdash;the water is got all right.  There is a move&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;in local government to try to get a water supply to labourers' houses, but as a general rule in the country there is no water, and no individual farmer out of his own means is able to bore a well himself to procure a water supply, so it should be the policy of the Land Commission to procure a water supply where land division is done to any extent.</P>
    <P>Others have referred to the large tracts of land in the Midlands.  I hope we have the right Minister for Lands now.  He passes through the plains of the Midlands even if he is going to Dysart, and I hope that he will take stock of these large areas.  I was told by some people that from Ballymahon to Moate there are hardly ten holdings, and we know that these lands are only used for grazing.  The Minister for Agriculture might think that a glorious thing, but I do not think so.  These holdings should be made smaller, particularly if the people who are occupying them are not prepared to till or employ labour. They have no excuse, and it should be the Minister's policy to see that these holdings are kept down.  I do not want any land confiscated, but the Minister says that he will give market value and leave the owners a reasonable share of land.  Very well then, by making reasonable holdings the Minister is not doing an injustice to anybody, and it would be a good thing for the Irish nation.</P>
    <P>A matter to which I wish to refer is the sale or grants of land for the making of sports pitches&mdash;we generally call them Gaelic Athletic Association pitches.  I am glad that the Minister has continued the policy of giving land for sports purposes where land is <Col N="1488" /> being divided.  Recently, however, at the very last General Council meeting I attended, a complaint was made that a clause is inserted in the deed to the trustees by which the land may revert in certain circumstances to the Land Commission.  In other words, it debars the Gaelic trustees, whoever they may be, from absolute ownership and as a result the solicitor who acts on behalf of the Central Council has refused to agree that a grant should be made from the Central Council or other Gaelic bodies.  It is a very serious matter, but after all it is rather a petty matter.  I think that the procedure has been where the Land Commission agreed to give a pitch that they only charged the amount of the annuity yet to expire. Is that not the position?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  They do not regard the title as complete and giving absolute ownership.  Deputy Kitt and other Deputies referred to the acquisition and division of bogs.  In many areas, and even in those areas where there is a lot of bog, turf is becoming scarce and many of the tenants are in a bad way.  I know that the Land Commission have done a lot of work in this connection and I have always applauded them for it.</P>
      <P>Wherever they have gone into a bog, they have done good work, have carried out drainage work and in many cases have made roads, but there is still a lot of work to be done.  Wherever there are large areas of such bog, I advocate that the Land Commission should be urged to continue that good work, because I know of no more meritorious work in the poor districts.  It is the only source of supply for the people there.  People in other areas can buy coal, but in these boggy districts the people cannot and in many cases they could make a little money by selling turf to the people in the local towns and villages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have often been a devil's advocate, but, notwithstanding all the harsh things said about the Land Commission there is one section&mdash;I should say that I have not been primed in any way to speak on their behalf&mdash;for whom I should like to plead.  There are a number of unestablished inspectors in the Land Commission, many of whom have given the best years of their lives to the work of the Land Commission. Most of them that I know are very hard-working men, and, in spite of what has been said about political pressure&mdash;I myself have often made recommendations, but I have never tried to force an issue with the Land Commission and would not do it&mdash;I can say that the Land Commission <Col N="1490" /> inspectors I have met are as free from political bias as any people I ever met and it is only fair to say that.  Whatever Minister holds the office of Minister for Lands will get loyal service from these men and I know that, if I were to try to use political influence with these men, I would fail.  Of that I am certain.  If I tried to bring political pressure to bear on them, I would certainly fail.  It is long past the time when these unestablished inspectors should be established and given pension rights.  It is all very fine to say that they have been paid for the years they have served, but many of them have spent the best years of their lives in the service of the Land Commission and I saw some of them coming out with no provision made for their declining years.  Whether Deputy de Valera or the Minister is right about the number of years it will take to divide the remaining land of this country, most of these men will continue to serve until they reach pensionable age and I urge that a scheme be devised to establish these officers and provide pensions for them.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter I must mention and it is, perhaps, the only unpleasant thing I have to say.  I do not know who is responsible for promotions, but I ask the Minister to look into that matter.  I understand that a divisional inspector was recently appointed in the West of Ireland and that he was not at all as senior, and had not as long service, as some of those who were passed over.  I do not know whether the Land Commission or the Minister is responsible, but it is a very serious thing if people are not promoted and rewarded according to their merit and seniority.  I do not intend to mention names, but I believe that that divisional inspector has been appointed and that he was not entitled to the appointment according to seniority, or, for that matter, efficiency. It is a matter the Minister should look into, because to neglect to promote a man who is fully entitled to promotion is a grave miscarriage of justice.</P>
    <P>I have always taken an interest in the work of the Land Commission.  It is a very important branch of the public <Col N="1491" /> service, and, with the reservation I mentioned in the beginning, lack of expedition in certain cases, I think that, on the whole, they have done a pretty good job.  I advocated last year that more responsibility should be left in the hands of reliable senior officers down the country.</P>

      <P>I do not think for one moment that every little bit of tittle-tattle should be referred to the Land Commission in Dublin.  In the final analysis, on whom are the Land Commission depending?  They are depending on the senior inspector in charge of the particular area.  They do not go down there themselves. Reports are sent again and again and finally they have to accept his word. Would it not be better to accept it at first?  If the Minister can influence policy in the Land Commission, and I hope he can, I suggest that he influence it in that direction.</P>

Much more expedition would be brought about in that way.</P>

      <P>I, as a western Deputy, am interested in congestion, because there is a fair amount of congestion in the constituency I represent.  I might not have taken part in this debate at all were it not for the rather tart reply I got from the Minister the other day concerning a particular area in my constituency.  It is an area in which there is very acute congestion and in which it is not necessary for the Land Commission to acquire land compulsorily.  There are a number of derelict farms in the area which are advertised weekly in the local Press and sold by public auction.  These farms are bought up by men who would <Col N="1492" /> be regarded as ranchers by those with holdings of £2 or £3 valuation.  There are a number of such people in the area who were in the habit of taking conacre in years past, but now, because of the improved conditions since this Government came into office, that conacre is not available, and some of these men had to sell their pigs before they were half finished and some of their fowl as well as their horses.  It is a matter of which I should like the Minister to take particular notice.  I gave the Minister the particular area, the parishes in the electoral division, and I can say that I have an idea why the Land Commission has not been active in that area since the present Government was formed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 22, before &ldquo;as&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;not being earlier than the date of coming into operation of the scheme envisaged in the White Paper (P. No. 9661).&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1493" /> It is hardly necessary to explain what the scheme envisaged in that White Paper is.  It is the comprehensive scheme of social insurance.  There has been some doubt abroad as to when, if ever, the scheme will come into operation. The Minister has repeatedly stated, with a certain air of confidence, that the scheme will pass into law during the present year. However, having regard to the statements of some of the Deputies who support the Government, particularly the Deputies of Clann na Talmhan, that they are committed to opposing this Bill, I take it that the Minister for Lands, being leader of that Party, is of the same mind.  The first question one asks is: if the scheme comes into law will it have the full approval of the entire Government?  Many people have hazarded a guess that, with the commitments of the Minister for Lands, that scheme will hardly come into operation before the general election.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from that, however, there probably will be certain difficulties facing the Minister before he brings legislation into the House which will enact that scheme.  The Minister in this section refers to the transfer day, as&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;such day as may be appointed in that behalf by the Minister by Order&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister may at some time appoint a day in anticipation of the coming into operation of that scheme.  This amendment is put down for the purpose of delaying the transfer of the staffs of the National Health Insurance Society into the Department of Social Welfare prematurely.  The Minister's transfer day might be much earlier than the date of the coming into operation of the comprehensive scheme. Until such time as the scheme comes into operation, it can hardly be argued that the necessity arises for the taking over of the entire staff of the National Health Insurance Society by the Department of Social Welfare. Until such time as the comprehensive scheme becomes law, national health insurance, as such, will have to be administered in the usual <Col N="1494" /> way, examining claims and providing benefits for persons insured in the society.  Therefore, I put it to the Minister that he ought to accept this amendment.  The Minister may answer me by saying that he has no intention of appointing the transfer day until such time as he is sure that the comprehensive scheme is about to come into operation.  Nevertheless, having regard to the air of uncertainty abroad, not only amongst the general public, but amongst Deputies who support the Government and even amongst members of the Government, I think that there is no urgency about the transfer and that it should be postponed until such time as the comprehensive scheme proper passes into law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to accept this amendment because I think it is based on want of faith by Deputy Lynch in what is going to happen in the sphere of social security.  In any case, perhaps at the outset the best thing I can do is to commend a close study by him of the views expressed by Deputy Dr. Ryan when speaking in this House on the 23rd June last, when he said, as reported in column 1341 of the Official Report, referring to the National Health Insurance Society:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It would be better to have it in before going on with the comprehensive scheme because it would be easier to start off from the new point then.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the view of a Deputy who was Minister for Social Welfare, who had given this matter considerable study and who, having been able to appraise the situation at close range, came down here definitely on the side that efficiency lay in the direction of taking in the society first, because he realised, as anybody who has given the matter any attention will realise, that when the society is in and only when the society is in can you begin to plan effectively for rearing up on the integrated sections the larger structure of a comprehensive scheme.  It is true that when the society comes into the Department claims for benefit will be paid in much the same way.  That is not the point.  Deputy Lynch clearly overlooked the administrative end of <Col N="1495" /> this, that we have to get power to do the things which the society is now doing.  We have to get power to integrate its staff with the staff of the Department.  We have to get power to integrate its records with the new recording scheme which will have to be devised as part of the comprehensive scheme.  We cannot do that at the moment.  It is only when the society is integrated in the Department that we will have the administrative power to weld the society with the rest of the Department and thus evolve a scheme of administration for the new scheme which is to follow.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Lynch reflects on the administrative machine which must necessarily be built up to administer the comprehensive scheme, he will clearly realise, as his colleague, Deputy Dr. Ryan, realises, that you must have the society in first in order to enable you to plan effectively, because you certainly cannot plan with the largest section of the comprehensive scheme outside the control of the Department, with no power whatever to interfere in the day-to-day administration of the society, no power to touch its records or to alter its administrative line so as to weave that in with whatever larger pattern is planned.  It is clear that the integration of the society is a first and very vital step in the implementation of the comprehensive scheme.</P>
    <P>In case the Deputy is inclined to give himself up to despair about the comprehensive scheme, I want to assure him and anybody else who may be infected by his melancholia in regard to this matter that they need not have any doubt about the comprehensive scheme.  It is the best bet they can have.  Having said that, and I hope cheered up the Deputy, I hope he realises, as his colleague realises, that integration is essential if you are going to build properly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is enough of a democrat not to ask that the views of any other member of this Party should be imposed on me.  As I said on the Second Reading, in cases such as this&mdash;if the comprehensive scheme is to become law&mdash;the amalgamation <Col N="1496" /> of the society would probably lead to better administration.  Nevertheless, as the Minister is aware, the present position is that various branches of his Department are being run practically independently.  That is something which the ordinary Deputy must be aware of.  If he has to make inquiries about widows' pensions he has to go to one particular place and if he has to make inquiries about old age pensions he has to go to a place located in a different part of the city.  Therefore, the Minister's Department at the moment is being run in such a fashion that if each particular section of it is not autonomous at least it is almost independent of its sister section within the Department.  I maintain that the National Health Insurance Society could be run equally independently until such time as the scheme is ready to come into operation.  I do not deny that a certain amount of oiling of the machine might be necessary beforehand. Apart altogether from the Minister's assurance and his tip from the horse's mouth, it is not improbable that this scheme will be postponed for a considerable time&mdash;it may be a year: it may be two years.  The Minister may appoint a transfer day many months, if not years, prior to the actual coming into operation of the scheme.  I hold, then, that it is not necessary that the National Health Insurance Society staff should be incorporated into the Department of Social Welfare proper until such time as the scheme is ready to be put into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned on the Second Reading that there are members of the society's staff, whether the Minister is aware of it or not, who are not particularly anxious to be co-opted into full establishment in the Civil Service.  In the meantime, certain difficulties will arise that will have to be smoothed out as regards the rights of members on transfer and, by delaying the transfer day at least to a short time before the coming into operation of the scheme, many of these difficulties which may not now be apparent will have become apparent at that stage.  Unless the Minister can give an assurance that the scheme is about to come into operation in the very near future, a transfer day <Col N="1497" /> appointed for a date years or even months prior to the coming into operation of this scheme is not necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been prompted to intervene by reason of the remarks of the previous speaker to the effect that certain members of the existing staff are not anxious to come within the Civil Service scheme provided for in this measure.  I, with others, met a deputation to our group and I am aware that the same deputation met the Fianna Fáil group.  They put up certain points for the consideration of the members of our Party in connection with the proposed transfer and the effect which the transfer would have on their future position if and when they came into the Civil Service. Reference was made to the possibility of any members of the existing National Health Insurance Society staff objecting to going into the Civil Service under the conditions in connection with the proposed transfer.  The spokesman quite definitely stated that the overwhelming majority of the staff &mdash;he did not know any who held the opposite point of view&mdash;was in favour of coming into the Civil Service and taking whatever chances came to them as a result of that transfer.</P>

In many cases, when the legal advice given to the State has been contested in the court, the legal advice has been found wrong. There is a case, not of a person described as an employee but of an occasional agent, acting in very occasional circumstances, who is on call, so to speak.  If we were to try to define &ldquo;employee&rdquo;, we would have to examine to what extent his or her work <Col N="1500" /> related, in percentage, to the total work done elsewhere.  The Minister might find there would be difficulty, if there were some contest about it, as to whether the person was an occasional employee, not being an employee in the sense the Minister wishes to understand it and we wish to understand it.

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Where an officer or an employee of the society is appointed <Col N="1501" /> to a situation in the Civil Service, pursuant to the provisions of sub-section (1) of this section, he shall be appointed within a grade at least as favourable, having regard to existing rights and salary scale, as his or her existing grade in the society's service.</P>
    <P>This would apply more to the indoor staff, though also to the outdoor staff. I do not know if the Minister is in a position to tell us to what particular grade or class in the Civil Service an agent would be appointed.  With the indoor staff it does not appear to be so difficult, as I take it that, according to their present situation, they will be made writing assistants, clerical staff, staff officers or executive officers.  The object of this amendment is that, when transferred, they will be put into a grade in the Civil Service that will not be less favourable, having regard to their remuneration and scale of salary and also to their &ldquo;existing rights.&rdquo;  I do not know if those rights have any legal significance.  I believe that in the National Health Insurance Society a certain proportion of, say, the clerical grade would get promotion to a higher grade.  If these employees are transferred to the Civil Service as clerical officers they may feel they are not in as good a position as they were in before.  They may feel that, as the Civil Service is now constituted, they will remain clerical officers when they are transferred, and will not have the same chance of promotion to a higher grade that they have at the moment. It may be a difficult thing for the Minister to give them a grade in the Civil Service where the same proportion of them, roughly, would pass on to a higher grade when transferred over.  This amendment is an effort to safeguard the employees of the society in that way.  The Minister may be in sympathy with what I have proposed&mdash;Deputy Lehane has a very similar amendment&mdash;and, if so, he might be in a position to draft an amendment which would be more in keeping with the ordinary drafting of Bills of this kind, and at the same time give the safeguards to the members of the society that we are trying to give them here.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Ryan, I thought when he commenced to speak that he was going to clarify a point that was giving me trouble in his amendment No. 4.  I would be in complete sympathy with him in regard to this amendment were it not for the very point to which he adverted, &ldquo;existing rights&rdquo;.  I see considerable difficulty there.  I think I would be on stronger ground in urging the Minister to accept the succeeding amendment. There would be considerable difficulty in defining existing rights.  I do not know whether Deputy Dr. Ryan would agree with me or not, but I think it would mean that, in fact, you would create a service within a service, if regard were to be had to the hypothetical promotion that might have accrued to a man had the society remained in existence.  That would be creating a favoured class within the Department of Social Welfare and I could see grave difficulties arising from the Civil Service angle were that the case.  I thought that Deputy Dr. Ryan was going to remove my doubts. I would suggest that &ldquo;existing rights&rdquo; only complicates the position and weakens the good case that can be made for the general principle contained in this amendment and in the succeeding one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Lehane that it creates a big difficulty for any Minister to ask him to have regard to existing rights.  I do not say that they must be put into a grade where automatically one of three or four must go on to a higher grade than clerical as vacancies occur.  There are not very many of those.  All we can ask the Minister is that he should be fair and reasonable with the staff and keep these existing rights in mind. When he is putting them into a grade such as clerical officer, perhaps he can only give them an assurance that there will be promotion to the staff officer grade, which would probably correspond with the supervisor grade they have in the society.  I would like to hear what the Minister has to say about it before we go any further.</P>

      <P>There is an unspecified type of officer that neither Deputy <Col N="1503" /> Ryan nor Deputy Lehane referred to. I suppose the Minister has given it some consideration.  It is the type of officer of the existing society who was a full-time agent in the City of Dublin or the county borough, but who, because of his age and because of his low salary, might find himself, when transferred, relegated to a position in the service which might be that of messenger rank.  Deputy Lehane says he does not think there are any.</P>

      <P>If the section is interpreted as it now reads, all that the State will have to do is to put them into a position from the point of view of salary and pension rights, and so forth, according to the status that they would enjoy in the service on account of the wage rate they are earning. I am afraid you would find yourself having to put these men into a grade of employment which would, in fact, be an injustice to them.  The Minister could get from his officers the rates of wages of these particular officers of the society that I refer to.  He should then take into account their age at the present time.  Some of them are not so very long in the society.  They have been appointed in comparatively recent years, although their age would be higher than the normal age for entry into the Civil Service.  I would ask him, therefore, to consider either of these amendments or an amendment of <Col N="1504" /> his own which would protect these people against an injustice which he may not want to happen but which, on a strict interpretation of Civil Service regulations, in my opinion, would happen.</P>

      <P>The remarks I made with reference to Deputy Dr. Ryan's amendment and the words &ldquo;existing rights&rdquo; were directed solely to getting the Minister to accept one or other of these two amendments.  If the Minister is prepared to accept Deputy Dr. Ryan's amendment, I think it is probably preferable to mine in many ways, from the point of view of the employees, but I do see grave difficulties, not alone from the Minister's point of view, but from the point of view of the attitude of the ordinary civil servants in the Department of Social Welfare, if rights are given to the importees which would supervene and take precedence over their rights as existing civil servants&mdash; if, in other words, you were to create a service within a service.  If, as Deputy Briscoe says, there are whole-time agents in the Dublin City or county area in receipt of salaries which would enable them to be degraded or down-graded, that is a matter upon which the Minister should give us an assurance.  My whole desire is to get the Minister to accept an amendment which will have statutory force.  My objection to &ldquo;existing rights&rdquo; is that it is so vague that it would be difficult to say you were giving statutory force to anything concrete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the arguments that have been advanced to the Minister in regard to the amendments and that were advanced on this particular point on Second Reading.  I personally am satisfied that in so far as the Minister personally is concerned, it is his desire and intention that no member of this society will suffer in any way through being brought into the Civil Service, but that, in fact, the position of that particular person will be improved.  I know that that is the Minister's intention and desire.  The staff are perfectly satisfied that it is the Minister's intention and desire, but when this Bill <Col N="1505" /> passes through the Dáil and Seanad and comes for interpretation to the Department of Finance, which is the Department that governs these matters, the Minister may find that that Department may not be anxious to interpret it in the way that he would interpret it.  It is to prevent the Department of Finance, at some time in the future, doing an injustice to those particular persons that we are in favour of some protection for the staffs being written into the Bill.  I think the Minister will accept what I say and what the other Deputies have said in regard to that, that we desire to write into the Bill some statutory protection. It is not that we are afraid of what the Minister may do but that we are afraid of what the Department of Finance may do.  The Minister, after all his years' experience in this House, knows what the Department of Finance can do.</P>
      <P>There is, of course, the point that has been made that if things continued as they are at the moment some members of the staff could receive promotion to the highest grades of the staff, but that promotion may not come to them within the new arrangement. They will become part of a very large pool.  They will be subject to all the rules and regulations relating to promotion and it may be that promotion to the higher grades in the section of the Civil Service that will be administering this Act may come from lower grades of the Civil Service who have no experience of the administration of the society or of the work the society has done or could do under its new name and under the new conditions. However, I do not think we need worry unduly on that particular point, because it seems to me that if this particular section of the Department of Social Welfare is to be properly administered, naturally, the higher grades in the section will be filled by promotion from the lower grades of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, of course, there is this other point, that the Minister may say that not only will these persons have the opportunity for promotion in the limited section that they have at the moment but that they will have opportunities <Col N="1506" /> for promotion in a much wider sphere.  That is an argument against the point I have just been making.  I desire to support the principle involved in either of these two amendments.  I would be agreeable, as are the other members, to accept the Minister's own amendment for the purpose of protecting these staffs against what might conceivably happen should their case come to be considered by the Department of Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with the points made by the Deputies on this amendment.  I thought I had given such an assurance as would reasonably be accepted when we were discussing the matter on the Second Stage.  I would like Deputies to help me in their approach to this Bill by not looking for something which, in fact, is no better than I am offering.</P>
      <P>I propose to take over the entire staff of the society.  Nobody will be dismissed.  Nobody will be redundant. The staff will be taken over <i>in toto.</i> This is a new approach to a very difficult problem, but I recognise that I am dealing with human beings who have human rights and human feelings and who are entitled to be dealt with accordingly.  Nobody will lose by being transferred from the society to the Department.  That assurance is now going on the records of this House.  It is a statement made by me in a ministerial capacity as Minister responsible for the administration of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where one has a clerical staff to deal with, such as the staff in the head office of the society, I propose to integrate that staff into the nearest comparable grade in the Civil Service. For instance, where there is an officer in a grade with a scale running from £170 to £430 per annum at present, the nearest appropriate Civil Service grade seems to be that in which the scale runs from £185 to £470, making an increase of £15 at the minimum and £40 at the maximum per year.  I propose to telescope the clerical staff of the society into the appropriate Civil Service grade.  When they are so integrated they will then be recognised civil servants.  They will then be part <Col N="1507" /> and parcel of the Civil Service.  They will then have all the rights that civil servants have and they will have a staff organisation to protect them if at any time anybody tries to worsen their conditions.  Over and above their right to have their own organisation and over and above their right to the full benefit of the conciliation and negotiation machinery now in operation in the Civil Service, they will also have the right to go before the Arbitration Tribunal where their case will be adjudicated upon and the verdict of that tribunal will be accepted by the Government, subject to the overriding authority of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>These people will be in the position that they will be civil servants.  Their destiny will be cast in the Civil Service.  Their rights will be the rights of every member of their grade.  They will have an organisation to protect them and they must think of their destiny as members of a grade in the Civil Service.  May I put this to Deputy Dr. Ryan, with his background of ministerial experience: is it wise in the Civil Service, or even in a Department of it, to create a special class of at most a couple of hundred people and give them statutory rights which are not given to existing civil servants, although those existing civil servants may have upwards of 30 years' service? Here the amendment, if carried, would impose upon me an obligation to give to persons who are not at the moment civil servants, after one day's service in the Civil Service certain statutory rights which existing civil servants with 30 years' service have not got. Looking at this matter objectively, is it not clear that it would be highly undesirable to create such a small class as this in the existing Civil Service? These people do not number more than 300; the Civil Service runs to something in the region of 30,000.</P>
    <P>These proposed rights could never be enforced.  It is useless to put them in a Bill of this kind.  Instead of offering these people something that is illusory, I am offering them instead something in which they will not have to interpret the letter of the law with all the concomitant possibilities of misconstruction, <Col N="1508" /> argument and dubiety and, in the last analysis, the possibility of having to take a chance as to what the ultimate legal interpretation will be in the courts.  I offer them instead something they can feel and sense and value.  I offer them a definite assurance that their conditions will not be worsened and that they will be integrated into existing Civil Service grades.</P>
    <P>These people are not being transferred into a bankrupt undertaking. They are not being transferred to an employer with a reputation for a high degree of rascality in his approach to wages and conditions of employment. They are being transferred to the service of this Parliament and to the service of this or any subsequent Government.  There is always this floor and these benches to raise a question if at any time the assurance I am now giving is not honoured, either by me or by my successor, whoever he may be.  I am giving this assurance not merely in the letter, but also in the spirit.  I do not want to see their conditions worsened.  I shall do everything in my power to ensure that they will not be worsened.  I want to give them a fair deal.  I want them to look upon this as a step in the implementation of this scheme. That is the major consideration for me in this matter.  I want them to pull together and work together to ensure the efficient administration of the scheme.  I deplore any attempt to set up here and there little &ldquo;cells&rdquo; of people with special rights over and above their own colleagues in the same class.</P>
    <P>If I were one of these people myself I would take the assurance I am offering much more enthusiastically than a cold assurance contained in a printed amendment which, even if passed, might not safeguard their rights, conditions and salaries to the same extent as I offer to safeguard them in the assurance I am giving now.  In principle there is nothing between us on this matter.  We want to ensure that these people will get a fair deal.  They will get that from me.  I hope they will get it from my successor.  If my successor is likely to come from the <Col N="1509" /> Fianna Fáil Party, then you can take over and you can say now that you do not want to worsen their conditions either.  In that way they will have something far more valuable than an amendment such as that suggested here.  They should accept that assurance. It is given freely by me.  If at any time while I am in the Department they are not getting either the spirit or the letter of my assurance, I shall be only too glad to deal with the specific case.</P>

I want to make sure that they will all get a fair deal.  I shall set the Deputy's mind at rest by telling him&mdash;I do not know the case he has in mind and I do not know to what grade the particular person will be assimilated&mdash;that in the long run they will get no less favourable treatment than they are getting to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think most Deputies will sympathise with the Minister's problem in this respect, but there are a couple of specific aspects of the problem to which the Minister has not alluded.  As the Minister is aware, in the Civil Service there are two or three promotion bars.  The clerical grade is one particular section.  Then comes the executive grade and next the administrative grade.  In order to get into the clerical grade in the Civil Service, one has to pass an examination initially.  If a clerical officer in the Civil Service wishes to be promoted to junior executive grade, he must, in almost every case, sit for an examination before a certain age.  The student leaving school can do an examination for the executive grade at something like an upper age limit of 20 or 21, whereas the clerical officer has an extension of the upper age limit in his favour to about 25.  Further, there are limited competitions within the Civil <Col N="1510" /> Service for clerical officers of all ages. These competitions are run in two heats.  The first heat is run within the Department itself.  Be it the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Industry and Commerce or the Department of Social Welfare, all eligible clerical officers who wish to go forward are interviewed by the senior officers of their own Departments and about 10 per cent. of these are selected to go forward for the second or final heat.  They go forward with the selected clerical officers of the other Departments and a very small percentage of the applicants in the final heat are selected for promotion to the junior executive grade.</P>
      <P>The position at present as regards promotion within the society is that young men start as cadets, and I understand they have a clear right to promotion to the clerical grade.  After that their promotion depends on their ability if satisfactory in the service. There is no promotion bar whatever within the society.  That is a particular aspect of the problem on which I should like some clarification from the Minister.  I agree that it is undesirable to create a favoured class within the Civil Service as a whole, but take, for example, a man who is being transferred from the society to the Civil Service at the maximum salary scale of a clerical officer.  I take it he would become a clerical officer.  If that man in the society waited or if the transfer were delayed for, say, a year, his salary scale might have brought him to the commencing salary scale of the junior executive grade.  Therefore, there is some hardship on that man, who is on the higher salary scale of a clerical officer in the National Health Society inasmuch as once he goes into the Civil Service his promotion does not become automatic or dependent on ability; he must go through the hazards of an examination, whether it be limited or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another problem that I foresee in the matter of cadets in the society is that I think their initial salary scale is lower than the initial salary scale for clerical officers.  The next lowest grade in the Civil Service is that of writing assistant.  Will cadets in the society <Col N="1511" /> become writing assistants in the Civil Service if the salary scale corresponds to that rank or will they become clerical officers?  I should like some clarification on these two points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can hardly expect me to sort out the entire staff of the society into their appropriate grades or to deal with the internal organisation of the society.  The position at the moment is that every member of the clerical staff of the society will be taken over into the Department and they will have no less salary than they have at the moment. They are on a scale at the moment and they will be integrated to the appropriate Civil Service grade.  That will not involve any reduction in their existing pay or any reduction in their existing maximum, if they have not yet attained the maximum.  There is a broad pattern which covers as comprehensively as I can the problems or doubts that I imagine beset the Deputy's mind.  It is clamped all the time with the assurance that their conditions will not be worsened.  I have approached this problem, I think, in a very generous way.  I have not trimmed my sails, and I think the Deputy might accept my assurance as to the treatment that will be accorded these people.</P>

At the moment the officers of my Department are actively engaged in the preparation of the heads of the new comprehensive social security scheme.  I want to get this society into the Department with the utmost expedition in order that, having got it in, we can go ahead to build up the administrative machine to take the impact of the new Act, probably within a couple of months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say to the Minister, that I quite accept that he is doing everything possible to safeguard the position of these people, but let it be credited to the various <Col N="1512" /> speakers on our side that that is their interest also.  We may differ slightly, however, as to the form that assurance or safeguard should take.  The Minister said that I wanted to make a privileged class inside the Civil Service. I do not indeed; that is a thing I should like to avoid, because I quite see that if we make a privileged class inside, there may be certain resentment from the civil servants there already. Our only object is to see that these employees of the society are taken into the Civil Service at least on as favourable a basis as they enjoy at the moment in the society.  We all, including the Minister, appear to be aiming at that.  The only thing on which we differ from the Minister at the moment is whether the clause is sufficiently clear and specific.  So far as the section goes it says only that every officer and employee of the society will be appointed to a situation in the Civil Service.  It does not say more.  I can quite understand the Minister saying that the only way to deal with this is to meet these officers and give them an assurance that they will not be badly treated and then to follow that up when the time comes by seeing that every single employee in the society is appointed to a grade in the Civil Service that will at least leave him as well off as he was before.  However, we naturally, like every Opposition in every Parliament, are anxious to have something put down in black and white in the Bill which would give these people the position they are looking for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point was mentioned by Deputy Cowan to the effect that a person going into the society always had a chance of going to the top but the clerical staff of the society who go as clerical officers into the Civil Service will have a very poor chance of going any higher. We are not pressing the Minister to make it possible for one of those clerical officers to become secretary of the Department when the vacancy arises.  We must keep in mind existing rights as distinct from the existing prospects, let us say, that these people have, and I am afraid that in legislation we cannot cover these prospects <Col N="1513" /> adequately, but we should at least keep them in mind when placing them in whatever grade they will be placed in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>I quite agree that the assurance of the Minister is very important.  As he said, it will be on the records of the House; it will always be there to be quoted by the officers and employees of this society when they are transferred.  At the same time, I think Deputy Cowan is right when he says that when it comes to a matter of dealing with these employees and officers, the Department of Finance will have the determining position and they will not pay very much regard to the Minister's assurance if it does not suit them.  They will say: &ldquo;The Act says so-and-so.&rdquo;  From that point of view, the Minister should try to meet us.</P>
    <P>I do not claim that my amendment is drafted in, perhaps, a very legal or presentable form for inclusion in a Bill, but if it were accepted in principle, or if Deputy Lehane's amendment, which is slightly different from mine, were accepted in principle, and the Minister said he would like to have it redrafted, I would be quite satisfied. He should meet us by having his assurance inserted in the Bill so that these employees and officers of the National Health Society will feel more sure of the position before they are transferred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's assurance on this matter is certainly very important but, from my experience in this House, there have been a few occasions on which we have discovered that the law as interpreted in the Civil Service &mdash;mainly in the Department of Finance &mdash;was not at all what we thought it was when we were putting it through this House.  In view of that, the Minister should have no objection to embodying in this Bill some clause that will meet the views expressed here in these amendments so that none of those people who are to be transferred will suffer in their salaries or their privileges.  Probably, in spite of anything that could be done, they will suffer in the future because their prospects for promotion will not be at all <Col N="1514" /> the same.  The least we should do&mdash; and I do not see why there should be any serious objection to it&mdash;is to put in some clause to safeguard their position. It has been the practice in transferring people from the local authorities to the Electricity Supply Board, for instance, to insert such a clause for the benefit of the people who are being transferred.  The Minister should frame something to cover the points in accordance with the views expressed here.</P>

Take the case of a national health agent down the country who lives in a certain district and operates over the same area as your present social welfare officer&mdash; I think he is described generally as an investigation officer.  Where it is found that one of these is able for the combined duties it may happen that the Department will ask the national health agent to move elsewhere, and that may not suit.  In such a case, what are the rights of the agent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>What happens in that case is that the national health agent does an entirely different kind of work. The social welfare officer will continue to cover the whole range of schemes administered by the Department, while the agent may be confined to a limited portion of that work.  The fact that the agent is there will not imperil the existence of the social welfare officer, nor will the social welfare <Col N="1515" /> officer affect the agent.  You cannot amalgamate the duties because there is an enormous dissimilarity in the scales of pay.  Again, one will not be able to do the work of the other.</P>

      <P>I have listened to the Minister in order to try to get a clear picture.  The Minister intends to take over every officer of the society and he has given the House the assurance that their terms of service will not be worsened.  He refers to the officers as &ldquo;staff&rdquo; and he mentions some 300 are involved.  That is what is disturbing me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that there are approximately 300 indoor staff and 300 agents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

      <P>I understood from the Minister that he would take over the staff and he referred to the inadvisability of setting up within the service special privileges for a small group of 200 or 300.  I want it made quite clear that he means to take over the existing indoor staff, the outdoor staff and the temporary part-time officers of the society; I want an assurance that they are all included in his comprehensive take-over and his comprehensive promise that there will be no exceptions made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a great deal of substance in what has been said as to the value of the assurance the Minister is giving.  The Minister is well aware that he has not the final word in this matter; he has not, in fact, general control over the Civil Service.  He cannot promote a man in his own Department without <Col N="1516" /> getting the consent of the Minister for Finance and he cannot determine the conditions of any of the officers of his Department without the sanction of the Minister for Finance.  So far as there is going to be any guarantee that these people will carry over with them into the Civil Service the rights which they now enjoy, that guarantee can only be given, not by the assurance of any Minister, not even the Minister for Finance, but by writing it into the Bill.</P>
      <P>If there were, as there might quite easily be, a change in the Department of Social Welfare, if the Tánaiste were to be promoted to a better place or if the people thought that his services might be more usefully employed outside this House, what he has said here to-day would not be worth the paper on which it will be printed in the Official Report.  It would not bind anyone.  It is of no value whatever to the people whose future is involved in what the Minister proposes to do in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard that the existing members of the staff can rise therein from subordinate posts in the service of the National Health Insurance Society to almost the very top.  I think, in fact, some of the existing higher personnel have risen in that way.  Now, it is quite absurd, and the Minister knows it is absurd, to hold out any hope to those people that they are going to enjoy that right when they enter the Civil Service.  But the Minister can do this.  He can have regard to the fact that they are going to be deprived of those prospects, and he can, by giving them better salary scales, compensate them for what he is depriving them of.  He will not do that, and he will not be able to do that, unless this House by legislation gives him a definite direction that he must have regard to what those people are losing as well as what he thinks they are going to gain by entering the Civil Service.  I am quite certain that the Minister wants to be fair and just, and I am quite sure that the assurances which he has given have been given sincerely; but I would ask him, as a man who has a long experience of the House and now almost three years as a Minister of State, to have regard to what he himself must know.  He must <Col N="1517" /> know that he cannot promote an officer in his Department, and that he cannot appoint an officer to his Department unless it has the sanction of the Minister for Finance: that he cannot alter salary scales or any of the conditions of service appertaining to any officer or grade in his Department without the sanction of the Minister for Finance, and that, so far as the general Civil Service is concerned, it is the Minister for Finance who is responsible for its administration and for determining and laying down the conditions under which its officers are going to serve.  Therefore, I say that the Minister, having given those assurances in all sincerity, ought to take the ordinary elementary precaution of seeing that he will be in a position to implement them.  He cannot do that, and he must know that he cannot do it, unless, as I say, the law definitely lays upon him the obligation to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it mischief making to ask the Tánaiste to take steps to see that his pledges will be kept?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied that the assurances which I have given to the House in the name of the Government will be honoured.  The only danger I can see of their being repudiated or not being kept is if Deputy MacEntee should ever happen to have any responsibility for the economic destiny of the people affected by this Bill.  There is no question whatever of a worsening of conditions of this transferred staff.  Deputy MacEntee ought to stop his mischief making contributions on this Bill&mdash;his endeavour to upset the staff by trying to convince them by his perverted words that their conditions in the future are going to be in any way worsened.  I do not know why it should be raised here that the staff in question will not have good opportunities for promotion in the future.  Not alone will they be bringing into the Department of Social Welfare all the higher vacancies which exist at the moment <Col N="1518" /> but they will be coming into a large Department where there are a considerable number of high posts.  They are coming into a Department where all the evidence is that it will be an expanding one.  Why it should be suggested that the staff of the National Health Insurance Society are such an inferior variety that they will not have a chance of getting some promotions, and a fair share of the promotions that are going in an expanding Department, I do not know.  I rate their intelligence much higher than that.</P>
      <P>I am quite satisfied, from what I know of the set-up of the National Health Insurance Society, that many of the staff there will have very good chances of promotion in the Department to which they will be transferred. Why, at this stage, raise doubts in their minds which are not supported by facts, I do not know.  Of course, Deputy MacEntee wants to be mischievous about this.  So far as the staff are concerned, they can take this from me, that they will have all the prospects of promotion in the Department in which they are being graded, appropriately with the other grades in the Department; their salaries will not be worsened and their conditions will not be worsened.  Their lot will be cast with the lot of the other members of the grade to which they are assigned. They will have staff organisations to make a case for them; they will have negotiation arrangements, conciliation arrangements and an independent arbitration tribunal at the end of all that.  Could anything be more reasonable in the matter of taking in a staff of that kind not, as I have said, to a bankrupt concern but into the service of the entire State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is any ground whatever for these fears.  Certainly, the fears of Deputy MacEntee in the matter are not shared by the unions which cater for these people, and are not shared even by the staff themselves. They know perfectly well that they will get a fair and a square deal, and that they are being given an opportunity for promotion in the Department. I think that I have gone to the limit of reason in giving the assurances which I gave to-day.  I do not take the doubting view that Deputy <Col N="1519" /> MacEntee does that a Minister's assurance in this House does not mean something.  The assurances which I am giving to a staff that is being transferred to a Civil Service Department should, I think, bind my successor to approach this matter reasonably, just as I would regard them as binding me if given by any other Minister to a staff, to whom this is, as it were, the moral basis of a contract.  If we want to play politics on this we can do that, but I have gone as far as anyone could reasonably go.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the whole matter in a sympathetic way, recognising that I was dealing with human beings. I think it would be highly undesirable, both for the officers themselves and for the Civil Service, if we were to create within the Civil Service a tiny little cell of people who imagined that they had got security by an amendment of this kind.  The more they can think of themselves as one with their colleagues, the better for themselves.  The greater sense of oneness they develop with their colleagues of the same grade the better, and the sooner they learn to think of one grade and of getting the whole grade to advance and improve itself the better for themselves.</P>
    <P>It is undesirable that we should create a special class in the Civil Service and give it rights against 30,000 other civil servants, give it rights which civil servants of 30 years' service are not getting.  I think any reasonable person will say that this matter is being met in a broadminded and understanding way.  I say that the staff of the National Health Insurance Society can trust the promise made here to-day will be honoured both by me and by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I must protest against the attitude of the Tánaiste regarding myself personally and regarding the merits of this proposal. I support Deputy Ryan's amendment because I know something about the Civil Service.  I know something about the manner in which it is administered and I know what can happen.  I have seen it happen by an Act of this Oireachtas passed at the <Col N="1520" /> instance of some of the Minister's colleagues. I have seen men and women deprived of their posts in the Civil Service because they did not accept a test that was not a condition of service when they entered.  I am not going to allow any of the Minister's cheap jibes to deter me from advocating what I believe to be just and right.</P>
      <P>The Minister has talked about sympathy. A little practical application of this great well of the milk of human kindness that is bubbling up in his heart in the form of a properly drafted amendment to the section would go much further to reassure the people who naturally are afraid that their future will be jeopardised than any of the soft talk in which the Minister has indulged.</P>
      <P>Let us examine some of the arguments which the Minister has advanced against the amendment.  He has said that it wants to create a cell in the Civil Service.  There is no question of creating a cell in the Civil Service or creating a specially privileged class in the Civil Service.  Perhaps the Minister has not read the amendment and perhaps therefore I should read it, since he is too indolent to try to read it and understand it for himself.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where an officer or an employee of the society is appointed to a situation in the Civil Service, ... he shall be appointed within a grade at least as favourable, having regard to existing rights and salary scale, as his or her existing grade in the society's service.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This operates once and once only.  It operates at the date upon which an officer of the society is taken into the service of the State and the moment he is taken into the service of the State&mdash; in accordance, we hope, with the provisions of this amendment&mdash;he ceases to be any more than a part of the general body.  He is not a separate cell enjoying, as the Minister tried to suggest, special privileges that demarcate him from all his colleagues around him. He is in a grade; he enjoys the salary and conditions of service of the grade to which he is appointed no more and no less&mdash;that is what we are contending for&mdash;than any other member of that <Col N="1521" /> grade.  In so far as the Minister has reasoned that the amendment would create a privileged class in the Civil Service he has no justification whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Let us examine this from another point of view.  The Minister says that when these officers and employees of the society enter the Civil Service they will have reserved to them&mdash;that is what the Minister said&mdash;exactly the same opportunities for promotion as those which they now enjoy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I said no such thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not say that and I am glad that he has admitted he did not say that because that is one of the things which they are losing.  The Minister said, however, that they are going to be no worse off, that their position will not be worsened in any way.  He will not deny that he said that.  That is the assurance he gave the House, but Deputy Ryan has pointed out that these officers and employees do enjoy peculiar rights and peculiar opportunities of promotion and that they are going to lose them.  All that is asked by the amendment is that when these officers, who are going to lose the opportunities which they at present enjoy, are taken into the Civil Service regard will be had to the fact that they are losing those opportunities in determining the grade to which they will be appointed.  That is what we have asked.</P>
      <P>As the Minister himself admitted these officers at the present moment do enjoy these special opportunities for promotion.  They will be brought into the Civil Service not as members of a departmental grade but as members of the general service grades. What does that mean?  If a man is a member of a departmental grade he enjoys rights and opportunities in relation to promotion in priority over members of the general service grade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The officers of the National Health Insurance Society as matters stand at present enjoy those rights in the same way as members of a departmental grade would, but once an officer of the National Health Insurance Society becomes absorbed in the general service <Col N="1522" /> grade these special rights and priorities with regard to promotion and special types of duty immediately disappear and, far from continuing to retain and enjoy the rights and opportunities for promotion which they now have, the officers and employees of the National Health Insurance Society will find that those rights and opportunities will be very severely restricted and diminished. The moment it becomes necessary to appoint on promotion a number of persons to one of the general service classes to discharge duties which would be analogous to those discharged at the present moment by grades in the National Health Insurance Society you will find that every general service officer in every State Department will want to be allowed to go for those vacancies on exactly the same terms as, upon no less favoured terms than, the officers and employees of the society who may be transferred to the Department of Social Welfare.  That is the position.</P>
    <P>I told people who have come to me on this matter and who are uneasy&mdash; they are uneasy about their future&mdash; about what is going to happen as far as their present opportunities for promotion are concerned, that in my view once they enter the general service grade in the Civil Service they have got to take their chance with the rest. Once they are in they stand on exactly the same plane as every other member of the Civil Service and it is not practicable that they should stand on any different plane.  We do not want to make them a special cell, as the Minister said, nor do they want to be a special cell, but we do say that when they are coming into the service for the first time regard should be had to the fact that their conditions will be worsened in that particular respect&mdash;I do not suggest they will be worsened generally&mdash;when we are determining the grade to which they will be appointed and the salary scale which that grade will carry.</P>
    <P>That is what we are asking to do in the amendment.  It is a perfectly reasonable thing to do.  However glad they may be to enter the Civil Service, the National Health Insurance Society is not being taken over by the Minister <Col N="1523" /> at the instance of these people; he is taking it over for reasons of his own, reasons of State, let us say; in fact, to be quite candid, I think for reasons of political expediency.  But however it may be, he is not taking it over at the instance of these people.  He is taking it over for his own profit&mdash;not his own personal profit&mdash;in the sense that he, as Minister, is a public corporation sole and entire.  He is going to take over these funds and this staff and I think he is bound, in equity, when doing that, at least to compensate the people for anything they may be losing.  That is all we are asking him to do.  We are asking him to accept this amendment in order that, if he does give this guarantee that he is prepared to do it, he will be able to implement that guarantee.  I do not see that there is anything unreasonable in that and I hope that, when a case is put in the calm, reasoned and logical manner in which I have put it, the Minister will on this occasion treat the matter seriously.  He has told us that the officers and employees of the National Health Insurance Society are intelligent people, but he ought to have remembered that when he was last on his feet because they could see through him as well as I could.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister repeated on the last occasion on which he spoke that we were seeking to make a privileged class of these officers.  I cannot see how the Minister can argue that, because, as Deputy MacEntee has said, we are seeking only that they shall enter the Civil Service in what might be regarded as a just and proper grade.  Once in, they are civil servants like any of the others and I do not see that they are a privileged class.  As a matter of fact, in his argument, the Minister spoke of putting them into the Civil Service on a just and proper grade and he does not accuse himself of making them a privileged class.  Why then should he accuse us of seeking to do so?  It is not our intention.  Assurances from the Minister are very good, but I must say that in all the many years I was a Minister, when I brought in many Bills in which employees were concerned, I was never let away with <Col N="1524" /> assurances.  The Opposition, and, in particular, the Opposition led by Deputy Norton at the time, were never prepared to accept assurances.  They always insisted that a clause should go into the Bill, and, so far as I remember, that was done.  I remember arguing very strongly on one occasion that assurances were quite sufficient and Deputy Norton at the time was gracious enough to say that he believed I was sincere and genuine in what I promised but he added that he wanted it in the Bill.  We are in the same position. We believe that the Minister is sincere in the assurances he gives, but we still believe that a clause should go into the Bill, because, as we have argued already, when it comes to be interpreted by the Department of Finance, they will rely on what is written into the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister also spoke about the chances these people have of making their case known.  They will have their own organisation and he has undertaken to have their arguments or grievances considered, and he went on to say that there will be a tribunal to which they can appeal.  On what will they appeal to that tribunal?  The tribunal, again, will be tied to the Bill if there is any appeal to them, and if there is nothing in the Bill except the simple words we have here as to appointment to the Civil Service, the tribunal will say: &ldquo;You have been appointed to the Civil Service and we cannot do anything more for you.&rdquo;  If they want to argue that they have been appointed to the Civil Service in a grade inferior to that to which they should have been appointed, having regard to their position in the society, I do not see what the tribunal can do for them.  If there is to be nothing in the Bill on the lines of the clause proposed in my amendment and Deputy Lehane's amendment, I think we should leave the tribunal out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is fair for the Minister to accuse this side of a political manæuvre, as I think he said.  It is all very well to use such tactics when you have no other argument to meet the case put up.  It is a nice answer to make that the Opposition are playing politics, but it does not answer the arguments put up.  The Minister may <Col N="1525" /> not be able to answer them and, in those circumstances, it may be a good reply.  It is quite a common thing for Ministers of this Government to answer the Opposition by saying that the Opposition wants to create sabotage. I do not want to create discontent amongst the staff of the National Health Insurance Society.  We should make them quite content in going into the Civil Service and that was our object in putting down this amendment, as I am sure it was Deputy Lehane's object in putting down his amendment&mdash;that we should take them over as a contented staff and not try to create discontent amongst them, as we are accused of seeking to do by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Opposition in any Parliament has a duty to perform and it is a duty which I think the Opposition in this Parliament always performed irrespective of what Government was in power. I know that, when we brought in Bills dealing with the taking over of concerns where staffs were involved, we were always watched very closely by the Opposition.  The various clauses were examined very carefully and amendments were proposed by the Opposition to safeguard the staffs in all these cases.  I think that is a proper function for an Opposition, because there is always the fear that the Government are anxious to take over concerns of this kind in order to get on with the work, and, in their anxiety to take the concerns over, may overlook the just claims of the staff.  It is up to the Opposition to see that the conditions of that staff are not worsened in any way.  It is a very serious thing when you take over a concern of this kind to worsen in any way the prospects of the staff.  I know that in the case of a junior clerical officer, he can be told: &ldquo;You were only 20 years of age going into this society and you hoped some day to get to the very top as secretary.  When you go into the Civil Service, it may be impossible to arrange that for you.&rdquo;  You could also say to that officer that by industry and so on, by taking the necessary examinations to get over the barriers in the Civil Service, he could do it, but we should keep in mind that they had <Col N="1526" /> these prospects and these possibilities in the society when arranging the grade into which they may go.</P>
    <P>I want to make this plain: we are not advocating a privileged class.  We are merely arguing that they should enter the Civil Service on a grade which will be fair, because, once in, they become civil servants and I do not think we can do any more for them.</P>

I do not think any of us has accused the other of being insincere in seeking to ensure that this is done properly but we differ with regard to the means.  The Minister says his assurance is sufficient; we say it should be written into the Bill.  We differ on the means, as I say, and if we cannot settle it any other way, we can only settle it in the division lobbies.</P>

I gather from his last remarks that he rather departed from that position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make this point.  It is impossible, without the creation of a privileged class, to write the amendment in the terms tabled by Deputy Dr. Ryan into the Bill.  I am sorry that the amendment is framed as it is, because I feel there would be a much greater possibility of doing service to the staff and achieving for the staff what I think we all agree we want to achieve for them, were Deputy Dr. Ryan's amendment not presented in its present form.  Were the Minister confronted with the succeeding amendment which stands in my <Col N="1527" /> name, I think he would at least be prepared to say that he would bring in some amendment, if he could not accept that amendment, which would cover that general position.</P>
      <P>Of course the Minister is a superb tactician in this matter and I never saw him display it to better advantage than he did this evening, because, apprehensive that there might be on this side of the House some people like myself who would be overborne by Deputy Dr. Ryan's reasonableness, the Minister conjured Deputy MacEntee out of the vasty depths and made it impossible for anybody on this side of the House to support the amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lehane, after the introduction of this amendment, argued that he was more in favour of this amendment than he was of his own.  He agreed with Deputy Dr. Ryan that a better phraseology could be adopted to cover both.  He also agreed with the suggestion of Deputy Dr. Ryan that, if the Minister would indicate his acceptance of the principle embodied in either or both, it would suit him also.  Now he does not want it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to try to get the Minister to understand what is in our <Col N="1529" /> minds over here.  As I understand Deputy Dr. Ryan's amendment, we are taking into the service of the State a group of people.  As there is going to be a difference between their future employment and their former employment, with particular reference to possibilities of promotion and to certain salary arrangements, we are anxious that a certain accounting should be made as to what their prospects would be by putting them into a certain grade on their entry into the service of the State where, from then on, they would carry on exactly as the rest of the State servants do.  Deputy Lehane says that he does not see that in the amendment.  I take it that he agrees that what I am saying is what should be in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it would be a very desirable thing to do if it were possible so to frame an amendment without creating a special cell within the Civil Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not unknown that amendments have been moved by members of the Opposition or by Indepenents which suggested a certain principle and, when the principle had been accepted by the House, it was found that the wording of the amendment would not have the effect intended.  It was always agreed in such a case that the amendment should be withdrawn and sent to the draftsman to redraft it for adoption on the Report Stage, the principle having been accepted by the Minister.  If we are all in agreement with the principle that has been argued, why does the Minister say: &ldquo;I have given you the assurances as far as I am personally concerned and I intend to see them carried out&rdquo;?  We know that any assurance given by a Minister, unless it is specifically embodied in the Bill, is of no value whatever when interpreted outside the House.  We have had Acts of Parliament discussed in courts of law and we have had people reading the verbatim report of what was said in the House and the judge saying: &ldquo;This is what is in the Act.&rdquo;  Deputy Lehane will not deny that.  I do not doubt that the Minister means what he says.  Everybody has been gracious enough to accept that <Col N="1530" /> as far as he is concerned.  If he is in agreement with the principle&mdash;if Deputy Lehane is in agreement with the principle&mdash;then let us get from him an undertaking that if either or both of these amendments are withdrawn he will, on the Report Stage, have drafted and put on the Order Paper for the consideration of the House an amendment which will bring about what we are asking should be done here.  Unless that undertaking is given by the Minister we say that we have no alternative but to press the amendment.  We know that an injustice could happen&mdash; might happen&mdash;particularly when it comes to the consideration of the service of these people afterwards.  I would strongly urge the Minister to accept the request and recognise that what we are saying is, in fact, correct.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan pointed out that when the Fianna Fáil Government brought in legislation, which affected the employment of people being taken into the service, the present Minister who was then Deputy Norton, the Leader of the Labour Party, demanded and had inscribed in the Bill which was then in question exactly what he wanted as regards protection of the persons whose employment was being affected by a change of control.</P>

      <P>When speaking a short while ago, Deputy Dr. Ryan said that when he, as Minister, introduced certain legislation on behlaf of the Department of Agriculture the present Minister who was then Deputy Norton, Leader of the Labour Party, was not satisfied to accept the assurances on the part of the Minister and insisted on having inscribed in the Act the protection which he considered these employees who were being taken over from other employment should have. Now the Minister asks me to quote the instance.  I cannot.  I have only referred to what Deputy Dr. Ryan has said.  He is here now and perhaps he can amplify his statement.  However, I challenge the Minister on this: he knows that unless a certain thing is specifically stated in the Bill, when it becomes an Act, all the discussion and all the assurances and all the promises given by a Minister in this House, or even by the Taoiseach, have no value in a contest in a court of law.</P>
      <P>I know of a case which comes to my mind.  I remember that when the present President of the country was Minister for Finance he introduced a measure setting up a Racing Control Board.  During the discussion of that measure there was certain criticism, and doubts were expressed as to the certain rights of certain people being maintained.  The then Minister gave personal assurances that, as far as he was concerned, this is what it meant and this is what he intended to see carried out.  Subsequently&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>At the time somebody suggested that the present Minister, then Deputy Norton, had a well of feeling in his heart.  I suggest now that, instead of the Minister having a well of feeling in his heart, he has only a cell of feeling.  That is all he has. Having given consideration to the situation which is created and which affects a certain group of people, we want to ensure that what the Minister has said is his intention will, in fact, be carried out.  If we do not succeed in carrying our point here and if it subsequently turns out that people are dissatisfied and have a grievance about it, it will end there unless an amendment is brought in either by the Minister or by somebody else.  I would point out that the Minister did not say, in this connection, that he would introduce an amendment if, afterwards, it turned out that there were certain injustices as a result of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to a particular section. The Minister in his jocular way asked: &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;  A number of permanent full-time agents in the City of Dublin and in the county borough will, if they are taken in under the terms <Col N="1533" /> of this Bill, right from the start be taken in at a great disadvantage.  Because of their age and the rights of salary which they enjoy, they will be appointed to very menial positions in the service of the State&mdash;positions not at all comparable with the status and prestige they enjoy at present, notwithstanding their low salary and their few years of service.  If the Minister examines the matter he will find that I am correct, and if he has examined it and does not deal with it he knows that I am correct.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Time will tell.  It tells a lot of things and it will tell about that too.  Let me say, in conclusion, that we are not asking for the creation of a special privileged group of people within the service.  All we are asking for is that when they enter the service there will be a calculation or a recognition of what they are losing by being taken into the Civil Service and that that will be borne in mind when appointing them to grades in the Civil Service.  That is what we are asking for.</P>

      <P>It is rather a pity that Deputy Lehane has reduced this debate, which is an attempt to preserve for people their existing rights, to a depth of petty spleen that I think this House has scarcely ever been pained to witness before.  Apparently, something that I said when I was last speaking on this amendment, some argument I used in trying to press my point on the Minister, so hurt Deputy Lehane that out of fervent devotion to the Minister he is going to punish not me, because he can do nothing to me, but officers and employees of the <Col N="1534" /> National Health Insurance Society. Everything, according to him, was going beautifully until I intervened.  I gathered from his own speech that he had already announced to the House that he regarded Deputy Dr. Ryan's amendment as a better one than his own&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is a great pity that Deputy Lehane believes that the business of the State can be conducted according to the rules of the nursery and that if he is not prepared to listen to argument all he has to do is to try and shout it down.  It is not Deputy MacEntee and the Tánaiste who are concerned in this matter.  Neither the Tánaiste nor I, nor even Deputy Lehane, will be transferred to the service of the State.  We are not going to become civil servants, but there are hundreds of men and women who will be transferred and it is their interests that are involved.  It is their interests we are discussing and the personal idiosyncrasies of Deputy MacEntee should not be allowed to influence the votes and opinions of members of this House in relation to the particular interests of these persons.  This amendment should be considered and discussed on a basis of justice and equity. We should examine the proposals in the Bill and in these two amendments in that spirit.</P>

      <P>Sir, I was not here. I therefore readily accept what Deputy Lehane has said.  I only hope that the printed record will justify his statements. Let us see what the two amendments are that appear to be at issue.  One is that by Deputy Dr. Ryan, which proposes:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where an officer or an employee of the society is appointed to a situation in the Civil Service ... he shall be appointed within a grade at least as favourable, having regard to existing rights and salary scale, as his or her existing grade in the society's service.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>For some reason or other, I understand that does not appeal to Deputy Lehane and, presumably, to other members of the House.  As against that, Deputy Lehane proposes:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a person is appointed to a situation in the Civil Service of the Government by virtue of sub-section (1) of this section such appointment shall be to a situation in a grade not less favourable as to salary scale as such person's existing grade in the service of the society.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1536" /> Now, there is a difference in phraseology. One says: &ldquo;at least as favourable,&rdquo; the other says: &ldquo;not less favourable&rdquo;.  I suppose I would not be capable of discussing how many angels could pirouette on the point of a needle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy really needs is a sleeping tablet.  If I could distinguish as to the shade of meaning that divided &ldquo;at least as favourable&rdquo; from the phrase &ldquo;not less favourable&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not see anything about &ldquo;existing rights&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we can take it that, in regard to the particular type of grade to which they want the staff to be appointed, Deputy Lehane and Deputy Dr. Ryan are <i>ad idem.</i>  They both want the same thing, so far as that phrase is concerned.  Then Deputy Dr. Ryan's amendment goes on to say: &ldquo;having regard to existing rights and salary scale,&rdquo; whereas Deputy Lehane only wishes the Minister to have regard to such persons' existing grade in the service of the society.  The Deputy has admitted, and servants of the society have told me, that they have special opportunities for promotion.  I do not think Deputy Lehane will deny that he made that statement.  If he does, I shall have to make up my mind that henceforward when he speaks I will not be able to believe my own ears. Therefore, what the Deputy proposes to do is to appoint these people to the Civil Service on a basis that will not be as favourable as that which they now enjoy in the service of the society. He is saying to the Minister: &ldquo;When you bring these people into the service, the only thing I want you to consider in relation to them is their existing salary scale; so far as I am concerned, you are at full liberty to disregard any opportunities of promotion which they may possess at the moment.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the difference between the two amendments.  Deputy Dr. Ryan wishes to bind the Minister to have regard <Col N="1537" /> to the existing rights, which, of course, means the right to participate in the normal flow of promotion in the special service of the society.  That is important, since when these people come into the Civil Service they are leaving the special service of the society and becoming merged in the general service grades.  These opportunities for promotion which are confined to them at the moment will be thrown wide open to the thousands of their colleagues whom they will meet in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>We quite frankly admit that these opportunities for promotion must be open to everybody inside the service but the mere fact that the posts are going to be competed for by hundreds or thousands where, perhaps, before they may have been competed for by only a comparatively small number means that the position of the people who are entering the service now for the first time is going to be worsened. We say that, in justice, the Tánaiste, when he is appointing these people to posts in the Civil Service, should have regard to that fact.  That is the difference between the stand, if you like, which we are making and that which Deputy Lehane, I think, has run away from.  Apart altogether from the rather humorous and merry excuse that my turn of phrase does not appeal to him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There are at least two precedents to prove the contrary. I referred, when I was speaking first, to the fact that the position of one-time serving members of the Civil Service was very greatly worsened by reason of the fact that they were compelled either to take a test or make a declaration of loyalty or to leave the service. That happened in 1923.  When we came into office, we decided that that wrong <Col N="1538" /> was going to be redressed and we passed an Act which brought these people back into the service.  They had been out of the service for nine years and, therefore, the question arose, how were they going to be brought back in a position which would at least give them approximate justice, that is to say, that they would be compensated for the time they had been out of the service and for the opportunities for promotion which they had lost.  We succeeded in devising a way of overcoming that problem, which is just the problem that Deputy Lehane denies is capable of solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>It is peculiar that within the last week I got a letter from one of the people referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I said there were two precedents and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, if he were here, would bear me out in this, that the second was the position of the officers of local authorities who were similarly dismissed, who had to be brought back and reinstated and whose reinstatement presented precisely the same sort of problem as we are dealing with here.  A <i>modus operandi</i> was found to deal with that situation.  The position, therefore, is that there are at least two precedents which show that, so far from its being impracticable to give effect to Deputy Dr. Ryan's amendment, it is quite possible and quite practicable to do so.  In fact, the position is very much simpler. The whole thing could be done by three men sitting down and considering the matter and finding an answer to all these queries inside of one week.  That is the position.</P>
      <P>Therefore, there is no justification for rejecting Deputy Dr. Ryan's amendment on the ground that it cannot be done, because this thing about lost opportunities and lost rights has been dealt with before and there is a procedure that has been established and which worked, on the whole, satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what we are asking.  That is the sort of grace we are asking should be extended to the servants and employees of the National Health Insurance Society.  Despite what Deputy Lehane said, despite what the Tánaiste <Col N="1539" /> or anybody else said, I do not think it it a sufficient ground for rejecting Deputy Dr. Ryan's amendment that anything I have said may have offended either the Tánaiste or Deputy Lehane.  As I said at the outset, we are not the people involved.  The people whose future is involved in this are the men and women of this society, some of them with long service, as Deputy Briscoe said, some of them young men and women who have entered the service of the society within the comparatively recent past.  It is their future, it is their rights, that are at stake here and we should surely rise above this sort of petty Party difference when we are discussing them, and try to do justice.</P>
    <P>This is the last point, Sir.  You have been very patient.  Somebody may say to me that these amendments are not necessary.  That is the plea of the Tánaiste.  I am an old hand at drafting Bills.  I have been Minister for Finance, Minister for Industry and Commerce, Minister for Local Government and Public Health and Minister for Local Government.  In those capacities I have seen this work of drafting from the two ends and I know precisely how sub-section (1) of Section 7 of this Bill came to be drafted.  I am perfectly certain that, when the draft heads of this Bill were first submitted to the Department of Finance, it contained some sort of proposal upon the lines of one or other of these amendments and there was a long struggle. There was a long struggle because, naturally, the Tánaiste, like the rest of us, would realise what is being done and would try to ensure that the people who were coming into the service would be contented and would be fairly dealt with and he would have put up in the heads of the Bill a sub-section more or less on these lines.  It went to the Department of Finance and there, Deputy McGilligan, the present Minister for Finance, did what I would have done as Minister.  He would try to ensure that the Minister for Finance had as free a hand as possible in dealing with the Civil Service, that he was not going to be hampered or restricted in any way by convenants which would create difficulties <Col N="1540" /> for him with other civil servants and might appear to fetter or curtail his rights and his obligations as Minister for Finance.  He has obligations to the general public which are separate and apart from those which the Minister for Social Welfare may have to the people whom he is taking over.  Therefore, the Minister for Finance had this bald statement written in the Bill&mdash;that subject to such and such, where a person was, immediately before the transfer day, an officer or employee of the society, such person is hereby, notwithstanding anything contained in any other enactment&mdash;that refers to the Civil Service (Regulation) Acts&mdash;appointed to a situation in the Civil Service of the Government.</P>
    <P>That is all it says&mdash;appointed to a situation in the Civil Service of the Government.  Under that section, as it stands, a superintending officer&mdash;I think that is what they are called&mdash;a senior outdoor inspector&mdash;could be appointed to the rank of writing assistant. I do not say it would be done, but he could be appointed to the rank of writing assistant in the Civil Service and the terms of sub-section (1) of Section 7 would be complied with and he would have no remedy as this Bill stands.  That is the position.  I do not want to make mischief.  That is the position and, since we will not, apparently, get support for our amendment, it is as well that the people involved in Section 7 should know what is at stake.  Any person who is offered the most menial post in the Civil Service has no redress under this Bill.  It does not matter how high his rank is in the society.  If that should be done&mdash; I do not think it will be done and I do not suggest it will, because I do not think the Tánaiste or anybody else would have the hardihood to do that, or indeed the will or the desire to do it&mdash;the people affected by that act have no redress.  That shows how important it is that we should have here in this statute some such proviso as Deputy Dr. Ryan has embodied in his amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee is filling a rather unusual rôle this evening. He is the protector of the destinies and <Col N="1541" /> the economic interests of small men and small women.  He appoints himself to that position notwithstanding his appallingly bad record in the matter of wages when he was a Minister in this House.  I think the Deputy was the architect of the famous, or shall I say infamous, Civil Service cuts Bill of 1934, in which he smashed to smithereens people's rights and said: &ldquo;Even though you have Treaty rights and statutory rights given to you by this House, I will tear them to pieces and I will slash your salaries.&rdquo;  Deputy MacEntee was the architect of that. Can anyone believe this is the same Deputy MacEntee who appears in this hypocritical rôle to-night?  He was the Cæsar of the Custom House.  His writ ran through the country.  Local authorities were prevented from increasing by as little as 2s. a week the wages of their workers, all under the ukase of Deputy MacEntee, Minister for Local Government. His whole policy was to keep wages down.  The Wages Standstill Orders were used by him time out of number to keep the wages of the workers down.  Deputy MacEntee was the architect of most of the disgraceful circulars dealing with wages and salaries.  Yet, Deputy MacEntee comes into this House this evening the saviour of the small man of no wealth and no power in the National Health Insurance Society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite clearly, whatever faults the Deputy has or from whatever disabilities he suffers, introspection is not one of them.  If the Deputy suffered in the remotest degree from introspection, he would assume a much more modest rôle.  He would certainly not appear here in the rôle of a gladiator entering the arena to fight for the National Health Insurance Society's staff.  If the Deputy wishes to put the matter to the test to-morrow and engage in such frolics, if he consults the staff of the National Health Insurance Society as to whether they think they will get a better Bill from him or from me, I shall abide by the result. But when they remember Deputy MacEntee's low-wage past and his low-wage policy and the bitter and vituperative language he used to justify that policy both here and on the public platforms, they will not be misled <Col N="1542" /> by the Deputy's cant and humbug here to-night.  These people may not hold high rank in the society, but the Deputy does his intelligence less than justice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is not often the Deputy comes into the House but, when he does, he learns something. Deputy MacEntee talks about opportunities for promotion.  He makes the most wild and reckless statements knowing full well that they are not true.  He conjures up a situation in which the staff of the National Health Insurance Society will be transferred to the Department, graded as clerical officers and thereby lose access to posts which exist at present in the society. Let us see what are the posts in the society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is no use my pointing out that I did not use the phrase &ldquo;graded as clerical officers&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Graded as general service clerical officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that. General service grades was what I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Here are the facts.  If you exclude clerical officers and supervising officers in the society, there are only eight departmental staff officers and five staff officers of the society. The assistant secretary and secretary need not be members of the society's staff at all.  They can be outsiders.  In fact, I think the first secretary was not a member of the society.  Therefore, the opportunities for promotion about which Deputy MacEntee talks tot up <Col N="1544" /> to eight departmental staff officers and five staff officers.  These are scattered over 24 supervising clericals, 49 clerical men, 134 clerical women, 74 junior clerical women and 76 clerical women. These are the 13 posts talked about by Deputy MacEntee as if this place was an El Dorado of promotion from the point of view of the clerical staff.  How many people will be secretary of that society in their lifetime?  How many will be assistant secretary?  How many of them within the span of human life will become staff officers or departmental staff officers?  It only requires a simple sum in addition to see what are the prospects of promotion in the society.</P>
      <P>But, whatever they are, they will be preserved to the extent that the entire staff of the society will come into the Department.  To that extent, the opportunities for promotion will remain because all these posts will be assimilated to the appropriate Civil Service posts.  At the same time the staff of the National Health Insurance Society will have opened up to them much wider opportunities for promotion than they enjoy at present.  More posts will be available to them.  Far from there being any restriction on their promotion, they will in future have much wider prospects of promotion.  Anybody who studies the matter knows that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>They are promoted to the next grade, minor staff officer, and then to staff officer, higher executive officer, assistant principal and principal. All that is departmental promotion <Col N="1545" /> but Deputy MacEntee sought to give the impression that folk from other Departments will try to filch these posts from the Department of Social Welfare.  That is entirely wrong.  A moment's reflection would have convinced any reasonable person that it was a gross misstatement and misrepresentation of the position.  I do not hope to convince Deputy MacEntee.  I have long since given up that fruitless occupation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have now told you what the position is so far as the higher posts are concerned.  Does Deputy Dr. Ryan still share Deputy MacEntee's view?  There are 13 higher posts in the society and the occupants of these posts will go into the Department of Social Welfare where there will be a much larger number of higher posts.  Deputy Dr. Ryan must know that so far from restricting the opportunities for promotion of officers transferred from the society to the Department, these officers are getting a much wider opportunity than they had before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us pass to the question of what is to happen the clerical staff taken over from the National Health Insurance Society.  I have said in the most positive way that they will be assimilated into analogous Civil Service grades.  There is no intention to worsen their position. Not only will the salary not be worsened, but in many instances it will be improved.  In the case of clerical officers, the maximum salary is increased from £430 to £470.  That <Col N="1546" /> will be done in the next couple of months when the scheme is pushed forward.  The staff of the National Health Insurance Society have no fear that it will not be done.  The organisations catering for them expect that it will be done.  I say to those Deputies, who want to be convinced that these people are getting a fair deal, that they can be satisfied that as sure as they are sitting here to-night what I am saying now in respect to the personnel will be implemented. There will be no worsening of conditions.  In many instances there will be an improvement in salaries.  There will be improved pensions and in my view there will be wider opportunities for promotion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an essential difference between the amendment tabled in my name and the amendment tabled by Deputy Dr. Ryan.  The purpose which Deputy Dr. Ryan's amendment seeks to achieve is admirable but I still suggest it is not practicable and that the best way to serve the purpose which he seeks to achieve, if he is concerned with the protection of the staff, is to accept the assurance which his amendment very usefully evoked from the Minister in the House to-day. I suggest that so far as Deputy Dr. Ryan's amendment deals with existing rights and throws open for consideration particularly the question of promotion, it is a totally different amendment from the one which I have tabled.  The amendment I have tabled merely seeks to write into the Bill a statutory guarantee of a grade which will give a commensurate salary.  The amendment reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a person is appointed to a situation in the Civil Service of the Government by virtue of sub-section (1) of this section such appointment shall be to a situation in a grade not less favourable as to salary scale as such person's existing grade in the service of the society.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In other words, it is an amendment seeking to guarantee that there will be no reduction in salary scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan's amendment goes considerably further than that and in my submission it is not practicable. The charge is levelled against me in this House that I originally expressed the view that his amendment should be supported.  I said about it originally what I am saying now, that I thought there was an estimable idea at the back of the amendment but that it was not one which could be supported because &mdash;I used these words&mdash;&ldquo;it would create a service within a service.&rdquo;  That, to my mind, is the kernel of the real objection to it.  I think that the Minister, without occasioning any grave inconvenience to his Department, without embodying any wrong principle in the Bill and without going to immediate war with the Department of Finance, might very well accept the amendment tabled in my name.  I am <Col N="1548" /> satisfied, at any rate, with the assurance which the Minister has given, and given in unequivocal terms.  I think that anybody who is honest in his approach to the question, anybody who is concerned with the interests of the employees and who approaches the question from that angle, will be similarly satisfied.  Of course, one thing is very obvious from what we have heard in the House in the last hour and a half.  It is perfectly obvious that Deputy MacEntee came in here to play politics in this matter.</P>

The Minister is much longer a member of this House than I am but even in my time, I have a fair recollection of his insisting on the transferred officers section being written into the Electricity Supply Board Act.  That was one Act. Another Act in which he insisted on a similar provision was the St. Laurence Hospital Act.  The transferred officers sections in these Acts are much wider in scope than what is proposed here.  What objection therefore is there to putting this section into this Bill? The Minister knows that, if it were not for that section in the Electricity Supply Board Act, certain officers might have suffered disability.  That was publicly advertised from time to time.  What objection, I again ask, is there to writing a guarantee into this Bill that employees on transference will not suffer in any way, not alone in their present conditions but as to prospects to which they might logically look forward?  That was the way the sections were worded in the other Acts, <Col N="1549" /> that they should not be deprived of what they might logically have expected if they had remained in the service from which they were transferred. Deputy O'Higgins may smile but Deputy O'Higgins may not be interested in the unfortunate people whose future positions are at stake.  I am interested in them.</P>

      <P>The debate on this amendment has gone on for quite a long time, and certainly the arguments for and against it have been repeated on many occasions.  When I asked the Minister at what time he expected the appointed day, what I meant was when the transfer day would be.  The Minister replied that it would probably be a couple of months after the passing of this Bill.  This Bill will take effect within a reasonable period&mdash;three or four months at the outside&mdash;and what we are anxious to ensure is that all the staff of the National Health Insurance Society, when going into the Civil Service, will go into a grade that will be comparable to their present grade in regard to status and salary.  That is what we all want.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given the House and the staff the clearest guarantees that no member of the staff will lose by the transfer, either in status or in salary; that, in fact, the majority of them will benefit in salary by the transfer, that they will also benefit in status, and in the opportunity for promotion. The Minister has gone further and he has assured the House that the staff of the society accept those guarantees and that the staff organisations, representing the staff, also accept them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one very simple issue involved. There are quite a number of grades or classes in the National Health Insurance Society staff.  I was of the opinion, on the Second Reading, that the Minister should write into the Bill a section showing the particular grade in the Civil Service to which these particular classes in the staff of the society would go.  I think the Minister could still do that without writing it into the Bill or without putting <Col N="1550" /> the amendment at present under discussion into the Bill.  He could do so by saying to each member of the staff of the society, or each grade or class in that staff: &ldquo;When this Bill is passed you will be taken into the Civil Service in this particular grade&rdquo;&mdash;the grade to be named&mdash;&ldquo;and your salary scale will be from so much to so much.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If that were done, that is all that any person would require.  The guarantee, as far as this is concerned, is a guarantee that will be completed on the day when the particular official of the National Health Insurance Society is transferred into the Civil Service. The guarantee goes no further than that.  What we are really anxious about&mdash;at least, what I am anxious about&mdash;is that no member of the staff of the society will have his position or condition worsened by the passage of this Bill.  If each particular grade in the society's staff were to be told by the Minister to-morrow, or before this Bill is passed: &ldquo;You are going into this particular grade of the Civil Service; your salary scale will be from such and such a figure to such and such a figure; under the provisions of the Bill you are entitled to so many years' service and, therefore, your starting salary in the Civil Service will be so and so&rdquo;, that would be quite satisfactory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped, and I still hope, and I believe my hope will be achieved, to grade these people into their Civil Service gradings before the transfer date, that is, before they are taken over by the Department, so that they will know before they go into the Department what their grading will be and what their salary scale will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is satisfactory up to a point, but the Minister would make it completely satisfactory if he would indicate to the staff of the society before this Bill passes what he intends to indicate to them before the transfer date.  If he could do that before the Bill is passed, each and every one of us would know that every member of the staff of the society was satisfied.  I am perfectly certain that Deputy Ryan would agree that, in these circumstances, there will be no <Col N="1551" /> necessity to press this particular amendment.</P>
      <P>Let me say this about a section of the National Health Insurance Society. I am quite sure other Deputies have received a copy of this document that I have received from the Connacht Provincial Committee.  The members of that committee are worried about their position.  I do not see why they should be worried; their present condition does not seem to be too good. They have onerous duties, a multitude of duties, to perform and their hours are not entirely Civil Service hours. They are classed as part-time workers. They have to maintain and provide their offices, to be in attendance at all reasonable hours from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., to deal with claims to sickness, maternity and marriage benefits, claims under the additional benefits scheme, which include dental, optical and hospital benefits, etc.  They issue benefit cheques to the average amount of £100 per week and reply to correspondence from head office, members of the Society and the general public.</P>
      <P>The duties, as one can see, are pretty varied and comprehensive, and for performing those duties they receive on an average £5 a week.  Out of that £5 a week they pay office rent of £1 a week&mdash;I think that is slightly exaggerated&mdash;fire and light of office, £1 a week, postage, 12/- a week, travelling expenses 5/- a day or 15/- a week for three days' travelling, all of which leaves the unfortunate outdoor representative, or agent, with a net salary of £2 13s. 0d. a week to support himself, his wife and family.  I cannot imagine any Civil Service grade to which that person would be appointed in which he could possibly be worse off than that.  The agents have asked me, and I am sure they have asked other Deputies, to raise their case in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy appreciates that I have no responsibility at present for their conditions of employment or wages.  They are employed by the National Health Insurance Society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.  I am just making the case that, when this Bill <Col N="1552" /> becomes law, I think I can safely say, without being a Minister, that they can look forward to having a substantial improvement in their conditions.  I think that without worrying the House any further I could, in reply to the case they make, satisfy them myself personally on that point.</P>
      <P>They are also concerned in the matter of promotion to the rank of inspector.  However, that is a matter that can be raised on the ordinary administration of the Department when the Bill becomes law.  I think that the Connacht Provincial Committee, the other committees and the agents right through the country can be satisfied that in no circumstances can their conditions be worsened by the passage of this Bill, and that, whoever else has to worry, they will have no worries on that particular score.</P>
      <P>I would conclude by again asking the Minister when speaking on the Bill to-morrow, or whenever it comes up again for discussion, to consider whether he cannot make his allocation in regard to grades in the Civil Service of the present staff, so that each and every one of us would know that this allocation was acceptable to the staff as a whole, and that it was welcomed. I think we indicated on the Second Stage of the Bill that what we want, and what the Minister wants in his Department is a contented staff.  From what I know of the National Health Insurance Society he will be getting over an efficient staff, a staff whose ability has never been properly recognised in regard to remuneration.  That ability may now be recognised when this Bill becomes an Act.  From what I know of certain officials in the National Health Insurance Society, I have no doubt whatever that many of them will reach very high grades in the Civil Service, and will be a credit to the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some experience of promises that were made in legislation some years ago.  As a result of my experience I have no reason to doubt that, if in office, the Tánaiste's promises will be fulfilled as far as the employees are concerned. Yet, I still feel that the Tánaiste's promises can be compared to legislation <Col N="1553" /> by desire and not by fact, because no matter how we look at this, if the Tánaiste professes to be sincere in a matter of this kind he will accept Deputy Dr. Ryan's amendment.  Let us, for example, suppose that in some years to come one of these transferred officers will have his conditions worsened through some cause or other. Let us, again, suppose that he takes his case to some tribunal or court or to a committee within the Civil Service. In law, that man will have nothing to fall back on except the assurance that was given by the Minister who introduced this Bill.  The Tánaiste is long enough in the House to know that an assurance of that kind is in law, so far as an employee or employees are concerned, not worth the paper it is written on.</P>
      <P>I have had two types of experience during my 30 years' association with a local authority.  In one case, the employees were told that, if they did not come under the 1909 Act, their conditions were assured under the 1890 Act. The result was that, when they wanted to claim a certain pension under the 1909 Act, they were told that they did not come under it, notwithstanding the fact that they were told by the parliamentarians at the time that their conditions would not be worsened, and that they would have the same opportunities as other people under that Act. Now, we here in this House are sensible men, I hope, and we are being asked to look upon things in a reasonable way.  The Tánaiste and Deputies who are legal men know perfectly well &mdash;Deputy Cowan made the point&mdash;that legislation by promises and plausible ejaculations by any Minister introducing a Bill is eyewash as far as the law courts are concerned&mdash;that is as far as defending a man's status afterwards is concerned.  Therefore, I hold that the Tánaiste should definitely embody Deputy Ryan's amendment in the Bill.</P>
      <P>We had some heated exchanges here this afternoon dealing with things that were not in the Bill.  This is a very serious matter for the employees.  If an employee is transferred he should be protected by law in that transfer and his status should be protected by law and there is no use in doing it any other way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can feel fairly proud of the year's achievement of the Land Commission seeing the position in which I found myself and the Land Commission two years ago at the time of the changes of Government. I think that bringing 1,250 families from the level of poverty to the level of a fairly decent economic holding is no mean achievement for the last 12 months, but I am not satisfied with that and I will not be satisfied with that in the coming year.  The relief of 1,250 families with an average of five persons per household totalling well over 6,000 is a very creditable achievement seeing the way we started two years ago.  The acquisition of 32,544 acres last year is a very creditable achievement and the distribution of 28,000 acres to 1,800 allottees is a very creditable achievement.  At least the Deputies on this side of the House and some Deputies on the opposite side of the House had the manliness to admit that they were perfectly satisfied with it for the year.  I feel quite proud of that achievement.</P>
      <P>There was a good deal of talk on the question of acreage divided.  I want to say that I am more interested in the number of families who have been raised from the poverty level to a fairly decent economic level and I am sure that the 1,250 families if they got the chance to voice an opinion on the subject would agree with me that that is no mean achievement for the past year.  Let me say now that if I am the Minister introducing this Vote next year I hope I will come into the House with an achievement of 2,000 families relieved in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy de Valera, the Leader of the <Col N="1556" /> Opposition, speaking the other night, referred, as he did last year, to a possible 500,000 acres available for distribution. I asked him last year where it was.  I do not want it all together but I want some of it and I want it badly.  I want to know where it is because I would love to get my hands on it.  The fact is that nobody knows what amount of land is available for acquisition at any given time without a survey and a survey would not be worth the trouble or expense of it because, under the 1939 Land Act, the Land Commission is prohibited from taking land which is being used in a certain way set out very clearly in the Act.  Land which was available last year may not be available this year because conditions on the farm may have changed.  Therefore the surface of the acquisition and resumption question is as changeable as the surface of the ocean.  It is constantly changing. The Land Commission may institute proceedings for the acquisition of a farm.  They may make preliminary inquiries; they may make later inquiries; they may even issue provisional lists notifying the owners and all persons concerned that they are going to acquire certain land, but meanwhile the usership of the farm may change and when the question goes before the Land Commission court they may decide not to acquire it.  I am not concerned with acreage so much as with the number of families relieved in a particular year and I want to advise the House that that is the only angle from which this question may be approached&mdash;the number of families still outstanding to be relieved.</P>
    <P>The acquisition question is a burning one and for that reason I have introduced in the Bill which has passed through the Dáil but which has yet to go through the Upper House a method of supplementing the flow of land into the Land Commission machine for the purpose of relieving congestion, that is, the purchase of land in the open market coupled with the fact that we are now giving market value for all land, whether it is acquired or resumed, which I anticipate will remove a lot of the obstacles which the Land Commission hitherto met.  Land will be purchased on the open market, <Col N="1557" /> always provided&mdash;as I said on the Second Stage and on the Committee Stage of the Land Bill when it was passing through this House&mdash;that no evils arise as a result of the Land Commission going into the open market.  I want to say to Deputies who want to see this Bill benefiting the people that if abuses of any kind arise, either inflation of prices or deflation of prices, as a result of the Land Commission going into the open market, the Land Commission will instantly be prohibited from proceeding further along those lines.</P>
    <P>Deputies can help me enormously when this Bill becomes law by advising their constituents who might be inclined to take the law into their own hands or to do something when a sale occurs which might be injurious either to the owner or to the purchaser to leave the matter severely alone.  If they advise them in that way they will be helping me and helping the Land Commission enormously.  If they take a certain other line of approach they will defeat the good intentions which lay behind the introduction of Section 26 of the Bill which has just passed through the House.</P>
    <P>The purchase of land on the open market will not be the final solution of the land question but it will help enormously in three ways.  The first, which I hope will be the most beneficial, will be the purchase of standard holdings of economic size which have a fairly decent house, out-office buildings and other amenities put there by the labour of the previous occupiers. These will be capable of being purchased by the Land Commission and will be instantly available for migrants. The second, and no less important, is the purchase of holdings which are described as derelict but which should more be described as ownerless holdings in congested or rundale townlands. When a Land Commission inspector goes to a townland to do a job of rearrangement or resettlement he is confronted with the fact that a number of holdings are apparently ownerless&mdash;they may be used by people in the immediate locality&mdash;but essentially in order to do a job of rearrangement in the area all these holdings should be purchased by the Land Commission. <Col N="1558" /> In some cases up to the present the Land Commission had power to purchase such holdings, but, in other cases, they had not the power to do so.</P>
    <P>The law up to the passing of the Land Bill showed many strange faces in that regard.  One of them was the fact that the Land Commission had authority under statute to give the market value for unvested land, but for a similar farm, a farm of the same size, the same valuation and of the same value in every way in the same locality which was vested, they could give only a price which was fair to the Land Commission and to the owner. Into the bargain, in the case of vested land, the redemption value, had the land been subject to the Land Purchase Acts previously, had to be taken out of the purchase money, with the result that there was scarcely an owner from whom the Land Commission took land who did not feel aggrieved.  The Land Commission also had power to purchase certain holdings, provided they were unvested and purchased under certain Acts, while other holdings in the same locality or near it could not be touched because they had no authority to pay for them in cash.  The Land Bill irons out many of these difficulties and that, coupled with the arrangement with regard to a senior inspector under the Bill, which I hope will not be materially altered in the Upper House, will provide a much quicker solution in the matter of rearrangement.</P>
    <P>None of the abuses which some of the Opposition seem to fear can possibly arise.  I have explained the position in that regard already and it would be superfluous to give a further explanation. It can be truly said that the Minister does a lot in the case of a rearrangement scheme, but, if we examine the problem, what we find is that, even though the inspector is the Minister's officer, when he goes into a townland he asks a number of tenants to surrender their holdings for the time being, so that the whole thing can be rearranged, but I want to remind the House that in such cases the inspector has not got only one commissioner over him.  He has more than the Minister over him because he has every tenant <Col N="1559" /> being rearranged and every tenant watches very jealously to see that none of his neighbours gets a divide of land which is better than the divide he gets. The result is, that if there is any discrimination, any injustice in the dividing of it, the scheme falls through, because one person can break it.  That was so obvious that I think it was Deputy Commons who introduced an amendment whereby three-quarters of the people being rearranged could force a rearrangement through.  There is no danger of any of these evils arising.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy de Valera, the Leader of the Opposition, who went so far as to suggest&mdash;I am subject to correction in this regard&mdash;that, in taking these powers, the Minister was taking power of acquisition.  Such is not the case.  Even under the new Bill, I want Deputies to understand clearly that the Minister does not acquire or resume any land.  The Minister has not got the allotting of new holdings or the allotting of additional parcels to holdings which are uneconomic but which are not being rearranged.</P>
    <P>I want to refer again to the 500,000 acres which the Leader of the Opposition said were available.  That is absolutely a myth.  There may be 1,000,000 acres available and there may be only 10,000 acres available.  I want to make it perfectly clear that I am not nearly so concerned with the acreage as with a number of congested homesteads which are relieved each year.  I regard the acreage required as only a means to that end and any other approach to the problem is merely turning our backs on it and trying to solve it without looking at it.  As I have said, 28,000 acres were allotted last year to 18,000 allottees all told.  Of these 18,000, 1,253 were brought from an uneconomic to an economic level.  This year, we have more than 32,500 acres with which to relieve congestion in the coming year.  There will be more migrants this year than last year and I will not be content with less than 2,000 families relieved this year.</P>
    <P>A number of 150,000 congests all told was mentioned by some Opposition Deputy as being the number yet to be relieved.  I think that if we had the <Col N="1560" /> means of knowing&mdash;in this respect again, a survey would be very costly and it would not have been completed three months until changes would have occurred which would render it in-accurate&mdash;we would find that about one-third of that number would be nearer the mark.  It is quite true that in the Land Commission offices there are records of approximately 383,000 holdings all told, but it must be remembered that, in the nine congested counties, many owners of small uneconomic holdings own one, two and sometimes three holdings, in addition to the one on which they live.  The other holdings are not residential.  We are more concerned with the actual number of occupied holdings rather than the total number of the holdings.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies, I am sorry to say, rambled off into all the usual things they spoke of in other years, seeking to make the Land Commission an omnibus Department covering many matters such as embankments, roads, turbary&mdash;which is part of Land Commission work&mdash;drainage, fences and so on.  Taking the matter of embankments first, it is a really pressing problem and I think Deputy Flynn made the best contribution, or at least showed the greatest knowledge of the problem, because he prefaced his remarks by saying that he was aware that the Land Commission are not responsible, once land is vested in the tenant or farmer.  That is exactly the position, and if we carry out repairs to embankments in counties like Clare and Kerry, it is purely a matter of doing a job for the Board of Works or some other Government Department.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat what I said last year.  The Land Commission is established for the primary purpose of purchasing out the landlords of this country and making the tenant farmers no longer tenants but owners of their holdings.  Each tenant farmer, as he becomes vested, ceases to be a tenant. He is the landlord of his own holding, be it big, medium or small in size.  The landlord's responsibility goes right over to the tenant the moment he is vested and the embankments thereupon become his liability.  In a great many cases, that liability is too heavy for the farmers to carry and the Land Commission <Col N="1561" /> steps in, but it means that a special grant has to be got from the Minister for Finance to carry out the job.  On the occasion of a visit to some embankments in Kerry which had broken down, it was clear to me that in many cases the farmers whose interest it is to preserve these embankments do not preserve them as they should be preserved.</P>
    <P>In the case of one man who was grumbling about an embankment, when I walked along the embankment I found holes made in it by the feet of cattle which had gone up on it for the sweet grazing there.  No greater damage could be done to embankments than by the walking of stock on top of them, with the exception of boring by rabbits or rats.  The first thing a farmer ought to do is to see that his stock are kept off the embankment and that it should be preserved as much as possible.  Very likely it is those who allow their stock to damage such embankments who are the loudest to clamour when a breach occurs and the sea or the river, as the case may be, comes in on the land.</P>
    <P>I have the greatest sympathy with those who have embankments on their land and who are at the mercy of high tides or storms which cause a breach and who may find their land, which was dry land the night before, part of the Atlantic the next morning.  I am doing my best to come to the relief of those people.  The maintenance of embankments is outside the scope of the Land Commission once the lands are vested.  When the embankments are in fair condition, the farmers should do their best to maintain them. In County Kerry and County Clare, the two counties where embankments are a very serious problem, I shall do my best to come to the rescue of the farmers concerned if it is humanly possible.  I do not want Deputies, however, to take up the position that the Land Commission are liable in these cases.  The Land Commission are not.  The job of the Land Commission is primarily to buy out the land and to make each tenant farmer the owner of it.  Grafted on to that was the problem of relieving congestion when the Land Commission and <Col N="1562" /> the Congested Districts Board were amalgamated under the 1923 Act.</P>
    <P>The question of turbary is also a serious one, because in many areas small bogs which were scattered here and there and which were very suitably located for the people in the district are being cut away and only substantial areas of bogs in mountain areas are left.  These are very often too distant from the people who want bog plots.  I think it was Deputy Kissane who accused the Land Commission of being slow in purchasing bogs.  That is not so.  We are anxious to purchase every acre of bog we can put our hands on and to divide the bogs in allotments, provided the people who are clamouring for them have not bog plots of their own.  In some cases, the people who clamour for such plots have bogs on their own land or other bog plots which they will not cut because they want to keep them for future generations.  In no case have I known the Land Commission to be slow in the purchase of bogs.</P>
    <P>In Mayo, Galway, Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Kerry and Clare small bogs of a few hundred acres or less are either cut away or being rapidly cut away.  The Land Commission may purchase land for the relief of congestion but they can never create bogs.  When a bog is cut away it cannot be replaced. How the people will be provided with firing in the future is a matter which will need serious governmental attention inside the next ten or 15 years, in my opinion.  I know areas where there was plenty of bog not so long ago which are now without any and where people have to go 15 or 20 miles for a supply of turf.  The trouble is that the Land Commission cannot find bogs to purchase.  There may be some isolated places in County Kerry where they refused to purchase some bogs, but they have some reason for it. I will have the matter investigated to see why they are not purchasing these bogs.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission are not anxious to keep bogs on their hands; they gain nothing by so doing. If they are delaying in the division of <Col N="1563" /> bogs, they probably have very good and sound reasons for so doing.  Several Deputies mentioned that the Land Commission make roads and described them as <i>cul-de-sac</i> roads.  That is true. When land is divided, the Land Commission make a road to accommodate the people living in the houses.  They make a perfectly good and sound road. Roads which were made 25 or 30 years ago are still perfectly sound and only require slight repairs.  It would be useless to ask the Land Commission to make roads linking up one county road with another, because there may be two or three privately-owned farms which would prevent them from doing that. When dividing land, they make a road to accommodate those living in the houses.  It would be a waste of good land to continue that road to the other side in order to make a link road connecting two main or county roads.  In my opinion, the Land Commission make a good job of roads.</P>
      <P>Two Deputies at least raised the question of certain unestablished officials in the Land Commission.  It is true that there is a number of unestablished officials, particularly on the outdoor staff of the Land Commission While I do not want to make a definite promise in regard to that matter, I will have the matter looked into to see what can be done for those who have fairly reasonable records of good service to the people and to the Land Commission.  I do not want Deputies, however, to take that as a definite promise.  All I am promising is to investigate the matter and see if I can do anything along the lines which Deputies Beirne and O'Rourke suggested.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Grady would have us believe that the only Land Commission activity that is taking place is in County Mayo.  It might be no harm to give some figures to the Deputy.  We shall take County Clare first.  In 1946, in County Clare there were 690 acres allotted to 38 allottees.  Last year, there were 2,244 acres allotted to 158 allottees, about four times the acreage and about four times the number of allottees.</P>

      <P>I am taking the year 1946 and last year and taking the same two years for the county the boundaries of which are said to limit the vision of the Minister for Lands&mdash; County Mayo.  In 1946, in County Mayo there were 1,182 acres allotted to 63 allottees.  If we maintained the same poportion as was allotted in Clare last year, there should be almost 4,500 acres allotted in Mayo last year and the number of allottees should have risen from 63 to 250.  We find that only double the acreage, 2,287 acres, was allotted in Mayo last year.  Therefore, while the Land Commission activity increased fourfold in Clare, it increased only twofold in Mayo in those two years.  I am thankful to the Deputy for having brought this matter to my attention because otherwise I might not have checked up the figures so accurately.  Perhaps the Deputy might want me to take some of the Land Commission officers out of County Clare and put them into County Mayo.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bartley mentioned that I was only asking for £855,170 in this Vote.  The Estimate is for £1,535,380.  The difference, £688,210, has already been granted in the Vote on Account a few weeks ago.  Deputy O'Rourke referred to sports fields and playing fields and asked that the question of vesting them in local Gaelic Athletic Association clubs should be considered.  Then he revealed the fact that it is the Central Council of the Gaelic Athletic Association who did not make a grant available to the local club for improvements or the erection of certain buildings on the local plot. That appears to me to be purely a domestic matter for the Gaelic Athletic Association.  I think that the Central Council are splitting hairs with the local club when they will not make a grant available.  I should like any Deputy to inform me of any instance where the Land Commission have taken back from a local Gaelic Athletic Association club any field which had been allotted to them.</P>

Suppose the Land Commission decided to give an allotment of land, if land was being divided in the locality, to a man who did not own the land or house in which he was living, they would be making an addition to something that belonged to the county council.  In the case of an enlargement, it is always to the parent holding rather than to the resident on the holding, that the enlargement is given.  It is for the purpose of bringing the holding from an uneconomic level to as near an economic level as possible, and nothing can be done there.

      <P>Now I come to the subject of acquisition.  Deputies have tabled questions to the Minister to ask the Land Commission to acquire land. As I have said in reply to a parliamentary question during the year, there are some decisions which the Land Commission arrive at and with <Col N="1567" /> which I do not agree.  Nevertheless, they have been vested with powers by this House to use their discretion in all cases of acquisition and resumption. While, sometimes, I should like to see them taking farms which they do not take, there is absolutely nothing the Minister can do about it.  The new Land Bill does not give the Minister power&mdash;regardless of what some members on the Opposition side of the House have said&mdash;to acquire or resume under any circumstances, not even in the case of a rearrangement scheme. If the Land Commission fail to take farms it is within their discretion to do so.  They are not breaking the law. We may disagree with them but there is nothing the Minister can do about it.  They have been given judicial functions under the 1933 Act and they have them under the new Bill as regards acquisition or resumption. Therefore, they have the very same status as a court.  They are a court in connection with the question of the acquisition or resumption of land on the one hand or the allotting of it on the other hand and, as such, they are not obliged to give reasons for their decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most Deputies seem to feel, as I do, perfectly satisfied at the fact that 1,250 people have been raised from the level of poverty to the level of being able to make a fairly decent living for themselves. Let us take a round figure of, say, 30,000 congests to be relieved in this country, or even 50,000.  If we can get the Land Commission machine geared to take 2,000 holdings per year we would be making good progress.  I want to dispel the gloomy forecasts of certain people in the Opposition who threw up their hands to heaven and said that there can be no finality in respect of the relief of congestion.  I do not agree with that outlook.  I do not want to say that congestion will be fully relieved by this time next year or by this time five years but, if the Land Commission relieves 2,000 holdings per year&mdash;and let them get the necessary land for it in any way they like, by compulsory acquisition, by resumption or by purchase on the open market as is permitted under the new <Col N="1568" /> Bill&mdash;they will surely come to the end of the relief of congestion when the rural slums we know of that stretch all the way from Donegal to West Cork will be abolished.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies say that the pool of land is running dry.  I say that there is nothing wrong about going into the open market and purchasing land there. A close eye will be kept on whether evils arise out of such a practice or not. I may say that I do not think they will. I have that faith in the people who know that their own Government is out for their benefit and good.  I believe I will get the co-operation of the vast bulk of the people with the exception, perhaps, of an occasional crank here and there.  The Land Commission can get land to relieve congestion by that means.  Deputy Maguire made what I consider a remarkable speech.  He said that that section was crushing people off the land.  I cannot see that it is. I do not agree that it is.  If a man puts up his holding of land for sale on the open market, who knows what he has in his head?  Perhaps he has money with which to buy a larger farm.  Perhaps he intends to change his mode of living and to take on some other means of living.  Is he not free to sell his land in the open market?  Is the Land Commission, under the new Land Bill, not free to buy it?  If that man chooses to change his existing method of making a living and to put up his land for sale, why should the Land Commission not purchase it if they want it?</P>
    <P>As I said during the Report Stage of the Bill, it is my belief that about 250,000 acres per year come into the open market for sale.  Less than about one-tenth of that would be quite sufficient for the Land Commission to purchase, if they want to do so, along with compulsory acquisition.  The necessary money required under the Land Bill is not included in the Vote I am asking for now.  It is not customary in this House to ask for money for a measure which has not been passed finally into law, until the Bill has gone through all stages in the Upper House and received the assent of the President. Then and only then can I ask here for a Supplementary Estimate to implement the 1949 Land Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1569" /> I am perfectly satisfied with the work of the Land Commission and do not think it right to conclude without expressing a word of gratitude to the staff and, particularly, to the outdoor staff who have achieved such wonderful results this year.  Deputies complain that this or that has not been done.  The reason is that the Land Commission was idle from April, 1941, when the close down order was issued. A vast amount of arrears of work of all kinds has grown up.  When the present Government took office two years ago, Deputies on this side naturally thought everything should be done at once.  The inspectors of the Land Commission are being asked to be everywhere at the same time.  That is very confusing and it is not conducive to the steady output of work which we would like.</P>
    <P>When the Bill becomes law, a priority system will have to be established in each county, whereby the worst congested estates will be dealt with first.  Under the present system, the inspectors are hopping about from one place to another, working 12, 14 or even 16 hours a day in trying to meet the problem.  Just as under the Arterial Drainage Act in the Board of Works, a priority system will be needed to deal with the worst estates first.  In such a case, the whole estate will be completely combed out and left in fairly good order; the holdings will be brought up to an economic size; new dwellings and outoffices will be erected; fences, drains, suitable roads, etc., will be provided.  That is a fairly big job.  I am glad to say I got very good co-operation from all Deputies last year and I will encroach on their goodwill and their indulgence this year to give me the same co-operation, particularly when the new Bill starts to operate.</P>

While I cannot give the assurance the Deputy asks for, I think that, if things turn out as we hope&mdash;there is no trouble about the migration of the particular man who owns Cottage Farm&mdash;by the fall of the year, or by Christmas at least, it should be in the Land Commission's hands.  Arrangements have been made to effect a migration in that particular case.  It is not at the Cottage end that the hold-up is: it is at the end into which he is being migrated.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £413,630 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1951, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Forestry (No. 13 of 1946), including a Grant-in-Aid for Acquisition of Land.</P>
      <P>The work of the Forestry Division during the past year has been devoted, on the one hand, to preparations for the expanded programme and, on the other, to the carrying out of the normal annual programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the matter of land acquisition, this has been very satisfactory, as during the last year the Forestry Division acquired 9,122½ acres, as compared with 3,777 acres during the preceding year.  Agreement has also been reached with private owners for the purchase of 10,867 acres.  The corresponding position last year was that agreement had been reached for the purchase of 6,427 acres.  In addition, offers have been issued, or will issue very shortly, for the purchase of 10,634 acres from private owners.  The Land Commission is also constantly on the watch for suitable land for afforestation and it is expected that 15,369 acres will be transferred to the Forestry Division in <Col N="1571" /> the near future.  There are also some 4,207 acres which have been jointly inspected and which it is hoped the Land Commission will be in a position to transfer at a later date.  In spite of my request last year, offers of isolated areas of from one to 20 acres are still being received in considerable numbers.  Such offers are only a waste of time for everybody concerned, unless the land offered is contiguous to existing State forests.  A second feature is that lands are being offered at fantastic prices, far in excess of what they would fetch in the open market.  I want again to bring to the notice of the public that small offers such as these, unless they are situated close to an existing forest, will not be considered and that a special grant of £10 per acre is available to every private landowner who wishes to plant any area from one acre upwards.</P>
    <P>Except for a very limited area of arable land still required for nursery purposes, the type mainly required must be purchasable at not more than £8 per acre in fee simple, and it is perfectly useless to offer inferior grazing land at prices from £15 to £50 per acre.</P>
    <P>The position at the time the Government announced the expansion in the forestry programme was that an entirely inadequate staff was available in the Department to deal with the huge number of offers that started to pour in the moment the expansion was announced.  That position has been improved but still not enough to my satisfaction yet.  The total number of acquisition officers is now eight and I will not be satisfied until that number is doubled.  Each offer must be inspected personally by an acquisition officer.  The land must be appraised for suitability, for the type of timber which will develop best on it and must be valued for price.  A very exhaustive report has to be furnished by the acquisition officer in each case.</P>
    <P>An outstanding event took place during the year and that was the establishment at Dundrum Sawmills in Tipperary of two drying kilns which were opened a short time ago and which are already working very satisfactorily. This is only a beginning.  The purpose <Col N="1572" /> of these kilns is to put on the market. Irish grown and Irish sawn timber in as good a condition as the best of foreign imported.  The quality of Irish grown timber is second to none in the world, in my opinion, and it is in the failure of the after felling treatment that Irish timber has been looked upon as being inferior to foreign.</P>
    <P>The sawmills at Dundrum have been completely rebuilt and reorganised and I am happy to inform the House that this is now one of the most up-to-date sawmills in the country.  A similar reconstruction of Cong will take place as soon as possible, as the present site is unsuitable and the machinery is, to say the least of it, antiquated.  It is hoped to erect two, if not four, drying kilns in Cong as soon as circumstances permit.</P>
    <P>The nursery acreage has been increased appreciably during the year but will, inside the next two years, have to be increased still further until a total nursery acreage of something in the region of 750 acres is reached.  The full nursery acreage will not be necessary until about this time next year as by that time the increased quantity of seed sown last year will need sufficient ground for the planting out prior to the final act of planting in the forest.  The total amount of seeds sown last spring was 14,200 lbs. weight.  Deputies may be surprised at this huge quantity but the experts say that taking into account failure to germinate, culls, the danger of a severe frost thinning their numbers, that any less quantity would be insufficient, if we are to have sufficient transplants for the 25,000 acre programme in the season 1952-53. Deputies who are keenly interested in forestry but who may not have sufficient experience of actual conditions must hold their impatience in check until these transplants are ready for planting out, as a period of three years must elapse between the sowing of the seed and the time when the young transplant is barely strong enough to be planted out in the forest.</P>
    <P>The collection of home-grown seeds has been very satisfactory during the year and a record quantity will be available for sowing this spring.  It is the belief in the Forestry Department that home-grown seeds will produce <Col N="1573" /> better transplants and eventually better matured seeds than foreign seeds.</P>
    <P>An outstanding event was the completion of the forestry survey, which has revealed that there are 1,200,000 acres of land in this country more suitable to tree-planting than to any other possible use.  Deputies should bear in mind that this 1,200,000 acres is all owned by private individuals and I should say that the vast bulk of it is owned by small farmers.  This area is not to be taken as the limit of plantable land, but should be regarded as the minimum.  I am having a map prepared on the basis of this survey.  The map will show the areas in which there are greatest possibilities of afforestation and preference must be given in the development of these areas.  I hope to make the map available to interested Deputies at an early date.</P>
    <P>It is hoped to obtain this summer the advice of two foreign experts on soil suitability.  The first, a Canadian of distinction and wide experience, will examine typical mountain areas scheduled as plantable and will advise upon the desirability and possibility of transferring these areas from their present use as rough grazing to forestry purposes.  The second, a Finnish expert of international repute, will give us the benefit of the wide experience of the Finnish Forestry Service in the drainage and planting of boglands. The establishment of a research station is also being considered.</P>
    <P>Because of the small planting programme which the Forestry Department were engaged in so far, it was easy to prepare by hand the small areas of unplantable or doubtful quality ground.  With the expanded programme, it is anticipated that at least from 13,000 to 15,000 acres per year will have to be treated or prepared so as to ensure that a healthy, vigorous crop will follow.  That brought me up against the position of mechanical preparation of this huge area, and it was decided to purchase our own equipment, which includes tractors of a heavy and special type, ploughs and other implements, also of a very heavy type.  As the Forestry Department had none of this special equipment so far and had no experience of the most <Col N="1574" /> suitable type for the nature of work done, it was necessary for me to visit the Scottish and English forests where such equipment was at work, for the purpose of ascertaining the best type to suit our own conditions.</P>
    <P>I hoped to exceed the 8,000 acres which we planted this year, but we had not sufficient transplants in the nurseries to reach the 10,000 acre mark which I was hoping we would be able to attain.  The question of importing transplants thereupon arose and I decided not to import plants as they might introduce diseases into this country from which we are comparatively free at the moment.  It is doubtful if the transplants would be available had we gone searching for them.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for the coming year represents an increase of £144,760 on the amount provided for 1949-50, but does not contain provision for the increases in the wages of forestry labourers recently announced.  The minimum wages paid to forest workers is now 62/- a week and I may find it necessary, at a later stage, to ask the Dáil for increased provision on this account in preference to curtailing the programme of operations contemplated.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the different items in the Estimate, I propose to deal at length only with those sub-heads which show an appreciable difference as compared with last year.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head A&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances&mdash;£97,594&mdash;the increase, £6,250, is due mainly to an increase in the number of technical officers and to an increase in the rates of salary paid to foresters of all grades.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head B&mdash;Travelling Expenses&mdash;£12,250&mdash;provision is made for the travelling expenses and allowances of the technical staff and of such of the clerical staff as are obliged to travel on official business.  The increase of £2,250 is required on account of increased numbers and increased travelling for land acquisition purposes.</P>
    <P>The provision under sub-head C&mdash; Acquisition of Land: Grant-in-Aid&mdash; £65,000&mdash;represents an increase of £40,000 over the amount provided last year.  As this is a Grant-in-Aid, the balance at the end of the year is not surrendered but is carried over to the next year.  The balance carried over <Col N="1575" /> from last year is approximately £23,250, making a total of £88,250 out of which about £6,000 will be required to pay Land Commission annuities and rents of leased lands, leaving a balance of approximately £82,050 for new purchases during the current financial year.</P>
    <P>In sub-head C (2)&mdash;Forest Development and Maintenance&mdash;£428,330&mdash;the main item in the Forestry Estimates&mdash; some changes have been made in the form and the expenditure is now set out under the headings of nursery expenditure, capital, constructional and maintenance expenditure.  Under the first heading is borne all the cost of raising transplants in the nursery to the stage at which they are fit to be planted out.  To capital expenditure will be charged the cost of drainage and the initial preparation of land for planting and the construction of new roads and buildings.  These will be mainly non-recurring and will not appear in the second or subsequent rotations. This heading will also bear the cost of new machinery, stores, etc.  To constructional expenditure will be charged the cost of new fencing, planting and the replacement of failures, etc., and to maintenance the cost of the after-care of plantations including fence repair, drainage repairs, grass cleaning, etc.</P>
    <P>Earlier on I gave some figures as to orders placed for supplies of seed and though it is not possible at this stage to state exactly what quantities will finally arrive or what precisely the home collection will amount to every effort is being made to build up stocks in the nurseries.  Unfortunately, it is still difficult to secure adequate supplies of Pinus Contorta, a species which is showing remarkable ability to succeed on poor and exposed sites and on which, so far as can be foreseen at present, more and more reliance must be placed in future.</P>
    <P>The growth of the plantations laid down in earlier years, which have now reached the thinning stage, necessitates a constantly increasing programme of road construction for extraction purposes and up to the present thinnings of all sorts continue to find a ready <Col N="1576" /> market.  Additional roads, moreover, facilitate the movement of staff and equipment in the event of fire, a danger which grows continually with the increase in the area planted.  On account of this danger it is desirable that foresters should be housed in suitable positions on or adjacent to the areas under their charge.  At present many have to live at appreciable distances from their forests and this is a problem to which serious attention must be given at an early date.  It is almost impossible in present circumstances to purchase suitable houses and the Department has been forced to consider the question of undertaking rather a large building programme. With this end in view, enquiries are being made into the possibilities of prefabricating suitable houses from the Department's own supplies of timber and it is hoped at an early date to make a start with one or two such buildings.</P>
    <P>Under part (1) of sub-head C (2)&mdash; Timber Conversion&mdash;£91,945 -- provision is made for thinning and felling operations, formerly charged to cultural operations, and for the working of portable saw-milling units engaged in the preparation of nursery laths and of fencing stakes for the division's own use or for sale, etc.  The division's own requirements of stakes increases yearly and while the demand for firewood is not very pressing, there are still a number of areas where it is in demand and in many cases cutting into firewood blocks is the only means of disposing of inferior timber which must be cleared to permit of the planting of more remunerative varieties. Many of the portable machines in stock have been in continual use for a number of years and are now no longer profitable to run.  It will be necessary to replace them at an early date and the question of the most suitable type of machine to replace them is at present under consideration.</P>
    <P>No increase is proposed in the provision under sub-head D&mdash;Advances for Afforestation&mdash;£2,000, out of which payment is made of the grant of £10 per acre payable, under certain conditions, to private landowners and local authorities carrying out planting operations <Col N="1577" /> on their own lands.  For various reasons, relatively little advantage has been taken of this grant but, as soon as I am satisfied that there are adequate stocks available in the commercial nurseries, I intend to advertise the terms of the grant widely and I hope that many more people will take advantage of it.</P>
    <P>The number of felling notices received during the past year shows a decline as compared with those received in the previous year but cover a somewhat higher number of trees. This seems to indicate a decline in the rather indiscriminate felling which arose out of war conditions and the scarcity of fuel and a return to more normal conditions of business in the trade in native timber.</P>
    <P>Some success has been achieved in inducing compliance with the replanting obligations of felling licences and a slight improvement in the position is noticeable.  The provisions of the Forestry Act of 1946, which make replanting conditions compulsory, not only on the licensee but also on his successors in title, will greatly strengthen the hands of the Forestry Division in dealing with this matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind holders of licences granted under the 1928 Act that permission to fell trees contained in any licences issued under that Act will terminate on 31st March, 1951, and that after that date no further trees may be felled by virtue of such licences. Furthermore, any replanting conditions incurred under such licences must be carried out not later than 31st March, 1952.  Persons concerned have, therefore, two planting seasons in which to clear themselves of liability. After that date they will be liable to prosecution without further warning.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to take this opportunity of thanking the staff of the Forestry Division for the magnificent work they have done and the huge output, embracing so many different types of skilled activity, and I have every confidence now that the programme which the Government have set up as their goal will be attained and maintained.</P>

      <P>When I spoke on the Forestry Estimate last year I was accused by Deputy C. Lehane, I think, of making the same speech in 1949 as I made in 1948.  I am afraid that if Deputy C. Lehane heard me to-night he would probably be in a position to make the same accusation all over again because the problem has not changed.  Whatever I say in indication of my view on forestry, my statement cannot be changed because the problem is exactly the same as it was last year and the year before.  Any statement by a Minister for Lands on a Forestry Estimate is always regarded as unsatisfactory by those who are enthusiastic about forestry.  The Minister's statement to-night is not so very heartening.</P>

The statement is not so very heartening since we seem to be a long way from the 25,000 acres that were to be so quickly planned and the bright hopes that the enthusiasts <Col N="1579" /> cherished have gone down the said trail of unrealised ambitions.  The Minister does not seem to have grasped the fact that a stated objective is not a substitute for policy.  It is all very well to say that we will plan 25,000 acres.  That is a more statement of objective.  In order to secure that, or any other target, there must be a considered policy and every line of that policy must be pursued to its appointed end.  I am an enthusiast about forestry.</P>

      <P>In anything I say to-night I give no shadow of thought to the discomfiture of the Minister or his Department.  Everything I say will be directed towards trying to secure the success of a forestry programme. When speaking on the Land Bill it was my intention to try to preserve in legislation whatever seemed to me to be of continuing value and to seek for something new in legislation which might prove helpful in the solution of the problem of congestion.  I propose now to follow that particular line on this Estimate.</P>
      <P>In the Land Bill debate I must have touched the Achilles heel of the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, since he was not satisfied with finishing the debate on the Land Bill; he had to break into the Estimate on Lands.  No matter what bluster or ballyhoo or bladderskite or bombilation&mdash;I am good on bees&mdash;by Deputy Dillon, Minister for Agriculture, the facts that my statement disclosed during the debate on the Land Bill still remain facts. They are incapable of being denied by the Minister for Agriculture or anybody else.  I merely say that in order to illustrate the fact that I shall stick close to the point and direct my mind completely towards the development of forestry.  I am rather doubtful about Deputy Dillon's&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather doubtful about the Minister for Agriculture's effect on forestry and on the mind of the Minister for Lands.  The Minister <Col N="1580" /> has said that there are about 120,000 acres more suited to forestry than to agriculture.  Speaking on the Land Reclamation Bill, the Minister for Agriculture said: &ldquo;There will be quadrupeds and men on the land I reclaim and trees on the land that the Minister for Lands will deal with.&rdquo; There was a suggestion there that quadrupeds and men are much more important than trees and may be had without trees.  The tree is a definite factor in land reclamation and in keeping the land in heart.  If the trees of this country die the quadrupeds and the bipeds will have an even thinner time than they have now.  At the risk of being repetitive and with all due deference to Deputy C. Lehane, may I say that land is the one outstanding factor in successful forestry, land possible of acquisition and plantable. If we cannot get that kind of land swiftly we cannot solve the problem of forestry.  One may take the figures for the past few years, including the figures given us by the Minister to-night. Now figures are peculiar things.  They can be made to mean many things.  Their interpretation by different people is not always the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Here are the Minister's figures.  I do not quote them to twist them in any fashion detrimental to the Minister.  I quote them merely to show how acute and difficult is the problem the Minister has to tackle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to put any blame on him or his Department.  I merely want to analyse these figures to see exactly what they mean.  In 1948&mdash;these are the Minister's figures&mdash;a purchase agreement was signed for 6,635 acres and negotiations were on foot for the purchase of 9,873 acres, a total of 16,508 acres.  We acquired 3,712 acres of plantable land.  For the year 1949-50 a purchase agreement was made, according to the Minister's statement to-night, for 9,122½ acres and advanced negotiations for the purchase of 10,867 acres were conducted&mdash;a total of 19,989½ acres.  We acquired this year, according to the Minister, up to February 28th, 6,149 acres.  These are the Minister's <Col N="1581" /> figures.  It would seem to me that in view of the planting programme in the past few years and of our success, or lack of it, in the further acquisition of land, that the pool of plantable land in the hands of the Forestry Branch has shrunk considerably. Of course, we have very flamboyant reports of the success of the survey.  I am surprised the Minister did not employ a pipers' band to parade in front of the map in the Library.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be a good thing.  I am not trying to worry the Minister; I am trying to help him.  As I say, we acquired only 3,712 acres of plantable land in 1948-49 and up to the end of February this year we acquired 6,149 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister quite recently answered a question of mine in the Dáil in regard to this matter and I can give him the Dáil Report in which it is published.  Of course, it may be that since February 28th, up to the 31st of March or up to whatever time the Minister's survey ends, the Minister could have purchased tremendous areas of additional land, but these are the figures the Minister gave.  I am glad it is amusing to the Minister but the fact that only 3,712 acres were acquired in 1948-49 and 6,149 acres last year does not indicate that he is going to reach his target of 25,000 acres of forestry per year.</P>
      <P>There are two bodies of opinion in the Dáil and in the country in regard to forestry.  Some Deputies here say that there is no disagreement about forestry development.  There is certainly no Party line in regard to forestry development.  Some people in Fianna Fáil, some in Clann na Poblachta, some in Labour&mdash;I cannot vouch for Fine Gael; it is always an unknown quantity&mdash;are in favour of forestry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some foolish statements are made by members of all Parties. Deputy Cowan argued last year that if we were to be successful with forestry and produce good timber we would have to use arable land.  The Minister does not agree with that.  Neither do I.  We cannot use arable land.  Even if we could acquire it and if the people would consent to our acquiring it, it would be completely unwise to use any of our arable land for forestry.  On the other hand, there is a vast acreage of treeless moorland and mountain land on which pasturage is very valuable to those who own that pasturage or have any rights over it.  We must make a very definite effort to secure more of that land because I know from long experience, having watched these things happen, that no matter how profitable for the moment grazing on these mountain lands must be, it tends, imperceptibly perhaps, steadily to deteriorate and in a short term of years this land will be valueless both for pasturage and forestry if it not acquired quickly.</P>
      <P>Again on much of our poorer land, semi-reclaimed moorland, many of our people eke out a rather meagre and poor existence.  We must also try to get this but we must recognise that to the occupier of such land a monetary payment is hardly sufficient compensation for leaving that land no matter how poor it is.  I would suggest, and the Minister apparently accepts it, that there should be an advance in the price to be paid for land.  I do not want him to pay an exorbitant price but the price paid at the moment is not sufficient in order to induce these people to part with their land for forestry purposes.  If there is a dwellinghouse on this land, the owner should be continued in occupation, either as owner or tenant, with a certain small amount of land attached to the house, which with forestry reinforcement would give these people some sort of adequate living.  That is not unreasonable.</P>

      <P>I should be congratulated on doing a good job in opposition. The area of land taken over, 3,500 acres in one year and 6,500 acres in another, is a rather attenuated effort.  I do not mean to suggest this as an indictment of the Minister or his Department.  It is merely an indication of the difficulty of the problem of getting land.  It may be an indication that the problem of getting land by the present methods and at the present price is insoluble.  I suggest then that the Minister should be helpful and make a deal with these people, both for their own benefit and for the adequate development of forestry.</P>
      <P>One thing that struck me in my experience is that farms at river sources, generally broad acres and very poor land, are far away from markets and from the ordinary living amenities, and from these farms families should be migrated to better land where, on small holdings with more economy, they would make a living much easier and with better profit.  That would give to the Forestry Department a large quantity of land where, for various reasons, forestry would do the most good to the country.</P>

      <P>In the past few years, even when the Fianna Fáil clubs relinquished their hold on the Land Commission, there has been a vast advance in soil and forestry science.  I think the widest field of acquisition is in land hitherto regarded as unplantable. The Minister has given us to-night, in answer to a question, the idea that he possibly favours that method, because he said that he proposes to purchase reclamation machinery.  I should like if he would tell us in more detail, when he is replying to this debate, what the nature of that machinery is, how much is going to be expended on it, and when we may see it in operation.  I wonder would Deputy Davin, in Leix and Offaly, like to hear Deputy Donnellan blowing his whistle, to see it going on again?  That was a valuable whistle.</P>

      <P>This is our own problem and there is no good in enthusiasts quoting here the progress in New Zealand or the progress in England.  There is no land problem in New Zealand and the system of tenure in England is altogether different from ours.  We have a much more difficult job of acquisition and the Minister should not be diverted from his task by uninformed statements of what the success is that attends forestry in New Zealand or England. There is no relation between forestry in Ireland and those countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Might I suggest again that there is no good in depending on the individual owner to make a sacrifice for the community?  We must try to educate the community as to the benefits that accrue from forestry, and we must try to induce them to accept the responsibility for the carrying out of the work. What are the benefits?  I would like to reiterate this, because this debate is probably the only opportunity that forestry gets during the year of any publicity.  To my mind one of the benefits is economic security.  During the recent war, as a result of the fact that <Col N="1585" /> we had not a forestry system suitable to our purposes, we were brought into a parlous condition.  The building trade almost came to a complete stop. Houses that we wanted to build, hospitals, the much derided hotels, schools, office buildings, factories&mdash; they all had to be stopped because we had not the timber.  Slums were deteriorating, buildings got worse and many skilled craftsmen had to emigrate because we had not timber of our own, because the amount of growing timber convertible into merchantable wood, and the imported stuff, was not sufficient for our needs.</P>
    <P>Bad and all as was our condition in regard to building, our condition in regard to fuel would have been bad but for the amount of timber in the hedgerows and woodlands available to augment our turf.  The only regrettable feature is that while most of that wood was not convertible for building purposes, nevertheless it did destroy a good deal of the beauty of our countryside. That was most regrettable.</P>
    <P>We are prone to regard damage done in Ireland as a result of forestry denudation as of very little account compared to the damage done in other countries.  In America particularly it is a commonplace to hear of huge losses of property and great loss of life due to forestry denudation.  The huge continental rivers and mountains take a toll because of human disregard for nature.  We do not take much notice <Col N="1586" /> of that happening here, but it does happen and relatively to our size it happens in the same fashion.  Recurring floods, continued spells of fine weather, alter our streams from being a constant run of water to alternate spate and trickle.</P>
    <P>There is erosion in this country.  I am very familiar every year with the damage done in my constituency by one particular river.  I know that if the catchment area of that river was properly afforested, the damage would be greatly obviated.  Forest deposit creates a sponge-like mass that releases water slowly and gives us a more regular run of water.</P>
