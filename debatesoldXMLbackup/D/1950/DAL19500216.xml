I would, however, refer the Deputy to paragraph 26 of &ldquo;The Trend of Employment and Unemployment&rdquo; for 1947-48 in which figures of employment in agriculture are given in respect of the 1st June, 1947, and the 1st June, 1948, the figures being compiled from statistics collected annually <Col N="154" /> by the Gardaí Síochána.  Figures for 1949 have not yet reached my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he is aware that during strikes of dockers in Cork, workers who were not involved in the strikes were refused payments at the employment exchange, and whether, in view of the hardships caused to these men and their families, he will take steps to ensure that in future such stoppages will not affect workers who are not employed when a strike occurs.</P>

Any person who is aggrieved by the decision in his case has a statutory right of appeal to a court of referees.  The suggestion in the concluding part of the question would require amending legislation.  I have been in communication with both trade union congresses in this matter and have intimated my willingness to discuss proposals for the limiting of the trade dispute disqualification for unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.</P>

      <P>The Deputy appears to be under a misapprehension.  The footwear scheme for the current year (1949-50) has been in operation since August, 1949.  A total sum of £37,500 was made available for the scheme in the current year, £30,000 being provided for the children of persons not otherwise in receipt of home assistance and £7,500 for the children of persons who are in receipt of home assistance. The same provision was made in the three previous financial years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that the valuations of houses in Brookfield Park, The Lough, Cork, vary between £14 10s. 0d. and £16 10s. 0d., even though the houses are similar from the point of view of purchase price, size and other amenities; and, if so, whether he will introduce proposals for legislation to have all such valuations fixed at the lower level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Morrissey) (for Minister for Finance) Daniel Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Morrissey) (for Minister for Finance)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the valuation of certain houses in Brookfield Park, The Lough, Cork, is £14 10s. 0d. while that of similar houses on the same road is £16 10s. 0d.  The first houses on this road were valued at £14 10s. 0d. but a valuation of <Col N="156" /> £16 10s. 0d. was placed on similar houses valued subsequently.  I am informed that the higher valuation of the latter houses is warranted by the increase in the letting value of property in the meantime.</P>
      <P>I understand the purchase price of the houses concerned varied from £750 in 1943 to £1,480 in 1949 and that the ground rents of the newer houses are higher than those of the older ones. If any of the houses valued at £14 10s. 0d. were now to come up for revision of valuation they would probably be valued at £16 10s. 0d. also.  As the Deputy is, no doubt, aware the initiative in the matter of revision of valuations rests with ratepayers and the rate collector and, in county health areas, with the secretary of the county council, also.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to introduce proposals for legislation as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>The export of whole untanned pelts is not permitted.  By arrangement with the tanneries, licences have for some time past been granted for the export, either split or tanned, of a fixed percentage of their intake of sheep pelts in order to enable them to dispose of heavy pelts which they claimed could not be disposed of in the home market. Representations have recently been made to me by one tannery that no further facilities should be granted for the export of pelts in any form, and this matter is under examination.</P>
      <P>Separate statistics are not available to show exports of split pickled pelts (fleshers and grains).  Exports are shown under the category of &ldquo;Sheep and Lamb Skins&rdquo; and amounted to 44,976 (weighing 715 cwts.) in November, 1949, and to 22,392 (weighing 424 cwts.) in December, 1949.  I am not aware that light pickled pelts are being exported, but if the Deputy has any information to the contrary which he is prepared to place at my disposal, the matter will be investigated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the last supplementary question first, so far as I know, whatever increase has taken place in the price of leather, it has been justified on the ground of the increased price for hides to the farmers.  With regard to Deputy Larkin's point, the position is that only pelts of a kind which is considered unsuitable for the home market are allowed, or are supposed, to be exported.  With regard to the other point by Deputy Lehane, this matter is under investigation and whatever appropriate steps have to be taken to put an end to whatever&mdash;shall I say&mdash; illegal exports are taking place, those steps will be taken.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a somewhat similar question on 17th November last.  In that reply I explained, as I had explained to representatives of the Dublin Corporation on the previous day, the reasons which rule out the possibility of making a grant available for this work.</P>
      <P>I should, perhaps, add that grants promised for works which are to be undertaken in Dublin as part of the short term hospital building programme will exceed £6,000,000.  By reason of the fact that these grants are being provided, the ratepayers of Dublin are being relieved of a very heavy burden which they would otherwise have to bear in the provision of much needed extra hospital accommodation in the city.  I do not think that any reasonable person, having gone fully into the facts could have grounds for feeling resentment at the decision concerning the work at Clonskea Fever Hospital.</P>

      <P>I wish I could agree with the Deputy in his last statement that there are many millions in the Hospitals Sweepstake Fund.

I do not think the Deputy would suggest that I should <Col N="164" /> bring on any other local authority that is being helped, as I am helping the Dublin Corporation, the hardship which would follow a reallocation of any grant which I have promised to these local authorities, in order to relieve the burden which he suggests is being placed on the Dublin Corporation.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a certain number of nurses trained in this country are emigrating to Great Britain but there is also evidence that during the past year Irish nurses have been returning from Great Britain in greater numbers than in previous years.  I do not accept the contention that, everything considered, conditions of employment in Great Britain are better than at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My functions as Minister for Health relate to nurses in the employment of local authorities.  The conditions of employment of such nurses is primarily a matter for the local authority concerned, but I have repeatedly urged these authorities to improve conditions by reducing working hours and by providing improved living accommodation, where such accommodation is provided, and facilities for recreation, and by relaxing irksome regulations where they exist.  The amenities provided in all new hospitals and sanatoria compare favourably with those in existence elsewhere and <Col N="165" /> similar amenities have been, or are being provided, as far as possible in existing hospitals.</P>
    <P>In regard to the last part of the question, I take it that the Deputy is not advocating that I should recommend to the Government that they should take steps to prevent any nurse who desires to leave the country from doing so.

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Cosgrave)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Limerick Gas Order, 1950, proposed to be made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and laid in draft before Dáil Éireann on the 15th day of February, 1950, under sub-section (4) of Section 10 of the Gas Regulations Act, 1920, be approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Limerick Corporation have made an application under Section 10 of the Gas Regulations Act, 1920, and the Gas Regulation (Special Orders) Rules, 1940, for a special Order to provide new plant and equipment as and when the need arises with a view to the eventual replacement of the old works by a new installation on another site, and for this purpose to secure power to borrow a sum not exceeding £500,000; to extend the limits of supply of the undertaking from the present <Col N="166" /> Borough of Limerick to the Borough of Limerick for the time being together with such other portions of the public health districts of Limerick and Clare not more than one mile from the city boundary; and for the modification of existing Acts and Orders.</P>
    <P>Borrowing powers will be exercised only with the consent of the Minister for Local Government and will be subject to the provisions of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Acts, 1878 to 1948, in relation to borrowing by a sanitary authority.  The Minister for Local Government has already approved of the installation of auxiliary plant comprising 36 horizontal retorts, together with ancillary equipment and to the reconstruction of the existing ten vertical retorts.  These proposals are estimated to cost £75,750. The work will commence shortly and, when completed, will result in an increase of gas output from 400,000 to over 1,000,000 cubic feet daily.  An increase in output of this magnitude will render increased gas storage space essential.</P>
    <P>It is proposed, accordingly, to erect a new gasholder of a minimum capacity of 1,250,000 cubic feet on the new site at Corkanree.  The holder will cost about £70,000.  The comprehensive plan which includes the new holder envisages the eventual erection on the Corkanree site of a new gasworks with a capacity of 2,000,000 cubic feet per day and the expenditure of a total of £500,000 as estimated will include general development, carbonising plant, including coal and coke handling plant, waste heat boilers; ancillary plant, gas holders, gas mains, district governors, compressors, consumers' meters and appliances.</P>
    <P>This expenditure will necessitate an extension of the existing borrowing powers of the corporation.  As these powers are subject to the consent of the Minister for Local Government, an inquiry was recently held by order of the Minister in Limerick into the application for power to raise £500,000.  The case for a development of this magnitude was made at the inquiry directed to be held by the Minister.  It was emphasised by the Limerick City Manager that the proposed extensions <Col N="167" /> would be gradual, and that each step would be preceded by a proved increase in demand.  It will be necessary for the corporation to obtain the specific approval of the Minister for Local Government to each work or installation included in the total figure of £500,000.</P>
    <P>The Order also provides that the revenues received from the gas under taking shall be paid into the municipal fund, and that the expenses incurred by the corporation in production and management of the undertaking shall be defrayed from the municipal fund, subject to the condition that as far as possible the establishment charges in any year shall be defrayed out of revenue for that year.  For the purpose of meeting any deficiency in the income of the undertaking or any extraordinary claim or demand made on the undertaking, it is proposed to establish and maintain a reserve fund amounting to £100,000.</P>
    <P>The existing limit of supply is the present Borough of Limerick, and it is proposed to extend this limit to the Borough of Limerick for the time being, together with those portions of the county health districts of Limerick and Clare for a mile from the boundary of Limerick for the time being.  Power is also sought to provide and maintain dwellings for persons employed in the undertaking as well as offices, showrooms and similar accommodation. The corporation also seek to secure power to refuse a supply of gas other than gas used for lighting or domestic use where, in the opinion of the corporation, the supply of such gas would interfere with a sufficiency of gas for lighting or domestic purposes. Authority is also sought to purchase, take, or lease land not exceeding 21 acres.</P>
    <P>The draft Order seeks to repeal Sections 22 and 23 of the Limerick Gas Act, 1878, and Section 40 of the same Act as amended by Section 2 of the Limerick Gas Order, 1918.  Section 22 of the Limerick Gas Act, 1878, empowers the corporation to maintain the existing gasworks at that time, while Section 23 limited the storage <Col N="168" /> and manufacture of gas to certain lands mentioned in the Schedule of that Act.  Section 40, as amended by the Limerick Gas Order, 1918, dealt with the revenues of the company and the establishment and maintenance of a reserve fund.</P>
    <P>The Gas Regulation Act, 1920, altered the old procedure whereby statutory gas undertakers were obliged to secure their powers by way of Private Act, or a provisional Order confirmed by a special Act of Parliament, and provided instead that powers or additional powers could be procured by a special Order approved by a resolution of both Houses.  The procedure, as laid down in the Gas Regulation (Special Orders) Rules, 1940, requires that the draft Order be prepared by the gas undertaking, and that full publicity of the intention to apply for the Order, and of the contents of the draft, be given by notices in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in local newspapers. Notification must also be given to the State, and to private interests involved, one month being allowed for the lodging of objections.  Subsequent stages are dealt with in accordance with the Gas Regulation Act, 1920.  If there are objections, an inquiry is held, and after considering the report of the person who held the inquiry, the Minister may modify the draft before submission to the Oireachtas, or he may decline to submit the draft.  When the draft Order was published in accordance with the rules, no objections were made by interested parties, and under these circumstances, no inquiry by an officer of the Department was necessary. The Minister for Local Government, as a result of the inquiry held by his officer relative to the proposed borrowing powers, is prepared to give his consent to the proposed borrowing. If the Dáil approves of the draft the Minister can make the Order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>When progress was reported last night I had mentioned the necessity for a central bus station in Dublin City.  I had expressed the opinion that the central bus station proposed to be built in Store Street and already partly constructed was the ideal place for the bus station.  Córas Iompair Éireann, with the approval, apparently, of the Government of the time and of the Dublin Corporation, agreed to construct that central bus station in Store Street.  There were difficulties in getting the corporation approval but the corporation approval was forthcoming.  The bus station was planned and substantial sums have been expended in constructing it, so far. The Government have announced, through Córas Iompair Éireann, that it is not proposed to complete this bus station.  There has been a suggestion that a bus station should be erected in Smithfield instead.  I think that that decision was taken on insufficient grounds.  I think that it was probably a snap decision and that it was taken without any reasonable consideration of all the issues involved.  No clear statement has yet been made by the Government or by Córas Iompair Éireann as to why the Store Street project should not be completed.  No statement based on logic has been made by the Government or by Córas Iompair Éireann.  The decision was taken and was announced but the reasons for taking the decision have never been made public.  At least, I have heard no reasons to justify the decision that was taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that the establishment or the utilisation of Store Street as a bus station will involve a serious concentration of additional traffic in the centre of the city.  I understand that that matter was considered in the early stages and that it was proposed, by diverting south-going and westgoing traffic from the centre of the city, to, in fact, ease the burden of the traffic in the centre of the city so that an objection based on that ground is not tenable.  If Store Street is utilised as a bus depot it can mean an easing of the traffic problem, in so far as that traffic problem is affected by long-distance buses, by the diversion of those services that I have mentioned <Col N="170" /> from the city centre.  Store Street has other advantages.  Store Street is convenient to Amiens Street Station so that persons wishing to change from road to rail can change with the minimum of trouble, travel and inconvenience. Store Street is also convenient to the centre of the city.  It is convenient to the place where most long distance travellers want to come, in the first instance.  There is an excellent local bus service passing through Store Street and passing very convenient to Store Street that can take passengers arriving in the city to any destination in the city and, similarly, passengers travelling from any part of the city, in order to avail of long-distance buses, can reach Store Street with the minimum of trouble and with the minimum of expense.  That is, I think, a very important consideration to be kept in mind.</P>
    <P>There is a further matter that I think ought to be considered.  Aer Lingus has offices all over the city. Those offices could conveniently, by arrangement with Córas Iompair Éireann, be housed in this new building so that the building would facilitate passengers travelling by rail, by road and by air.  Those railway booking offices that are, also, in the centre of the city could be housed in Store Street&mdash;and that would release for other use those offices at present utilised by Aer Lingus and by Córas Iompair Éireann in the city.  Store Street has all those advantages.</P>
    <P>When the suggestion was made that the Store Street project should not be continued, there was a suggestion that Smithfield might be used as an alternative site.  I am not aware that permission for the utilisation of Smithfield has yet been given by the Dublin Corporation.  Whatever chance there is of the present Dublin Corporation giving permission for the utilisation of Smithfield, I am satisfied that a new corporation, in which this particular matter would be made an issue, would not give approval for the utilisation of Smithfield.</P>
    <P>Smithfield has enormous disadvantages. It is not within easy reach of the centre of the city.  It is not on any of the bus routes.  If passengers are <Col N="171" /> dumped in Smithfield, they have either to walk to a bus line, walk to the centre of the city, avail of taxis or find some other means of getting to the centre of the city.  It is inconvenient from every point of view.  The provision of transport, whether by taxi or otherwise, to bring these passengers from Smithfield into the centre of the city will create chaos in the traffic in the centre of the city.  I think the Minister must realise that.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect that must also be considered.  The entrances to Smithfield are not suitable.  The exits from Smithfield are not suitable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Who said so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I say so.  They will not be suitable for that heavy bus traffic unless Córas Iompair Éireann arrange to send some type of staff in front of every bus to ensure that some of the little children living in the vicinity of these entrances and exits will not be killed by the buses travelling in these areas.  The entrances and exits are not suitable for that heavy traffic.  I think that most of us feel a sense of pride in our own City of Dublin and we like to give people coming to Dublin for the first time as good a view of the city as we possibly can.  Smithfield is the most depressing site in the whole City of Dublin.  Certainly no person would be anxious to dump travellers, particularly strangers, in a place like Smithfield and say: &ldquo;This is Dublin.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Deputy is concerned with this problem because every Deputy represents an area from which people will be travelling by road services to Dublin.  Every Deputy knows that his constituents, as things are at the moment, have to put up with the greatest hardship, the greatest inconvenience and risks to health in the conditions that are obtaining now, and that have obtained for many years.  If this project that has been half completed is to be abandoned, and if all the preliminary work that has to be done in regard to a bus station elsewhere in the city has to be done all over again, there is no likelihood of the situation being eased for bus <Col N="172" /> travellers for the next four or five years.  I see very little hope of getting over all these difficulties, getting plans that will be agreed upon, plans that will be approved because, as I mentioned on Second Reading, I understand that two sets of plans prepared for Smithfield have been scrapped and that the last instructions to the architect were to shove up some form of hayshed which would fit in with the particular requirements of the bus traveller.</P>

If the Ministerial view that has been expressed in regard to Store Street being too elaborate, has been communicated to Córas Iompair Éireann, it may have influenced Córas Iompair Éireann as to the sort of bus station that would be acceptable to the Government. I am, as I said at the beginning, concerned with this from many points of view, but I am concerned with it primarily from the point of view of the travelling public who ought to have reasonably decent facilities provided for them.  I think that, in the normal way of democratic government, where one Government has come to a decision and has progressed a long distance towards putting that decision into effect and has expended hundreds of thousands of pounds on the project &mdash;as in this case, where a building has been designed, planned and erected for a particular purpose and where it does suit that purpose&mdash;I say that, in the normal way of Party following Party in the democratic system of government, that particular project should be completed and put into operation.  If, every time we have a change of Government, work that is half done is to be abandoned, notwithstanding the fact that some £500,000 has been spent on it, that will not be good for the community.</P>
      <P>I would make this final appeal to every Deputy in the House that, as so much money has been spent on the project, as it has been designed specially to cater for the bus travelling public, where the building is almost complete&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, it is not.</P>
      <P>Captain Cowan: Well, it is a long way towards completion.  Where that has been done, we should see the finished job.  We ought to go ahead and finish the project, so that in the shortest possible time we will be enabled to provide facilities and amenities that are so badly needed by the suffering and the travelling public.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowan is a <Col N="174" /> very good advocate.  What was running through my mind when listening to him was what an infinitely better case he could make for Smithfield than I hope to make, if we were dealing with Dublin North West instead of Dublin North East.  Deputy Cowan knows as well as anybody in this House, and as the vast majority of the people in Dublin know, that from every point of view Store Street is entirely unsuitable as a site for a central bus station.  I think it is generally agreed in the city that if you set out deliberately to find the most unsuitable site in the City of Dublin for this purpose you could not get a better spot than Store Street. The Deputy might throw his mind back and remember the very extreme reluctance with which the Dublin Corporation acquiesced in this project.  He might throw his mind back to the time when it was first mooted, and remember the outcry that there was in the city about it.  I think the Deputy was stretching it too far altogether when he described Smithfield as the most depressing sight in the City of Dublin. That is not true.  From every point of view, Smithfield is unquestionably a better site for the bus station.</P>

He urged that we should go on, and he spoke as if the building were going to be abandoned and left there as a skeleton if it were not going to be used as a bus station.  That is not so.  The building will be completed and will be used for a purpose for which we think it is more suitable and more necessary and for which the site is certainly more suitable.

There is no necessity for five storeys of offices in the centre of the City of Dublin.  Córas Iompair Éireann can carry on their work in the offices they have already.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will allow me.  There can be erected&mdash;and if Córas Iompair Éireann were facilitated it could be on the way now&mdash;a bus station that would be adequate to cater for all the long-distance buses and that would provide reasonable amenities for all passengers at Smithfield within 18 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Costing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Costing approximately £150,000 as against £1,000,000 and available as a bus station, and to the public probably before Store Street could be available as a bus station.  There is no use in the Deputy talking about providing some sort of ramshackle building like a hayshed at Smithfield.  There is no intention of doing any such thing.  There is an <Col N="178" /> intention to provide an adequate bus station, but not a superstructure of five storeys of offices.  Apart from any question of congestion of traffic, apart altogether from the question of suitability of site, in their present very bad financial situation, Córas Iompair Éireann would be utterly irresponsible, in my opinion, if they were to continue with a project costing £1,000,000, which they did not require, when they could make adequate accommodation available for the public at a sum estimated at £150,000.  I do not claim to know the City of Dublin as well as many Deputies, but I have been knocking around the city for the last quarter of a century and I have fairly frequently been around the Butt Bridge-Beresford Place-Store Street-Amiens Street area. It is the first part of Dublin that I saw when I first came to Liberty Hall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Have you ever been around Smithfield?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes: I know Smithfield also.  I know it fairly well.  I know enough about the Butt-Bridge-Beres-ford Place-Abbey Street-Store Street-Amiens Street-Talbot Street district to know that it is one of the most congested districts in the city, that it is an area that carries the heaviest traffic in Dublin, that it is an area where the most slowly moving traffic operates. That is my view and that view is supported by people who know infinitely more about it than I do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any case, the building at Store Street is a building that Córas Iompair Éireann cannot afford, in the first place and, in the second place, it is a building that they do not require.  If the Department of Social Welfare take it over, they will do so on the basis that Córas Iompair Éireann will be repaid whatever their outlay on the project has been up to the date of taking over. That is the position.  As far as I am concerned, I would be completely disregarding my duty and my responsibility both to this House and to the users of the national transport system, who have to pay this £1,000,000, if I did not put the facts as I have put them before the House.  I have no doubt in my mind whatever that, no matter from what angle it is <Col N="179" /> approached, whether in regard to the question of suitability of site, Córas Iompair Éireann's requirements, or traffic, Store Street is not what Córas Iompair Éireann requires.  Store Street has not all the advantages even from the point of view of being so very central&mdash;a point that Deputy Cowan talks about.  If you concentrate all southern, northern and western traffic there, most people will find themselves not merely walking there but lugging their luggage there.  It is not answering the question merely to say that there is a bus service there already.  That bus service, I think most Deputies will agree, is hardly sufficient to meet the normal call that is made upon it.  It is not true to say that Smithfield is remote from the centre of the city and it is not true to say that there is no bus service to Smithfield.  There is a bus service running along the quays, probably the most frequent bus service in the whole city.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  The transport experts are perfectly satisfied that the outlets are there and that the outlets are adequate.  They did not say&mdash;some of the Deputy's colleagues tried to put the words into their mouths&mdash;that it would be necessary to knock down streets of houses. They said the very opposite to that. It is not remote, and there can be a bus service, if it is required and it would be required, operated from there to any part of the city, to bring people to the centre of the city and to take them to the central bus station.</P>

In support of that, like Deputy Cowan, I can only give my own opinion.  Frankly, my own opinion is that Smithfield, even apart altogether from the question of finance, is a much more suitable site for a central bus station.  What I do want to emphasise to Deputies is that it is a question of Córas Iompair Éireann, heavily in debt and losing money, undertaking a commitment of approximately £1,000,000, or undertaking a commitment of £150,000.</P>

      <P>At last we have had an attempt made to defend the decision to abandon Store Street.  It has taken 12 months to get it and, indeed, it was very poor when it came.  I think I know Store Street and its surroundings better than the Minister.  I pass through it several times a day and I also, in the course of my rounds, have to go around Smithfield.  I never have any fears when passing through Store Street, but I certainly avoid the exits of Smithfield when I possibly can and any man who travels around Dublin and knows Dublin as I do&mdash;I was born and reared in Dublin&mdash;will tell you the same, that it was a place to be avoided even in the days before motor traffic. So much for the traffic end of it.</P>
      <P>What about the other advantages possessed by Store Street?  Córas Iompair Éireann were lucky to be able to get a site as good as Store Street is, a site which gives rise to no inconvenience to business or housing, a site so convenient to the central railway station, the city bus termini and to the docks instead of away in Smithfield where it will be necessary for any traveller in or out to have to resort to a taxi or other means of transport.  The fact is that the bus depôt is practically complete now.  It should have been completed and could have been completed long before this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only 12 months since I put a question to the Minister about the completion of Store Street. He then told us that the work was not stopped.  How much has been done since?  How much is being done at the moment?  The only progress one can see for the past six months is the putting in of certain panes of glass, and not many of them at that.  The building is lying there practically derelict, unfinished and exposed to the elements, after all the money which has <Col N="182" /> been laid out on it.  Will the Minister tell us how much it will cost, in addition to what has been already wasted, to convert that portion of it which was to be a bus depot into offices?  To my mind, it is criminal waste to do it and the people are going to have to pay for it in one way or another, whether the Department of Social Services or Córas Iompair Éireann takes it.  It is capital expenditure and we know the Government's view about it, but my view is that if the capital expenditure required by Córas Iompair Éireann had been allowed to them, there would have been the possibility of recovering it at some time.  There will be no possibility of recovering it if it goes to Social Services.  The want of a bus depôt is a long-felt want in Dublin.</P>

      <P>We are agreed on that, but when the building is practically completed, we have this turn around to delay it still further and we are then told that Social Services are to be housed there.  I do not know whether that Department is badly off for extra accommodation, but they are not exposed to the elements, as the people waiting for a bus depôt are.  I think these people should come first.  It is outrageous to tell us at this hour of the day that the matter was to be left over until another bus depôt was built.  It is all very well to make a promise that it will be completed&mdash;we had all these promises about Store Street, too.  A definite effort should be made to look after the bus travelling public, and I do not think that any case whatever has been made for abandoning this project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister probably has the idea at the back of his mind that my only reason for pleading for Store Street is the fact that it happens to be in my constituency.  Let me tell him that no trader or anybody else in that area has approached me on the question, and, if I were standing for Cork to-morrow, I would take this line with regard to Store Street with the knowledge I have.  I am not influenced one way or the other by that fact.  I believe that, in the public interest, the bus depôt <Col N="183" /> should be at Store Street and that you cannot get a better site in Dublin, Smithfield notwithstanding.  Let the Minister or anybody else say what he likes, if Smithfield becomes the bus depôt, the cost will be thrown on the citizens of Dublin of widening the streets and housing hundreds of people in order to widen these streets.</P>

      <P>The traffic congestion there is far worse than it ever could be around Beresford Place or Store Street.  Of necessity, it must be, because of the narrow streets running out of it, from which those coming out converge on to the narrows of the quays with their immense traffic.</P>
      <P>Neither the Minister nor anybody else has so far referred to the citizens' rights of market in Smithfield, rights which have existed for hundreds of years.  Nobody seems to count these rights&mdash;they are merely stepping in and taking over the place which was allotted hundreds of years ago to the citizens of Dublin as a market.  Nobody is thinking about them, but some people may assert their claims and their rights, if this is proceeded with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard about the cost of the building, but the building was not to be only a bus depôt.  The late chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann found that it would actually save money. That may be disputed by other people, but it was his view and many of these views have turned out to be right.  It was to be far more than merely a bus <Col N="184" /> depôt, but the total cost of the building is being counted as against the cost of the same bus depôt in Smithfield. I do not think that is a fair way of putting to the citizens the matter of the cost.  In any event, I am convinced that a better site could not be got in Dublin for a bus depôt than Store Street, and I am certainly going to back this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the viewpoint expressed by the Minister on this amendment.  I think it a pity that the discussion on this amendment should have resolved itself into a controversy as between Smithfield and Store Street.  The amendment is quite a simple one and from the point of view of Deputies Cowan and Colley it is very natural for them to support the calls for the completion of the Store Street structure as a central bus station.  It does not mention the question of Smithfield or alternative sites.  I want to say despite the fact that Deputy Colley seems to think there would be some reflection on him if this were stated, that I think it perfectly natural that Deputies Colley and Cowan, who represent Dublin North East constituency should adopt the attitude of supporting the views expressed in this amendment.  I think the reason they do it is purely because of the constituency they represent and the local interests in that constituency, possibly because they have been approached or at any rate because they feel it would add to the wealth and prosperity of an area in that constituency if this project were proceeded with.  I think it perfectly natural.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Colley said that he had not been approached by traders or anybody else in Dublin N.E. constituency to advocate the retention of Store Street as a bus station.  I do not represent Dublin N.E., nor am I within miles of it, but I have been approached by a traders' organisation called, I think, the Talbot Street Traders, to support the retention of Store Street as a bus station in the interests, naturally enough, of the people forming that organisation.  I do not see anything wrong about that.  I do not see why Deputy Colley should feel that it was <Col N="185" /> any reflection on him or on Deputy Cowan to say that they were concerned with the interests of the people they represent in a local matter in their constituency.  I think, however, that it would be entirely wrong if the Deputies of this House were to decide a question of such importance as this by relating it to the interests of particular traders or a particular section of traders in Dublin N.E. constituency, and I sincerely hope that the majority of Deputies in this House will not give their judgment on this amendment from motives of that sort, and I am not criticising either Deputy Cowan or Deputy Colley in any way when I say that.  I had hoped that this amendment was not serious and that Deputy Cowan would have felt that he had discharged to a great extent his obligations to his constituents in Dublin N.E. if he made a protest here.</P>

Deputy Cowan seems to be infected with the same bug as Deputy Colley.

      <P>On the other hand, I do not think there is anything to be ashamed of in that.  Like Deputy Cowan on another occasion, I count ten before I proceed.  I could make references to the same Deputy about which he might not feel so cocky later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Colley spoke of the Minister's <Col N="186" /> speech here to-day as being the first attempt to defend the decision to abandon Store Street as a bus station. I do not think that in point of fact that is accurate, but I do not think that any necessity for putting forward a defence arises at all.  I think that the people in the dock, the people who are defendants as far as this matter is concerned, are those who initiated the scheme.  I think it was a madcap scheme from the start.  It was ludicrous that any concern in as bad a shape financially as Córas Iompair Éireann was at the time should even contemplate a scheme of the dimensions outlined by the Minister, a scheme which would cost £1,000,000 or more to complete.  Deputy Cowan refers to this as being a matter of public interest and I think he is right on that.  I think it is definitely in the interests of the public that Deputies in this House should do their utmost to see that the waste and extravagance envisaged in this particular scheme should be stopped and stamped out.  I am glad to know that the decision not to proceed with the Store Street project came from the Government in consultation with Córas Iompair Éireann. The Government would have been quite justified in coming to that decision without consultation with Córas Iompair Éireann and, if they had the necessary authority, in ordering Córas Iompair Éireann not to proceed with that scheme.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Colley who mentioned that if the scheme were proceeded with and finished it would result in an annual saving to Córas Iompair Éireann.  I do not think he is accurate in that.  I am speaking from recollection now and have not any figures to substantiate what I am going to say, but I think that either the Minister, in a previous statement to this House, or else the chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann, in a statement or correspondence to Dublin Corporation, pointed out that that was not so, although originally it was considered that a saving might be effected.  The Córas Iompair Éireann offices at the moment cost about £4,000 a year in rent and rates and the figure, as far as I am aware, for the new building, if it were <Col N="187" /> completed, in rates and whatever rental might be payable on it, would be £40,000 a year.  Instead of an annual saving there would be an annual loss of about £36,000.  I am not in a position to stand over that statement at the moment if I am contradicted, but I am pretty certain it is correct.</P>
    <P>I do not want to follow the lines of Deputy Colley by drawing comparisons between the Store Street site and the Smithfield site.  What is important is the nature of the structure on whatever site is adopted.  Personally, I do not care whether it is Smithfield or not, but as a member of Dublin Corporation I should like to correct Deputy Colley on his statement that some £100,000 would have to be spent and levied on the ratepayers of the city to put Smithfield in order as a site for a bus station.  That matter was discussed at Dublin Corporation, and Deputy Colley may have misunderstood that discussion when he read it in the papers.</P>
    <P>There was a report from a corporation official that if certain work were to be done it would cost about £100,000.  But there was a very big &ldquo;if&rdquo;.  The chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann and his officers met the corporation in connection with Smithfield and they pointed out that that work would not have been necessary and would not have been done.  The position, as far as I am aware&mdash;and I think Deputy Barney Butler will bear me out in this&mdash;is that if Smithfield were to be selected as the site to-morrow morning, as far as the ratepayers of the City of Dublin are concerned, it would not cost them a penny piece.</P>

      <P>At any rate, I think it would be a mistake if Deputies were to be misled, particularly Dublin <Col N="188" /> Deputies, by the suggestion made by Deputy Colley in his speech.  The Dublin Deputies who are members of the Dublin Corporation&mdash;many of them are Deputy Colley's colleagues&mdash;are in that position and know exactly how much reliance can be placed on that particular suggestion.  They know it is untrue, and I think it is a great pity that Deputy Colley did not consult them, some of the more responsible of them at any rate, before he stood up to spout out that kind of propaganda here.</P>
      <P>I am sorry if Deputy Cowan resented some of my earlier remarks.  I would just like to assure him, now that I have succeeded in counting ten several times over, that the remarks I made with regard to him, or to any other Deputy in that constituency, were made in a perfectly friendly and <i>bona fide</i> manner.  I did not intend to suggest that there was anything wrong at all in Deputy Cowan or Deputy Colley or any other Deputy from Dublin NorthEast constituency supporting the views contained in this amendment.  I tried to explain that attitude of mine as clearly as I could, and I am sorry if Deputy Cowan should have misunderstood me.  It certainly was not intended that there should be any reflection cast on him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to reiterate that I myself, and, I think, all of us in the Dublin Corporation, were, in fact, approached by letter from a traders' organisation in the Talbot Street area in connection with this site.  It is just because that approach was made, and because it is known to every Deputy who is a member of the Dublin Corporation, that I referred to the fact that the traders in that area are naturally anxious, in their own interests, to try and retain Store Street in their locality if it can be done.  I do not believe that there is anything wrong in that at all. I think they are perfectly entitled to agitate for that if they want to.  For these reasons, I made the remarks that I did make on that particular question. I hope the House will accept what the Minister said here to-day as the true position, that Córas Iompair Éireann simply cannot afford a bus station of the size or cost which would be <Col N="189" /> entailed in the Store Street structure, and that the requirements of Córas Iompair Éireann and the requirements of the travelling public will be fully met by a more modest structure elsewhere. Consequently, I would urge the House to reject the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder is there any prospect that we can induce the Government to change their mind in this matter?  For myself, I would be prepared to agree to let the issue between Smithfield and Store Street be decided at a conference of representatives of the Dublin Corporation, as the city authority, of the Garda Síochána, as the traffic controlling authority, and of Córas Iompair Éireann as the transport operating authority, provided they were allowed to consider the matter impartially on technical grounds and to arrive at a decision without being subjected to influence or pressure of any kind.  I would be prepared to agree to that, even to the extent of asking the conference to ignore the fact that the Store Street building is there. Most of us would regard it as foolish to consider the problem of a bus depôt in Dublin and leave out of account that there is, in fact, a bus depôt almost completed, but I would be prepared to agree even to that.  I think myself that the Government would be glad of a way out of the difficulty in which they find themselves, because they are in a difficulty.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  I believe that if the Government could reconsider their decision and find a means of reversing it, and saving face, they would adopt it.  However, if that is not so, we can merely put the arguments on record in favour of such reversal of decision and attempt to convince the public that the Government are acting foolishly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very curious about the history of this decision.  I have tried already to extract from the Minister some information as to when it was made.  We know that the Government came into office in February, 1948, that work on the Store Street building was then in <Col N="190" /> progress and was continued actively all throughout that year, and that there was no decision on the part of the Government to interfere with it. On the contrary, every suggestion which was made to the effect that they might interfere with it was indignantly denied by them through Ministerial statements in this House as well as by statements issued by the Government Information Bureau.  It was emphatically stated that the Government had no intention of interfering with the operations at Store Street or of taking over the building there for any purpose other than that for which it was designed.</P>
    <P>Then at some stage, because of some action taken by the Government, work on Store Street stopped and has never been resumed, and, eventually, it emerged that the Government had, in fact, decided to acquire the building from Córas Iompair Éireann and use it for offices for the Department of Social Welfare.  I admit that the Department of Social Welfare requires offices.  Perhaps the history of that particular matter is also interesting, because the need for offices for the Department of Social Welfare was recognised in 1947, and plans for the construction of these offices in Ship Street were prepared by the Board of Works and brought to the stage where construction was about to begin.  The abandonment of these plans was one of the first economies of the Government.  They decided to stop the building before they had investigated the necessity for it.  Later, of course, it became obvious that additional accommodation was required for the Department of Social Welfare.  The Minister for Social Welfare realised the circumstances under which his staff was working; he appreciated that an expansion of social welfare legislation would necessitate additions to his staff and that accommodation had to be got and, because of the Government's earlier decision, it had to be got in a hurry.  Hence this decision, I take it, to acquire the Store Street premises.</P>
    <P>The secrecy with which the decision was made to acquire the premises and the speed with which work on the completion of the premises was stopped is in marked contrast with the fact that <Col N="191" /> nothing has been done since.  Twelve months ago the work on Store Street was stopped.  Six months ago we were informed that the building was to be acquired by the Government and adapted for use as offices by the Department of Social Welfare.  Yesterday the Minister for Social Welfare told us that not a penny has been spent by any Government Department in preparing plans for the conversion of that building to offices for his Department.  It is going to take a considerable period of time to prepare plans for the conversion of that building. A substantial building which was in large part designed as a bus garage cannot be easily and conveniently converted into offices without a great deal of planning which must be done before any conversion work can be started.  I do not know whether we got the whole truth from the Minister for Social Welfare. If, however, it is a fact that nothing has been done by any Government Department, not a penny spent in the preparation of plans for the conversion of that building into offices for his Department, then there has been scandalous delay, a delay which some member of the Government should attempt to justify.  If the Government had not interfered, that building would be completed and a central bus station would be in operation by now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that that is not so.  I shall content myself with reading paragraph 133 of the Milne Report, which was published in 1948:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Considerable progress has been made with the erection of the building, and it is anticipated that the work will be completed towards the end of next year.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is to say the end of 1949.  However, on the assumption that the Government cannot be induced to change their mind and recognise that they made a bad decision and should get out of the position which it has created for them, we have got to deal with this issue.  It is not true, I think, that the decision to abandon Store Street as a bus garage was taken by the Government <Col N="192" /> in consultation with Córas Iompair Éireann.  Córas Iompair Éireann were told of the Government's decision and disliked it.  Subsequent to the taking of that decision by the Government, the chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann appointed by the present Government went back to the Government and urged them at least to permit of the retention by Córas Iompair Éireann of the bus garage portion of the building and to limit their acquisition to the offices overhead.  He was refused that concession by the Government. It is, therefore, unfair to Córas Iompair Éireann and to its chairman to represent the decision as having been taken by the Government in consultation with him.</P>
    <P>As between Store Street and Smithfield sites, it is a fact that every technical expert whose opinion was sought on the matter favoured Store Street. It is a fact that before the Store Street site was chosen the possibility of using Smithfield was considered and rejected. It is a fact that the Town Planning Committee of the Dublin Corporation, the traffic section of the Garda Síochána and Córas Iompair Éireann regarded Store Street as suitable. It is a fact that Smithfield is unsuitable and, I understand, will not be sanctioned by the Dublin Corporation for use as a bus depôt unless street widening on a considerable scale is part of the plan.  If there is street widening, then clearly it would be unreasonable to expect the Dublin Corporation to pay the cost of it.  It is no answer to the criticism of Smithfield to say that buses can operate there without streets being widened. It is a fact that no sensible person would like to sanction the use of Smithfield unless that widening took place in the interests of public safety.</P>
    <P>We are, therefore, in this position, that there is a building there in Store Street which could be adapted for use as a central bus station in a very short time.  The need for a central bus station has existed for many years.  It existed before the war.  A decision to construct it before the war was hampered by the fact that the Great Southern Railways Company of those days was not in a position to finance <Col N="193" /> it and could not by any means raise the capital for the purpose. Construction could not be undertaken during the war.  It was begun as early as possible after the conclusion of the war.  To criticise that decision of Córas Iompair Éireann on the ground of the company's financial position ignores the fact that work on Store Street was begun in 1946, a year in which Córas Iompair Éireann made profits in excess of £1,000,000.  It is, of course, nonsense to say that Córas Iompair Éireann are not in a position to finance that undertaking.</P>
    <P>I do not know what conception Deputies have of the function of a national transport organisation.  Surely its function is to provide proper transport facilities.  If we are going to decide that proper facilities are not to be provided because they cost money, then much more than the construction of a central bus station in Dublin is liable to be abandoned.  The construction of that central bus station and central offices was decided on by the Córas Iompair Éireann board with the approval of the Government, under pressure from the Government, for two reasons: (1) because the construction of a central bus station was regarded as an essential facility for bus travellers, a facility which they should have, just as railway travellers have corresponding facilities in the railway depôts, and (2) because a centralisation of their administration was likely to increase its efficiency and reduce its cost.  I do not want Deputies to take my word for that.  Sir James Milne commented on that aspect of the scheme also:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Centralisation of headquarters should facilitate the general administration of the company's business and enable several economies to be effected, but some sections of the administrative work could be equally well carried on elsewhere.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have already on another occasion given the Dáil my personal experience in the Department of Industry and Commerce of the tremendous increased administrative efficiency and convenience which follows upon the centralisation of activities in one building.  I am quite certain that a similar improvement <Col N="194" /> in the administration of Córas Iompair Éireann would follow the centralisation of their staffs in the proposed offices at Store Street.  If, however, there is an urgent need for accommodation for the Department of Social Welfare, if the Government decide that that need is greater than that of Córas Iompair Éireann, and if, therefore, they feel justified in taking over the offices which were being built for the Córas Iompair Éireann staff and using them for the Department of Social Welfare, that does not necessarily involve the abandonment of Store Street as a central bus station. That is a fact which the Minister tried to obscure.</P>
    <P>It may be that the total of the staffs for which the Department of Social Welfare requires accommodation is greater than can be fitted into the office portion of the Store Street building, but, nevertheless, there is sufficient accommodation there greatly to relieve their present problem and to permit of time to the Department to proceed with the far more intelligent plan which was prepared for the construction of the additional accommodation adjacent to their present headquarters in the Castle.</P>
    <P>I am not going to attempt to offer a technical opinion upon the suitability of Store Street.  It is very misleading to represent the location of a bus depôt there as necessarily involving that all the long-distance bus traffic must pass over Butt Bridge.  The intention, as I understand it, was that some 80 to 90 per cent. of the long-distance bus traffic into Dublin would come down the North Circular Road to Store Street and thus avoid crossing the traffic in the centre of the city.</P>
    <P>The consideration I want to put to the Dáil is this, that wherever the central bus station is to be located, it should be convenient to the centre of the city; it should be within a radius of a mile from O'Connell Bridge.  I think that Córas Iompair Éireann and the Dublin Town Planning Committee were remarkably fortunate in the fact that, convenient to the centre of the city, there was such a site as Store Street.  I invite any Deputy to get a map of the city and a compass and put <Col N="195" /> the point of the compass on O'Connell Bridge and draw a circle of a half or three-quarters of a mile radius from the centre of the city and find there any place at which a bus depôt could be built without involving the demolition of buildings in use or considerable alterations in the width of streets.</P>
    <P>But in Store Street there was a building that was not in use, a deserted store, a building that was so ugly, as I said before, it should long ago have been demolished on æsthetic grounds. It was there to be purchased cheaply and to be demolished without inconveniencing anybody.  It was so located that, in relation to Amiens Street railway station, the shipping services on the quays and the city's shopping centre, it was almost ideal.</P>
    <P>No doubt, any expert town planner would have justified some other site if it was equally available.  The original town plan of Dublin, I think, contemplated the construction of an omnibus station west of O'Connell Bridge on Aston's Quay or, preferably, in Christchurch Place.  Anybody who can afford to ignore the practical difficulties of getting the work done quickly could recommend some such location as that.  The officials of the Dublin Corporation and of Córas Iompair Éireann were, however, well aware of the long and tedious process that would have to be completed before title to any suitable site in this area could be acquired, much less construction work begun.  There was no such difficulty in relation to Store Street and, although it may not be described as the perfect site, it was, from many points of view, superior to any other site that could be procured.</P>
    <P>Whether they were right or wrong in taking that site, there it is.  Whether they were right or wrong in spending money on it, there is the building completed. Is it reasonable at this stage to intervene, to attempt to adapt a building designed by experts for one purpose so as to utilise it for quite another purpose altogether?</P>

I do say this, that the alterations in that building in the provision of lavatory accommodation, fire escapes and the other amenities that must be provided for the men and women who are to be employed on clerical work, will involve far more expenditure than would be needed for the construction at Ship Street of far more suitable buildings for the same staff.  I think it is untrue&mdash;I know it is untrue&mdash;that no State money has been spent upon the preparation of plans for the conversion of that building.  I know that plans have been prepared. I do not know who is paying for them.</P>

      <P>I do not, fortunately. So far as the records of the House are concerned, the Minister for Social Welfare said that not a penny has been spent by any Government Department on plans for the conversion of that building.  That is on the record and that conveys a worse situation than I am assuming exists.  Eventually time will tell whether it is correct or not.  I am not forgetting that the Government Information Bureau once published an indignant denial that the Government ever intended to take over Store Street station for the purposes of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>I would be in a bad way if I were.  I put this proposition to the Government: they can get out of this situation if they take what appears to be the intelligent course.  I will undertake on my part never to taunt them with changing their minds. I think the man who will not change his mind when he realises he has made a mistake is very unintelligent.  The Government have made a mistake. They can reverse it, because no work has been done towards the conversion of the building for use by the staffs of the Department of Social Welfare.  If they reverse that decision the work on the Store Street building can be resumed and the building can be in use by the end of this year as a central bus depôt.  The need for the depôt is recognised.  The only thing holding it up is the unwillingness of the Government to release the building for that purpose, the purpose for which it was approved by every expert whose opinion is available to members of the Dáil.  Therefore, I urge at this stage that the Minister will, in relation to this amendment, at least indicate that the position will be reconsidered.  If he does that, I will urge Deputy Cowan to withdraw his amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the speakers to this amendment have addressed themselves to the amendment with what I might describe as the Dublin urban mind.  I am what might be described by Dublin dwellers as a country man, though Cork City people would not so describe themselves.  Before I became a member of this House I myself thought Store Street most unsuitable as a central bus depôt because I was then under the impression that the <Col N="198" /> greatest volume of traffic from the south and west would have to cross O'Connell Bridge to and from that central depôt.  Since I became a member of this House, I have become more familiar with the City of Dublin and I have come to the conclusion that the greatest folly the Government could commit would be to abandon Store Street.  Traffic using such a bus depôt need not touch upon the nerve centre of the city at all at O'Connell Bridge and Butt Bridge.  North, south and westbound buses could use the North Circular Road.  There is nothing like the same density of traffic on that route as there is on O'Connell Bridge and along the quays.  Travelling to the west the buses could travel the full length of the North Circular Road and then proceed either through the Park, or down Infimary Road and out by Chapelizod.  Going south the bus traffic could use the North Circular Road, pass out over Island Bridge and through Kilmainham.  Going to the north Circular Road at Drumcondra. In that way density of traffic could be avoided.  Possibly buses travelling to the south-east might contribute to the density of traffic on Butt Bridge.</P>
      <P>I submit that the alternative proposed by the Government in relation to the erection of a central bus depôt at Smithfield would only make confusion worse confounded.  It would, indeed, create chaos.  I get my car serviced in Smithfield.  Sometimes I have driven to Smithfield.  Sometimes I have had to walk.  No one can deny that even at the present time, without any ferry service to bring people from Smithfield to the centre of the city, the traffic along this route is much too dense.  It is outside the bounds of practicability to suggest putting any more traffic on these routes.  From any point of view the proposed site at Smithfield is most unsuitable.  I have here a quotation from the <i>Irish Times</i> of October 28th, 1949.  In the column headed &ldquo;London Letter&rdquo; there is a reference to this particular problem. It is stated there:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>&ldquo;Modern Transport,</i> a technical journal, which enjoys a high standing in the transport would, has recently <Col N="199" /> had two members of its staff in Dublin to make an investigation on the spot into the question of the central bus station.</P>
    <P>In an article in the current issue, it is held that the decision to turn the Store Street building into Government offices, and put the bus station instead at Smithfield, is mistaken. Smithfield, it is pointed out, is threequarters of a mile from O'Connell Bridge, and if it were to be used, a connecting bus service to Smithfield would be necessary.  This would cause as much congestion as the provincial buses are said to be in danger of causing at O'Connell Bridge, particularly to passengers with luggage, and the advantages of a concentrated loading area would be wiped out.</P>
    <P>The conversion of the building to Government offices, the article suggests, will probably involve much additional expense, while there will be no return, such as Córas Iompair Éireann would have received from rent of shops, catering, etc., at the station.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It concludes with a quotation from the periodical itself as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whatever may be the final decision, Dublin's need of a bus station is urgent... the hope may be earnestly expressed that in the wider public interest and, indeed, in the cause of true Irish national economy, the Government will feel that there now seems every reason to use the new Store Street building for the purposes for which it was originally intended.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That quotation is taken from a well-informed journal on transport.  It is published in England and certainly it cannot be said to have any particular bias one way or the other.  Two impartial observers were sent by it to examine this problem.  I submit that they have reported, not only impartially but most intelligently, as to the proper solution.  From a countryman's point of view, I suggest that the advantages of Store Street as a central bus depôt far outweigh any advantages <Col N="200" /> in the alternative site proposed at Smithfield.  From the point of view of congestion, there can be no argument since Smithfield must add considerably to the already existing congestion, whereas Store Street, using the routes I have suggested, would go a long way towards relieving the present chaotic condition of transport around O'Connell Bridge and Butt Bridge.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the Minister and the Minister's advocate in this debate, I feel that it is a good job that Dublin was built before the Minister came into office. We have a city full of magnificent buildings.  If these buildings were to be erected at the present time, they would be exceedingly costly.  One asks oneself what would be the attitude of the Government and the Minister if they had any responsibility in regard to the erection of such buildings.  I think, if they had any such responsibility, we would have no buildings, and we would have no city.</P>

      <P>That seems to be the idea.  That is the kind of mentality that shows itself in the Minister's speech in regard to this particular matter.  We have a magnificent airport at Collinstown.  It is a good job that was completed before the Minister came into office; otherwise, he would have scrapped it.  It is a good job that his own departmental building was completed because, clearly, on his own argument here this evening, he would have scrapped it.  Each generation must contribute something towards development.  Store Street was some contribution towards development, but it has been decided to scrap it.  Deputy Lemass said this afternoon that the decision to scrap Store Street was taken by the Government without any consultation with Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>

      <P>Some Deputies want to take the line that the Government have come to this decision.  They have come to this decision after the type of consultation that has been mentioned with the chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann; after the type of consultation with the Garda authorities.  They have come to the decision that they will not proceed with Store Street and that they must have their bus depôt in Smithfield.  The Government may have been wrong in that decision.  But whether they were right or wrong, if we approach this from a purely political point of view then they must be supported by a majority of Deputies in the House.  Is that not what it boils down to?  No matter how wrong they may be, no matter how wrong the Minister may be in his approach to it, that is the position.  I do not know whether this is a Government decision or whether it is the Minister's decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether it is the Minister's decision, approved by the Government, or whether it is the Government's decision that the Minister has indicated.  I just do not know.  I do not know what the Minister's own views are in regard to it&mdash; whether, personally, he believes or, personally, he does not believe.  But, anyway, as I have already said&mdash;and I just want to repeat it, in conclusion&mdash; this building is almost completed.  It can provide amenities and facilities for bus travellers.  If, as Deputy Lemass says, the Department of Social Welfare requires those offices, arrangements can be made to let them have the use of the offices for a time.  The general view is that those offices were offered to the Department of Social Welfare.  The office portion of the <Col N="205" /> building was offered to the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Social Welfare said:&ldquo;No, we must have the building, lock, stock and barrel.&rdquo;  If that rumour is incorrect I should like the Minister to nail it now and say that no such thing as that happened.</P>

Did the chairman of <Col N="206" /> Córas Iompair Éireann request that the bus portion of this building should be left available as a bus depôt, and did the Department of Social Welfare say that they would have nothing to do with it unless they got the building lock, stock and barrel?

      <P>There is no harm in trying.  If you do not try you will not succeed, and probably, notwithstanding how this matter may go on a vote in this House, the Minister may yet respond to pressure in regard to it. I am quite certain that in that event Deputy O'Higgins would be just as eloquent in supporting a change of front by the Minister and in suggesting improper motives to me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

All I said was that I saw nothing wrong in his trying to look after the needs of his constituency.  I still think that.  The Deputy now talks of bringing additional pressure to bear in this matter.  Is he going to bring the Volunteer movement into this now?</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are reasonable in their charges.  However, that is not the issue.  Deputy O'Higgins did suggest that the only reason this amendment was put down was that Store Street happened to be in my constituency and he suggested that I should be satisfied with making a show, as it were, in regard to it and that I should withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>Making my protest? I want Deputy O'Higgins to realise that my attitude is somewhat different from what he supposes it to be.  If that Store Street building were built anywhere else in Dublin City, I would support the completion of it exactly in the way in which I am supporting it now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It may come as a surprise that some people can believe in supporting a matter on principle, no matter how that may affect themselves personally or politically.  That does happen.  However, so far as this is concerned, I understand that the Talbot Street Association which has been mentioned by Deputy O'Higgins have been in touch with members of the corporation and that they have also been in touch with Deputies in my area but they have certainly overlooked me or at least they have not approached me in regard to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to prolong this debate further and I am certainly not going to follow Deputies down side lanes.  A lot of ground has been covered.  Every aspect of this matter has been touched upon except one.  Neither Deputy Lemass, Deputy Cowan nor anybody else adverted to two facts&mdash;(1) that this building, except for that portion of it which could be used purely as a bus station, is not required by Córas Iompair Éireann and (2) the much more important fact that Córas Iompair Éireann cannot afford it. Nobody adverted to the fact that a bus station, at least as good as the one in Store Street, can be provided for an estimated sum of £150,000 as against an expenditure in Store Street of £1,000,000.  Deputy Cowan repeated over and over again that the building in Store Street was almost completed-Deputy Lemass asserted that also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I quoted the Milne Report&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me put the Deputy right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that it would be completed by the end of last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Let me put the Deputy right.  The final estimate was that before it would be ready for occupation it would cost approximately £1,000,000.  About £380,000 has been spent on it, and there is still £600,000 to be spent on it.  Even if there had been no interruption, no change in the plans which were made by the old company and approved by the previous Government, the building would not now be ready for occupation and would not be ready for a considerable time. Deputy Cowan&mdash;of course one can understand Deputy Cowan's attitude&mdash; and Deputies on the other side are weeping over the conditions under which people have to wait for their buses and descend from them on Aston's Quay.  Deputy Colley was appalled at the conditions that obtain on Aston's Quay.  Some of us who had to suffer these conditions during <Col N="209" /> the war, lining up and queueing there, knew of these conditions and knew that they existed for many years before the war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Deputy and his colleagues on the Dublin Corporation are trying to check us in providing a new bus station in Smithfield, to improve conditions for the people generally.  I want again to ask do Deputies believe that Córas Iompair Éireann, which is a bankrupt concern, can afford to spend £1,000,000 on the project in Store Street with a superstructure of five storeys for modern offices which they do not require? Deputies have very short memories.  It is only a few weeks since I had to come to the House with a Supplementary Estimate for £4,000,000.  I do not suppose I am giving any secret away when I say that I will probably have to come to the House for some more money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So will the Minister for Social Welfare, to finish this building. You will have to pay for it, anyhow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me make this perfectly clear.  If the Department of Social Welfare never required offices, so far as the Government is concerned it was not going to spend or allow Córas Iompair Éireann, in their unfortunate financial plight, to attempt to spend £1,000,000 on a building to provide accommodation&mdash;necessary accommodation&mdash;which could be provided for £150,000.  I do not want to sail away on the fact that the Department of Social Welfare require offices.  Whether they require them or not, this project would not go on.  It is easy for Deputy Cowan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's questions are not simple at all and the Deputy is in no way simple, either.  I am not objecting to the questions the Deputy asked, but am just reminding the Deputy that he jumped to his feet very quickly when he alleged that Deputy O'Higgins had attributed an unworthy motive to him; yet he has attributed, in the course of the last speech and in his questions, unworthy motives to quite a number of people and to people who cannot defend themselves here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to associate myself with the objection made by Deputy Cowan to the remarks of Deputy O'Higgins.  If we were to follow his reasoning to a logical conclusion, a Deputy from a particular constituency in which some project or another might be under examination should, or would be, excluded from discussing that particular project.  That is a rather narrow, childish suggestion that he made.  In addition, he went on to say that the reference by other Deputies in this House who did not agree with his views was pure propaganda.  That was equally childish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not hope to convince the Minister that he should change his mind, as his mind is set.  There is no possibility of inducing him to do the logical thing at this stage, as he has been obviously defending a prejudice here right from the beginning of this debate.  He is not defending the project at all.  He has been defending the prejudice that has been built up against this structure because it was conceived in the time of the Fianna Fáil Government and for no other reason.  It suffers from the <Col N="212" /> same defect as the transatlantic air lines, the travel bureau and all the rest.</P>
    <P>In the course of the Minister's remarks here, he said he had a reasonably good knowledge of the City of Dublin.  Had he not said that, I was going to point out that, as a Deputy coming from a rural district, he was suffering from the disability of not knowing the particular area about which this discussion is being taken. When he went into the question of traffic congestion&mdash;and he seemed to be very worried in respect of the tremendous congestion that would ensue following the use of this building as a depôt for the buses&mdash;he seemed to be unaware of the fact that the exit from this bus depôt is through an eastern route.  He seemed to be unaware that buses leaving for the south, the west and possibly the east, such as Wexford and Wicklow, would have been via Amiens Street, the North Circular Road and right out to the thoroughfare that would take them to the east, the west and the south. Thereby the congestion which he appears to have feared to a considerable extent would have been eliminated.</P>
    <P>The proposition now of removing the bus depôt to Smithfield, to my mind, will add to the congestion that exists on the northern quays of Dublin City. He has also suggested that there will be practically no necessity for alterations in the Smithfield district.  If he knew Smithfield as well as he has stated he knows it, he must know that the only exit from Smithfield on to the northern quays is a narrow thoroughfare, probably not 20 feet wide.  I have not gone to the trouble of measuring it, but I would be prepared to vouch for the fact that if it exceeds 24 feet it is as much as it is.  How these large buses are going to emerge from a thoroughfare of that width into a thoroughfare which is carrying all the traffic from the north side I cannot imagine.</P>
    <P>It has also been stated here that whatever alterations may be necessary, whatever removal of buildings may be required and whatever reconstruction may be needed, the cost will not fall upon the ratepayers.  Doubt has been expressed as to whether that is correct <Col N="213" /> or not.  However, if it does not fall on the ratepayers of Dublin, it will fall surely on the people as a whole.  It is the people who will pay eventually, whether it is the citizens of Dublin or the people of the nation.  It will be paid for anyhow out of the pocket of the people.  That cannot be disputed.</P>
    <P>In the course of his remarks, the Minister also said that if he were looking for the worst site in Dublin&mdash;or words to that effect&mdash;he would not pass Store Street by.  I think he was not serious when he made that statement, just as he cannot really be serious when he tells us that Smithfield is a much more ideal site for the purpose.  If he looks into the matter, he will find that not only was the exit from the bus depôt along the routes I have mentioned but that it was proposed to carry a thoroughfare right direct down through Amiens Street and out on to the Custom House Quay, which would have brought tremendous relief to the area around Beresford Place into Abbey Street.  While it would not in any respect ease the terrific congestion which continues at Butt Bridge, it would at least relieve the congestion around the bus depôt.</P>
    <P>I want to say, in addition to what has been said by other speakers, that the bus depôt has been left there practically derelict for the last two years.  I raised this question with the Minister before and he informed me that I was making a misstatement, that there was quite a number of people employed.  If there was, I could <Col N="214" /> not find them or see them.  I saw one or two individuals going about the outline of the building which, to my mind, has been left there a gaunt skeleton in order to raise the minds of the people against it.  Certainly, no construction of any kind worth talking about has been carried out on that building for the last couple of years.  I am pretty certain that, as a result of that neglect, there must be a certain amount of serious deterioration taking place.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 15.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 19 (a):&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 15 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The board shall furnish to the Minister such information as he may from time to time require regarding matters which relate to its activities, other than day-to-day administration, and which appear to him to affect the national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I move this amendment in order to try to meet, to some extent at least, the point of view put by many Deputies on Second Reading, that there should be some machinery which would enable them to get from the Minister information regarding the operations of the company.  As Deputies are aware, I stated in reply to those of them who asked for this that I would not be prepared to put myself in the position of having to answer to the Dáil for the day-to-day administration of the company; but seeing that it is going to be a national company and that certain <Col N="217" /> of its decisions or projects may be of a character that would affect the national interest, I have tried to meet Deputies to the extent that the company will be required to supply me, on request, with information concerning what might be described as matters of major policy. The House, I think, ought to agree that I have gone as far as is reasonable to meet the point of view put up and I hope Deputies will be satisfied with the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see how the amendment meets the point at all.  The purpose of the amendment is to require the board to furnish information to the Minister.  What the House desires to have, or what we can assume from the speeches made on the Second Reading debate there was a general desire to have, was a degree of Ministerial responsibility to the Dáil which would permit of the Dáil raising here for the purpose of getting a decision questions of general policy.  The board would, it is assumed, supply the Minister with information concerning its activities in any circumstances.  Does the fact that the Minister will have that information mean that Deputies can procure it by way of Parliamentary question?  Will it mean that any Deputy who is dissatisfied with the activities of the company in any particular matter will be able to table a motion here and get recorded a decision of the Dáil disapproving of the activities of the company or calling for their revision?  If it means that then I think it is important enough.  We are setting up a national undertaking.  It will be carried on in accordance with the legislation we enact.  It will be, for some time at any rate, in need of financial help from the taxpayers which Deputies will be required to vote year after year.  In the circumstances it seems clear enough that the House should have some means of getting information from the Minister, some means of raising questions affecting the company from time to time.  I do not suppose that any Deputy would desire to put the Minister in the position of being required to answer why a particular officer of the company was dismissed or transferred or why <Col N="218" /> some other administrative arrangement of that kind was carried out, but if there is an alteration in train services or other facilities which affect commercial interests in a Deputy's constituency he should be able to get from the Minister an explanation of the action of the company in making the change and a justification for it.  If he is dissatisfied with the explanation he should be able to bring all the facts before the Dáil and endeavour to get other Deputies to support a motion calling for the restoration of the old conditions or the institution of new arrangements. Does the Minister intend that this amendment if it is adopted will mean that he will be open to be questioned here by Dáil question and liable to have the policy of the company debated upon a motion tabled here?</P>

      <P>I like the change of attitude on the Minister's part indicated by the submission of this amendment.  In my view, while the amendment does not go perhaps as far as many of us would like, at least it does indicate a material change, a fundamental change in the whole character of this piece of legislation.  With many other Deputies on this side as well as on the opposite side of the House I was one of those who urged in unmeasured terms upon the Minister that it should be possible for Deputies of this House to bring under review the activities of the new nationally controlled transport company.  In my view&mdash;I am open to correction on this &mdash;the amendment goes a considerable distance to meet the point of view which was expressed to the Minister during the course of the Second Reading of the Bill.  I take it&mdash;I would like the Minister to be explicit in answering this&mdash;that there is no doubt but that the inclusion of this amendment will mean that it will be open to Deputies on any matter other than a purely day to day matter to elicit information from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose is to enable Deputies here in the House to raise matters, particularly of course by way of question, in connection with any information which I feel under the terms of this amendment I should require <Col N="219" /> the company to furnish me with; in other words any matter other than an ordinary day to day matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that it cannot be done by way of motion. It probably can.  My idea was to get the amendment drafted so that it would go a reasonable way to meet Deputies without going so far that it could be abused.  The Deputy can take it that it meets his point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>That argument was advanced on the Second Reading as well as now by Deputies who did not see eye to eye with us and it is a point I can readily appreciate, but it is not the desire of any Deputy that the time of this House, public time, should be wasted by questions to the Minister concerning the <i>trivia</i> of administration in the new Córas Iompair Éireann.  That was advanced as an argument, not altogether honestly I think in some cases, against the whole principle of allowing Deputies to bring the activities of the transport company under review.  I think that the Minister has now made it plain that as far as matters other than day-to-day matters are concerned it will be open to Deputies to elicit information from him by way of Parliamentary question.  I should like to say that I appreciate the fact that the Minister has met the opinions expressed by numerous Deputies in the way he did.  Those of us who had the opportunity of discussing this matter with the Minister and of placing our views before him realised that we had a wall of objection to break down in the views the Minister held.  He held them honestly and he certainly held them very strongly and for that reason my appreciation of the length to which the Minister has gone to meet us is to that extent enhanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that we will not on any occasion be faced with the situation of a Minister saying: &ldquo;My opinion of what is or is not of national importance is the operative thing.&rdquo;  I hope that there will be a reasonable interpretation of that portion of the <Col N="220" /> section but as far as it goes, taking the amendment on its face value.  I think the House will welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a clarification to my mind if I put the question which I addressed to the Minister in a somewhat different way.  Possibly it should be answered by the Ceann Comhairle rather than by the Minister. If the company increases its costs for the haulage of beet, can a Deputy or Deputies put down a motion expressing disapproval of that decision and asking for its revision and have that motion accepted as in order by the Ceann Comhairle on the grounds that the Minister has responsibility or will the Ceann Comhairle say that the Minister has no responsibility and that the motion is out of order even though the Minister is prepared to defend or explain the board's action?  Will he answer questions in the House in regard to decisions of the company that might affect the general interests of the community or the specific interests of particular parts of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>If a decision affects the general interests of the community, or even a considerable section of the community, then I think it could be held that it was one affecting the national interest, and after all that is the governing factor in this amendment. It would apply, say, in the case of an industry of such very great importance as the beet industry if some action were taken that was likely to damage or discourage in any way that industry.  This amendment is the best we are able to do from the point of view of getting words to meet Deputies to the fullest extent short of having questions raised here day after day in regard to the ordinary actions of the board or its officers.  I think Deputies can take it from me that I have approached this with the intention of meeting them to the fullest possible extent.  The wording set out in the amendment is the best that we could find.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Minister's only difficulty in connection with the amendment was to get suitable language in which he could give <Col N="221" /> an assurance to Deputies that they will have access to information from the new board of Córas Iompair Éireann on matters other than those relating to day to day administration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I should like to say, in that connection, that I would hope advantage would be taken of this amended section only to the barest minimum.  If action were taken by the board of Córas Iompair Éireann on matters which Deputies felt were of importance to the community, then Deputies in my opinion should be entitled to raise them, again subject to the Ceann Comhairle, either by way of question or by way of motion.  I want, however, to make it clear that it would not be fair to the company and would be an abuse of what I am now proposing, if Deputies were to be asking questions every other day.</P>

      <P>As one who is interested in this amendment, I want to say now what I said before, that we should not be afraid of giving Deputies the right of asking questions in the case of a board of this character.  If the wording of the amendment means that if something is done by the board about which a Deputy will have the right to put down a question, the whole matter may be raised here.  Then I am satisfied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>There was one point raised by Deputy Lemass which I would like to be clear on.  Take it that the amendment is accepted and that a question is put down by a Deputy, is the propriety of that question to be decided by the Minister&mdash;it may appear to him to affect the national interest under the terms of the amendment&mdash;or is it to be decided by the Ceann Comhairle in accordance with Standing Orders and Procedure?  I do not want to be disrespectful to the Ceann Comhairle, but we know he is bound by Procedure and Standing Orders, whereas the Minister is subject, if you like, to pressure both inside and outside the House.  I, personally, would prefer to have to depend on the Minister's interpretation than on what would probably be the more strict interpretation that the Ceann Comhairle would be bound to apply.</P>

      <P>The intention here is to deal with a particular situation. Whether it does that fully or not I am not just in a position to say.  I take it that it will be possible to move an amendment on the Report Stage dealing with this if that should be considered necessary.  I am not altogether clear with regard to the amendment, but I take it that the Minister's view is that if this new section were not there the board could ignore the request of the Minister for information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amendment which obliges the board to furnish to the Minister information about everything except matters relating to day-to-day administration, if the Minister considers that the information he requires affects the national interest. I take it that the Minister and his advisers and the drafters of this new amendment were of opinion that without it the board was under no obligation to furnish to the Minister information of the type indicated in the amendment.  That is a different thing entirely from giving this House the right to require information from the Minister, and that is why I am anxious to have more time to consider it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lehane suggests that, once the Minister can get the information from the board, the Dáil can then oblige the Minister to give the information to the House.  That may be so. But if it is not, does it mean that the Minister cannot require the board to give him information?  If the board is bound to give the Minister information, then I think this amendment should not be in the form in which it is because it will create some confusion. I should like to have an opportunity of considering this more fully when I see a print of the Bill after it leaves Committee.</P>

      <P>I welcome the insertion of this amendment.  It represents a considerable improvement, from the point of view of Deputies, on the powers enshrined in the 1944 Act. Those who have been members of the House since the 1944 Act was passed know that there were many occasions when Deputies wanted to get information and could not.  There were occasions when they tried to persuade the Minister to use his good offices to get the company to change some objectionable practice&mdash;for example, the closing of branch lines or the reopening of branch lines that had been closed.  On such occasions Deputies were generally told by the Minister that he had no power to intervene.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The transport undertaking is one thing, but the powers and duties of the board extend beyond the provision of a transport undertaking. Consequently, the alteration of the wording here means that you are giving them power to acquire lands and property compulsorily in connection with the exercise of duties or functions which extend beyond the operation of the transport undertaking.  I have no very great objection to it, but it is widening the powers of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  I think this is a provision we should make.  There are possibilities that we can foresee even now where they may very legitimately engage in a certain operation or operations which would not come within the definition as it is there at the moment and which it would be quite legitimate and perhaps very desirable for a national transport company to undertake.  As a matter of fact it might be a sort of activity that could more properly and more <Col N="225" /> efficiently be undertaken by a national transport company than by any other organisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The power of compulsory acquisition of land is given to these public service undertakings operating under statute in circumstances where it is obvious that their activities require the purchase of a particular piece of land.  If the Electricity Supply Board has a power-station on a particular site that it wants to enlarge it has to purchase the field immediately beside it.  Similarly, a railway is so fixed to the land that any extension of it means the acquisition of a particular piece of land.  In such circumstances, the price of the land would be abnormally enhanced against them if they had to rely upon voluntary purchase. In the case of activities which could be carried on on alternate sites, where an undertaking can acquire land in one place or, if they cannot get it upon reasonable terms, acquire it somewhere else, the powers of compulsory acquisition should not be used.  It is only where purveyors of property can, as it were, gang up against the national undertaking that this power of compulsory acquisition is needed. Where a national undertaking has an alternative to acquiring a piece of property the price of which is enhanced against it, the ordinary process is by agreement.  However, that is a theoretical point.</P>

      <P>( ) (a)  Where an acquisition order is made in relation to any land, the board may, subject to the subsequent provisions of this sub-section and before conveyance or ascertainment of compensation, enter on and take possession of the land.</P>
      <P>(b)  The board shall not enter on or take possession of any land under paragraph (a)  of this sub-section without giving to the occupier thereof at least one month's or, in the case of an occupied dwelling house, three month's previous notice in writing of its intention.</P>
      <P>(c)  A notice under paragraph (b) of this sub-section may be given to any person by sending it by prepaid post in an envelope addressed to that person at his usual or last known address.</P>
      <P>(d)  Where the board in exercise of its powers under paragraph (a) of this sub-section enters on and takes possession of any land any compensation payable in respect of that land to the person who would, from time to time be entitled to occupy it, if the board had not exercised those powers, shall bear interest at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum from the date of entry until payment of the compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="227" /> I am advised that this new sub-section is necessary and desirable.  I am informed that it is a common provision in legislation relating to local authorities and that, as I said in respect of the previous amendment, it is applicable in the case of acquisition of lands by the Electricity Supply Board and Bord na Móna.  It provides that after the acquisition order is made the board may take possession of the site.  The House may remember that we did the same thing last year when the Electricity Supply Board Bill was going through.</P>

      <P>The Minister cannot kill my amendments by not moving the sections. I am only protecting a right.  I am not saying what I am going to do.</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 25:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 17 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The provisions of Sections 70 to 87 inclusive and of Sections 92 and 93 and of Sections 94 to 101 inclusive of the Transport Act, 1944 (No. 21 of 1944) shall apply to the board as to a dissolved undertaker.</P>
      <P>On the whole, I think it is better to discuss this general question on this amendment.  This is one of the main issues which arise in connection with the Bill.  It concerns the point of responsibility for increasing transport charges, curtailing transport services, or making other changes in transport arrangements of a similar kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will remember that, under the provisions of the 1944 Act, such changes were made by a procedure which terminated with a decision of the Minister.  In the case of alteration of maximum charges, classifications of merchandise, standard conditions of carriage and so forth, the company made its proposals, published details of them, and ultimately the Minister, having considered the issue in the light <Col N="229" /> of the Government's proposals and any public representations directed to him, came to a decision for which he was responsible to the Dáil.  Similarly, in the matter of the curtailment of services, the closing of branch lines and of stations and other alterations in the scope of the transport undertaking, the company decided upon its policy; it published in the Press details of its decision, made application to the Minister for sanction and the Minister gave or withheld that sanction, it being open to him to refer the matter to the Transport Tribunal established under the Act for an inquiry.</P>
    <P>The whole procedure was designed to remove certain obstacles to the alteration of charges and conditions of operation which had existed previously and at the same time keep in the hands of the Minister, as representing the public interest, the ultimate decision, a device which ensured that the Dáil could, and frequently did, express its view on the matter in question.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House, as it stands at present, is designed to give the company power to deal with these matters on its own responsibility, both in regard to the alteration of charges, the variation of services, and maintenance of branch lines and stations.  The new board can act on its own responsibility, taking the course it considered best, without being responsible to anybody, except in a very general way to the Minister.  The Minister is not required, however, to sanction any specific act and consequently cannot be challenged by the Dáil in relation to it.</P>
    <P>Following the Second Reading debate, the Minister decided to change his proposals in that regard and he now proposes to move amendments designed to establish a transport tribunal to which the company will apply whenever it desires to raise charges or alter railway services, and whose consent must be secured by the company before the changes are effected.</P>
    <P>Now, these are three alternative methods of dealing with what is the kernel of our transport problem and, having considered the two alternatives which the Minister has given us in the <Col N="230" /> Bill and in the amendments, I am strongly of opinion that the procedure laid down in the 1944 Act is still the best.  It is obviously desirable to release transport undertakings from the onerous restrictions on their freedom of action which were imposed by old time legislation, in the days when public transport services were almost entirely confined to railways and canals, which, because of their nature, had an effective and complete monopoly, each in its own area.  The legislators of various countries were naturally concerned to protect the public against exploitation by these monopolies.  Transport legislation for the past 50, 60 or 100 years was all based upon the assumption that public transport was operated on a monopoly basis and that legislators had not merely the duty but a considerable responsibility in protecting the public against these monopolies.</P>
    <P>That situation changed fundamentally when the monopolies of the railways and canals disappeared with the emergence of the motor car and, even though subsequent legislation passed here was designed to re-create in part the monopolies of the transport undertakings by giving them certain exclusive rights in the matter of the operation of transport services by motor vehicles, nevertheless we know that the old situation has passed, that the monopoly which formerly existed is permanently broken and, so long as we permit private lorries and cars to operate freely, it can never be fully restored.</P>
    <P>The change in the transport situation was not immediately followed, however, by changes in the law or even in the outlook of those responsible for making the law and it was reluctantly, and only in a piecemeal fashion, that we released the transport undertakings from the restrictions which were formerly imposed upon them, which it was necessary to maintain in the old situation but which were merely a handicap to their survival in the new. The easy course to take at any time was that which the Minister favoured when framing the Bill&mdash;release them from all these restrictions, let them charge what they can and let them <Col N="231" /> run whatever services it pays them to run.  That, of course, has a great deal to recommend it.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputies argue here yesterday in favour of differential freight charges for the purpose of encouraging national economic development, for the purpose of facilitating specific forms of production or the cheap distribution of particular goods throughout the country.  I do not think these Deputies have fully appreciated the problem of our transport undertaking. In the days of railway monopolies, railway charges were fixed upon the principle of charging what the traffic could bear.  Every schedule of charges was prepared upon the basis of ascertaining the highest rate which the traffic would bear and still be available. If the traffic ceased, the rate was too high and the task of the railway managers was to find the point at which the traffic would still be available while yielding the highest revenue to the company.</P>
    <P>Frequently in the past I discussed with transport managers here the possibility of framing charges on another system, on a cost plus system, on a differential system intended to encourage export trade in particular goods, and to discourage import trade of other goods, to facilitate the decentralisation of industry and so forth. Always I came up against practical difficulties which made the adoption of any other system of freight fixation impossible.  Once you examine the position logically you must find that that is inevitably so, because if every charge is based on what the traffic can bear, then any alteration must tend to involve a loss of revenue to the company. You cannot cut one charge to encourage some form of trade and hope to recover the lost revenue somewhere else if the charges elsewhere are fixed at the highest rate which the traffic could bear.  Therefore, we could take a chance so far as the railways are concerned in releasing the companies from official control in relation to maximum charges.  But still it seems to me that it would be desirable, so long as we give a legal monopoly, to have some authority with power to ensure that there was no discrimination <Col N="232" /> between one citizen and another; that whatever charge the railway company considered necessary or thought possible to maintain for the transport of a particular type of merchandise would be available under equal conditions to all using their services. Clearly the introduction of an element of discrimination would be regarded as publicly undesirable even though on many occasions in the past the railway operators here asked for a change in the law which would permit of that, not so much as it involved discrimination between one individual and another but in particular as it involved discrimination between one town and another, or one port and another, where they were losing trade to seaborne carriers, or in other special circumstances.</P>
    <P>In the case of road services, however, somewhat different principles apply.  If we take the course of compulsorily acquiring public road transport operators and handing them over to a nationalised transport operator, while prohibiting anyone else without a licence engaging in the haulage of goods for hire on the road, then I think we still have and cannot avoid responsibility for ensuring that there will be some body whose sole concern is with the public interest who will be empowered to regulate the rates charged, the conditions under which the transport is provided and other matters affecting the economy of transport, such as the classification of merchandise carried.</P>
    <P>The procedure under the 1944 Act, therefore, was as I described.  So far as the law was concerned a great number of statutory restrictions were removed and the company were virtually put into the position that they could charge what they liked, run what services they liked, alter charges and conditions as they liked, provided always that they got the Minister for Industry and Commerce to agree.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce exercised his function as custodian of the public interest vis-a-vis the Dáil. The Minister for Industry and Commerce as the public authority who sanctioned alteration in charges or methods of working was in the position  <Col N="233" /> that the Dáil could query his actions and could express approval or disapproval whenever individual Deputies had it brought to their attention that the operations of the transport company were having adverse economic effects on their constituencies. It was not a completely satisfactory system.  How satisfactorily it might have worked in what might be described as normal conditions we do not know.</P>
    <P>The 1944 Act was, as Deputies know, passed before the end of the war.  It was passed merely with the intention of creating an organisation which would have the task of transport reorganisation after the war, even though we recognised then that some years would elapse before it could function normally.  During the war the exercise of Ministerial control over services or charges was far more directly related to the day-to-day problems of supply rather than any consideration of transport policy.  Time and time again I had to give the House assurances that when rail services were curtailed, branch lines closed down, or public road transport operated in some new manner, it was the result of supply difficulties and not because of any attempt to prepare the ground in advance to implement a transport policy upon which the Dáil had not been consulted.  Because of the fact that the 1944 device has never been tried out in normal circumstances and because, on the face of it, it appears to be the best device to handle the problems which inevitably arise in the operation of transport services on a monopoly basis, I am in favour of retaining it.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister in his original proposal to leave the company free, not subject to him or any other authority, went too far in one direction. I think that in his amendments which involve the creation of a transport tribunal he is going too far in the other direction.  I do not know how he contemplates the tribunal will work. The old transport tribunal established under the 1924 Act was a most cumbersome instrument.  Granted that its functions were somewhat different and granted that it was charged under that <Col N="234" /> Act primarily with the duty of arranging a schedule of charges which would enable the Great Southern Railway Company to earn a standard revenue which it had itself determined in accordance with the provisions of the Act, nevertheless it is sufficiently similar to the tribunal which the Minister intends to propose here to enable us to come to some conclusions as to how the new tribunal will work by reviving our recollections of how the old tribunal worked.</P>
    <P>The new tribunal will exercise its functions with regard to the provisions of Section 14.  Section 14 of the Bill will be amended in a way which will give that tribunal the duty of having regard to other things than the financial result of its decisions.  It will be enabled to have regard to their effect upon national economic development and on the conditions of employment of the company's staffs.  I must confess that I am rather appalled at the prospect of anything like the old tribunal reappearing again.  When the Minister's amendments are submitted to the House, as presumably they will be, and when we have an opportunity of considering them as a whole in the framework of the Bill, I think we shall have to examine then the possibility of amending them in order to eliminate some of the abuses, at any rate, which arose in connection with the operations of the old tribunal.  The principal abuse in my view was the practice of having counsel employed whenever any proposal to modify the standard charges, or permit the establishment of special charges, or other alterations, was under consideration.  The railway company decided on the tactic of filling the courtroom of the tribunal with a number of high-powered barristers and everybody who was offering opposition to the proposal of the company was either foredoomed to failure or forced to incur the expenditure involved in employing a similar array of legal luminaries to offset the company's counsel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The net result was that people did not go to the tribunal, that, if anybody had objection to make to the charges of the company on the <Col N="235" /> ground that they were detrimental to business interests or that they worked contrary to economic development, or desired to get some special charge in the circumstances of those days below the standard charges in order to continue in business, that person came to the Department of Industry and Commerce and asked the Minister to argue his case with the company; and, in the course of time, that is what the Minister for Industry and Commerce did.</P>
      <P>Long before the tribunal was abolished the situation existed in which, in the great majority of cases, the representations of business interests were conveyed to the company and supported in argument with the company by the officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce and not in the way contemplated in 1924, before the tribunal.  Eventually, when the tribunal reported that there was no system of charges that it could devise which would enable the company to earn the standard revenue contemplated by the Act, it came to an end and its legal existence was terminated by legislation in 1933.  If there is going to be a new tribunal it has got to work informally.  If it is going to mean that the company will come before it, whenever it wants to close a station or a branch line or to increase its charges, with a great number of lawyers and that anybody who wants to oppose it will have to oppose it by employing lawyers to argue their case, then I think it will be a failure, and not merely a failure but it will do the one thing which, I think, it is important we should avoid&mdash;it will occasion unconscionable delays in bringing into effect changes which the company regard as not merely necessary but urgent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of restoring the procedure of the 1944 Act, which means that the board can effect these decisions subject to the sanction of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. That is, in effect, what this amendment means.  Its purpose is to incorporate in this Act the appropriate sections of the 1944 Act&mdash;the sections <Col N="236" /> which deal with railway charges and conditions of carriage by rail and those which deal with alterations in charges and conditions and with canal charges.</P>
      <P>I am not putting forward this suggestion because I was the author of the 1944 Act and have any sentimental regard for the provisions I devised then.  I had given a great deal of thought to the preparation of that legislation and I had, at least, the benefit of having introduced here at least four other Transport Bills in previous years, some of which temporarily benefited the transport operators or overcame temporarily some of their difficulties but none of which solved the transport problem. In the 1944 Act, which was introduced at a time when the problems were of a special and of an abnormal character&mdash;and looking far ahead towards circumstances which we could not entirely visualise&mdash;we had time to proceed with deliberation in the preparation of the measure.  These provisions of the 1944 Act represent the conclusions I arrived at after a great deal of consideration and consultation with officials of the Department and of the company and of others interested. Coming to consider them again in relation to the problem of 1950, and seeing the alternative proposals in the Bill, I still think my suggestions are the best method of handling this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary to give the company the power to alter charges or to curtail services or to amend its system of working as circumstances change but it is also necessary that that power should be subject to supervision and approval by a representative of the public interest.  I am convinced that, in the long run, there is no representative of the public interest who can work as expeditiously and as impartially as the individual holding, for the time being, the post of Minister for Industry and Commerce in the Government.  That Department has in it a great number of people who are thoroughly familiar with all these transport problems and who have accumulated a great deal of information relating to transport.  The Minister, therefore, can be confident of getting competent advice in the exercise of his function under the Act.  In any circumstances that it is possible <Col N="237" /> to conceive, I believe that will work more expeditiously both from the point of view of the Dáil and of the public and more expeditiously&mdash;which is important from the point of view of the company&mdash;than any form of tribunal which it is possible to devise.  Therefore, I would press on the Minister and on the Dáil the desirability of reconsidering again this part of the Bill and the desirability of deciding to adopt the provisions of the 1944 Act which have no relationship to the particular scheme of transport organisation contemplated by that Act and which are just as applicable to the nationalised undertaking to be operated by the board as to the other undertaking operated by the Córas Iompair Éireann company, and to decide that they are still the best that can be devised and to give them a further opportunity of showing their utility.</P>

      <P>I would be far more impressed by Deputy Lemass's activity in connection with this particular matter if I had found him on what I would regard to be the logical line in connection with this matter and to which he adverted on a number of occasions, that is, an endeavour on his part to restore the original intention as disclosed in the Bill when it was first published.  Deputy Lemass says there were a good many features of that proposal that appealed to him.  I would remind the House that in this particular amendment we are asked to perpetuate a state of affairs that may be regarded as having been responsible for the downfall of the railways, during the last quarter of a century, in this country.  When the Transport Bill was first published a number of members of the transport industry examined the Bill.  To my personal knowledge they were unanimously of the opinion that the outstanding feature in the Bill and the one calculated to make it a complete success was the provision being made by the Minister to permit the board to fix its own charges without reference to a tribunal.  What we are doing here in Deputy Lemass's amendment is a repeat of the powers that were conferred under the 1924 Railways Act.  That means that the board and all concerned will have to go through the same tortuous and irritating and <Col N="238" /> almost ineffective procedure in connection with that tribunal.  I could understand Deputy Lemass's proposals if we were dealing with a private company&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am coming back to the point that when this matter was under discussion on the last occasion the main divergence of opinion on the Bill on the Second Reading, and I think from the Opposition side of the House, was in respect of branch lines.  I have not read the speeches on the Committee Stage but my impression is that the main line of coercion on the Minister from all sections of the House was in respect of branch lines.  I am speaking subject to correction but I do not think any great stress was laid on the desirability of adverting to the tribunal so far as maximum charges or classification of merchandise are concerned.  I do not know why the Minister has gone whole hog, so to say, in reintroducing what is to our point of view here an objectionable course, namely, the setting up of this tribunal again for a purpose which we feel will undermine the activities and the operations of the new concern.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £375,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1950, for Agricultural Produce Subsidies, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact, Sir, this sum is required to complete the Charge that will come in course of payment in this financial year for subsidies on the production of dairy produce and an allowance for storage of butter for winter consumption.  It may appear remarkable that so large a sum should be sought by way of Supplementary Estimate in regard to this Vote and, indeed, it is, but our Estimate was framed on a reasonably optimistic forecast of what our best efforts, sustained, I must admit, by exceptionally clement weather, could achieve in the matter of butter production and of milk supply.  I am happy to report to the House that our most extreme optimism was far surpassed by our performances. The total intake of milk into the creameries of this country in 1947 was 154,000,000 gallons.  In 1948 it was 170,000,000 gallons, and in 1949 209,000,000 gallons.  It is relevant, I think, to mention for the information of the House that, without exception, since 1938 no production figure approaching that has been recorded, and it is also a matter of passing interest, at least, to record that the increase of 39,000,000 gallons between 1948 and 1949 is of an order unprecedented in the period over which our records extend. The highest milk deliveries to our creameries were recorded in 1934, when we had 210,000,000 gallons; in 1935, when we had 219,000,000 gallons; in 1936, when we had 236,000,000 gallons; <Col N="240" /> in 1937, when we had 210,000,000 gallons, and in 1938, when we had 212,000,000 gallons.  Then they began to decline and they continued to decline until 1947, when they turned up again.  In the years prior to that, the figure of 209,000,000 was never remotely approached.</P>
    <P>Although there is occasion for congratulation to the dairy farmers who succeeded in thus expanding their production, it is right to recall that on every hundredweight of butter now produced the State pays a subsidy of approximately £4.  It is a little less than £4.  Since I became responsible for this Department, I have collaborated to the limit of my capacity with the creamery societies to find alternative outlets for milk supplies which would permit of the product being sold on an economic market which would not involve the Exchequer in any charge at all.  These efforts have been attended with some measure of success and they are proceeding.</P>
    <P>It may occur to some Deputies that it is odd that there should continue to be rationing of butter in the presence of this great abundance.  I remember Deputy Dr. Ryan, last June or thereabouts, when it became possible to increase the butter ration to eight ounces, saying that he thought I had acted recklessly and precipitately, because I might find myself without any butter wherewith to supply the demand when November or December came.  I know that he has noted the falsification of his prognostications with satisfaction and admiration.  The ringing accents in which he has declared these sentiments cannot have failed to reach the ears of the most inattentive sections of our community.</P>
    <P>A very interesting fact appears to emerge from this increase in the butter ration.  When we increased the butter ration to eight ounces from six ounces, according to the known statistics then, at six ounces we were consuming 50,000 cwts. per month.  We assumed that when the butter ration was increased by 33? per cent., we must be prepared to make provision for a corresponding issue of butter and that the consumption of butter would rise from 50,000 cwts a month to something in the order of 66,000 cwts. a month but <Col N="241" /> that did not happen.  In fact, the issue of butter rose to about 60,000 cwts. and has never shown the slightest tendency to rise above it.  This would suggest that a total issue of butter measured by one ½lb. per head of the population is approximately saturation point for butter consumption, on the most favourable terms, because all that butter carries a subsidy of 7d. or 8d. a lb.</P>
    <P>Now, in that context, we must recall that, while much may be said for subsidising butter to the tune of £4 a cwt. for consumption by our own people, a very different aspect is assumed by the problem if our production reaches a point at which a substantial part of it must be exported.  I have no relish for the prospect of paying anybody outside our own country £4 per cwt. to eat our butter.  However, I suppose prudence suggests that we meet our problems when they cross our path and that we should not unduly anticipate difficulties which may never arise.  I hope things may turn out in such a way as to ensure that an ever-increasing production by our dairy farmers will never fall to be described as a &ldquo;difficulty&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have here a record of the efforts we have made to date to divert the use to which creameries put the milk supplied to them from butter production, once we had reached what appeared to be saturation point, to other milk products for which there was a ready export market at remunerative prices. In 1945, the total intake of milk was 178,000,000 gallons, of which 11.8 per cent. was used for the manufacture of commodities other than butter; in 1946, 165,000,000 gallons were received by the creameries, of which 13.5 per cent. was used for purposes other than butter production; in 1947, 154,000,000 gallons were received, of which 13.5 was used for purposes other than butter production; in 1948, 170,000,000 gallons were received, of which 14.1 per cent. was used for purposes other than butter production; in 1949, 209,000,000 gallons were received, of which 14.9 per cent. was used for purposes other than the production of butter.</P>
    <P>I respectfully request the House to do me the favour of passing this Estimate some time to-night, for this <Col N="242" /> reason.  The Estimates are so drawn that the Vote upon which provision for butter is made contains no other subhead and, therefore, the butter subsidy cannot be supplemented <i>ad interim</i> from savings on some other sub-head of the Vote.</P>
    <P>I have, in fact, asked the Dairy Disposals Board to get along without production allowance for six or seven weeks, so that I might use the available fund voted by the Dáil to keep the small co-operative creameries in funds, without imposing the strain upon them of a delay.  I acknowledge gratefully the assistance afforded by some of the larger co-operative creameries, who have gladly forgone the monthly payments in order to leave some money in the pool available for the small creameries who would find it an embarrassment.</P>
    <P>I doubt if I am in a position to maintain monthly payments to all the small creameries with regularity, unless this provision is made this week.  I do not want to press the Dáil unduly.  There will be no bankruptcies or collapses if the week has to elapse.  Most of them will tide over the problem.  However, if the convenience of the Dáil can be met by making this grant some time this evening, I think it would be appreciated by a number of small creameries who must make special arrangements to secure finance to bridge the gap for the fortnight or whatever period might eventuate if no money is available to maintain the regular production payments which they depend on receiving in accordance with a certain programme.</P>

      <P>As far as I am concerned, this Supplementary Estimate will not be delayed unduly.  I would like to say a few words on this matter of the figures which we have just heard from the Minister and to draw his attention to how misleading those figures can be &mdash;to his own knowledge.  I am sure.  I do not want in any way to take away from the fact that increased deliveries to creameries have taken place, but let us not fool ourselves by the figures which have just been quoted.  The Minister will agree, I think, that as far as milk production in the country is concerned, <Col N="243" /> about half of that milk production normally went to the creameries. The Minister himself has quoted figures here, showing milk deliveries to creameries in the years 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937 and, I think, as far as 1938, when a new situation immediately set in for the years that followed.</P>
      <P>There were scarcities of many commodities, scarcities of fats of one kind or another, and there was a severe system of butter rationing.  In many cases where farmers had long distances to send their milk to creameries, or had extensive routes to follow, it became profitable for them to convert the milk into butter at home.  That situation prevailed for the years 1938, 1939, 1940, 1941 and on to 1947.  It was only when the scheme for the subsidisation of farmers' butter was dropped by the Minister that farmers who had creameries within their reach had no alternative but to send their milk to the creameries.  In addition to that fact, the Minister was obliged to remove the restrictions on the haulage of milk imposed in the normal way by the Road Transport Act, 1934, and to permit milk to be conveyed very long distances indeed in a manner that was not possible at any previous time.</P>
      <P>I am only drawing attention to these facts which I am sure must be within the knowledge of the Minister.  Figures such as those to which we have listened are all right in themselves but do not present a true picture of the whole position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no objection to the passage of this Supplementary Estimate.  It raises no point, as far as I am aware, but I should say that in the war years, during my time, we too were considering the possibility of converting milk and diverting it into other channels for reasons not very different from the reasons the Minister, I am sure, now has in mind.  At that time, we were not as free as he, I am glad to say, finds himself, in that there was a butter shortage and we could not take advantage of the opportunities then presented to us to raise the percentage of milk diverted in that way.  At that time, one could not, from the point of <Col N="244" /> view of public policy, justify following that course as vigorously as that course should now be pursued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Every Deputy will welcome the evidence that there is an actual increase in the production of creamery butter and an apparent increase in the production of butter generally. I think the House would have welcomed figures from the Minister showing the extent to which the creamery areas have been enlarged and the extent to which new suppliers have been brought into the creameries. Such figures would show to what extent this increase in the volume of butter represents an actual increase in butter production and to what extent it may be offset by a reduction in the total output of farmers' butter.</P>
      <P>I am quite convinced, from my knowledge of my own and adjoining counties, that there must have been a falling off in the production of farmers' butter during the past year because, certainly, only a fool would produce farmers' butter at the prices that were being offered.  In a matter of this kind, it is very difficult to obtain a reliable figure.  Farmers' butter is produced on the farms.  Some of it is consumed on the farms.  Some of it is sold locally. There can hardly be any accurate record of the volume of production.  At any rate, it is logical to expect that there was a certain reduction last year. I know of farmers who specialised in the production of farmers' butter for sale who went out of that business during the past year and who, perhaps, found other lines of production more remunerative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure that it is a sound policy for the State to kill home production of farmers' butter.  That is what the present policy amounts to. The present policy of heavily subsidising creamery butter and depriving home-produced butter of any subsidy whatever, must inevitably have the effect of wiping out home production of butter for sale.  Possibly, the Minister may say that that is a good policy in the long run, that creamery butter is the superior product.  I do not agree with that.  I think home-produced farmers' butter is the superior product and if anything can be done to help <Col N="245" /> continued production of farmers' butter that policy should be adopted.  I make that case particularly in view of the extension of rural electrification. Rural electrification will take a considerable amount of the drudgery out of the production of farmers' butter.  It will enable separating and churning to be done by mechanical means and in that way will enable the farmer to produce on up-to-date lines.  Government policy seems to be definitely directed against that line of production. As far as I know, there is very little departmental instruction in home butter-making now.  The instructors in poultry-keeping and butter-making are confining their activities to poultry production.  That aspect of policy should be carefully considered.  We should aim at maximum output and at getting the product which is the best from all points of view.</P>
    <P>With regard to external markets, I am sure that creamery butter is the only butter that can be exported. There again I would like the Minister to say something as to the prospects of getting a remunerative price for exported butter and to indicate if there is any possibility of doing so.  We are all quite willing to join in drowning the British people with eggs but I do not think that we would like to be committed to choking them with cheap butter at the expense of the Irish taxpayer.</P>
    <P>It may be possible to find an external market for butter but I have very grave doubts.  Therefore, we all welcome any proposals which seek to promote the production of an alternative to butter for export purposes.  We hope&mdash;and I think we can depend upon it&mdash;that the Department are doing everything possible in that respect.  I have often wondered, however, if we are doing enough to promote the consumption of increased quantities of whole milk.  I feel that the Irish people as a nation do not consume anything like the quantity of raw milk that they ought to consume.  It would be to their benefit nutritionally and would raise the general standard of health and the general standard of living.  Milk is a very dear food at the present time but it is still cheaper than stout.  Some very intensive <Col N="246" /> effort should be made by the Department to popularise and extend the consumption of whole milk.  There is, of course, a certain amount of prejudice against milk consumption.  Many people claim that it is not wholesome in that it may not be free from bacteria and may not be perfectly clean.  That is a matter which can be rectified and, having been rectified, very intensive efforts should be made to extend and promote the consumption of milk.  That would, I think, relieve the position so far as an export surplus is concerned, a surplus for which there may not be a suitable and profitable market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>My main objection to this subsidy is that it is not sufficient to pay the difference in the costs of production of milk as between 1947-'48, when the Minister took over, and the present time.  The price of milk still remains at the old figure, despite enormously increased production costs.  Another objection is that the removal of the subsidy from home-made butter drove these unfortunate people, who were without any protection and who were entitled to the protection of this House at least, off the market altogether, and the fact that they have been discriminated against by receiving no subsidy for their butter while a subsidy is paid on creamery butter is, to my mind, very unjust, particularly when the steps which we were told would be taken by the Minister with regard to bringing branch creameries or travelling creameries to these people have not been taken.  I should like to know from the Minister how far he has gone in that respect.</P>
      <P>I have a very definite objection to paying a subsidy on butter exported from this country, while, at the same time, there is in operation here a rationing system to prevent our people from getting all the butter they require, and I should like to have a guarantee from the Minister that, before any butter is exported, carrying with it a subsidy from the taxpayers, the rationing of butter here will cease. Our people should be able to get all the butter they require before we start paying the taxpayers' money in order to give cheap butter to John Bull or anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="247" /> We have complete silence from the Deputies who were very vocal when in opposition on the question of the uneconomic price being paid for milk and we had an admission at the Fine Gael Árd-Fheis that the farmer's costs of production in respect of rates and labour have gone up.  If these costs have gone up, as we all know they have, surely that situation should be met by a corresponding increase in the price of milk.  As against that, we are told about the increased production, but, although we had an extraordinarily mild year and although we are two years after a scare period so far as feeding stuffs are concerned, the production of milk this year is not equal to the production in the last normal year, 1938, that is, taking into consideration the quantity of milk which at that period was being converted into home butter and is now being driven into the creameries by a very definite compulsion.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear something definite from the Minister on: (1) the fact that no allowance whatever is being made for any subsidy for home butter; (2) the fact that no allowance is made in this subsidy for paying an increased price to cover the increased costs of the production of milk; and (3) some guarantee that no butter will be exported until rationing has ceased here. I am not a believer in paying a subsidy from the Irish taxpayer to somebody else to eat our butter while anybody is prepared to eat it here.</P>

      <P>Go maith; táim sásta.  Níl ins an Meastachán Breise seo ach comhlíonadh geallúint a thug an tAire dhúinn anseo i mí <Col N="248" /> na Bealtaine seo caite.  Is maith an rud gur chuir sé an Meastachán os comhair na Dála mar mura ndhéanfadh sé amhlaidh, bheadh ar na feirmeoirí glacadh le hairgead níos lú ar a gcuid bainne, an bainne a chuireann siad go dtí na tithe uachtair. Ní chiallaíonn an Meastachán Breise seo go bhfuigheadh na feirmeoirí aon bhreis airgid, rud a thuig cuid mhaith acu a bheadh le fáil acu ón uair seo bliain ó shoin.  Ní chloisimíd aon rí-rá, aon chaint ná aon cipidiríl in aon chor anois ó na daoine a bhí ag caint go hárd-ghlórach nuair cuireadh an praghas bainne i bhfeidhm i dtosach na bliana 1948.  Dúrathas an uair sin nár leor é, go raibh sé suarach agus nár airgead ceart é ar an mbainne a bhí á chur go dtí na tithe uachtair, ach ní chloisimíd focal anois ó na daoine céanna a bhí ag labhairt agus ar béicigh an uair sin, agus níor tháinig aon árdú ón lá sin amach ar airgead an bhainne atá le fáil ag na feirmeoirí atá ag dul go dtí na tithe uachtair. An t-airgead atá le fáil acu sé rialtais Fianna Fáil a chur ar fáil dóibh é, agus ní bhfuaireadar pingin, leith-phinginn ná feoirling sa bhreis ó shoin.  Tháinig breis agus breis mhaith ar an méid bainne atá ag dul go dtí na tithe uachtair, le bliain anuas go mór-mhór. Tá níos mó ná cúis amháin leis sin, ach an rud is mó ba chúis leis, dar liomsa, aimsear an-bhreá na bliana seo caite.  Blian mhaith don bhainne ab ea í.  Tá sé sin fíor agus mara gcreideann an tAire é nó mara dtuigeann an tAire é, tuigeann na feirmeoirí é agus tuigeann siad go maith é.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bhí an tAire ag cainnt tráthnóna mar gheall ar abhair eile a d'fhéadfaí a dhéanamh as an mbainne a tugtar go dtí na tithe uachtair seachas an t-im.  Ba mhaith linn breis eolais d'fháil ar an taobh sin den scéal. Cad é an t-abhar eile agus cé mhéid bainne sa bhreis is dóigh leis is féidir a úsáid sa tslí sin?  Ba mhór an ní é dá bhféadfaí an bainne a húsáidtear faoi láthair le im a dhéanamh a úsáid feasta i slite eile má tá slite eile ar fáil agus dá mbeadh airgead chomh mhaith nó níos fearr le fáil ag na feirmeoirí.  Tá slí amháin ann, sé sin, dá ndéantaí iarracht ar an bpobal a mhealladh le níos mó bainne a ól <Col N="249" /> ná mar a hóltar faoi láthair.  Tháinig breis an-mhór le blianta anuas ar an méid bainne a hóltar sa tír seo ach dá mhéid an bhreis ní leor é fós. Is dócha go bhféadfaí an pobal a mhealladh chun níos mó bainne a ól agus ansin bheadh laghdú ar an méid bainne a cuirtear go dtí na tithe uachtair agus ar an méid ime a bheadh le spáráil.  Tá áiteacha ar fud na tíre, bailte beaga go mór-mhór, i láthair na huaire, a bhfuil bainne anghann; is deacair do na daoine bainne a fháil. Baineann sé sin le rialacha atá curtha i bhfeidhm ag an Aire Sláinte.  Is rialacha maithe iad ach níl na feirmeoirí sásta glacadh leo agus tá siad ag éirí as bainne a dhíol mar a bhíodh siad.  Ní rabhas anseo nuair a thosnaigh an tAire ag caint; chuir cuairteoir isteach orm ach bhí fonn orm bheith anseo.  Ba mhaith liom na figiúirí a fháil faoi an méid ime a rinneadh anuraidh agus ins na blianta roimhe sin ionas go bhféadfaimís na figiúirí a chur i gcomparáid.  Nuair atá an méid san ime ann cén fáth nach bhféadfaí deire a chur le ciondáil? Tá daoine ann atá sásta leis na hocht n-unsa atá le fáil, ach tá tuilleadh ann agus ba mhaith leo breis agus sílim nach bhfuil aon chúis mhaith, nuair atá an méid sin ime le sparáil, gan trial a bhaint as deire a chur le ciondáil agus leigint dár muintir fhéin é ithe i dtosach sul a gcuimhneoimís ar é a dhíol.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's modesty is proverbial in the country.  The Minister might have adverted to the fact that last year and the previous year a fairly substantial amount of non-creamery butter was exported.  The producers of non-creamery butter are citizens of the State who are trying to eke out an existence the same as any other group of farmers.  They are ordinary decent farmers who have no other means of processing their milk except by making it into farmers' butter.  The Minister deliberately refused to give them any assistance whatever during the past two years to market their butter and get an economic price for it.  I agree that if the consumers of butter in this country are to get it under the cost of production the Minister has no option but to provide a subsidy.  The subsidy is not to export butter because the farmers' butter which was exported received no subsidy and its producers were forced to export it at an uneconomic price and well the Minister knows it.  They had no option but to find a market abroad at an uneconomic price.  It had <Col N="251" /> to go without a subsidy and for that reason the Dáil should be slow to act unless the Minister gives them an undertaking in the present production year in the matter of farmers' butter. Farmers who are forced by circumstances over which they have no control to manufacture home-made butter should be given an economic price for their produce just as the manufacturers of creamery butter or those who are in a position to supply their milk to the creameries.  During his last year in office, the Minister's predecessor provided a subsidy out of State funds to enable the producers of home-made butter to get a reasonable and economic price for it.  The present Minister for Agriculture has consistently refused to aid that particular type of farmer in any way, while at the same time he is aiding&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are now almost on the eve of the summer production of home-made butter, and in all seriousness I would press on the Minister to reconsider his attitude in this matter.  I suggest to him that he should make provision in his Estimate for whatever type of organisation his Department can devise to meet the needs of those who are engaged in the production of home-made butter.  There is a considerable amount of butter being made in the homes of our farmers.  A market has to be found for quite an amount of it.  It should not be beyond the wit of man, the ingenuity of the Minister or the planning of his advisers, to find some way of giving an economic price, so as to meet the costs of production, to the people engaged in the production of home-made butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope we shall also be able to get from the Minister comparable figures <Col N="252" /> as to the number of gallons of milk that were received in the creameries in the year 1949 and the last normal year pre-war.  As we are now about to enter on the penitential season, I trust the Minister will examine his conscience carefully to see whether or not he has been just to all sections of the community.  I have no doubt that if he does he will see the light and provide some means of giving those in the production of home-made butter an economic price for it during the coming production year.</P>

      <P>Having listened to Deputy Allen, I want to say that I come from a county where it is nearly all farmers' butter we have.  Heretofore, it was supposed to be subsidised, but the farmers did not get the subsidy. If we brought 1 lb. of butter into Mullingar market and got 3/- for it we were summoned.  The Minister has taken off the subsidy.  We welcome that.  We do not want any subsidy for our butter.  We are quite satisfied as we are.  I am beginning to think that the southern and other dairy farmers are getting too much in the way of subsidies.</P>
      <P>I was speaking to a Limerick farmer in the Dublin market last week.  He told me that he has 20 cows, and that last year his receipts in respect of the milk of each cow were £51.  If we in the Midlands could get bullocks or calves that would pay us £21 for a season we would soon be millionaires. We are not subsidised, but we are subsidising other people.  If we have any butter to sell we can take it to Mullingar market and get a price for it.  No decent farmer will have much butter to sell.  He will eat it or else he will use the milk for feeding calves.  I say to those so-called farmers: &ldquo;Go and feed calves with the milk and have a good thriving industry&rdquo;.  We want no subsidy in the Midlands for our butter.  I have told you of the Limerick farmer who is getting £51 for the milk of each of his 20 cows.  He also told me he got £9 a head for dropped calves a week old.  We would have to feed a beast for three or four years before we would get £60 for it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Allen excites my admiration.  He has a brazenness of <Col N="253" /> face of Burmese brilliancy which I have never seen in any other living man. Deputy Allen and his friends in Wexford closed down a co-operative creamery that was catering for the dairy farmers in the southern half of County Wexford.  They did that with shameless irresponsibility, utterly indifferent to the interests of the small farmers in that area, who were informed one fine morning that the creamery society could make more money out of retail and wholesale distribution, and that they did not want to be bothered any more with farmers coming with cans of milk.  Now that is one of the wealthiest co-operative societies in Ireland.  It is controlled and directed by supporters of Deputy Allen and Deputy Dr. Ryan.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's herring is neither red nor blue, but it is very odoriferous.  Deputy Allen says ample provision should be made in this Vote to subsidise the sale of farmers' butter, because the farmers in the area with which he is acquainted are bereft of any other method of disposing their milk.  I say that he has a face of Burmese brass to mention that fact, inasmuch as his friends in County Wexford are responsible for leaving them without the means.  Now I am happy to tell him that his friends in County Wexford, having abdicated the obligations they undertook, fortunately it is within my power to come in and do for the people of South Wexford what Deputy Allen's friends are too proud to do.  A survey of County Wexford has been proceeding for the last few weeks with a view to establishing a system of co-operative creameries for the convenience of the dairy farmers of County Wexford who have been bereft of that convenience since Deputy Allen's friends closed down the co-operative creameries which used to function in that county.</P>

Does the Deputy remember the halcyon days of the Creamery Stabilisation Act when we provided whatever subsidy the British demanded to enable them to eat Irish butter at 8d. per lb. while our people were required to pay from 1/6 to 2/- in order to provide the subsidy wherewith to persuade the British to eat our butter for a third of the cost of production?</P>

      <P>Deputy Cogan is right about farmers' butter and my views upon it up to a point; I do not agree with him that farmers' butter is better than creamery butter, but I know it is just as good.  The fact, however, that a thing is intrinsically good does not make it marketable.  The quality of farmers' butter can be every bit as good as the best creamery butter, and there are hundreds of people in this country who prefer its flavour and are prepard to pay a premium over the creamery butter price to get well-made farmers' butter, but the bulk of the market does not share that view.  That is no reflection on farmers' butter.</P>
      <P>When I was a child the popular sweetmeats for children were striped rock and peggy's leg which are just as good to-day as they were 40 years ago. But, if you ask the average child of to-day to content himself with striped rock and peggy's leg he will tell you he wants jujubes and fruit capsules. There is no use adorning your window with striped rock and peggy's leg if the infant customers demand fruit capsules and jujubes because they will not attract anyone but the itinerant fly.  The striped rock and peggy's leg are every bit as good and perhaps better than the jujubes, but you cannot force people who are free to buy what they please to buy what you want to sell them and only fools try.  Far from encouraging countrywomen in this country to produce good farmers' butter, which, in the circumstances in which we are, is to scatter pearls before swine, I prefer to put within their reach facilities to convert their milk into creamery butter, which is not one bit better, but for which a relatively ready market can be found.  Is that a sound policy or is it not?  I think it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In opening, I gave figures for milk production and a very simple mathematical operation by Deputy Allen could have reduced that to butter.  But, being as I am a paid servant of the people, I recognise that, if a Deputy <Col N="257" /> is too lazy to do a modest sum, he has the right to command me to have it done on his behalf.  I am not sure of the year for which the Deputy desires to have the figures of butter production communicated to him.  In 1935-36 the production was 828,000 cwts.; 1937-38, 755,000 cwts.; 1940-41, 658,000 cwts.; 1944-45, 576,000 cwts.; 1947-48, 523,000 cwts.; and 1948-49, 581,000 cwts. For 1949-50, that is up to the 1st of next April, which is the milk year, we estimate that the total production will be 685,000 cwts.  If the comparison of January of this year with the January of 1949 is any guide&mdash;I am bound to warn the House that it is by no means a reliable guide&mdash;but if it should prove this year to be a true indicator of what we may expect in the year from April next, the production of butter could well be from 710,000 to 720,000 cwts. between 1st April, 1950, and 31st March, 1951.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ó Briain was scandalised about the short memory of those who made such a loud hullabaloo and kip-o'-the-reel when the Fianna Fáil Government announced the 1/2 price, and marvelled that they did not repeat their outcry now Deputy Ó Briain has overlooked a very relevant factor.  In 1947&mdash;I take the figures of an average creamery in the South of Ireland&mdash;the average milk yield of the cows supplying milk to that creamery, measured by the delivery of milk per cow, was 376 gallons; the average yield for 1948 was 443 gallons; the average yield for 1949 to date has been 505 gallons.  The cow that was earning £26 when Deputy Ó Briain was listening to the kip-o'-the-reel is earning £32 11s. 11d. now.  Is there not a strange connection between lime and phosphates and the yield of a cow?  Is it heretical to venture the opinion that some of these cows may have had their milk productivity in some measure influenced by the quality of the grass, or will lightning from heaven strike down the Minister for Agriculture when he dares to mention grass in these hallowed surroundings?</P>

      <P>The amnesia of Fianna Fáil Deputies fascinates me&mdash;the way they leap lightly over long periods of years.  Might I direct the attention of Deputy Ó Briain, absent though he is, to the fact that one of the reasons why farmers in Ireland are so much better off now than in 1947, and so much more content, is that in 1947 we grew a variety of grass in this country which was entitled, I think, to the description of a botanical monstrosity.  It was a variety of grass of which a cow could eat in abundance and die of starvation as she chewed the cud.  Scientists came from afar to see this extraordinary product. It is getting quite rare in the country now.  I thought of railing off a piece as a kind of memorial.  I would not let Fianna Fáil set their foot on it, but it would be sacred to their memory, year after year producing this green monstrosity.  They had a word for it in Irish, you know&mdash;they called it the féar gorta.  In those days I think it was believed that if you walked across it you died of the thirst.  However, this was the Féar Fianna Fáil; the more you ate of it the hungrier you got, and if you kept at it long enough you died of starvation.  Now, perhaps, Deputy Ó Briain understands the lack of kip-o'-the-reel to-day which entertained him so vastly in the days of the féar gorta of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People ought to drink more milk, says Deputy Ó Briain.  I agree with him.  I am just going to launch a &ldquo;drink more milk&rdquo; campaign.  Does Deputy Ó Briain not know why it was impossible to embark on a &ldquo;drink more milk&rdquo; campaign to date?  The fact is there was not any milk to drink.  The cows on the exiguous diet I have described were unable to supply the milk that people would drink without any exhortation at all.  Now I have to <Col N="259" /> inform the House that the milk supply in areas where liquid milk is for sale is beginning to present a problem, not one, very happily, beyond our power to master and turn to good purpose, because I hope to be able to increase the production of milk in urban centres by from 20 to 50 per cent. and that should go a long way to absorb the growing supply which is forthcoming from cows that have had their diet changed.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Ó Briain speaks of a real problem when he dwells on the fact that in some country towns, where there appears to be abundant milk for the creameries and even for direction to the adjoining cities, it is almost impossible to get supplies of liquid milk for sale.  I am afraid the fact is this, that the standards that the person who produces milk for human consumption is required to maintain in his byre are so high that many farmers feel that the cost of equipping themselves in order to maintain these standards makes it impossible to sell liquid milk at the controlled price that obtains in rural towns.  I know of no solution for that dilemma so long as price control of liquid milk is retained in rural towns.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to say that people living in rural towns should have made available to them liquid milk which is produced under any condition&mdash;I do not think any Deputy woud wish me to do that&mdash;yet it is not reasonable to insist on farmers selling milk when they have been required to incur capital cost which they are unable to recoup out of the retail selling price permitted to them.</P>
    <P>Just imagine Deputy Corry bawling like the Bull of Bashan with apprehension lest the export of butter to John Bull would be subsidised.  Does he think that we are all fools?  Does he think that we do not remember him roaring like the Bull of Bashan for an ever-increasing subsidy on our butter exports to John Bull 15 years ago?  The higher the subsidy the more sprightly he danced his jig.  Deputy Corry deludes himself that our people can be fooled eternally.  I think he received a lesson recently from the old hen.  If <Col N="260" /> he wants to take a whirl on the butter subsidy, he will simply succeed in making the people of Cork laugh even louder than they are laughing now.</P>
    <P>I am very much obliged to the Dáil for being good enough to facilitate the passage of this Estimate.  I assure Deputies that their forbearance in this matter will prove of great convenience to the smaller creameries which might otherwise experience unnecessary difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Morrissey) Daniel Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Morrissey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan was in possession but, since he is not present at the moment, I will take this opportunity of intervening.  I do not propose to accept this amendment. Deputy Lemass made many statements in the course of moving this amendment with which I find myself in entire agreement.  In so far as he made a case at all, I think he made a case for the provisions in the Bill as the Bill was originally introduced.  The purpose of this amendment is that the charges shall be fixed or determined by the company subject to the sanction of the Minister.  Deputy Lemass laid a good deal of emphasis on the fact that that was a provision in the 1944 Act and that it had worked satisfactorily. The situation when this Bill becomes law will be entirely different from the situation that has existed up to this. When there was a provision in which appeal lay, so to speak, to the Minister you were dealing then with a private company versus the railway users, the passengers and the community generally utilising transport facilities.  The Minister held the balance as between the company and those upon whom the increased charges were being made. The situation will, of course, be entirely different when the new national transport concern gets under way.  It will not then be a private company.  It will be a State company responsible to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  In effect, it <Col N="261" /> will be the Minister's own company. In my opinion that creates an entirely different situation from the situation contemplated under the Act of 1944 at a time when it was a purely private company.  I think it would be very undesirable that the Minister for Industry and Commerce could be approached by a company for which he himself is responsible and in whose earnings, charges and ability to operate in such manner as to earn sufficient to pay its working expenses he is primarily interested.</P>
      <P>I shall be quite frank and open in this matter.  I would prefer to have the Bill as originally introduced.  I am introducing the tribunal in response to appeals from both sides of the House and because of the fears expressed by members of all Parties that, if the company were given complete freedom to change their classification of goods in any way they desired, to increase their charges to any point they liked, and to close down any branch lines they liked at any time they liked, the company would thereby inflict undue burdens, grave hardship and injustice if there were no restrictions placed upon them or no right of appeal.</P>
      <P>As far as I could gather on the Second Stage, it was the wish of the House that there should be some form of appeal and some authority to whom such an appeal could be made.  In that eventuality, I would infinitely prefer a tribunal, or any form of appeal, other than the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  If the proposals contained in my amendments are accepted, the position will be that the company can increase its charges up to the maximum without going to the tribunal.  If any body affected wishes to appeal against that, then the tribunal is there.  If the company wishes to increase its charges over and above the authorised maximum, then it must go in the first instance to the tribunal; it must give public notice of its intention to do so and any aggrieved person, or body, will then have the right to go to the tribunal and the tribunal will determine the case on its merits and their decision will be final.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputy Lemass over-painted the picture when he was dealing with <Col N="262" /> the tribunal.  I think he exaggerated the delays and difficulties that might arise.  Undoubtedly there are always delays when questions like this have to be determined, just as there are delays in determining questions of law.  What the Deputy said with regard to the array of barristers and so on is, of course, happening every day in our courts.  My desire would be similar to his.  It would be my wish to simplify the machinery as much as possible and as far as practicable without impeding the usefulness of the tribunal and so to frame it as to ensure that there will be the minimum of delay and the minimum of expense in having a decision reached on the matter appealed.</P>
    <P>Frankly, the amendment does not appeal to me because I do not think the Minister is the person who should, so to speak, decide the matter.  That is what it amounts to, in effect.  I was not in love with that decision even under the 1944 Act when it was a private company.  It still less commends itself to me now that we are going to have a national company.  If there is to be an appeal board, an authority to whom an appeal will lie, we ought to ensure as far as we can that that will be not merely an impartial authority but an authority in whom the public and the company will have confidence so that they will come before it in the belief beforehand that they will get strict justice and an impartial decision.  I would say that a Minister, in spite of himself, when this new national transport company is formed, would almost certainly be blessed to some extent, no matter how small, in favour of giving the company what they require.  I think that that danger of bias would be much greater under the new set-up than has been the case up to the present.</P>
    <P>If the company are not going to be given the right to determine their own charges, their own classifications and where they will run services, then I think that we must provide a tribunal of the sort or the type I am proposing in the later amendments.  I do not wish to labour the matter any further than that but I certainly do not think the Deputy's proposal to revert to the position that obtained under the 1944 <Col N="263" /> Act would meet the situation in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the change in the constitution of the undertaking proposed in this Bill is of any importance in this connection at all and that it is far more a formal change than a real change.  In relation to the essential features of our transport problem or the position of the undertaking <i>vis-a-vis</i> the public and the Dáil, there is no change.  Córas Iompair Éireann at present is not a private company.  It is a company set up by statute, operating in accordance with that statute, limited and controlled in its capital expenditure by the Government and functioning under a chairman, appointed by the Government, who has certain unusual powers to ensure that the company conforms to Government policy.  Therefore, I think that argument of the Minister in favour of a different system from that provided in the 1944 Act is not very strong.</P>
      <P>However, as between the Bill as originally introduced and the Bill as it will emerge from Committee if the Minister's amendments were accepted, I would much prefer the original Bill.  If the Minister is interpreting the remarks I made upon the Second Reading of the Bill as arguments in favour of imposing greater restrictions upon the freedom of action of the undertaking in the matter of charges and services, I want to correct him.  I think it would have been more than reasonable to expect Deputies speaking from this side of the House to decline to accept the opportunity of contrasting the provisions of the Bill and the prospect they hold out of increased charges for transport, closed branch lines and reduced transport facilities with the various criticisms of the previous administration offered by Deputies now sitting opposite and the various promises which they made when seeking election to this House. However, we must not allow these political considerations to affect our judgment too far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that many Deputies on both sides of the House were perturbed <Col N="264" /> by the prospect that the financial difficulties of Córas Iompair Éireann undertaking would be resolved by a drastic cutting down of the railway services, by the closing of numerous branch lines, railway stations and so forth, and, when expressing their concern in that regard, they were to a far greater extent endeavouring to extract from the Minister a clear indication of the policy which he thought should be followed by the undertaking rather than arguing in favour of limiting the freedom of action of the board.</P>
    <P>There is, however, in the House a very strong feeling in favour of retaining to it some power of questioning and, if possible, influencing the policy of the company.  What we saw in the original Bill was that the Minister had removed himself from the picture, that the board he was setting up could alter charges or reduce services without reference to him and that if any Deputy was critical of these developments he could not raise them here and get the Minister to explain or defend them.  The Minister could&mdash;at least if he wished&mdash;have declined to answer questions or to deal with motions on the ground that under the legislation he had no official responsibility.  It would, I think, meet that particular objection to the original Bill if a simple section were inserted which, while retaining the freedom of action which the Minister proposed to give the undertaking, gave to the Minister power, if he thought fit to use it, to require the board to reverse some alteration in charges or to restore some curtailed service where, in his view, the action being taken was undesirable or where an opinion to that effect had been expressed by the Dáil.  The insertion of such a section in the Bill&mdash; even though the Minister never used his power under the section; even though he made it clear that it was not his policy to use his power but rather to let the company do what was necessary and desirable&mdash;would retain to Deputies the right to question the Minister and make these matters clearly open to discussion and decision here.</P>
    <P>I confess that a case could be made to show that the provisions of the 1944 <Col N="265" /> Act, were rather too elaborate.  When framing that Act we were abolishing a very large number of statutory provisions relating to the operation of transport companies and we may not have gone as far as could have been justified in releasing them from Ministerial supervision and regulation.  There are a number of sections dealing with the conditions of carriage of various classes of goods, the classifications of merchandise and alterations of the classifications as well as with the provision of services and the maintenance of maximum charges.  If these provisions could be simplified, while still leaving the ultimate power of sanction in the hands of the Minister, it would be an improvement.</P>
    <P>If the Minister does not wish to go so far, then I think he would be wise to consider adopting the alternative suggestion of taking a negative power, power to require the undoing of something that was done where, in his view, it was contrary to the public interest and where that view had been expressed in the Dáil and supported by a majority of the Deputies.  A simple device of that kind would retain the functions of the House in the administration of transport and would not necessarily involve any impediment to the freedom of action of the company and certainly would be far preferable to elaborate provisions for the establishment and functioning of a transport tribunal.  I hope the Minister will not proceed with the tribunal suggestion. I gather it has not received an enthusiastic welcome from anybody, but if it came to an issue where the alternative I had suggested was defeated, and I had to choose between the tribunal device and the Bill as originally introduced, I would choose the Bill as introduced.  I would not lose any opportunity of pointing out to Deputies the contrast between their performances and promises, but that would be Party politics, in which I do not often engage.</P>

      <P>There is, however, one matter to which it seems to me we must give some attention&mdash;that is, the right to fix maximum charges for transport <Col N="266" /> and to make it the law that the company must not exceed these charges. It never has been the difficulty that the company wanted to exceed the maximum charges.  In fact, the worst type of difficulty was that the company wanted to cut charges below the maxima prescribed in a manner which appeared to give preferential treatment to individual firms or to particular ports or towns or to certain sections of the community.  Under the 1944 Act, we contemplated a considerable simplification of the merchandise classifications and of the charges relating to them.  I think it is true to say that at one time the Great Southern Railways had something like 200,000 classifications of merchandise.  These classifications of merchandise and the special charges relating to them were regarded as so secret that not even a member of the board could, on his own initiative, have access to the records in order to ascertain the exact cost of transporting particular goods from one area to another in stated quantities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There were occasions when, in order to attract particular traffic, they agreed to charge the lowest rate they were permitted to charge and they gave further concessions in the form of passenger traffic to the directors of the firm concerned.  That was not done out of malice or out of any peculiar kink in their own minds.  They were in the situation where legislation compelled them to raise a certain revenue and where practical considerations forced them to cut the charges in order to get the traffic at all.  In an effort to compete with the growing volume of motor haulage, they were compelled to adopt extraordinary and unusual devices to get round the legal difficulties and to keep the charges low enough to attract traffic to their services.  Circumstances could well arise where the new board would find it necessary to cut rates in particular circumstances in order to hold business or to win back to the undertaking business which had been lost because the firm concerned had purchased their own lorries. While it is probably desirable to give them that power, it is clearly a power <Col N="267" /> which could be abused because two traders in the same class of goods could find themselves differently treated by the company, one being placed at a competitive disadvantage <i>vis-a-vis</i> the other by reason of his rival's greater influence with the officials of the company concerned with the fixation of these charges or the arrangement of special charges.  If a simplified system of charges were adopted that could not arise.  Under the 1944 Act, the number of classes was reduced to six and there was a fixed charge for each class.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The 200,000 may be an exaggeration.  There were not merely these numerous classes of merchandise but there were also these special charges which the company was permitted to make by the railway tribunal below the standard charges which the tribunal had fixed and the total of these possible variations of rates came to something like 200,000.  The classifications, as I say, were reduced to six and for a time the company was in the position that they could adhere to these classifications and anybody could send his goods at the charges quoted in the various classifications.</P>
      <P>That continued so long as there was a scarcity of transport but as soon as motor lorries began to appear on the road and traders began to engage in the transportation of their own goods to a greater extent, and the volume of traffic available to the company began to decrease, then the need to cut rates here and there in order to retain traffic arose again.  It will continue to arise in future so that the company will be forced more and more, in dealing with the special problem of the individual trader, into making a bargain with him in order to retain his business. They should have power to do that but there should be, in the hands of somebody else, authority and power to supervise the doing of it to prevent the possibility of anything like real abuses emerging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the main issue before us, the question of giving freedom of action to the <Col N="268" /> company, I am in favour of it but I think we should have some simple and easily operated system of supervision by an authority independent of the company.  I prefer that authority to be the Minister for Industry and Commerce because if he is responsible here, the individual Deputy faced with grievances amongst his constituents will not be debarred from raising them here and getting whatever satisfaction he can.  If, however, we are limited to a choice between giving the company complete freedom of action and the establishment of the tribunal which the Minister proposes.  I am for complete freedom of action.  I think that there is much more likelihood that the transport problem which will arise in the future will be resolved by giving freedom of action rather than by going in the opposite direction.  Circumstances could arise again when the transport monopoly will become more effective, when the company may be exploiting their monopoly position to the detriment of the public and in that case the matter will have to be reconsidered.  I still suggest, as the best of the three courses mentioned, the maintenance of power by the Minister to control the situation which automatically ensures the retention of the power of the Dáil. If that is out, then I prefer the Bill as originally introduced.  I ask the Minister to consider whether he should not now consider proceeding with the Bill as originally introduced, with some simple provision which would give him power to intervene, if circumstances should necessitate it, and which will also have the effect of enabling Deputies to voice the grievances of the constituents here and to get redress for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very involved and technical matter.  I have listened to the arguments by the Minister and by Deputy Lemass.  There is a substantial change, in the transport system that we will have if this Bill becomes law, from the transport position hitherto.  It is right to say that, looking back on the historical development of the railways, many statutory limitations were placed upon them and there were good and sound reasons why that should have been done at the time. <Col N="269" /> But this new transport undertaking, as visualised by this Bill, is a national concern for which the Government, the Minister and this House will have considerable and serious responsibilities. The Government will have the responsibility, the Minister will have the responsibility and this House will have the responsibility, for many years to come, of making available out of the revenue of the State moneys to keep this concern going.  I think that is a fair statement of the position.</P>
      <P>We all hope that the establishment of this new board will enable a more efficient transport service to be provided for the community.  We hope that the board will do everything possible to make the service pay and to provide up-to-date equipment, carriages, engines, railway lines and buses.  That is what we expect of them. Naturally, we must be prepared to face the fact that we will have to foot the bill, or a considerable portion of it, for a long time to come.  That being so, one would imagine that it would be vitally necessary to have the strictest control by the Minister, on behalf of the Government and representing Parliament, on that organisation from the point of view of finance.  This new board is charged with responsibilities in regard to the encouragement of national economic development and the maintenance of reasonable conditions of employment.  I take it that the encouragement of national economic development will necessitate the carriage or conveyance of goods at the most reasonable rate at which they can be carried economically.  That seems to me to suggest that the responsibilities will have to be properly placed and properly borne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we establish a tribunal such as is visualised in this amendment&mdash;a transport tribunal consisting of five persons, appointed by the Government, holding office for a period of five years each, with the duty of investigating this question of transport charges, and whose decision will be final, in accordance with this amendment&mdash;we are hamstringing the whole thing and we are placing a very serious obstacle in the way of the board and of the Minister. It is like spancelling or tethering <Col N="270" /> a racehorse and expecting him to win the race.</P>
    <P>I agree that this is a very serious matter and that it deserves further consideration.  The Minister should indicate that, in view of the opinions expressed in the House, this matter will be further considered by himself and by the Government.  Will this suggested tribunal be helpful in any way? I do not think it will.  If the procedure is followed which we expect before that tribunal, those five people, who may know nothing about transport&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister has a responsibility placed upon him and in coming to a decision he will have the benefit of advice from a number of people who are experts.  What will be required of the Minister then is to exercise a judicial function, not forgetting his own sound common sense. If we have, first or foremost, a board selected because of their ability to make a success of the undertaking, one of the big responsibilities of that board will be the question of charges.  They are in competition with other services. If we have this tribunal, that sits anywhere it likes in the city, five people, with the board represented before it by counsel, senior and junior, and with some other objectors similarly represented, the argument may last for weeks.  Eventually they may come to a decision which may be harmful to the board and which the Minister may know would be harmful to the board in its operation, but under this amendment the decision of the tribunal on any matter before it shall be final.  I think that is a situation which we should not permit to develop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some years, at least, there must be given to the board a certain freedom and, if they are the sensible expert people that we hope they will be, who will carry out their functions in accordance with the duties and responsibilities placed upon them under this Bill, we can be satisfied that they will do the right thing.  But, if the matter <Col N="271" /> of alteration of charges is put into the straitjacket of this new tribunal, we will be hampering and strangling the board from infancy.</P>
    <P>I take it that the Minister will accept that this is not a political matter in the sense of criticism of the Minister.  It is an endeavour to be helpful to the Minister. It is an endeavour to look into the future of a board that we hope will be successful and it is our duty as Deputies, at this stage, to try to give it a chance to be successful.  For these reasons I would ask the Minister, in view of what has been said, to indicate that he will reconsider this whole matter of the transport tribunal in relation to charges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Candidly, I must confess that I do not like the alteration proposed to be made in this vital section of this measure by the Minister. I would not object, under other circumstances, to the establishment of a tribunal of the kind now proposed by the Minister because, provided all sections of the community engaged in the transport industry were to be brought within the authority or under the power of this proposed tribunal, there would be nothing radically wrong in a proposal of that kind.  The tribunal would be standing as a body between the community interest and the company that might at some time propose to inflict excessive charges upon the users of the transport undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has definitely made up his mind to bring in further legislation at a later time dealing with the people now in the transport industry who are not covered by any of the terms of this measure. It is a queer state of affairs that we are to have a nationalised transport service, road and rail, brought under the powers of the tribunal now proposed by the Minister to fix rates and fares whereas their competitors, who are acting as pirates, without any proper or effective control, are to be left free from the authority of a rates tribunal of any kind.  We have less than 1,000 lorries operating under the control of Córas Iompair Éireann.  Their right to raise charges in future will be subject to the authority of this tribunal <Col N="272" /> whereas the 17,000 other lorries that are operating at their own sweet will can fix any charges that will enable them to capture the cream of the traffic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am arguing that the section of the Bill as it now stands is much preferable to the amendment proposed by the Minister.  We inserted last night&mdash;not with any enthusiastic support, from me at any rate&mdash;an amendment which was argued at considerable length.  I did not take part in the discussion.  Amendment No. 18 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To insert before sub-section (2) the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) It shall be the duty of the board so as to conduct its undertaking as to secure, as soon as may be, that, taking one year with another, the revenue of the board shall be not less than sufficient to meet the charges properly chargeable to revenue.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The contents of that new sub-section will have to be taken into consideration by the members of the new tribunal when they come to consider the objections that may be raised to the company at any time that they may propose to increase charges and the contents of that section, as I read it, with the limited knowledge of the working of the transport industry, may help to create a first-class row on the new Transport Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an advantage to listen to everybody with an open mind. It seems to me that Deputy Davin has thrown a grain of wisdom into the debate on this section.  The difficulty I find is that we still do not seem to have made up our minds as to what exactly we require of a national transport undertaking.  Are we in fact going to look for a transport undertaking which, in effect, will pay its way?  If we are, are we going to put it in a position to fix charges which will enable it to obtain traffic in competition with every other type of transport undertaking, regardless of the consequences to the community or to its employees or, alternatively, are we requiring this new Transport Board to provide a transport service for the community? There is a vital difference. It is because of the fact that we are discussing a machinery Bill, without having had any indication of the policy that will be operated through this machinery, that this type of difficulty arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am frankly, at the moment, quite confused as to what is the best type of machinery in relation to the fixation of charges.  It is quite clear that if we expect the transport undertaking to carry out its operations in conformity with the general policy of the amendment moved last night we must put it in a position to fix its charges in such a way as to enable it to take traffic from its competitors if they still exist.  From that point of view, the original drafting of the Bill is preferable either to the present amendment or to the alternative suggested in the Ministerial amendment in regard to the tribunal because, in effect, we are giving the new transport board complete freedom of competitive operation, but there may be consequences there that we have not yet foreseen.  They may be so competitive that they drive themselves out of business.  They may be so competitive that they drive half of their staff out of employment and <Col N="274" /> create such difficulties between their staff and the community generally as to make their efficient operation almost impossible.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if we take the view that the transport board is to provide a transport service, then there is a number of policy questions that we have not yet faced up to.  One of those is the relationship in future that we will allow to exist between this national transport service and competing services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter before the House is not the fixation of charges but who will fix the charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed, and that is the matter I should like to discuss&mdash;who will fix the charges.  The amendment says that the responsibility for the fixation of charges should be vested in the Minister, and clearly, in the fixation of these charges, the Minister must have regard to public policy, to public goodwill. We are still in the dark as to whether that is an obligation to be placed on the transport company&mdash; whether they are to have regard to the provision of transport services as service to the community or to the running of a highly competitive, profitable transport undertaking.  So long as we are in the dark, it seems to me that it is anybody's choice which method of fixing the charges is preferable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to expect the new board to provide transport services on the basis of the requirements of the community, it is clear that it would be best to have the ultimate responsibility vested in the Minister, as suggested by his amendment, because that clearly carries with it an implication of policy; but there still remains to be decided the question of future policy in regard to private hauliers and private transport. If that policy is decided on on the basis of granting a monopoly to the public transport system, clearly the operations of that monopoly must be subject to the control of the House, through the Minister.  It is equally clear that, granted such a monopoly, the Minister should have powers to correct its operations in such a way as is best suited, not merely to the needs <Col N="275" /> of the community but to the needs of special sections of the community or parts of the country in relation to overall general policy.</P>
    <P>I frankly at the moment cannot decide, in view of the complete absence of any indication of policy, which is the best type of machinery.  That is why I think it is to some extent regrettable that in regard to certain main lines of policy some decisions were not taken before we sat down to establish the machinery which will provide for the board to carry out a policy which we ourselves have not yet decided.  If it were merely a question of establishing a board to carry on the undertaking on an <i>interim</i> basis and to report later, we could possibly have left certain questions of policy to a later date; but here we are dealing with machinery which will vitally affect the operation of any policy which may subsequently be decided upon in relation to the main character of this undertaking, that is, whether it is to be a competitive undertaking paying its way, and, as it was put on an amendment we had last night, meeting its revenue charges one year with another, or whether it is to be a public service run under the direct control of the community through the House and at times possibly required to provide service which is not economic but which is good national policy from the point of view of the community's requirements.  We have already had questions raised as to whether it is expected that this undertaking will be able to pay its way and to what extent we shall have to provide subsidies in future.  All these questions revolve around the machinery for the fixation of charges and it would be helpful on this debate, although I do not think it is possible at the moment, if we got some indication of the type of policy which we expect to be carried out by this machinery.</P>

If he thinks, in view of that, that he would like to reconsider the position in that regard, I would not press the amendment, but if I am forced to choose, I will put the amendment to a division.  If, however, the Minister is likely to reconsider the position, in view of the fact that there is no enthusiasm for the transport tribunal idea, we might let the matter stand over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the Deputy is entitled to make that point and I might be entitled to wonder what has become of all the people on all sides of the House who were clamouring for a safeguard for the public.  Seriously, however, there is no doubt that on the Second Reading representations were made from every side of the House for some protection, as it was put, for the public against giving unlimited powers regarding charges, services, classifications and so on to the company.  These representations were not merely made to me here by Deputies of all Parties, but were conveyed to me from very responsible bodies and organisations outside and from some of the biggest users of the national transport system.  I must confess, as I do confess, that my view originally was that the company should be put, as some Deputy said, on at least a competitive basis in relation to the competition, it has to meet, but, rightly or wrongly, I was impressed by the representations made here from all sides and all Parties, and I was conscious of the fact that there was, outside, a fear on the part of people in the commercial world, people who are using the transport system, rail and road services, that their costs would be very considerably increased, and I felt that they should have some court to which they could appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to choose, apparently, between the tribunal and the amendment put forward by Deputy Lemass.  I have no difficulty whatever in making up my mind in that regard&mdash;I am in favour of the tribunal.  The Minister, in my opinion, should not be there at all.  The Minister, whoever he may be, may be influenced by considerations other than transport considerations and he may be influenced by considerations other <Col N="277" /> than economic considerations.  There is no doubt whatever that, if it comes to a decision as to whether a particular branch line is to be closed or to remain open, the Minister will be influenced, and almost coerced, by political pressure, apart from any other pressure, in arriving at his decision. Let us face the facts&mdash;that is so and I do not think anybody will deny it. Under the Bill as originally introduced, the company could close down a particular line, or cease to run services over a particular line, if they so decided, and there was no appeal. Under the tribunal they must go to the tribunal; they must publish notice of their intention to close that line or to cease running services on it.  Anybody concerned whose interests are affected by the company's intention can go before the tribunal.  The tribunal hears both sides and it must have advertence to the obligations which are laid on the company under Section 14 of the Bill which is before the House in arriving at their decision.  It seems to me that that is a much fairer, a much more equitable and a much better way of having a particular question decided on its merits than leaving it to be determined by a Minister who is bound to be open to influence and pressure to which a tribunal would not be open.</P>

      <P>I quite agree, not now.  Deputy Lemass's amendment is that the position which obtained under the 1944 Act should be retained or carried into this Bill, that is, that in respect of all those various matters such as charges, classifications, services, lines and so on the Minister should be the final authority.  I again make the point that whatever justification there was that the Minister should be, so to speak, the final court of appeal when it was a question of a private company versus the public, when it is the question of a national transport company for which the Minister himself is responsible as against the community or particular sections of the community, then I do not think the Minister is the person who should be there.  I doubt very much if Deputy Lemass himself is very much in love with this particular amendment or the particular machinery he is suggesting. I am asked to provide some sort of impartial and fair tribunal to stand, so to speak, between a State transport company and the users of it, the business community or the ordinary travelling community, and I am suggesting this tribunal.  Having regard to the fact that it is either the tribunal or Deputy Lemass's amendment I think on the merits alone there is a better case for the tribunal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be fair.  We are not to assume that because people are not voicing their fears this afternoon as they were on the Second Reading those fears have grown any less.  Simply, they have taken it, I dare say, as I had given an undertaking that there would be an appeal tribunal and provided for it in amendments, that there would be no necessity for them to go over the same ground again. I am not particularly influenced one way or the other except by the merits. It is not a question of avoiding responsibility, but I think that the Minister should not be brought back into the Bill in the same way as his functions were set out in the 1944 Act.  I would say to the House that it is better to have a tribunal in whom the ordinary public will have confidence and that tribunal in arriving at its decisions must advert to the responsibility placed on the company by this House as it is set out in this Bill.  If the tribunal is doing its duty and is competent to do it those decisions will be arrived at on their merits and having a full regard to the obligations we are placing on the company in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to clarify the matter.  The amendment I am proposing relates only to charges.  These sections of the 1944 Act which I proposed should be inserted into this Bill relate to the regulation of charges by rail, road or canal.  As far as the tribunal is concerned, I have no very strong objection to the tribunal idea where the closing of branch lines is concerned.  I expressed the view before that the closing of branch lines, where there is opposition to it, should follow some form of public inquiry into the justification of the action and the tribunal would serve as an inquiry in my view.  The objection which has been voiced by many Deputies and <Col N="280" /> which I hold to the tribunal is solely its function with regard to charges because it is a cumbersome machine with regard to charges.</P>
      <P>The alternatives are to give the company a free hand, to give the Minister power of sanction or to have a tribunal.  People who are familiar with the problem will agree that the tribunal idea is the worst.  If the Minister will not bring himself back into the picture either in the positive way by requiring his sanction or in the negative way by requiring the undoing of something to which the Dáil objects, we would prefer to fall back on the original proposal to give the company a free hand.  I should like to give the Minister one bit of advice. Whether a branch line is closed as a result of an inquiry or not he will not escape the consequences.  He will not as I did not.</P>

      <P>I do not suppose that that would worry the Deputy and it would not worry me either.  There is this to be said for it: it would be closed after the people concerned, the company and the local interests, had an opportunity of a full hearing in public.</P>

      <P>What we are worried about is the danger of their being closed whether we like it or not.  The Deputy's latest suggestion is that we should have the Minister plus the tribunal.  Whether in regard to branch lines or charges, I think the tribunal <Col N="281" /> is the fairer way.  It will meet more with the goodwill and confidence of the public.

Would it not be possible for the concern to go into bankruptcy in that period?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as amendment No. 26 is concerned, I will be satisfied if the explanation of the position in future is as I anticipate.  As the Bill was introduced, the company could fix any fares or charges they like and require nobody's sanction for any alteration of them.  I was proposing that the existing schedule of maximum charges should be the actual charges of the company, unless and until they are changed with the Minister's sanction. As I understand the Minister's amendment No. 80, that will be the position, that the existing maximum charges will remain the maximum charges until altered with the consent of the tribunal.  In that case there is no use in going on with the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As to amendment No. 28, if I read rightly amendments Nos. 79 and 80, the tribunal which the Minister proposes to establish will have to be consulted by the board before maximum charges are altered and can only alter maximum charges if the board agrees.  The tribunal, however, will have nothing to do with the classification of merchandise and it seems to me that that stultifies the whole proposal, because maximum charges are of no significance unless they are related to the merchandise classification. If we assume that there are half a dozen classifications and a separate charge for each, the company could, of course, avoid or evade the maximum charges by altering the classification of particular classes of goods.  If it is intended that the maximum charges to be fixed with the approval of the tribunal under amendment No. 79 are to be related to the classification fixed by the company under a previous amendment, then that point is met.  But, if it is to be the position that the company cannot alter its charges except with the consent of the tribunal but can alter its classification at any time without consultation with the tribunal, then it seems to me that the whole tribunal idea is of no value whatever.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 31:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 18 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>18.  (1) The Minister may, whenever and as often as he thinks fit, by Order, made on his own initiative or on the application of any person representative of trade or a locality, require the board to establish and maintain such services for the conveyance of traffic by rail, road or water as he thinks fit and to make such increase, variation or alteration of existing services as he thinks fit and may attach conditions as to frequency and routes of services, facilities to be provided and other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="286" /> (2) The Minister may at any time by Order revoke or amend any Order made under this section.</P>
    <P>(3) The obligations imposed on the board by any Order under this section shall be in addition to any statutory obligation imposed on the board as regards the provision of facilities for the receiving, forwarding and delivering of traffic.</P>
    <P>This is a different point.  One of the matters which we considered when framing the 1944 Act was the need to give to the Minister power to require the company to provide a transport service in any locality where the Minister considered it was needed.  Up to the present we have been discussing th restrictions we should put on the power of the company to curtail or withdraw services.  I want to direct attention to the need to have in the Minister, or some other authority, power to require the company to provide services.</P>
    <P>A fear has been expressed that in outlying parts of the country where the need for a transport service is considerable, but where a service would not be economic, the tendency of the company or the board might be to withdraw or unreasonably curtail the facilities offered.  Under the 1944 Act, representatives of a particular locality or any business interests in that locality could come to the Minister with the complaint that a reasonable service was not provided and the Minister had power to require the company to provide a service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>You do not; you merely define their duties.  There is no obligation in the ordinary meaning of that <Col N="287" /> term.  Under Section 48 of the 1944 Act the Minister has power to require the company to establish or maintain services for the conveyance of traffic by rail, road or water or increase or alter existing services.  It seems to me that power has gone and nothing takes its place and that there is need to have something in substitution for it.  It is by far the most likely complaint a Deputy will receive, that the services provided by the company are insufficient, or that some village or area is not provided with freight or passenger services at all.  If a Deputy gets that complaint and brings it to the Dáil the Minister will be in the position that, even though he sympathises with the complaint, he can only make formal representations to the company; he will have no power to require the provision of services or investigate the need for such provision.  It seems to me he should hold this power, or alternatively give the tribunal the power, if it is to be brought into existence, to require an adequate service.  The safeguard against a monopoly of this kind is not merely the restrictive safeguard which the Minister proposes but also the positive safeguard of requiring the facility which the public is entitled to expect.</P>

      <P>(ii)  an Order has been made under Section &mdash; exempting the board from the obligation to operate a service of trains over a specified railway line or to restore any service of trains over a specified railway line which has been temporarily discontinued under the Emergency Powers (Córas Iompair Éireann) (Reduction of Railway Services) Order, 1944 (S.R. &amp; O., No. 354 of 1944), and the Order relates to all trains over that specified railway line and is not expressed to be in operation for a specified period,</P>

      <P>I take it this means that where the company has by ministerial Order under the 1933 Act been released from the statutory obligation to run train services over a line, or where an order is made by the transport tribunal exempting the company from the obligation to restore a service of trains on a line where the service was withdrawn under an Emergency Powers Order, then the company can abandon the line.  That seems to me to be logical and necessary.  If there are going to be no services on the line, there should be no obligation on the company to maintain them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide that where an arbitrator has power to award costs he shall have regard, amongst other matters, when awarding such costs, to any unconditional offer of compensation made by the board and not accepted by the other party.  In other words, if the company was willing in the first instance to <Col N="290" /> make a reasonable settlement they should not be penalised subsequently by having to pay heavy costs.  There is a similar section.  I think, in relation to the acquisition of land by such bodies as the Electricity Supply Board, Bord na Móna and the Tourist Board.

      <P>In sub-section (1), page 17, to delete paragraphs (a) and (b), lines 42 to 47.</P>
      <P>The proposal here is to delete the provision relating to the making of by-laws by the board for certain purposes; for example, for providing for the due management of the affairs of the board, and so on.  The Bill provides machinery for the confirmation by the Minister of by-laws made by the board.  This machinery has been extended by amendment No. 36 to provide for the prior publication of by-laws and for representations being made to the Minister. I feel that the matters referred to at paragraphs (a) and (b), which are related only to the internal affairs of the board, should be covered by regulations made by the board and should not be subject to confirmation by the Minister.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="291" /> This again deals with by-laws.  The amendment provides that the board may make by-laws concerning the custody and re-delivery or disposal of lost property.  I understand there is no statutory provision at present regarding the disposal of lost property found on premises, vessels or vehicles belonging to the board.  The Garda have power to make sales relating to unclaimed property found in public vehicles and so on.  This power is revoked by amendment No. 37 in relation to the board.  I should say that the Department of Justice and the Department of Local Government have been consulted in this matter and have agreed.</P>

    <P>(a)  the board shall, as soon as conveniently may be after the submission, publish a notice of the submission at least once in each of two successive weeks in each of the daily morning newspapers published in and circulating in the State;</P>
    <P>(b)  the notice shall include:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  a statement of the purposes for which the bye-laws are made, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  an intimation that a copy of the bye-laws is open for public inspection at the principal office in the State of the board, and</P>
    <P>(iii)  an intimation that any person may submit to the Minister objections to the confirmation of the bye-laws at any time during the period of 30 days commencing on the date of the first publication of the notice;</P>
    <P>(c)  the board shall, during the said period of 30 days, keep a copy of the bye-laws open for public inspection during ordinary office <Col N="292" /> hours at its principal office aforesaid;</P>
    <P>(d)  any person who objects to the confirmation of the bye-laws may, at any time during the said period of 30 days, submit his objections in writing to the Minister;</P>
    <P>(e)  the Minister shall, as he thinks proper, refuse to confirm the bye-laws or by Order confirm the bye-laws without modification or with such modifications as he thinks proper and inserts in the bye-laws, but, if he approves (with or without modification) of the bye-laws he shall not do so until the expiration of the said period of 30 days and until he has considered any objections to the confirmation submitted to him during that period.</P>
    <P>37.  To insert at the end of the section the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 40:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(6) Where it is anticipated that, by reason of an arrangement under sub-section (1) of this section, any officers or servants of the board or of the transferor may suffer loss of employment or worsening of their conditions of service, such arrangement shall provide for payment of compensation to such officers or servants in terms no less favourable than are contained in Sections 35 and 36 of this Act.</P>
      <P>Section 24 provides that the board may enter into an arrangement for the acquisition of any transport undertaking carrying on any transport wholly or partly within the State.  Sub-section (3) of that section provides that such arrangement may:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;adapt, modify or repeal any statutory provision, contract, deed or other instrument relating to any relevant part of the undertaking.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amongst other things, this would enable&mdash;and this is the point of the amendment&mdash;but would not make it obligatory that the sections dealing with the transfer of staff, payment of compensation for loss of employment worsening of conditions and so on, be adopted as part of the arrangement.  In the case of small undertakings such elaborate provisions might not be necessary. In the case of such portions of the Great Northern Railway, however, as lie within this State there is no reason why it should not be compulsory that upon such acquisition any arrangement entered into should be no less favourable than that contained in the sections of the Bill.  On the Second Reading the Minister indicated that in connection with developments that might take place in relation to the Great Northern Railway legislation would, in fact, be necessary.  In this connection I want to break one lance with the Minister.  I was disappointed yesterday with regard to another amendment when the House voiced its <Col N="294" /> perturbation on the subject of regulations made under a particular section. The Minister said, in explanation, that matters affecting the Great Northern Railway might be dealt with under the question of regulation.  That is my interpretation of the position at any rate. When I was dealing with the question of regulations, I understood that theses regulations would be laid on the Table of the House and would deal only with what is known as the day-to-day business. On the Second Reading the Minister did specifically refer to the Great Northern Railway and said that legislation would, in fact, be necessary.  In the meantime there are certain small undertakers who may be taken over and with regard to whom the provisions under sub-section (3) of this section are merely permissive.  They are not mandatory. By means of this amendment we want to ensure that any transfers operating in that particular way will bring with them for the staffs all the protective clauses contained in the Act itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is obvious that, if this Bill is to make provision for the acquisition of other undertakings by the new board, it is desirable that there should be some safeguard for the employees of any undertaking that may be acquired.  Deputy O'Sullivan suggests that the Bill should prescribe that the agreement for acquisition should provide for the payment of compensation to the employees who may lose their employment on terms not less favourable than those set out in the Act.  I prefer the other arrangement which the Bill itself contemplates in relation to the Grand Canal Company; that is, to make transfer of the employees to the board, which transfer would then entitle them to all the protection the Act affords them in regard to continuity of employment or compensation for loss of it.  I think it is obviously desirable the Bill should contain some such safeguard.</P>

We have, in fact, covered everybody, I think, as far as one can foresee every possible contingency in relation to employees. I would not be prepared to accept the amendment as it is but if the Deputy is satisfied I shall make absolutely certain.  I am prepared to have it looked into again.  However, I do not want that to be taken as an indication that I am accepting it exactly as it is here.

      <P>I move amendment No. 42:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), line 48, after the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;, to insert the words &ldquo;with the consent of the board and subject to any arrangement required by the board to ensure that the cost of discharging such functions will not impose any net loss on the board.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The amendment relates to Shannon navigation.  For some reason, the Minister is anxious to saddle his new undertaking with the Shannon navigation. I do not know if the operations of the Board of Works on the Brosna are going to mean that the managers of the Shannon navigation are going to have an easy time.  However, it is a fact that the transfer of the Shannon navigation to the board will involve the board in some loss of money.  I admit that it is not a very big undertaking and that the loss will not be very considerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I extracted from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance the information that, in last year, the gross revenue secured from the Shannon navigation by the Board of Works was £5,537 and that there were directly <Col N="297" /> employed in connection with the Shannon navigation 41 persons.  Making a brief calculation as to the wages paid to the persons directly employed in Shannon navigation I decided that the costs must have exceeded the revenue. Therefore, I felt that if we were to decide to transfer this enterprise to the new board without their consent we should accompany it by sufficient financial aid to offset the difference between the revenue and expenditure.  I admit that I tabled this amendment before I knew that the losses of the enterprise were going to be met by subsidy.  If they are going to be met by subsidy it does not matter whether the loss arises on the Shannon navigation or on any other part of the system.  Therefore, I shall not press that part of the amendment.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister thinks it desirable that he should seek the consent of the board to accepting Shannon navigation.  I do not know whether it would be willing to accept it.  It may be that the board may have good arguments against it if it merely means more trouble for them and less trouble to the Board of Works, and no great advantage to offset the trouble.  However, I shall not press the amendment if the Minister is keen on transferring this source of trouble to the board and he gives me an assurance that the losses will not be offset by earnings on the other part of the system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>They may convert the losses to a profit.  After all, the canal company are the main users&mdash; almost the sole users.  As the railway company will now become the canal company, so to speak, I think the obvious thing is to transfer it.</P>

      <P>There are Deputies in this House who probably know more than I do about this matter.  There are obligations on those who control Shannon navigation in relation to the control of flooding.  I met a deputation of farmers from that area before the Brosna scheme was started.  They were very apprehensive lest the drainage of the Brosna would complicate the problem of flooding on the Shannon. There was some doubt, too, as to who <Col N="298" /> was responsible for the operation of the sluice gates and the avoidance of flooding.</P>

      <P>This is an amendment which I put down before I knew that it was the policy of the Government to subsidise the company in order to meet any losses on working.  It seemed to me undesirable to limit the issue of new stock to the provision of money to meet the cost of work properly chargeable to capital. Under the 1944 Act, the corresponding section merely authorised the company to issue stock to raise money and stock could have been raised to meet losses. As, however, the losses of the company are now going to be met by subsidy, there is no need for any change.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="300" /> Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 26 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section itself, the main issue must be discussed. Sub-paragraph (b) of sub-section (2) provides that the total of the money which may be borrowed by the company under the sub-paragraphs which relate to the borrowing of money shall not exceed £7,000,000.  That limitation naturally suggests that we should ask the question whether £7,000,000 is a sufficient sum to make available to the company for capital purposes.  The Minister, when speaking on the Second Reading of the Bill, suggested that the figure of £7,000,000 was taken from the Milne Report.  Deputies will remember that Sir James Milne estimated the capital needs of the undertaking at £10,500,000 for five years.  He assumed that £3,500,000 would be available from depreciation funds and that the new capital needs of the company would therefore be £7,000,000.  He set out in his report various headings under which he considered it was desirable that capital expenditure should be undertaken. If it was considered essential that the capital needs of the undertaking should be limited to the £16,500,000 figure, then not much argument or not very strong argument could be advanced against the allocation of that sum to the various sub-heads which he indicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first question we have got to ask ourselves is: is that enough.?  The second question we have got to consider is whether it is practicable for the company to undertake heavier capital expenditure in five years.  It is true that the five year limitation does not appear in the Bill but in so far as the Bill related the figure in the Bill to the figure in the Milne Report, I assume it had a five year period in mind and contemplated that at the end of that period there would be fresh legislation to raise the amount, if the board required new capital for further development purposes.  Sir James Milne, it is true, contemplated that Córas Iompair Éireann undertaking would be able to pay its way and to meet its operation costs and provide for interest upon its <Col N="301" /> debenture stock.  He assumed that because of certain developments which he foresaw.  Unfortunately the indications of future trends which have become available since his report was published suggest that these developments are not likely to occur.  He anticipated a reduction in the cost of fuel and of materials, a reduction in labour costs, certain increases in traffic and other developments beneficial to the company which would tend to diminish the gap between its revenue and its expenditure. In regard to most of the matters to which he referred, it is now clear that in the immediate future his assumptions will not be realised.</P>
    <P>We know also that the organisational scheme provided for in this Bill is different from that which he contemplated and, because it is different it involves an increased charge on the undertaking for payment of interest amounting approximately to £90,000. The Minister obviously does not anticipate that it is likely that in this year, next year or in the immediate future the company will pay its way, and that is the problem with which we have got to deal.  Are we going to face an interminable prospect of a concern operated with the assistance of a Government subsidy or are we going to investigate the possibilities of so reorganising and equipping the concern that it can reduce its operating expenses and bring them within its likely revenue?</P>

      <Col N="302" /> I have always been of the opinion that the financial problem of the railway was due to the unsuitability of its equipment for economic operation. Every Deputy knows the history of our main railway undertaking.  The present company was brought into existence as a result of a whole series of amalgamations of small independent companies. The 1924 Act began the process of amalgamation. A number of separate railway companies were combined in the Great Southern Railways system.  They brought into that system varieties and types of railway equipment and of workshop equipment which made it very difficult for the new concern created by the 1924 Act to keep at a reasonable level the cost of maintaining and operating its rolling stock. Subsequently road transport concerns were also amalgamated with the Great Southern Railways Company and now the canal company is being brought in. This new board is starting off with an equipment which is very largely obsolete and which is so completely unstandardised that, I think I am correct in saying, there are over 500 types of railway engines in use.</P>
