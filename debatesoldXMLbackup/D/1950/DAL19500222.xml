      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if, having regard to the fact that numerous recipients of children's allowances have been deprived of their benefit through the operation of Section 18 of the Children's Allowances Act, 1944, he will introduce proposals for legislation to amend the section either by extending the period during which payment may be made or by authorising the issue of a duplicate voucher.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>My view in this matter is that children's allowances orders should be allowed to accumulate for longer than three months if the recipient so desires.  I am, however, bound by the statute and am not empowered to extend the period without amending legislation.  I have already had the matter noted for review at the first opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will state what the additional cost would be to abolish the old age pensions means test and increase old age pensions to 25/- weekly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the suggestions in the question were in operation in the current financial year, it is estimated that the additional cost would be £6,895,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he is aware that old age pensioners have been <Col N="450" /> expecting the abolition of the means test together with an increase in the pension to 25/- weekly; and whether he is prepared to introduce proposals for legislation to give effect to these expectations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a motion was introduced in this House in 1947 which sought a modification of the Means Test affecting old age pensions, etc., but was defeated in circumstances with which the Deputy is doubtless familiar&mdash;he having voted against the motion.  Since then&mdash;by means of the Social Welfare Act, 1948 &mdash;there has been a modification of the means test for old age, blind, and widows' and orphans' (non-contributory) pensions, and these pensions have also been increased.  During the coming year (1950-51) it is estimated that the average number of old age pensions payable weekly will be 162,000 as compared with an average of 147,500 in 1947.</P>
      <P>Apart from the foregoing improvements provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1948, at a cost of approximately £2,500,000 per annum, I would refer the Deputy to the Government's proposals for further improvements as set out in the White Paper on Social Security which has recently been issued.  Under these proposals, retirement pensions will be provided at 65 years of age for men and at 60 years of age for women who will be included in the proposed scheme, and no means test will be imposed in respect of such retirement pension or any other benefits provided under the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the Minister voted for the motion to which he has referred in his reply and, secondly, is it not a fact that the Leader of the Fine Gael Party has given a clear indication to the country that they are not disposed to accept the proposals in the Social Security White Paper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The outstanding fact in connection with this whole matter is that more has been done for old age pensioners in the last two years than was done since the first Old Age Pensions Act was introduced in 1908.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of an adjournment debate last year, I explained fully the difficulties presented by this project.  The Land Commission are faced with the problem of erecting a substantial tidal barrage on what I might describe as a mud flat.  If there were a rock foundation for the barrage there would be no problem, but, unfortunately, the site is composed of soft clay underlying a layer of sand.  The barrage would be subject to tidal action and the weight of the barrage itself would also exert considerable pressure, so a proper foundation would be a prime necessity.  Naturally, the Land Commission cannot be expected to embark on such a project until they are quite satisfied that it would be a complete success.</P>
      <P>I know the Deputy is anxious to see this work put in hands.  I am equally anxious about it, as I wish to ensure that no further damage will be caused to the land and buildings in the area.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state whether any recent experiments have been carried out with a view to ascertaining the most economic food ration for pigs, or if any investigation has been made into the costs of producing pigs; and, if so, with what result in each case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Cosgrave) (for the Minister for Agriculture)</NameTxt>
      <P>Many experiments have been carried out at the Department's farms and elsewhere throughout the country with a view to ascertaining the efficiency and relative nutritional value of various foods (including many home-grown commodities), the results of which have been published in the Department's official journal and in the leaflets.  The most economic ration for pigs (and this is the main factor in the cost of production) is, of course, dependent on the relative prices at which the constituents of the ration can be produced or purchased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect pig producers to get 190/- cwt. for pigs in the category mentioned, but the degree of certainty with which pig producers can anticipate this is largely dependent on discussions which I hope will take place with the British Ministry of Food in the early future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Feeders will pay whatever may be the world price for maize, a matter which will be profoundly affected by the appearance of the maize crop in Texas <Col N="455" /> next June and Illinois next September and in view of this incalculable element in the situation feeders are strongly urged to make their position secure by planting the maximum acreage possible of Ymer barley, potatoes and oats, a sufficiency of which would make us independent of maize or any other imported cereal food.</P>

    <P>(3) Inquiries made by my Department do not reveal that more satisfactory prices could be obtained on the Continent than in Great Britain, taking into account transport costs and difficulties and risks involved in the shipment of a perishable commodity.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the position is as stated in the first part of the Deputy's question, but this is surely a matter for the growers themselves to determine.  As I have explained on numerous occasions, my policy in the matter is to ensure that tomatoes are available to all sections of the community at reasonable prices; and, inasmuch as I do not subscribe to the view that Irish tomato <Col N="458" /> growers must be less competent than foreigners, I anticipate they will avail of the extensive and excellent domestic market on which to sell their wares.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that the reduction of the lime subsidy has resulted in a substantial increase in the price of lime to farmers in a number of counties and whether he will consider the matter in the light of the net price which farmers have now to pay for burned lime and for ground limestone in counties such as Wicklow which are far removed from the source of supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that it may not be possible for farmers in certain areas to procure burnt lime this season at a net price as low as that at which it could be obtained in 1949.</P>
      <P>The maximum subsidy under this year's lime subsidy scheme for burnt lime is 15/- per ton and the highest price at which a quotation will be accepted from a supplier is 60/- per ton.  The rate of subsidy in County Wicklow last year&mdash;I am afraid I should have got the statistics for Carlow&mdash;was 27/6 per ton and the quotations accepted for the supply of lime ranged from 40/- to 75/- per ton ex kiln.  The tenders accepted from the same suppliers under the current scheme vary from 40/- to 59/6 per ton so that the fixing of a maximum price in 1950 has had the effect of reducing the level of prices under which lime is supplied in the county in the current year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information which would enable me to state the quantity of phosphates purchased by farmers in 1949.  If the Deputy means the quantity made available for sale by home manufacturers and importers for the 1949 cropping season, it is, including phosphates used in compound fertilisers, approximately 258,000 tons. It is not possible at this stage to state what quantity of phosphates will be manufactured or imported for the 1950 season, but indications are that it will be greater than the 1949 figure.  If farmers could be persuaded to put out phosphates on grass now, it would greatly relieve the storage position and facilitate the provision of still larger quantities than can otherwise be made available.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware <Col N="464" /> that 250 tons of phosphates amount to approximately half a cwt. per acre on the agricultural land of this country and does he not think that half a cwt. per acre is an appallingly low amount of phosphates for this country, if we are to improve production?

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite mistaken.  The principal limitation on the user of phosphates at present is our inability, through lack of storage, to produce more phosphates, and we are producing and importing all that we can handle.  If the farmers could be persuaded to purchase and use phosphates in the winter and early spring, this would permit a 100 per cent. use of our storage, and consequently, a substantial addition to the total amount used, but the Deputy will be glad to hear that two new factories are in process of organisation and that I hope to see a third promoted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative.</P>
      <P>There is room both for the Shorthorn and the Aberdeen Angus breed in the area.  If the Shorthorn breed is not maintained, a shortage of milk will follow.  At the same time, the Aberdeen Angus is useful for the store trade.  My Department keeps both objectives in view.  In the past ten years it has located 75 Aberdeen Angus bulls, as well as 111 Shorthorn bulls on special terms in the area, and it will continue to locate reasonable numbers of Aberdeen Angus in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he is aware that three Gardaí in Clonmel have had their increments of salary stopped because of the fact that they had no court cases, and whether, in view of his reply to my question of the 1st December, 1949, he will take such steps as are necessary to have the increments restored to the Gardaí in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is in the negative.  As I informed the Deputy in reply to a question on 1st December last, it has never been the practice to judge a member's efficiency solely by the number of prosecutions for which he is responsible.</P>
      <P>I am informed that in 1947 the Commissioner decided to defer the grant of their final increments to three Guards in Clonmel because he did not consider that they had qualified for the increments under the Garda Síochána Pay Order.  The Order provides that the final increment on the Garda pay scale may be awarded at the discretion of the Commissioner only to members who have completed 25 years' service and have shown sustained zeal and efficiency in the performance of their duties.  The increments were awarded in 1948.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I right in taking it that the Commissioner's exercise of his discretion as to what is sustained zeal and efficiency is governed by the number of court cases brought by members of the Gardaí?  Might I ask the Minister further, arising out of his reply, is he aware, in respect of the Guard concerning whom my query of the 1st of December was addressed, if disciplinary action has been taken against him to the extent that because he had no court cases he has been shifted, and shifted to his disadvantage?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I said, in my reply, that the answer to the Deputy's question &ldquo;is in the negative&rdquo;.  If there is any particular case which the Deputy has in mind, and if he will let me know of it, I will be glad to have it examined.  I want to assure him that what he says is not correct.  Secondly, the Commissioner is the sole authority to decide efficiency.  That is laid down in the statute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that, whatever the theoretical regulations are, it has been the practice of the higher Garda officers to penalise Guards who have no prosecutions in the courts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations are not theoretical.  They are very positive. I am satisfied that what the Deputy says is not so, and that a Guard gets what he is entitled to under the regulations.  The Commissioner is the authority to decide that.</P>

      <P>I am informed that Bord na Móna do not propose to continue the production of turf in Meenleitrim Bog in 1950.  It has been found from experience in 1948 and in 1949 that, because of the relatively high altitude of the bog, production of turf there is not economic.  In regard to the unemployment aspect to which the Deputy refers, I may add that at the peak period last season employment was available for 30 men, but only 17 were procurable.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is to meet a point raised by Deputy Lemass on the Committee Stage and it confines the purposes of acquisition to land adjacent to an aerodrome or land on which the Minister proposes to establish an aerodrome and, I think, meets the objection made.  Under Section 41 of the Principal Act, the Minister is empowered compulsorily to acquire any land, and Section 36 of that Act defines the purposes for which the Minister may acquire the land.  The purposes set out in Section 36 relate to the necessary measures for the safety of aircraft using aerodromes and Section 6 (2) of this Bill is intended to make <Col N="486" /> clear that these purposes include and always included the establishment of an aerodrome.  As the section was originally drafted the Deputy feared that power was being taken to interfere with property distant from an aerodrome and which might not be required.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The point to which Deputy Lehane refers relates to a privately-owned aerodrome in Cork. Some time ago a project to establish a State-owned aerodrome in the vicinity of Cork City and the inauguration of regular air services from Cork across the Channel was considered.  There was, however, considerable difficulty in locating near the City of Cork a suitable site for an aerodrome, a site which had the necessary geographical facilities and which was free from meteorological objection.  In order to settle the question of a site, meteorological investigations, which it was estimated would take about three years, were inaugurated.  I would like to know if the Parliamentary Secretary can tell me from the information available now whether these meteorological investigations have revealed in the vicinity of Cork City any site suitable for an aerodrome from which regular passenger services might operate and if the idea of establishing a State aerodrome in Cork and the inauguration, through Aer Lingus, of services from Cork is being taken up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The position about the meteorological stations is that two stations were established, one in Midleton and another at Farmers' Cross. Neither of them, however, proved very suitable, but of the two the more suitable was the one at Midleton.  At the moment it is contemplated establishing a fully-manned station at Roche's Point to replace the existing station at Midleton and the matter to which Deputy Hickey referred is governed by that.</P>
      <P>The position with regard to Farmers' Cross aerodrome is that an application was made by a company to operate scheduled services from Cork to Cardiff.  The application was supported by the Cork Airways Company, which, I understand, runs the Cork airfield, and also by representations by Deputy Hickey and, I think, other Deputies. The application was refused on the grounds that the Anglo-Irish Air Agreement of 1946 did not contemplate that airlines other than Aer Lingus should operate scheduled services between the two countries.  Further correspondence took place between the Cork Airways Company and the Department, and the company was informed that in view of the international requirements governing meteorological protection and the fact that it was not possible to meet these requirements at the Cork airfield, together with the difficulties which I mentioned about the meteorological station at Ballygarvan or Midleton, it was impossible to provide the services necessary at the Cork airfield.  It has been decided now, after examination of both places, Midleton and Ballygarvan, to proceed with the proposal to establish a permanent station at Roche's Point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say in that connection that, as Deputy Lemass no doubt knows, it is very difficult to get sufficient personnel to man these stations or to get sufficient meteorologists in the country. In fact, in a number of instances, personnel from outside had to be recruited. <Col N="488" /> For these reasons it has not been found possible to assent to the application from the Cork Airways Company to run services from the aerodrome at Farmers' Cross.</P>

      <P>I mentioned on the Second Stage that there was a certain public uneasiness with regard to the possible use of our aerodromes by foreign powers in the event of war.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary should take an early opportunity of allaying any public uneasiness there may be in that respect and we would like an assurance that whatever development is necessary to establish our own air lines, none of the powers given by the Dáil will be utilised for the purpose of creating large aerodromes that might be used for purposes of war by foreign nations in the event of an emergency.  Further, in the event of such an emergency, we should like to feel that the full resources of the State will be utilised to protect these aerodromes against any possible invasion by a foreign air force.</P>
      <P>These are the only points I would like to mention.  I know they are creating some public uneasiness and I would very much like to have that uneasiness set at rest by a clear and positive declaration from the Government, through the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

      <P>I have heard the Parliamentary Secretary and Deputies on the opposite benches, when they were in the last Government, eulogising private enterprise.  We have an airfield in Cork which was prepared by private enterprise and I must say the encouragement given by this Government to that project is anything but satisfactory from a Corkman's point of view.  We have the station mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary at Midleton.  The air company there are <Col N="490" /> asking to have that station transferred to Farmers' Cross airfield, which is 572 feet higher than the station at Midleton.  I hope that in the near future the Government will show much more appreciation for those who have tried to provide an airfield for Cork and services across the Channel as well.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowan asked two questions and I will answer both. There is no intention of establishing any new aerodrome at the moment and it is unlikely in the foreseeable future.  In so far as the use of civil aerodromes for military purposes is concerned in the event of any war, as the Deputy is aware, the policy of this country in relation to an international conflict is a matter, under the Constitution, for the Dáil.  I cannot foretell what decision the Dáil will take in relation to any conflict that may arise, but whatever decision is taken, whatever Government will be responsible then will, I have no doubt, implement that decision.  In so far as the present use of aerodromes is concerned, they are used entirely for civil aviation.</P>

I assume that the insertion here of a section which is designed to provide for the preparation of new schemes is necessary because there are some classes of employees not yet covered.  If that is so, I should like to know what classes they are.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 74:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (4), line 13, after the word &ldquo;board&rdquo; to add the following words &ldquo;unless and until legislation is enacted by the Oireachtas imposing on the board and employees of the board the obligation to pay contributions under a compulsory State social security scheme.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to get some clarification of the Minister's intention and, if he can give it, of the Government's intention in regard to superannuation schemes administered by Córas Iompair Éireann, as they are by other industrial concerns, on a voluntary basis.  The White Paper on Social Security has been circulated and it provides for the granting to contributors under an insurance scheme to be established of pensions at 65 at certain prescribed rates.  The sub-section of the Bill makes it a legal obligation <Col N="492" /> on the company to maintain existing superannuation schemes.  Some of these existing schemes were, of course, not the consequence of legal enactments here but were introduced voluntarily by the old company and could have been modified or withdrawn by them if they thought fit, or if a State scheme was substituted which provided corresponding benefits.  In the future, however, in consequence of this sub-section, as I understand it, it will be a legal obligation on the new board to maintain existing schemes in operation. On the other hand, we know that the Government has in contemplation the implementation of the proposals in the White Paper on Social Security.  If the White Paper proposals are implemented, is it intended that they will run parallel with the existing superannuation schemes of Córas Iompair Éireann, or will the Minister then modify this particular proposal so as to permit of some change in the position so far as Córas Iompair Éireann is concerned; or is it intended that at that stage Córas Iompair Éireann will drop their existing superannuation scheme and allow the workers concerned to rely entirely upon the State scheme?</P>
    <P>The position, as I understand it at the moment, is that the regular wages staff of Córas Iompair Éireann become entitled to pensions at 65 in consequence of a contribution of 1/- per week.  There are various classes of pensions.  They can take a pension of 20/- per week for life; they can take a pension of 30/- per week between the ages of 65 and 70, dropping to 12/- per week at 70; or they can take a pension of 37/6 per week between 65 and 70, dropping to 6/- per week at 70.  These alternative proposals are, of course, a consequence of the means test under the present old age pensions scheme and are designed to enable the workers to get the benefit of a higher pension between 65 and 70, and then take advantage of the old age pension from 70 onwards.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme as proposed in the White Paper, which will be an insurance scheme, the pensions payable will not be subject to a means test and <Col N="493" /> would not, therefore, be reduced by reason of the fact that a worker was also in receipt of a pension under the Córas Iompair Éireann scheme.  But against the contribution of 1/- per week, which the worker is now paying, he will, under the White Paper proposals, pay 3/6, and it is clearly necessary to define what the position will be at that stage.  Will the worker be obliged to pay the contribution under the White Paper scheme and will he then be entitled to get the benefits under it?  Will he, at the same time, be obliged to make the 1/- per week contribution under the Córas Iompair Éireann scheme and will he be entitled to get the benefits under it also?  If it were intended that the worker should pay the two contributions and get the two pensions, some modification of the Córas Iompair Éireann scheme might be necessary because its present arrangement does take cognisance of the fact that old age pensions are payable at 70 subject to a means test.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the effect on the company's funds is also considerable because they are paying something in the region of £150,000 a year towards the cost of pensions at the present time; and, as I have calculated it, they will be obliged to pay in increased contributions under the social insurance scheme something akin to another £150,000.  I have not given any consideration to the determination of which is the best arrangement from the point of view of the workers.  Nor have I attempted to ascertain in any detailed way what they themselves would prefer, but it is clearly a question upon which the Government will have to make up its mind either in relation to transport legislation or in relation to the contemplated social welfare legislation. Of course, the problem that arises for Córas Iompair Éireann arises for every industrial concern which at present operates a pensions scheme for its workers.  When the social welfare proposals are implemented they will then have to decide whether or not they will abandon or modify their existing pensions arrangements, either because of the higher contributions which the employees will have to pay, or because of the cost to themselves of operating two schemes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="494" /> It is, therefore, a matter of some importance to get from the Minister an indication of the significance of this sub-section, because clearly it will be taken by other firms as an indication of what the Government intends.  If they intend that existing insurance schemes should continue and are to be supplemented by the State scheme then the workers concerned will have to reckon with the possibility of this higher contribution payable and the firms concerned on the possibility of higher costs.  If, on the other hand, it is intended that all these existing voluntary schemes should be absorbed into the State scheme then the position will be clarified but will obviously necessitate, at that stage, Córas Iompair Éireann getting released from the obligations proposed to be put on them under this sub-section.  I should be glad if the Minister would find it possible to explain what is intended in that memorandum.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, this sub-section merely confirms the existing position.  My line under it is that if and when, shall I say, the Social Security Bill is introduced into the House, if there is a necessity to make any amendment of this sub-section which may be necessary or which may be required, it can be, I think, more appropriately contained in the Social Security Bill itself rather than here now.  I do not think we can so provide now or that it would be proper for us to anticipate the legislation which is going to be introduced. The point made by the Deputy can and I assume will be covered by whatever amendment of this sub-section may be found to be necessary.  I think the Deputy will agree that that is sufficient.</P>

      <P>( ) Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing the board from amending an existing superannuation scheme in accordance with a power in that behalf contained therein.</P>
      <P>I have just been talking about the welfare schemes &mdash; maternity and medical benefit, and so forth.  As Deputy Lemass has just pointed out, they do not form part of the superannuation scheme.  The schemes are not statutory and include in their rules provision that they are subject to amendment.  While the statute for pension schemes can be amended by an amending Order under Section 41 of the Bill, the welfare part of these schemes would be made binding on the board by Section 42 (4) of this Bill. There is a doubt as to whether this may deprive the board of the power to amend them in the future.  This amendment is to provide that the power, if any, to amend such schemes will not be affected by the passing of this Bill. I think it will be appreciated that that is necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We had some discussion during the earlier stages of this Bill concerning the obligations of the company under existing superannuation schemes and the extent to which they have met or failed to meet <Col N="496" /> these obligations.  I am really setting out now to correct a false impression that was left on the public mind by reason of certain references in the speech made by the Minister for Finance on the Money Resolution of the Bill.  The House will remember that each year of its existence the company has appropriated certain sums for pensions purposes.  In the earlier years&mdash;1945, 1946 and I think 1947&mdash;the amounts so appropriated were paid but in the subsequent years, in which the company suffered a loss, the appropriations became part of the loss and, in fact, money was not transferred from the company to the pensions fund trustees.  The references which were made to that situation were, to some extent, misleading and unfair to the directors of the company. The normal method by which the company would find funds to cover live obligations of that kind in a year when the revenue was insufficient for the purpose would be to borrow by the issue of debentures.  As I understand the situation, the company sought authority to issue debentures for the purpose but were refused by the Minister for Finance and the matter came before the board of the company in the middle of 1949.  The position arose at that stage where, according to information given to me by the directors of the company, they expressed their concern at the non-fulfilment of the obligation to transfer these funds to the pensions fund trustees.  The chairman of the company explained that the money was not available and authority to borrow the money by the issue of debentures was not forthcoming.  May I explain for the benefit of certain Deputies who, I think, were left under a misapprehension by the speeches already made, that the chairman to whom I am referring is the present chairman, Mr. Courtney, and that this matter did not develop during the period of office of the former chairman?</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, in the course of his speech on the Money Resolution on the 6th December, 1949&mdash; column 1911 of the Official Report of the Dáil Debates (No. 13, Volume 118) &mdash;said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;They (that is, the pensions fund trustees) approached Córas Iompair <Col N="497" /> Éireann, and then something took place which it is laughable to recite here.  If it had to be recited in a court of law it might have a much worse complexion.  Transport Subsidiary said to Córas Iompair Éireann: &lsquo;You owe us £142,000 that you should have paid us for the benefit of these trustee funds.&rsquo; Córas Iompair Éireann said: &lsquo;We will assume the figure is correct, but we have not the money.&rsquo;  Transport Subsidiary said: &lsquo;We will lend you the money,&rsquo; but they also said: &lsquo;We have not the money either.&rsquo;  Then an arrangement was made that Córas Iompair Éireann would notionally send Transport Subsidiary a cheque for £142,000, and that Transport Subsidiary would notionally send Córas Iompair Éireann a cheque for £142,000, but not 1/-passed. That is the situation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Apart from any impression that may have been left that this device of exchanging cheques with the pensions fund trustees&mdash;which had the effect of transferring the obligation of the company from an undischarged financial commitment to a permanent debt to the pensions fund trustees&mdash;was done on the responsibility of the former chairman, Mr. Reynolds, certainly the impression was left that it was a device of the existing stockholders' directors.  I was approached, after that statement was made, by one of the stockholders' directors, who explained to me that, in fact, it was a device suggested by the present chairman, Mr. Courtney, and adopted by the board on his recommendation and that the minute authorising the transfer of funds was signed by him.</P>
    <P>He explained to me that they had not suggested to Mr. Courtney that there was any obligation on him to publish a statement to correct any false impression that had been created, because they thought it might be embarrassing for him in present circumstances, but I think it is only fair that the records of the Dáil should state the facts.  The device to exchange cheques could be made to look ludicrous but, in fact, it does not represent anything other than a borrowing <Col N="498" /> by the company from the pension fund trustees of the amount of money required by them to meet a specific obligation.  It was always contemplated that the pension fund trustees should preferably invest their funds in Córas Iompair Éireann stock. It is by no means an unusual situation that pension fund trustees should lend money of which they are the trustees to the company for whose employees these moneys are held.  That is the situation as far as the Electricity Supply Board is concerned.  The moneys of the Electricity Supply Board Pension Fund are invested in the Electricity Supply Board.</P>

It probably would have been better if they got authority from the Minister for Finance to issue debenture stock in order to raise the money and to pay cash to the pension fund trustees.  My main concern is to remove any idea from the minds of the members of the Dáil that the method adopted was devised by the former chairman, or was a special device discovered by the stockholders' directors.  In fact, the minute authorising the issue of this cheque was signed by the present chairman.</P>

      <P>In reply to the question asked by Deputy Davin, in the balance sheet for 1947 it was shown that there <Col N="499" /> had been accumulated in the insurance reserve fund a sum of £150,000. In 1947 a loss was made and although the company had shown in their profit and loss account the amount due in respect of their obligations to the superannuation schemes, in fact they had not got the money to pay.  That position continued in 1948 and 1949.  As I understand the position, some time early in 1949 the present chairman approached the Minister for Finance for authority to issue debenture stock to raise money to discharge that liability in cash and to rectify the position. He was refused that permission by the Minister for Finance and he reported that position to the board at the meeting of the board at which the matter was considered.  This arrangement for the borrowing of the money from the pensions fund was approved by the board and the authority to execute that agreement was issued by Mr. Courtney.  I think in all fairness, that the false impression that this device was either contemplated by Mr. Reynolds or suggested by the stockholders' directors, should be removed. It was a device suggested and implemented by the present chairman.</P>

      <P>I take it that the main purpose of the section is to continue certain statutory obligations imposed upon the new company in so far as they take over the undertakings of both the railway company and the canal company.  In respect of the canal, presumably one of these statutory obligations will be to maintain the canal waterways until such time as they are released from such obligations.  There is a matter I would take advantage of this to raise.  In connection with the canals, we have a somewhat different position from that of the railways, in so far as the canal waterways are used not only by the canal company for its own traffic, but also by privately owned boats, some directly by their own owners and others under contract for the canal company.  If it did happen that the canal were closed, that would affect their position.  There is the curious position that, while we have made arrangements in respect of direct employees of the canal company, we <Col N="501" /> have taken no responsibility for the employees on these privately owned boats now working under contract.  I wonder if the Minister would look into the matter between now and the Report Stage.  I know there are difficulties, but it is a problem which is going to affect their livelihood.</P>

Deputies will notice that the series of amendments there running from No. 77 up to and including No. 84 deals with the tribunal and the application of charges.  They are to a large extent in lieu of Sections 17 and 18 of the Bill as originally introduced, sections which I did not move.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is an attempt on my part to meet the point made by Deputy Lemass and other Deputies earlier on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposition before us here is one that I think should not be accepted by the Dáil.  When the Minister produced this Bill here in its original form and spoke in favour of giving the company unrestricted power to alter its rates of charges or the frequency of its services without reference to any other authority, I criticised it and suggested that there was a danger to the public interest in the granting of unrestricted power as proposed.  That point of view was supported, I think, by Deputies on both sides of the House, although it is true to say that in the subsequent discussion <Col N="504" /> more was said about the possibility of the board using its new freedom to close branch lines and railway stations than about the varying of fares and charges unduly to the public detriment.</P>
      <P>So far as I am concerned, I have not anything like the same objection to the establishment of this tribunal with functions in relation to the withdrawal of services, the closing of branch lines or stations, that I have to this tribunal with functions in relation to fares and charges.  I think it is desirable that we should have some authority whose approval the board must get before they close branch lines, close the canal, or seriously diminish by any means the transport facilities available to the public.  I would have preferred that the supervising and controlling authority should be the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I have explained the reasons for that already.  The Minister is responsible to the House if he has got functions in relation to these matters and Deputies are entitled then to question him concerning the use of his functions.  They are entitled to submit motions calling upon him to exercise those functions in accordance with their view as to what the proper transport policy should be.  The Minister, however, has adhered to his original decision to keep himself out of this machinery so far as it is possible for him to do so. Therefore, while conceding the necessity for some restriction upon the freedom of action given to the transport company, he has now proposed that the restriction should be exercisable through the transport tribunal, a transport tribunal the character of which is indicated in amendment No. 101.  It shall consist of a number of members, not less than three or more than five, appointed by the Government and holding office for such period as may be determined by the Government at the time of appointment and remunerated out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas on such terms as the Government shall decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, I think, an unduly elaborate type of organisation to set up for the purpose of supervising the use by the company of its power to alter transport <Col N="505" /> services.  First of all, it should be clear that the tribunal, if it is to be the supervising authority, should function only if there is in the mind of the Minister or the members of the tribunal <i>bona fide</i> objection to the proposed withdrawal of transport services. Branch lines have been closed here without serious objection from anyone.  In some cases there was serious objection which, however, disappeared when facts were made known to those expressing them.  In other cases serious differences of opinion emerged and were never really resolved, although ultimately a decision had to be taken.  There is no point in having a tribunal to consider the desirability of closing a station or branch line or some part of a canal when everybody thinks it should be done and there is no local objection to it because of the adequacy of the alternative transport systems provided. Similarly, it should be understood that normally these matters would be considered informally.</P>
    <P>I remember many years ago the case arose of terminating a service of passenger trains on a small branch line in County Cork and, having intimated that I was going to concede the application of the company in the matter, I was asked to meet a deputation of the traders of the town.  The traders of the town came to object to the withdrawal of passenger services on this line.  The statistics of the company showed that one passenger per week travelled.  It was the same person who travelled every week.  Over a number of years past, although the company had regularly attached the passenger coaches to their trains in accordance with their statutory obligations, only one person per week travelled.  As soon as the members of the deputation learned that fact, they, of course, quite reasonably, withdrew their objection, and for a long time that branch line was operated solely for freight service. I understand it was closed since that time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No; a smaller line.  If Deputies are trying to make the point that we should compel the public to travel by passenger train when they much prefer to travel by bus, I would not agree with it.  I certainly agree that we should not prejudice the maintenance of railway services, but to restrict what the public would regard as a more suitable service in order to compel them to use passenger trains would, I think, be unjustifiable.  However, that is not the point I am trying to make.  The point I am trying to make is that, if there is to be an inquiry into the curtailment of a service, it should be only where there is an arguable case on each side.  If, in fact, there is no objection to the withdrawal of the service or if the objection is withdrawn following informal discussion and communication of relevant facts, then there is no point in calling into action this transport tribunal of paid members and there is less point in keeping them in cold storage until that situation arises.</P>
      <P>However, if the Minister will not take on himself the function of determining when transport services should be curtailed or what constitutes adequate transport facilities and, if we have to have a tribunal, it is better than nothing.  It is better than leaving the company power to do it on their own without explanation to anyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My objection to the tribunal is mainly because it is also proposed to give it functions in relation to transport charges.  We have had experience of a transport tribunal of this character functioning in relation to transport charges.  It was a complete failure.  It aroused widespread irritation amongst business people who had to go before it to make their reasonable objections to the company's proposals because of the legal costs in which they were involved and, ultimately, it functioned <Col N="507" /> without hearing the views of the business community, who let their decisions go by default rather than undertake the protracted process of appearing before them and the cost of briefing counsel to represent them.</P>
    <P>It is true that at the time the original transport tribunal was functioning its main concern was to prevent the railway company from cutting fares rather than from increasing them unduly. It was charged with the statutory obligation of ensuring that the company earned a particular revenue and it had to devise a system of fares and charges which would enable it to earn that revenue.  It never did, in fact, earn the revenue and, as I have mentioned, ultimately, the tribunal formally reported that there was no system of fares or charges that they could devise which would enable the company to earn the standard revenue.</P>
    <P>That situation may appear to some Deputies to be different from the present situation but, when we analyse the present situation, it is not so very different.  It is true that during the war years and the period immediately after the war, when there was a scarcity of transport facilities, the maximum charges became operative. The company charged the rates they were permitted to charge under the legislation or under Ministerial Orders amending the legislation and were always able to make these maximum charges effective.  It is extremely doubtful whether they will be able to make these maximum charges effective in future.  In fact, the justification for giving them freedom from control in the matter of fixing charges and fares is to enable them to meet competition where it is developing on the roads by cutting charges and holding the traffic by quoting lower rates.  Is there any real danger, in present circumstances, that the company will, so far as freight traffic is concerned at any rate, be able to charge at an unduly high level?  Is it not obvious that their problem is to get traffic at the present charges and that any increase in these charges will lose traffic for them?  Our main concern must be to devise means by which they <Col N="508" /> can reduce their charges and increase the volume of traffic offering to them. On the other hand, we here as members of the Dáil representing the taxpayers have a new concern, to ensure that they do not unduly cut their charges, because now their losses will be met by subsidy and there must be an obligation upon somebody to ensure that they do not unduly increase these losses, and consequently the need for subsidy, by reducing the charges unnecessarily. The whole problem of transport management is to balance charges with traffic potentialities, but, with the new factors in this situation, that balance could be upset and is far more likely to be upset to the detriment of the taxpayer than to the detriment of the transport users.</P>
    <P>This tribunal which the Minister proposes to set up functions only in relation to proposals to alter maximum charges.  It will not have any functions like the old railway tribunal of preventing the company from cutting charges below standard, but if we are to have any investigation of how it frames its policy in that regard, our interest is much more likely to be in inducing them to keep up their charges, where it is practical to do it, rather than in preventing them from increasing charges unnecessarily to the detriment of those who have to use the railways for traffic purposes.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned here already that this problem of transport is one which has been examined on more than one occasion, that is, the basis upon which charges are determined.  The old transport rule was to fix the charges which the traffic could bear, and, as I told the Dáil, I, on a number of occasions, considered and discussed with transport executives whether some other basis of charging was not practicable and ultimately came to the conclusion that no other basis was practicable. The idea of quoting for specific traffic like the beet traffic on the basis of actual cost, plus a percentage of profit, was considered.  The idea of utilising the movement of traffic charges to influence economic development of a desirable kind was also considered, but it became clearer in the course of time <Col N="509" /> that any other basis of charging meant a loss of revenue, and loss of revenue was what our transport undertakings have never been able to afford.  One could contemplate the State coming in and insisting upon a particularly low freight charge for, say, turf, in order to reduce the price of turf in districts to which it has to be conveyed by rail, but if it does so, it must either make good the loss in revenue by subsidy or recognise that some other form of traffic will be meeting unnecessarily high charges in order to compensate the company.</P>
    <P>This board, so far as its railway undertaking is concerned, and to a large extent so far as its rail freight services are concerned, will always be in the position of seeking to charge what the traffic will bear, recognising that if they go beyond that, they will lose the traffic, and also that if they go below that, they are going to lose revenue unnecessarily, and it seems to me therefore that we do not have to be as concerned as these proposals of the Minister would suggest with the power of the company to vary its transport charges without supervision. The original Bill proposed to give them power to vary their charges without supervision and as between it and the proposals now before us, I think the original Bill was preferable.</P>
    <P>I do not know to what extent I may have influenced the views expressed in the Dáil on the Second Reading.  I feel that I was fully entitled as a member of a political Party to remind opponents of that Party that they had promised to reduce transport charges and to increase services and that if they failed to implement these promises they cannot expect to have them forgotten.</P>

      <P>I promised that after the war there would be a reorganisation of transport services.  Deputy Davin's recollection of the circumstances of 1944 is probably no vaguer than my own.

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would be well advised to read it.  If we are to accept it now that it is not possible to implement these rather foolish promises in relation to transport charges and services and if we are to deal with this matter in a serious practical way, we have to face up to the fact that it is unnecessary to establish elaborate safeguards around this organisation in relation to charges.  We can give it, with fairly easy consciences, freedom of action there, knowing that they cannot do much damage in the circumstances that exist and are likely to exist in the future either to economic development or to the general level of costs by their charging policy.  We do think that a tribunal or some other instrument of that kind should be there to deal with proposed curtailments of transport facilities.  Ordinarily, I think it would be preferable merely to give the Minister power to stop the company from doing something they proposed to do when serious objection to the proposal was voiced in the Dáil, with the approval of a majority on the initiative of the Deputies for the area concerned.  That negative power of stopping the company from doing something which, without objection, they could do would, I think, be sufficient protection, without putting upon them this proposed obligation to go on every occasion to this tribunal for sanction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not profess to be thoroughly familiar with the practice of transport companies in the matter of charges, but I certainly understand that the maximum charges which are now in force and which are likely to be prescribed by this tribunal will be charges for merchandise related to the classifications of merchandise in operation at the time.  If, for example, mill stuffs are in category 3 and the charge per ton per mile for the haulage of goods in category 3 is fixed at a certain rate, can the company escape the <Col N="511" /> obligation to carry mill stuffs at that charge by transferring them to category 2 or category 4?  It seems to me from the wording of the amendments proposed by the Minister that the tribunal will have no function in relation to the classification of merchandise.  The company will declare and determine its own classification and, with regard to that classification, the tribunal will agree to increase the maximum charges if the company applies to it and they agree that the application is sound; but, if having gone to the tribunal and having applied for an increase in the charge for classification 3, which is in force at any time, and being refused, can they, nevertheless, get the increased charge by transferring categories of goods from that classification to a higher one?  It seems to me that if the tribunal are to function effectively in relation to the control of the maximum charges of the company they must also be given power to concur in any alteration of the classification of merchandise which the company propose to bring into effect.  This new amendment, which has been circulated to-day, is certainly very complete in placing upon the company the obligation to make available to the public and put on display information concerning the classification of merchandise for rail and canal purposes, the charges in force and so forth.  But it does not appear to bring the tribunal into the alteration of charges at all.</P>
    <P>The other question which I want to raise relates to the operation of agreed charges.  Agreed charges result from arrangements made by the company with an individual trader to carry his goods to all parts of the country at a flat rate.  There are agreed charges in force, as far as I know, in relation to Guinness' stout and certain other commodities of that kind at present. In the past there was always a certain amount of reluctance to sanction the extension of the system of agreed charges because it was felt that they could be used to give some traders special advantages over others and, consequently, any proposals under the 1944 Act for agreed charges had to be <Col N="512" /> submitted to and approved of by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. That situation will not continue now. The company will be free to make agreed charges and if they are unobjectionable it is probably desirable that they should do so but it will not be in the Minister's or the tribunal's power to supervise such charges and to ensure that they are not being operated in a manner which is detrimental either to individual traders or to national policy in relation to the decentralisation of industry.  It is obviously desirable that the transport tribunal should not function in any way which would leave it open to a charge of prejudicing individual firms or the economic development of particular towns, especially of particular harbours.</P>
    <P>I understand that as the Bill stands individual traders alleging discrimination will still have the right of recourse to the courts for justice in that regard, but if we are going to have supervision over the company's charging policy by a tribunal then I think we should give that tribunal general power also to look after these matters and satisfy itself that the general policy of the company is sound and that there is no proper ground for any allegations that its charges are framed to confer undue benefit upon individuals or districts. Probably the Minister has that in mind in empowering himself to go to the tribunal at any time and ask them for a report on specific aspects of transport policy.  But if the tribunal is to function in relation to charges it is desirable that it should have a more general policy than is given to it here.  I think, however, that we should not have a tribunal in relation to charges at all. Any such extension of the tribunal's functions would only be a second-best course.  As far as I am concerned the best course would be to keep in the hands of the Minister for Industry and Commerce general power of approval. The second-best would be again to keep the Minister in the picture but to give him, not the positive obligation of approval of changes in charges, but the power to veto subsequently any course adopted by the company of which he disapproves or to which the Dáil has expressed objection.  If we cannot have <Col N="513" /> the one course or the other the third course in my view would be to go back to the Bill as originally introduced and leave the company free of all restraint whatever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>When the matters under discussion in this particular amendment were discussed previously in this House on previous amendments I had a good deal of sympathy with the point of view of those who threw up their hands in horror at the thought of a revival of the old railways tribunal. I can sympathise with Deputies' natural feeling of aversion to the recreation of a similar body.  On giving the matter more mature consideration, however, I think it right to say that there is no necessity that any new tribunal as envisaged in the new section which the Minister is inserting in the Bill should be characterised by the dilatoriness, the delays and the slowness which did to the business community in this country make the former railways tribunal a byword.  I have a difficulty in approaching many sections of the Bill and the amendments to many sections because all the time there is present to my mind the feeling that the framework of the Bill, while it is an improvement on the present situation, is not in my submission an ideal one.  There is a rather fundamental difference probably in point of view.  There would be more in common between the point of view of the Minister and of Deputy Lemass than there would be between my point of view and that of either of them.  In my view the correct way to have approached the Bill and consequently the correct way to have approached the matter sought to be dealt with by the amendment, disposing altogether of the necessity for a tribunal or anything else, would have been to treat the whole transport system of the country in the same way as the postal system of the country is treated, namely, to set up a separate Department of State for it and have direct control over it by a Minister. That to my mind was a simple way.  It would perhaps be to the minds of many Deputies too radical a solution, but to my mind it requires a radical solution of that nature to achieve radical changes and we do want to achieve radical <Col N="514" /> changes in our whole transport system. I say that merely as an indication of the difficulty I have in assessing the comparative steps of merit or demerit in the various alternatives that Deputy Lemass has suggested to what is in the amendment.  Were we approaching this Bill from that angle these difficulties would not arise.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass, dealing with the question of the tribunal, was prepared to concede that it might have some function in so far as the closing down or diminution of branch line services was concerned.  He thought that the question of charges should be removed completely from the jurisdiction of the tribunal.  On the question of the closing down of branch lines, I think it is important to have imported into this measure a court of appeal, and to that extent I think the tribunal can serve a useful function.  I would not at all subscribe to the view expressed by Deputy Lemass that no form of persuasion of the travelling or freight sending public is justified and that they must be left completely free to choose road or rail as they will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposition which I make to the Dáil is that it is essential, in a country situated as we are, to have a transport system which can be maintained even if only on skeleton lines in emergency periods.  If the wholesale closing down of branch lines had been allowed to proceed, we could be faced, in an emergency, with a complete cutting off of certain areas.  I ask Deputies to bear in mind the fact that it is possible to keep some kind of an emergency railway system going while we have turf in our bogs.  It is not necessary to tell me how unsatisfactory and how slow the service was or the difficulties under which it operated during the emergency. It was better than nothing, because if we had been completely dependent in some areas on road services, grievous hardship could have resulted for many members of the community and this country would have been forced into a state of economic and strategic dependence that would have ill-accorded with what was national policy at the time.  I think that, for these reasons, it is not open <Col N="515" /> to us to say that the persuasion of the public with regard to the use of the railway system as opposed to the road system would be wrong, unjustifiable or indefensible.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of charges, Deputy Lemass seemed to concern himself completely with freight charges.  While I think I made it clear to the House that the idea of the tribunal does not yet evoke any great enthusiasm from us, it probably is as well that the tribunal will have some function in supervising passenger charges, and in supervising freight charges in the case of concerns of national importance which it might be sought, as a matter of public policy, to assist.  From that point of view, I would not feel fully justified in withholding support from the amendment which the Minister has introduced.  The fundamental difference that there is, I think, between the viewpoint expressed by Deputy Lemass and the viewpoint held by some of us is that we regard it as essential that a railway system be maintained over as large an area as is possible, and that, if it is uneconomic so to maintain that railway system, and that it has to be subsidised, then subsidised it must be, but that the question of whether it can be made pay cannot be allowed to be the deciding factor.  It is nationally essential and, therefore, if we have got to pay for it, and if it is in normal times a little bit more expensive than other forms of transport, we can still justify it by reason of the fact that in an emergency we cannot do without it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Second Stage of the Bill I spoke at some length on the question of the tribunal.  In the time that has since elapsed I have seen no reasons advanced which would lead me to change the views which I then expressed.  In the absence of executive authority by a Minister, a tribunal, or some such system, is, of course, necessary.  It appears to me, however, that this will mean the establishment of another body of individuals who, by reason of their appointment and their services, will be entitled to reasonably large salaries. I should be glad if the Minister could <Col N="516" /> give us some idea of what the increased cost that this will entail is likely to be. There will also be, naturally, the cost of the administration of this particular office.  That will be an additional cost.</P>
      <P>Now, we were told some time ago that the expenditure in this State was excessive, and that it was vital and necessary to reduce it.  I personally have seen no activity in that direction. In fact, so far as one can see, the movement is in the direction which the proposed establishment of this tribunal will tend.  I certainly would much prefer to see the Minister retain his responsibility, so that when the question of the discontinuance of a branch line or the raising of fares or freight charges comes up, this House, which is the representative of the man in the street and can secure views more easily than any group of individuals who would be established as a tribunal, is the place where discussions on these subjects should be undertaken.</P>
      <P>The suggestion made by Deputy C. Lehane is not, to my mind, unreasonable. The only point about it is that I do not see how it could be brought about until such time as full nationalisation takes place.  Even then I do not think it would be necessary to establish a new Ministry, because there is a Ministry ideally suited for the handling of that particular aspect of national affairs.  I refer to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;a Department which would be particularly suited for the guidance of the transport of this nation if full nationalisation should ever be brought about.  I would be glad if the Minister could give the House some idea of the costs to which I have referred &mdash; the salaries of this proposed tribunal and the cost of administration.</P>

If I am wrong, the Minister can correct me, but I understand that this is only a first attempt to implement the Milne Report and that a further measure at a later stage is bound to come. <Col N="517" /> Whether that is the decision of the Government or not, I think it is bound to come.  Consequently, I would prefer that this tribunal, so far as it affects the question of rates and charges, would not be established until the whole transport industry of the country, road, rail and canal, is brought under some kind of Government control or supervision.  Deputy Lemass surprised me when he stated that, generally speaking, the branch railway lines which were closed down had been closed down without serious objection.  I beg most respectfully to differ with that statement.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister and Deputy Lemass to accept this point of view&mdash;that the uneconomic road freights charged by pirate services over a period of years have not conferred any advantage on the community.  Will anybody tell me, so far as the traders in my constituency are concerned, that any traders of the many hundreds who used the pirate road services as against the railway because they got cheaper freights for the carriage of essential commodities, have passed on to the community the benefits of these cut-throat rates?  If the cut-throat rates meant cheaper goods and services to the community, I would not be raising any opposition to the activities of these road services.  The trader in my area who gives his goods to the railway to be carried has been for a long time at a disadvantage in competing with his fellow-trader who gets the benefit of the cut-throat road freight charges which are not passed on to the community. Will anybody challenge that statement?  Therefore, from a community point of view, in regard to Córas Iompair Éireann road, rail and canal services and road services not controlled by this concern, we will have to face up almost immediately to the question of bringing all these transport <Col N="519" /> services under effective governmental supervision.  This tribunal, so far as it affects the control of freight charges, should not be insisted upon by the Minister until such time as the further legislation will be introduced and passed to implement in its entirety the Milne Report.</P>
      <P>This is before its time.  I agree with Deputy Con Lehane that there is a case for the effective control of passenger rates, both by road and rail, because in effect Córas Iompair Éireann has a monopoly of the passenger services of the State.  I would prefer the Bill as it stands.  I would not urge that upon the Minister if the new rates tribunal, now proposed in his amendment, was going to mean effective control over the pirate road services that are paralysing the railways and that have brought them into a state of bankruptcy.  When is that further piece of legislation going to come before the House?  If this matter was dealt with in a bold manner this Bill, which is supposed to mean the nationalisation of transport services, would bring those 17,000 lorries under effective control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>They cannot be dealt with under a Bill of this kind.  I do not care what rates tribunal you have under this Bill, whenever it comes into operation, it will not help to bring the railway company out of its present state of bankruptcy.  You will not have stability or fair competition in transport until everybody who has a licence to operate a transport service, whether it is Córas Iompair Éireann or somebody else, is brought under the same control.</P>

      <P>They are employing people under any conditions they like, whereas Córas Iompair Éireann, as <Col N="520" /> Deputy Lemass knows, is under very effective supervision and control so far as wages and the working conditions of the staff are concerned.  If we are to have competition, let us have fair competition and the Government are the only people who can ensure that. I would change my whole attitude on this matter if the road services that are now operating any way they like, capturing the cream of the traffic without control of their rates, were passing the benefit of the reduced rates to the community.  The trader who gets his freight carried by the railway, thus conferring a benefit on the railway company by giving it the carriage of that freight, is a patriotic citizen and a better type of trader than the trader who takes advantage of cut-throat rates and does not pass on the benefit to the people who purchase commodities in his shop.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I feel in regard to this discussion is this, that under what I might call the old system, when the railways had an absolute monopoly, because of the circumstances, in the carriage of goods, the community set up what it considered to be safeguards.  One of the safeguards they set up was this form of tribunal in relation to charges.  That principle was all very well when you were dealing with that type of monopoly. But Córas Iompair Éireann now has no monopoly.  This Bill even when it is completed will give Córas Iompair Éireann no monopoly.  We as taxpayers will contribute for quite a number of years a very substantial sum towards enabling Córas Iompair Éireann to balance its budget and to pay its way.  The Minister wishes, and we all wish, that the demands on the public purse by Córas Iompair Éireann will grow less from year to year until they disappear altogether.  But we are bound to give some liberty, some freedom, to the new board of Córas Iompair Eireann if we expect that new board to provide a satisfactory transport service with reasonable charges. We must give the new board freedom to fix its charges.  If we do not do that, if we superimpose on that board this tribunal that is mentioned here, set up by the Government with all the powers <Col N="521" /> and duties that are laid down in this Bill, then we are to some extent interfering with Córas Iompair Éireann in carrying out its functions.</P>
      <P>There is a further point.  While the community is subsidising Córas Iompair Éireann and while we as representatives of the people are called upon to vote very substantial sums to enable Córas Iompair Éireann to pay its way, to meet its obligations, then I feel that we must have some say in regard to charges.  That say will and should and ought to be exercised through the responsible member of the Government, the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>There seems to be in this Bill a tendency to transfer what I might term ministerial functions to somebody else and the establishment of this tribunal, in so far as it relates to charges, is undoubtedly a transference of functions that ought to be exercised on behalf of the community by the Minister for Industry and Comerce. By setting up this tribunal to deal with charges we are creating something that is cumbersome, something that will be difficult to operate, something that will be a bit of a nuisance and cause trouble to the board of Córas Iompair Éireann, something that may in the long run be of no benefit whatever to the people who will be utilising our transport service. Deputy Davin is quite right.  We are not nationalising transport by this measure.  We are merely reorganising Córas Iompair Éireann.  We are not doing anything to cope with the cut-throat competition to which Córas Iompair Éireann is subjected by these privately owned vehicles which are breaking the law day after day by carrying goods illegally.  Not only are they carrying goods but they are carrying passengers for reward too, and that is also illegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In those circumstances and since the Government refuses to face up to the complete nationalisation of transport, then we should be fair to the chairman and to the new board and we should not encumber him or them with all the ridiculous and unnecessary restrictions contained in these amendments in so far as they relate to charges.  One <Col N="522" /> amendment here proposes that the board shall keep for public inspection at the principal office copies of the rail way classification of merchandise, copies of the canal classification of merchandise, particulars of the charges for the time being made by the board in respect of the carriage of merchandise by rail and inland waterway, the schedules of the existing statutory maximum charges in respect of the carriage of merchandise by rail and inland waterway, and schedules of the maximum charges which the board is entitled to make in respect of the carriage of merchandise by rail and inland waterway.</P>
    <P>One would imagine that if Córas Iompair Éireann was well run, as we all hope it will be, they would naturally provide both their classifications and their schedules without our having to write it in specifically in an Act of Parliament.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The board shall keep for public inspection at each depôt owned by it at which merchandise is received for carriage by rail, a copy of each of the following&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the railway classification of merchandise,</P>
    <P>(b) particulars of the actual charges for the time being made by the board for the carriage of merchandise by rail from that depôt,</P>
    <P>(c) the schedules of the existing statutory maximum charges for the carriage of merchandise by rail,</P>
    <P>(d) schedules of the maximum charges which the board is entitled to make for the carriage of merchandise by rail from that depôt.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The same restrictions apply in a further sub-section which deals with the duty of the board to keep for public inspection certain copies at each depôt owned by it at which merchandise is received for carriage by inland waterway. At every depôt these schedules and classifications are to be kept for public inspection.  If that is so, then, necessarily, at least one clerk will have to be employed for nothing else but the control and supervision of these classifications and these rates of charges.  I think people using the railways will have no difficulty in ascertaining <Col N="523" /> what the charges are.  If all these charges have to be classified and scheduled, then Córas Iompair Éireann is deprived of freedom in relation to the competition with which it may have to contend.  If that board is to be successful I can visualise circumstances in which a decision may have to be taken on the spur of the moment in relation to conveying certain goods at a certain price. The board must be in the same position to bargain as are its competitors. Here we seek to deprive them of the right to bargain by classifications, schedules, statutory requirements and statutory controls.  I want to see Córas Iompair Éireann successful. I am quite prepared to give the board freedom of action because I realise that with the competition that exists they will have no traffic unless their charges are favourable to the business community generally and to users of the railway.</P>
    <P>We are trying to combine two completely different systems here, the railway run by private ownership at a profit and subject to all these statutory restrictions and Córas Iompair Éireann which has no monopoly of transport, which is not making a profit and which is being subsidised heavily by the community.  The two things cannot mix.  I appeal to the Minister not to insist on this tribunal and to leave a certain freedom to Córas Iompair Eireann which is under his control as a representative of the Government and of the people.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to take a certain amount of trouble in constituting the board of Córas Iompair Éireann.  If this tribunal is set up, he will have the same trouble in establishing it.  Its principal function will be to act as a court of appeal in relation to the charges imposed by Córas Iompair Éireann, a board established by the Minister and by the Government under this Act.  I do not think the board could be successful under such a system.  In order to give it an opportunity of becoming a success, I appeal to the Minister to agree to the removal of these restrictive clauses in so far as they relate to the revision of charges by the proposed tribunal.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McGilligan) Patrick McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill provides for the continuance for a period of five years of the Act of 1945 called the Customs (Temporary Provisions) Act.  The circumstances that led up to that Act were that there had been for some time a code of customs law governing the illegal importation of goods.  The matter of <Col N="526" /> goods imported directly was definitely under control as far as the old customs Order was concerned.  There was no code corresponding to that which dealt with illegal export.  When the old code was drawn up the matter of the export of goods was not as much in the forefront as it is nowadays.  Countries were then concerned mainly with preventing the importation of goods except under certain conditions.  There was not the same attitude with regard to export. Export restrictions then came into being and they increased as the years went on.  The absence of a code of the same type as that which was there to deal with importation was found to be a difficulty.  It was met by year-to-year improvisations.  In the year 1938 an Act was passed called the Scrap Iron (Control of Exports) Act.  A considerable number of provisions under that Act were on a much more extensive scale than previous <i>ad hoc</i> legislation. The provisions of the Scrap Iron Act were based on the Exports Consolidation Act, 1876.</P>
      <P>When the emergency arose in 1939 there came, at the same time, a very wide range of export prohibitions. The question of making the exports prohibition effective became more and more important.</P>
      <P>The control exercised as from 1939 was based upon the Emergency Powers Order of that year and, in particular, upon the powers given to a Minister under Article 31.  But you had the system that for years people were charged with the export of such things as butter, eggs, or any sort of dairy produce and, when the matter came before the court, it was based eventually upon a Scrap Iron (Control of Export) Act.  It was always a source of amusement to the people in the court when they first discovered that some offence in relation, say, to dairy produce was being prosecuted in relation to an Order which dealt with scrap iron.  However, it was the particular Act in which the more extended provisions were and that had been applied to the various Orders made under the Emergency Powers Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The machinery was very awkward. The powers were inadequate for the purposes required.  Accordingly, the Customs (Temporary Provisions) Act of <Col N="527" /> 1945 was passed.  That was intended to be a permanent measure for customs (control of export) prohibitions.  At the same time it took advantage of the situation by attending to certain defects in the existing law.  The Bill was not liked when it was brought in here. It is not a very attractive Act.  It gives very definite powers to the revenue authorities.  Considerable objection was taken to the Bill when it came in here in 1945 with the result that later the Minister in charge of the Bill took an amendment restricting the life of the Act to five years.  That period of five years expires on 31st March this year. Therefore, it is necessary to arrange for its continuance in the way I have done or in some other way.</P>
    <P>If the Act expires the Revenue Commissioners advise me that their powers over the wide range of exports which still remain on the prohibited list would definitely be inadequate in respect of what was demanded of them.  Certain of these articles are on the list of exports prohibitions because of temporary shortages, but there are certain other articles where the permanent control is based upon certain economic or social necessities.  There is quite an amount of export prohibition with regard to the agricultural produce type of goods, and dangerous drugs, and so forth, which come under the heading of social necessity.</P>
    <P>The case for the Act is what has happened since the year it was passed. Since the enactment of this piece of legislation in 1945 there have been 649 prosecutions.  Practically all of these have been successful.  The power to bring these would have been very definitely weakened if the provisions of this Act, which weighed the matter in favour of the Revenue Commissioners, were not there.  The 649 prosecutions take no account of the tens of thousands of seizures, which never came near the court at all.  Those who have any touch with the affairs of this country and the northern half of it will know that modern smuggling is quite a lucrative affair.  The fact that large profits are able to be made from smuggling have induced the formation of certain gangs who provide themselves <Col N="528" /> with the best possible equipment for the purpose of achieving their object, that is, illegal export and all the money that it brings.  Motor transport was organised in quite a distinct way, as the stuff was brought to a certain point and made ready for transport across the Border.  There are associated with this machinery quite a number of scouts who have to see whether the roads are guarded in a particular way or whether it is possible to slip through, and who are generally on the <i>qui vive</i> the whole time against the revenue officers.  It has required a good deal of motor patrol work and a very high degree of skill to deal with the rackets that started in the counties adjoining the Border.  It is possible that these rackets have even branches which extend widely throughout the country.</P>
    <P>There are two matters in particular that called for many precautions. There was, firstly, the question of the export of motor cars.  The export of gold from this State had also become a serious matter.  After many months of detective work of the type of which I have spoken, certain people were brought to book and convictions were obtained in court.  Smuggling has been held in check and certainly the two big rackets that were threatening to form in regard to the export of motor cars and gold, appear to have been defeated decisively.  The question of the illegal export of certain agricultural produce, particularly the export of poultry, has given us a good deal of trouble.  There have been many court prosecutions brought to a successful conclusion and court penalties, including imprisonment, seem to have got the matter fairly well in hand.</P>
    <P>These results, I am informed, could not have been achieved without the special powers given by the Act.  If the Temporary Provisions Act were allowed to lapse there would be a good deal of administrative confusion.  It is quite possible that these rackets would be organised again and there would be no possibility of stopping them in the effective way in which they have been stopped with the aid of these powers. This Act, as it was presented to the House, did represent a summary of the minimum legal powers that were considered  <Col N="529" /> necessary for dealing with these illegal activities.  It was decided to bring the Bill forward to renew these powers and it is suggested that the Act should be allowed to continue for a further period of five years.</P>

      <P>The Minister rather understand the effect of the 1945 Act when it was brought before the members of the then Opposition.  He stated that it was not liked.  It was, in fact, roundly abused.  I must congratulate the Minister on having brought forward this Fianna Fáil Act here to-day and on making a case so well for it. When this Act was first introduced, Deputy Mulcahy, now Minister for Education, said that we wanted it, not, as the Minister suggested here this evening, to stop the smuggling racket but in order to proclaim to the world that our people were nothing but a community of racketeers and tricksters. Deputy Norton, now Minister for Social Welfare, said that what we wanted was to fill the jails.  They got all their Parties at that time to vote against the Bill.  They voted against it on the Second Stage and several times on the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>As I say, I want to congratulate Deputies on the Government Front Bench and Deputies who are supporting them on their political education within the last couple of years.  Unfortunately, it has taken a little time to get them to see that the things they denounced under the Fianna Fáil administration were good and proper measures for the safety and prosperity of our community.  It is too bad that they allowed themselves to be persuaded by their own propaganda, while in opposition, to overthrow, undermine and reverse certain of the decisions of the Fianna Fáil Government for the development of the country.  However late their conversion, we congratulate them on bringing forward this Bill and we take the Minister's speech as a due and humble apology for the various attacks made on the Fianna Fáil administration at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not going to accuse the Minister for Social Welfare of wanting to fill the jails by bringing forward <Col N="530" /> this Bill to extend the Act for another five years, nor are we going to say that the Minister for Finance wants to call our people tricksters and racketeers. I am sorry the Minister for Agriculture is not here because he was certainly very voluble and extravagant in his denunciation of this measure which we now propose to re-enact for another five years.  Everyone who knew the situation in 1945 regarded the measure as a proper one and regarded the powers which it was proposed to give to the Revenue Commissioners as the minimum powers that could be given, if they were to carry out the duties which the House imposed on them and the job which the people expected them to perform.  Undoubtedly, as the Minister has pointed out, were it not that the Revenue Commissioners had these powers in the last five years, we could not effectively have prevented the exportation of supplies of goods which were very badly needed for our own people.  I am glad that the Minister is continuing the Act for another five years.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies may remember that when speaking on the Financial Resolutions on the 4th May last year, I indicated that I proposed to meet representations of the Irish Pot Still Distillers' Association in regard to certain definitions.  They had asked that the terms &ldquo;Irish whiskey&rdquo; and &ldquo;Irish pot still whiskey&rdquo; should be legally defined and pointed out that the absence of a definition constituted a certain handicap in relation to the export market.  I had said that it seemed to me that the proper occasion to deal with the matter would be the Finance Bill of the year, but I was <Col N="531" /> warned by the Chair, that the inclusion of a provision of that kind in the Finance Bill, might mean that the Finance Bill would not be declared to be a Money Bill.  For that reason, I did not go on with the suggestion, since what I had indicated to the House was reported to me as likely to happen. When I did not put it in the Finance Bill, I thought of bringing it in at a later stage and this is now the time to fulfil my promise to the distillers.</P>
      <P>In regard to the legal definition of Irish whiskey, the distillers said a definition of this type was necessary in order to safeguard the name of Irish whiskey at home and abroad.  It is a rather technical matter.  The whole matter has been under discussion with the people concerned&mdash;mainly these distillers&mdash;and with Ceimici Teoranta. The Department of Industry and Commerce have also been consulted about this and have concurred in the proposed amendment of the law.  Deputies will see that all that is set out is that spirits described either as &ldquo;Irish whiskey&rdquo; or &ldquo;Irish pot still whiskey&rdquo; are not be deemed to correspond to the description for certain purposes unless&mdash;and then certain conditions are set out which form the technical side.  The Bill is related to sub-section (9) of Section 105 of an Act of 1880 known as the Spirits Act. That sub-section (9) is in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If any question arises as to the accuracy of the description of spirits in a permit or certificate, the proof that the spirits correspond to the description shall lie on the owner or claimant of the spirits, who shall prove the same by the oaths of two credible witnesses, being skilful and experienced persons competent to decide by examination thereof.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We add on to that that spirits described as &ldquo;Irish whiskey&rdquo; or &ldquo;Irish pot still whiskey&rdquo; will not be deemed to correspond to the description unless certain things are carried out which are set out in (a) and (b) of Section 1 of this Bill.  That will meet the requirements, we have been assured. We have been assured further that representations on similar lines <Col N="532" /> were made by the Scotch distillers to the British Government in 1933 and that they achieved the result in the Finance Act of 1933, where there was a definition of Scotch whiskey related to this same Act of 1880.  We are following exactly the same procedure as adopted then.</P>
    <P>I do not pretend to be able to explain what the definition will entail, but I do know that it is sought by the distillers as a necessity for protecting their export trade.  The permit does not apply to export: the permit applies when spirits are moved inside the country from one bonded place to another; but the permit being given for the purpose of the internal movement of the spirits will be accepted, say in America, in relation to whatever whiskey is exported there.  That is the way the situation is met for export purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We are, of course, altogether agreeable that this Bill should be adopted by the House.  When Fianna Fáil was in office, it did all in its power to encourage our distillers to get up the stocks of whiskey, so that in the post-war period we might add to our export trade.  Had they asked for anything like that, of course, and proved to the Government and its officials that it was necessary, they would have got it.  Indeed, in certain years the commodities that were in short supply were made available to the distillers in order that they might get up their stocks.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister and his officials have examined this from the technical point of view and are satisfied that it meets the situation.  Reading it as a layman. it seems to me to be simple enough and if it gives power to prevent the movement of really good Irish whiskey it is a thing that everybody would approve of.  We do not want the name of Irish whiskey to be destroyed in foreign markets&mdash;it is much too valuable an export trade&mdash;by people exporting Irish whiskey which is not up to standard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This definition, as I have had occasion to know outside this House, is absolutely necessary, if there is to be any export to America.  In <Col N="533" /> fact, the position up to this has been that it is only by an indirect method that exports to America have been permitted. I think Deputy Aiken is wrong when he says that this is the first time it has come up.  I remember this matter being raised about seven or eight years ago and on that occasion I do not think the then powers that be were prepared to give the association the facilities that are being given now.  Just as the Deputy a few minutes ago welcomed the Customs Bill as a change of heart, so I, too, welcome this Bill as a similar one.  Apart from that pleasantry&mdash;which was not what I got up to mention&mdash;there is very definite danger of real damage being done to the reputation of Irish whiskey, particularly by what is known as &ldquo;Irish type&rdquo; whiskey.  I think that one of the things which this definition will do is to enable the distillers themselves to tighten up this point in their own associations, in their own sales catalogues, retail sales catalogues and so forth.  There was a suggestion here some time ago that certain Irish whiskey would be utilised as a basis for Irish type whiskey in America and if anything like that were to occur it would be disastrous to the name of Irish whiskey.  Anything we can do in this definition to prevent that happening would be welcomed by the country as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume it is normal parliamentary practice to bring in a Money Resolution for a piece of legislation that has not been thoroughly discussed.  Before the Minister seeks to secure the finances for the Bill that is being discussed in the Dáil, we should really have a lot more information about it.  The Minister brought in the Bill in a tremendous hurry.  He wanted the Committee Stage a week after he got the Second Stage. Strangely enough, he has been bringing in his own amendments since then in very great spate.  Before the House would agree blindly to offer him a blank cheque, it would be advisable for us to get a good deal further in the discussion on the Bill.</P>
      <P>Both in his opening and closing remarks on the Second Stage, the Minister spoke about the price of land and market value.  While the House is in a great measure in agreement with him, yet, I think his definition of market value as he gave it leaves the thing as much in the air as it was before he introduced the Bill.  Then again he brought in what is a very broad and very difficult proposal and one that requires a good deal of consideration, that is, the question of the reorganisation of the Land Commission.  The proposals of the Minister are such as completely to upset all preconceived ideas of what Land Commission procedure ought to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally enough.  But the Minister proposes to make very definite changes in the structure of the Land Commission and, therefore, it can hardly be said that money that is already voted for the present position will be available or should be utilised for the position visualised in the new Bill.  Anyhow, Sir, if I may proceed, the Minister's proposals for the reorganisation of the Land Commission make a very decided change in procedure. The Minister is always responsible for the policy of the Land Commission, financial and otherwise; the staff is always responsible to the Minister but there were certain specific points that, for the Minister's own safety and so as to maintain his position in a regular way, he had to surrender to the commissioners.  By the proposals made in this Bill, while the Minister does insist that he is in fact widening the powers of the commissioners, he is completely taking out of the hands of the commissioners any powers they have.</P>
      <P>Again, Sir, there is this question of market value.  While the Minister has not settled the market value, while he has not decided what the market value is to be, and while his statement on the matter is such that it leaves the position exactly as it was, yet, if we do accept the point of view that market value is to be paid, there is also to be paid compensation for disturbance and compensation for consequential damages. These are very wide and very important proposals and, if I interpret the views of certain members of the House in relation to the Bill, these proposals tend to hold up the work of the Land Commission rather than to facilitate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, of course, an exceptionally dangerous, certainly an unfamiliar, proposal embodied in the Bill and that is the purchase of farms as going concerns. I am sure that would be included in the Money Resolution because <Col N="536" /> it may mean the expenditure of a tremendous amount of money and completely cuts across the economics of land at the present time.  I do think that we ought to have a much longer and more adequate discussion on that particular point before we start to vote any moneys.</P>
    <P>I mentioned also to the Minister in the debate, hoping that he would take some notice of what I said, that there is embodied in the Land Acts a clause which limits the advance to Land Commission tenants to £3,000 and in some other cases to £5,000.  It is my belief that in a great many cases, happening particularly during the war, that limit of advance has been very much passed, and I do think that it is wrong to the State and wrong to the taxpayer that such huge advances should be made to certain individuals, particularly moneyed individuals, because they are the ones concerned.</P>
    <P>I am rather at a disadvantage in speaking on the Money Resolution as I envisaged that we might have a general discussion on the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no intention of saying anything but the speech of Deputy Moylan leaves me with no other alternative.  The Deputy has been a member of the House for a very long time.  He started off his speech by an attack on the Minister because the Minister was taking the Money Resolution. The Deputy would have been better advised&mdash;unless of course it was because he was taken short and had not time to consider the matter, as he suggested at the end of his speech&mdash; to have taken an opportunity of referring to Standing Orders, which are so easily phrased that even those who are not legal gentlemen can understand them.  He would have found that it is a provision of this House that Money Resolutions must be dealt with before the amendments are discussed.  He would also find, if he wished to advert to it, in the annals of the House that it is the general custom that the Minister never does anything more on a Money Resolution than to move it, and that he leaves the case to be made against the Money Resolution before he intervenes.  I am surprised that a person of Deputy Moylan's experience should have taken the note which he adopted in this regard.</P>
      <P>I am surprised, too, that Deputy Moylan, who was Minister for Lands for a considerable period and, during that period had, no doubt, to refer on many occasions to the provisions of the Land Acts, 1923 to 1939, dealing with the resumption of land, should be in any difficulty with regard to the phrase &ldquo;market value&rdquo;.  If the Deputy is in difficulty with regard to that phrase, I wonder how it was that, when he was Minister, he had no such difficulty, because the phrase was there just the same in regard to resumed land and it must have been operated during those years, if the Land Commission and the Deputy, when Minister in charge of it, operated it at all, and I presume they must have, during these years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was even more surprised when Deputy Moylan said that the Minister in this Bill was taking away the powers <Col N="538" /> of the lay commissioners.  The Deputy started a hare on the Second Reading and he was followed nobly by one soldier after another on the other side.</P>

      <P>I am inclined to agree.  The Money Resolution provides specifically that moneys are to be provided under the Act for the purposes of Section 10, amongst other sections, for the purposes of the excepted matters left to the lay commissioners. The money is required for that purpose, and, so far as I can understand, the objection Deputy Moylan has to the Money Resolution is that any money should be provided for the purpose of paying the lay commissioners to deal with excepted matters.  I do not know whether the Deputy intended that money should not be provided in this way or not, but it would have been much better if the Deputy&mdash;it would also have enabled me to do so&mdash;had dealt with these matters on the various sections.  We would then get much more clearly from the Deputy and from the Minister what the purpose of each particular amount required was and could deal with it on the basis of the details and merits of the reasons for <Col N="539" /> which the individual amount were required rather than try to have, as Deputy Moylan tried, and as perhaps I tried, to have a rehash of the Second Stage.</P>

      <P>(b)  where in the opinion of the lay commissioners or the appeal tribunal (as the case may be) it would be inequitable that the Land Commission should acquire the land for a price fixed on the basis of market value, the lay commissioners or the appeal tribunal (as the case may be) in fixing the price may include therein compensation to the owner for disturbance, and may also include therein, if satisfied that damage will be sustained by the owner by reason of the acquisition of the land as affecting his user of other land or otherwise causing injury to such other land, compensation for that damage.</P>
      <P>This is merely a drafting amendment, designed to bring the provision in relation to disturbance and damage to other lands into line with a similar provision in Section 45 of the Land Act, 1931, which deals with resumption cases.

      <P>This paragraph takes the place of sub-sections (b) and (c) of the section with reference to disturbance and consequential damage.  I think it would be appropriate that the Minister should indicate to the House <Col N="540" /> how the compensation for disturbance is to be assessed, what are the precedents which are to determine the extent of the compensation and what information he has to give the Dáil to illustrate cases where this compensation may include consequential damages sustained by the owner by reason of the acquisition of the land as affecting his use of other land.  It seems to me that in laying down principles upon which compensation for disturbance or ancillary damage is to be given, it would be appropriate for the Legislature to lay down these matters in some detail and not merely leave the question of the determination of the assessment to the complete discretion of whatever arbitration machinery there may be.  Even in the case of the expression &ldquo;inequitable&rdquo;, at the beginning of the paragraph, we ought surely in legislation to be able to state what are the circumstances in which the Land Commission would determine that the acquisition of certain land was inequitable.  One can see that it is necessary to have a certain discretion, but in this matter we are simply giving power to the commissioners, in the first instance, and to arbitrators, in the second, to determine matters on whatever criterion or basis of assessment they may fix themselves.</P>

      <P>In moving the amendment I explained&mdash;whether Deputy Derrig paid sufficient attention or not &mdash;that the purpose of this amendment is merely to bring the case of acquired land, vested land, into line with provisions which are already there since the 1931 Act for resumed land.  There is no change.  There was a difference in the way of treatment of the two types of land occupiers, owners and tenants.  While a tenant living on unvested land stood to enjoy certain benefits up to this by way of compensation for disturbance, the actual owner of a farm, living perhaps across the road, who was unfortunate enough to be the vested owner, did not benefit in the same way.  This is to bring the two types of land users, owners and tenants, into line with each other. Deputy Derrig was trying to suggest that there was some sinister move in this.  If there is, it was wrong to leave <Col N="541" /> it on the Statute Book since 1931 in the case of the unvested owner.</P>

I do not believe it would be possible to pin this matter down in cold words.  In the case of resumed land this practice has been in operation and the matter has been dealt with in a satisfactory way by the lay commissioners and the appeal tribunal since 1931, and I do not see why a difference should be made between tenants who do not own their land at all&mdash;because the Land Commission own it&mdash;and who get benefits and the man who actually owns his land.

      <P>I think we need not pursue the Minister's argument about the difference between resumed tenants and others.  The fact is that for a long period it was State policy to treat resumed holdings in a special manner. Is it not going to be the position now when the question of market value is raised that the number of cases where holders will apply for compensation for disturbance is likely to be greatly increased? Is it not the position that whereas in the past the number of these cases was somewhat limited, since the type of case from which they flowed was limited, now, since in all the cases the question of market value will arise, the lay commissioners will have this extra discretion?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The people whose lands are being acquired will understand <Col N="543" /> that the law of the land, if this legislation goes through, will entitle them to market value and furthermore, if they can make a case for disturbance or show that they have suffered in the particular way indicated, that not alone will they get market value but something over and above.  The House is in the position that it has no idea of what imposition this is likely to cause.  I have already expressed my doubts as to whether the whole orientation upon which the Minister has now embarked will have the opposite effect to that which he had contemplated. However, he has not given us any information even from past experience which may not be the best guide to what is going to happen under new circumstances.  We do not know what the market value of land is likely to be.  He has not given us the limits even of what he thinks might be the appropriate figures.  That would not mean that the Minister's words would bind us in any way or bind himself, but it would at least give an indication of the type of price he has in mind. He has failed, in spite of requests from this side of the House, to give any indication of what the disturbance value is likely to be.</P>
      <P>During the period when Deputy Moylan and I had experience of the work of the Land Commission the operations of that body were of course very severely restricted by the emergency situation.  If the Minister contemplates going out into the market and taking up land on a large scale, then obviously with present-day values this whole question of market value in relation to disturbance must mean that very considerably more will be paid than was paid in the past.  I think if those like myself who have doubts as to the wisdom of this policy and its effect on land acquisition generally got the information we seek from the Minister we would be able to substantiate our belief that far from relieving congestion by making large amounts of land available it will in fact have a different effect while high prices will probably render it difficult to carry on at all.</P>

      <P>I had practically finished when we adjourned.  I want to say that I am not any more in love with this tribunal than anybody else. As I explained earlier, it is there in these amendments, in this new part of the Bill, because of representations which were made from all sides of the House during the Second Reading debate.  If the House does not want the tribunal, and wants to leave the Bill as originally introduced, that will suit me.  On the other hand, if the House wants to retain the tribunal for the purpose of dealing with the question of branch lines or the reduction or cesser of services on certain lines, I do not mind &mdash;if that is the wish of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no desire whatever that this tribunal should come into the picture from the point of view of charges.  As I said before the adjournment, all I really want to know is what exactly the House wants.  As far as I could gather from the debate to-day on this group of amendments, I do not think anybody spoke in favour of the <Col N="545" /> tribunal in relation to charges.  I think that most Deputies, with the exception of one or two, were in favour of having the tribunal in relation to branch lines. I take it that is what the House desires.  If it is, that satisfies me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the position has been made perfectly clear all along from our side.  It is that we did like the idea of the reference in the original Bill to the manner in which charges were to be dealt with by the board.  We gave our reasons for that. We did think it was a mistake that there was a change, as outlined in the Minister's amendments, in that position.  If I am any judge of the feeling in the House it would appear to be that the House desires that the question of charges should not be referred to the tribunal, especially under present conditions, but that there should be some form of appeal so far as branch lines are concerned.  There is a feeling in the House that the question of branch lines is one on which the board should not have arbitrary powers, and that there might be some form of appeal as suggested by the Minister himself.  There is a feeling in that respect.  It was put to me by one or two members of the House who have, shall I say, certain commitments in this matter of branch lines.  I think that the change suggested can be justified. On the question of charges, it does seem that there is a feeling in the House that it might be left alone, and with good effect so far as the new organisation is concerned.  That is how we feel&mdash;that the Bill would be a better one on these lines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As between the Bill as introduced and the amendments, I would support the view expressed by Deputy O'Sullivan.  If, however, the tribunal is to be retained in respect of the closing of branch lines and presumably also in relation to the operation of canal services, I would like if the Minister would indicate what type of tribunal he has in mind. Reference has been made to remuneration. I take it that he has not in mind a tribunal the members of which would be remunerated by an annual salary: that it would be a question of a payment per meeting or on some such <Col N="546" /> basis, which would mean that the tribunal would not be paid if there was no work for it to do.  On that basis, I would agree to the suggestion that the tribunal be retained in respect of the services of branch lines and canals, and that the Minister would revert to his original proposal so far as charges are concerned.  I think, however, I should say that we still would prefer the arrangement which would put upon the Minister's shoulders just that amount of responsibility which would make it relevant for a member of the Dáil to query policy on these matters.  If, however, that is not practicable, I think the Minister would improve his Bill by adopting the suggestion made by Deputy O'Sullivan.</P>

I should explain that the amendment was introduced as a substitute for the original amendment No. 81 to meet points which were raised on amendment No. 27 by, I think, Deputy Lemass, and raised also by other members of the House.  It is merely to clarify the position in relation to the various classifications and to ensure that they should be accessible to the public.  I think that is reasonable enough.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 85:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 50 and in Part VIII to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) The board may not reduce the facilities granted to by-traders on the Grand Canal undertaking or increase tolls, dues, or wharfage or other rates charged to such traders except by Order of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii) Every Order made by the Minister under this section shall not come into operation unless and <Col N="556" /> until it is confirmed by resolution in each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I take it that amendment No. 84a relates to the operation of the canal by the canal company, and this ensures that the board will not be able to close the canal or any part of it without the sanction of the tribunal.  But, apart altogether from closing the canal, there is the question of the protection of the interests of by-traders.  These by-traders on the canal are, in a sense, in competition with the canal company itself.  They are both seeking business in the transportation of goods by canal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>They are also a source of revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And a source of revenue &mdash;that is true.  But there has been a policy of live and let live followed to a considerable extent by the company in the past in so far as they did not seek, in the operation of their own barges, to interfere in branches of trade which the by-traders regarded as their own. I think it might be desirable to have some provision in the Bill which would ensure that the board could not alter its policy without justifying the alteration. I do not want to preclude them from altering their policy, but it should not be left entirely to their own discretion.</P>
      <P>It is entirely different from railway operation.  Nobody but the railway company runs trains on their railway lines, but over the canal highway there are these other traders operating, and their capacity to operate at a profit depends on the facilities given them by the canal undertaking and by the level of the tolls, dues, wharfage charges and other charges made to them for their operation.  While we have reached agreement that the company is not to be restricted in the charges it makes for its own services, I do not think it would be wise to leave them unrestricted in the charges they make to these by-traders operating on the canal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case I think it is desirable that the Minister should come in because an alteration in policy of this kind would have to be considered by the Dáil and it is only if the Minister has responsibility that the Dáil could do it.  That is why I urge this amendment or something like it should be <Col N="557" /> inserted by way of protection for these by-traders.  I do not wish to represent the position as one in which there is any apprehension amongst them at the moment, that they will be adversely affected by the company's operations or that they will be powerless if they are so adversely affected, but I think it is desirable that we should have in the Bill some safeguarding clause which would ensure that they cannot be subjected to more adverse conditions of operation without the Dáil having some power to do something about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I urge the Minister to have regard to the point made by Deputy Lemass.  Possibly the amendment as drafted might not meet with his acceptance, but he should have regard to the peculiar position arising in connection with the canal.  So far as rail and road traffic are concerned, leaving aside the question of licences to haul goods, nobody could stop a person running a lorry on the road if he wants to do it; but here we have a position where the by-traders on the canal fall into two categories.  There is the category of the commercial undertaking that has its own boat and hauls its own goods, and there is the private boat owner who may work under contract for a commercial undertaking or for the canal company.  The position is that practically 50 per cent. of the traffic carried by the canal company on its canals is carried in boats owned by persons other than the canal company; in other words, half the traffic is carried in privately owned boats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These by-traders may be affected in a number of ways by changes in the tolls or in the withdrawal or the reduction of the facilities in respect of traffic for their boats on the canal.  I am not so much concerned with those fairly large commercial and industrial undertakings that have their own boats, because in many cases these boats are utilised only because some of the directors of these undertakings happen to be directors also of the canal company and they take that personal interest in the canal.  Many of them in recent years have started to develop their own road transport system in opposition to their own <Col N="558" /> canal boats and canal services.  But there are a number of small boat owners whose livelihood depends on the ownership and the working of the boats.  They have crews working for them.</P>
    <P>As regards the men employed on the boats of commercial undertakings and the employees on the privately owned boats, we have here a body of men who, for more years than I like to remember, have worked under the most intolerable conditions, both in regard to wages and working hours, and they are living in the hope that some day they will eventually be regarded and treated as human beings.  If the employees of the canal company are working under conditions and receiving wages which could not well be defended in public, the employees of the privately owned boats are even on a lower scale and, while I realise it may be difficult if not almost impossible to provide the form of protection to which these men are entitled, I think the Minister should retain some powers of final sanction in regard to possible interference with their livelihood and he should retain, even in an indirect way, the power to ensure that if their livelihood is taken away by virtue of their not being able to carry on&mdash;that is, the privately owned boats&mdash;through not getting contracts from commercial undertakings or the canal company itself, there should be some consideration for their position.</P>
    <P>These men are in a special class. They follow this particular type of work.  Indeed, their families have followed it for generations, and they put up with conditions that I do not believe any other body of men would suffer under.  If we integrate the canal system with the national transport system we should not do it in such a way as to place any greater hardship on these men.  During the emergency the canal system played a very, very important rôle in maintaining transport. Indeed, it was the only period for quite a long time in which the canal company paid dividends and they were able to do that because they got the benefit of the increased traffic during the emergency and they had not to pay increased wages at the same time.</P>
    <P>While I recognise the difficulties the <Col N="559" /> Minister is up against, I think his sympathy will be with this group of men.  In so far as Deputy Lemass's point is concerned, it will give some indirect control and supervision with respect to the private boat owners and I urge the Minister to put in some amendment along the lines suggested by Deputy Lemass, which I support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there are any grounds for the fears expressed by Deputy Lemass or Deputy Larkin. I think we have a right to assume that a national transport concern operating the canals will have at least as much concern for the rights of those by-traders as a private company has and I have no doubt that as regards the conditions under which they operate their boats on the canal, if they are not improved, they certainly will not be worsened.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>They cannot do that. We are doing nothing in this Bill which alters their present position.  The new board will be bound, in accordance with Section 49, to maintain the canal, to have it open for traffic by those boats and to give reasonable facilities for the acceptance and delivery of freight or merchandise, and it will be to the interest of the canal company or the new board to encourage boats of that type, not to discourage them, because, as Deputy Larkin has pointed out, the canal company at the moment is not itself able to carry the traffic on the canal.  I do not know if the Deputy is aware that the canal company earn a very substantial income through the operations of the private boat owners.  The Deputy may think I am, so to speak, walking into it by admitting that, but that is the fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I want to remind Deputies of is this.  They are sometimes inclined to forget that we are displacing a <Col N="560" /> private company for a national board. Surely, therefore, it is reasonable to assume that such a national board will have at least as much&mdash;I believe far more&mdash;consideration for the people using the canal outside of the canal company itself.  There is no use in talking about bringing the Minister into the Bill at this stage.  It cannot be done.  There is no use in talking about bringing the tribunal back into the Bill at this stage in order to deal with the canal company alone.  We have already dealt with that.  I think that both Deputy Lemass and Deputy Larkin will agree that there are no real grounds for any fear in this connection. I am quite sure that if the national board did at any time try to inflict a hardship on or deprive private owners of boats on the canal of any rights which they are enjoying at the moment, that is a matter that could very easily and quickly be set right. One can do it with a national board when one could not do it with a private company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>So long as we have the assurance of the Minister that he will deal with the position if trouble does arise, I will accept his view that we cannot bring him back into the Bill at the moment.  May I submit, however, that his view of the canal company is quite wrong?  So far as canal traffic is concerned, the money earned by the company on tolls and so forth is considerable, but the main source of income outside of the profit made by them on the road freight section largely springs, particularly in recent years, from the dividends earned on their investments.  I do not think the actual tolls and rents would be sufficient to maintain the canal.  The reason why these private owners have been a source of profit is that the crews of these privately owned boats work for wages below the rates paid by the company itself; they work a 24-hour day as compared with the canal company's 16-hour day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From that point of view it is a paying proposition for the company to have traffic carried in these privately owned boats because they can make money on them when they cannot make it on their own.  The canal company believe that <Col N="561" /> the most profitable policy to pursue is to close down their traffic-carrying activities and close the canal as well while making the company a road freight service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>While it is true that there remains a statutory obligation to keep the canal open for traffic, it only wants a fall in the water level to wipe out all traffic altogether.  That could be excused on the grounds that the condition of the water bed and the condition of the locks was unsuitable or because of a thousand and one other reasons which would successfully relieve them of this onerous obligation. I think that in amalgamating the canal company and the rail and road system, we are pursuing a proper course.  I am aware that one cannot make omelettes without breaking eggs, but I do not want to have those omelettes at the expense of the men who have already had a hard life and who, if we do not have regard to their claims, may find themselves, after 30 or 40 years, thrown out of employment.</P>

      <P>The statutory obligation to keep the canal open is worth nothing.  The Great Southern Railway had a statutory obligation to keep the Royal Canal open.  Córas Iompair Éireann has that statutory obligation now, but there is not much traffic on the Royal Canal.  I think there is considerable ground for apprehension in this case proceeding on the general knowledge that no canal undertaking has ever been able to complete with a railway undertaking anywhere.  I think it is inevitable that the whole tendency of the management will be towards the disposal of the canal undertaking.</P>

      <P>Once the Minister assures us that the matter will receive his attention and sympathy, I think <Col N="562" /> that is as far as we can expect to go. Some time ago I had a deputation from these men.  They told me the wages they received, the hours they worked and the distances they travelled.  I told them that it was my opinion that, if the canal continued to exist, there would be no danger to their employment because the canal company could not find anyone else to do the work they were doing for the wages they were prepared to accept for it.  It is, of course, a traditional family employment. Because their fathers, their grandfathers and their great-grandfathers before them engaged in it they are anxious to carry on.  Now that the Minister has expressed his appreciation of and sympathy with these people, I think we can leave the matter there.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2) to delete the words &ldquo;High Court&rdquo; in lines 50 and 55 and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;Minister for Finance&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It does not seem sensible to me that where an agreement exists between the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the board it should be necessary for the purpose of revising that agreement to go to the High Court.  I could understand that being necessary when Córas Iompair Éireann was a private concern.  It will no longer be a private concern under this Bill in the sense that it will be subsidised by public funds. If there should be any difference of opinion or any dispute between Córas Iompair Éireann and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, I think it is the Minister for Finance who should determine such a dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the dispute were to go to the High Court the board would have to appoint counsel and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs would have to do the <Col N="564" /> same.  The matter would be argued before a judge and decided by him. His decision might not be acceptable from the point of view of the public. Therefore I thought it would be better that the Minister for Finance, who provides the funds for the board and who is concerned with the finances of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, should be the person to decide. I am not tied entirely to the Minister for Finance in this respect but it strikes me as being an expensive and unnecessary procedure to have it brought before the High Court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  As a matter of fact there was a similar provision in the 1944 Act.  I am advised that, actually, no case ever went, under the 1944 Act, to the High Court. It is quite possible that the Minister for Finance might be a very interested party himself in any dispute between the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the board&mdash;and particularly if we reach the time for which we are all so anxiously hoping when Córas Iompair Éireann will be paying its way and perhaps making a profit. If they were making a profit the Minister for Finance might be inclined to come down on the side of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I think it is unlikely that there will be many disagreements of such a type as would require to be referred to the High Court.  There will be very few.  Personally, I should prefer them to be determined by the High Court rather than by the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that I cannot accept this amendment.  At the same time, I am anxious that, as far as possible, the maximum amount of native fuel will be used by Córas Iompair Éireann or by any other State company.  I think the Deputy knows that I am sympathetic towards the idea behind this amendment&mdash;so much so that I asked Sir James Milne to go into the matter of Arigna coal at the time they were going into the question. The company themselves are desirous of using native fuel to the fullest possible extent.  In fact, certain experiments are being carried out at the moment to see if it is possible to devise or build a locomotive that will burn native fuel economically, whether it be coal or turf.</P>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, I have represented on numerous occasions to the board that it is my desire that, as far as it is possible for them to do so, they should use Irish coal.  I cannot go any further than that and I certainly could not accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister is aware that while these investigations are going on the coal workers in the Arigna area are fleeing the country in large numbers.  Is the Minister aware, also, that, without getting in new machinery in the way of boilers suitable for our coal, Arigna coal has been used for years on the railway system prior to amalgamation and that it is still being used on some of the branch lines?  The operators on these branch lines have informed me that they have got better results from Arigna coal than they have been getting or got when they used foreign coal.  It is, therefore, clearly evident that new <Col N="566" /> types of boilers are not required before the coal can be used efficiently.  It has been used for the past 100 years on some of those lines: it is still being used and it is still successful. Surely it is not impossible for the Minister to interfere and stop this unemployment and consequent emigration of trained workers by insisting that the railways should be asked to use a larger quantity of Arigna coal than they are using?</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister, in view of the circumstances &mdash; of which he must already be aware and which I know to be a fact&mdash;to ensure greater use of Irish produced coal in this respect.  I am in close touch with the district in question&mdash;Arigna.  I ask the Minister to go so far as to give an undertaking to-night that he will see to it that the railways will increase their consumption of the fuel that has been successful and that is still efficiently and successfully used on the railways system.</P>

I do not want this to develop into a debate on the question of Arigna coal but I think it is only fair to say, in respect of Arigna coal, and Deputy Maguire is aware of this, that two or three State companies are taking much more than 50 per cent. of the entire output of the Arigna coalfield.  Having regard to that, I must say that I cannot understand why it is so difficult to dispose of the balance of that output or why there should be this great volume of unemployment or emigration that we are told about.</P>

I think that that in itself indicates that so far as the State <Col N="567" /> is concerned it has a very definite interest in that coalfield and that it is giving it a very substantial amount of support.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. B. Maguire Mr. B. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be aware,&mdash;if he is not he should be so aware&mdash;that semi-State owned concerns such as the Sugar Company and Córas Iompair Éireann are taking 50 per cent. of the output from Arigna. Nevertheless, it is also true to state that the present output from Arigna is just half what it ordinarily should be. The result is unemployment and a considerable amount of emigration.  Further, is the Minister aware of this rather peculiar position in regard to the consumption of coal from Arigna? The coal mined in Arigna, for the purpose of getting sale with the Sugar Company&mdash;the lump coal; the best quality coal&mdash;is not accepted by the Sugar Company until it has been crushed for steam purposes.  It has to be reduced from the level of first-class lump coal to the level of the least valuable coal, namely, ordinary slack. A deterioration and loss in fuel power is thereby incurred.  The Minister may say that one half of the output is at present being consumed by State-owned concerns.  While that may be true, the amount of the output has been reduced and accordingly unemployment has been increased.  Could the Minister not ensure that the railway authorities will use the best quality of lump coal and leave the increased output of slack coal to be consumed in the sugar factories?  There is definitely a great waste going on under the present arrangements and the Minister need not by any means consider he is discharging his duty in allowing it to continue.  The Minister should reserve this home-produced coal, which is as good as any imported coal, for use on the railways and supply only the inferior quality coal to the factories which could use it economically</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I know, there is no problem of design which prevents the use of Arigna coal in railway locomotives. Before the war, from 1932 onwards, there was an arrangement, into which the railway companies entered under some pressure, though it <Col N="568" /> could be described as a voluntary arrangement, by which both the Great Southern Railways and the Great Northern Railway agreed to take stated quantities of Arigna coal, that is to say, properly screened Arigna coal.  I think that arrangement may have terminated when the sugar factories came into production because there was a time when they were prepared to take all the Arigna coal they could get.  It is true that during the war some small workings were commenced in various parts of County Leitrim in the Arigna coalfield area, and the output of coal increased considerably in tonnage but a lot of the coal produced was of very bad quality. I am sure Deputy Maguire will not deny that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There were similar complaints from other users.  A lot of the workings during these years were improvident and those who undertook them were merely trying to make hay while the sun shone.  There are, however, properly equipped collieries in that area with proper screening of output and they can produce coal which is quite comparable with Welsh steam coal and which can be used by itself or with a mixture in any equipment which can burn Welsh steam coal.  My recollection is that, in the operation of the pre-war arrangement, there was little complaint from any of the railway companies as to the difficulty of using that coal and whatever complaints subsequently emerged were due to the deterioration of quality during the war.  The extent to which it is desirable to exploit the coal reserves in the Arigna area is a matter of policy.  Clearly, in time of war one would develop them more thoroughly and by various methods that would not recommend themselves in normal <Col N="569" /> times.  There has been, as far as I know, 20,000,000 or 30,000,000 tons estimated as available in the whole area all of it capable of economic working.  These narrow seams can be better exploited by the establishment of a few competently managed and properly equipped collieries rather than by a rough and ready extraction of the coal without regard to any long term plan or the amortisation of capital investment.  Let me again remind the Dáil that there was an arrangement which ensured the use and consumption of Arigna coal for railway operation before the war.  It worked successfully and if there is any particular problem in the disposal of Arigna coal now, I am sure a similar arrangement could be worked out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the amendment of Deputy Maguire and the remarks made by Deputy Lemass in connection with it. I handled a considerable amount of Arigna coal during the war and I must say that it was equally as good, if not better than, some of the English coal. It was much better than some of the coal that Córas Iompair Éireann used during the war and is using to-day. We hear a lot of talk about home industry and the necessity of encouraging home production and I see no reason why the Government could not formulate some plan to ensure that a large percentage of Irish coal would be used by native concerns.  I happen to be engaged in the coal trade myself and I can say the coal we have been getting in this country from abroad for a number of years past is anything but Grade 1.  That is even true of the coal that is coming in now, but our hands are tied and we have to take it.  We are dealing with the National Coal Board and they tell us it is Grade 1 coal.  We know very well it is not Grade 1, but rather Grade 4 or Grade 5 coal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would strongly urge that the Government should encourage the use of Irish coal as much as possible on the railways and in our factories.  I have discussed this matter several times with Deputy Maguire and he has assured me it would be a great boon to that district if the use of this coal were encouraged. <Col N="570" /> It is not alone in the coal mines that additional employment could be given but on the railways and in the various factories where it could be used.  This coal, I understand, is quite satisfactory for use in the sugar factories and I fully support the views put forward by Deputy Maguire and Deputy Lemass in regard to this matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="573" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 59 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>My opposition to Section 59 is largely for the purpose of finding the basis of justification for the section as put in.  I am not approaching this matter from the normal standpoint I take in respect of directors.  I always have a certain amount of doubt there that they justify the payment to them of sums of money of from £200 to £800 a year for attending a meeting lasting one or two hours on one or two occasions in a month.  I am leaving that aside altogether.  What I am concerned with is the position of the persons referred to in the section, in the light of statements made in this House. I am not even concerned with the fact that they happen to be directors or in a particular technical position.  I am not one of those who, in the course of a debate, gives a great deal of time to the upbraiding and criticising of the actual members of the board of Córas Iompair Éireann.  That seems to me to be a waste of time when there are much graver problems facing us.</P>
      <P>However, many members of the House, many members of the Government, were very outspoken in their criticism of the board of Córas Iompair Éireann.  I do not think it is unfair to say that the Minister himself took a very critical view, both before and subsequent to taking office as Minister.  We may look upon this group of gentlemen in one or two ways.  We can, on the one hand, follow the line that has been followed on many occasions in this House, of regarding the board of Córas Iompair Éireann as consisting solely of the late chairman and the other directors as merely a collection of automatons or rubber stamps who automatically followed and fell in with the decisions made by the late chairman.  If that is the case, then what is the justification for giving them these sums of money? They will be compensated already as shareholders.  I have not expressed opposition to the compensatory terms of the Bill, because I realise that the general view would be that they are terms that should be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="574" /> Again, the problem of transport is too big to worry unduly over minor details of compensation.  Yet, if we take the view that has been expressed repeatedly in this House by various members of the present Government and by the Minister himself, that here over a long period we were dealing with a group of directors from whom all effective power had been taken because of the constitution of the board and the powers given to the previous chairman by the 1944 Act, how then in heaven's name are we to justify compensating these directors for their loss of office? Are we to compensate them for something that they did not do?  Are we to compensate them for exercising powers they did not possess?  Are we to compensate them for the management and control and direction of policy of a transport undertaking in respect of which they had no power, no responsibility and could not influence policy?  That does not seem to me to be a line of argument that would carry us very far.</P>
    <P>If, on the other hand, we take the view that they have carried out some effective duties, somewhat analogous to the work carried out by directors of other concerns, then we must relate it to the very direct criticism made of their direction and control of the undertaking. Either they had control of the undertaking and they must answer for all the charges made against them, or they had no control and had not, in fact, performed any work for which they should be compensated.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that we have compensated shareholders and that we propose to compensate officers and servants, all the workmen of the two undertakings about to be amalgamated, and that it is only reasonable that we should compensate these directors for their loss of office.  It always surprises me how generous we are prepared to be when we come to deal with directors. In this particular case, I take it that in regard to the director of one dissolved undertaking, the total fee he would be entitled to receive in respect of 1948-49 would be somewhere in the neighbourhood of £800 or £1,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Much more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="575" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I always underestimate, so that I will not be caught out.  Perhaps it is just as well that I do not know how much more.  If we take it as £1,000 or £800 and then come to the case of a person who is a director of both dissolved undertakings, we get a figure of roughly £1,600 or £2,000.  That is the compensation we propose to give to the directors who, according to the report of Sir James Milne, met once a fortnight.  It would be reasonable to assume that they spent three or four hours at their meeting once a fortnight, engaged on the work of the company. They may have had sub-committees of the board which met occasionally in addition to the fortnightly meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go into the other matter set down in the Milne Report, because, apparently, a good deal of it is challenged, as regards the manner in which the business of meetings was conducted.  Let us accept it that they did meet once a fortnight and spent three or four hours at the meeting and conducted their business as an ordinary group of business men.  We are still up against the fact that we now propose to give each of these persons a sum from £1,600 to £2,000 as compensation for loss of office and we propose to give them a lump sum equal to the total amount that it would take an ordinary workman in one of these undertakings four years to earn.  I know quite well that there is a tremendous difference between an ordinary porter, engine cleaner or labourer in the shops or a third hand on a canal boat and a director of Córas Iompair Éireann or the Grand Canal Company. In normal times I would be too modest to challenge the exalted position of such a director but what concerns me at the moment is how all of us who, over a period from 1944, have poured out the vials of our wrath in criticism and condemnation of those charged with the management and control of Córas Iompair Éireann, can now calmly say that we feel that these people, either as automatons under the control of the former chairman or as active directors in charge of the railway company which has been brought to such a state that not merely has the organisation to be put under State control but the whole credit of the <Col N="576" /> State has to be made available in order to save it from complete wreck, are entitled to compensation.  Either as automatons having no responsibility, no control and no active work to perform or as active directors responsible for all that has brought Córas Iompair Éireann into this House again in 1950, after all the mismanagement, lack of policy, lack of co-ordination and lack of view, these directors are to be compensated in these very large sums.  I, frankly, am at a loss to understand the matter and I hope the Minister is in a position to give us information that will justify this particular section.  I cannot reconcile it with what has been stated in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not very often, perhaps, that on a matter like this Deputy Larkin and I would be in agreement but I find it impossible, in conscience, to reconcile a vote for this section with the views that have been expressed as to the manner in which the board of Córas Iompair Éireann carried on their business during the past years.  Although in every winding up of a concern there is a precedent for the payment of compensation to outgoing directors and although the provision is put into this Bill, as it has been put in other Bills because there is such a precedent, nevertheless, we must consider the terms of this Bill, not from the point of view of precedent but from the point of view of the individual case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have also to remember that the board of Córas Iompair Éireann went out of their way last year to enter the arena in regard to the position that existed.  If the board of Córas Iompair Éireann had behaved as an ordinary board should behave, I personally would feel that they had a very much stronger case for the inclusion of this section.  They did not do that.  They deliberately went into the arena.  I must, of course, bow to the Standing Order that prevents me referring to people outside this Chamber.  They cannot be criticised.  Yet, what has been done by people outside the Chamber must be considered in relation to the section that it is proposed to put into the Bill affecting them.  So far as I am concerned.  I take the view <Col N="577" /> that these gentlemen went into the arena and, therefore, it behoves the members of the House to consider their position as directors, who either carried on this undertaking without any effective voice in the concern of Córas Iompair Éireann or, in the alternative, without giving to the transport service the attention that it deserved and that should have been given to it.</P>
    <P>As I have said, it is not very often, perhaps, that on matters like this Deputy Larkin and I would see eye to eye.  There may be some reason for the inclusion of the section that I am not aware of, beyond the fact that it is a precedent, but I do feel that the Minister ought to leave it to the House to decide, on a free vote, if a vote is required, as to whether this section should be included or not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must have figures, and before accepting responsibility for inserting this section, I would like to know approximately what amounts are involved in these payments if the section as it stands is passed.  It is an historical fact&mdash;the Minister, Deputy Lemass and other Deputies know it&mdash;that these directors, strictly speaking, are not railway directors.  These directors are not put there by the votes of the common stockholders.  They are put there by the power held by the banks.  Apart altogether from that, this House, on a recent occasion, passed a Bill to meet £4,000,000 odd accumulated losses caused by the incompetency and inefficiency of the members of the board that we are now proposing to compensate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If they had carried out their duties in a satisfactory way or if they had made an honest attempt to do so, one could understand this kind of proposal, for which there is a precedent.  It is quite correct, as Deputy Sweetman said, that these gentlemen took the arena against the Government, against the will of the people.  At a shareholders' meeting, the chairman nominated by the Government and approved by the members of this House&mdash;and he has the approval of all the members of this House, which is one good thing &mdash;was challenged in the chair by a gentleman who gave himself the title <Col N="578" /> of deputy chairman.  He led the attack on the chair and a certain meeting of shareholders had to be adjourned.  The Minister cannot deny that.  I hope the Minister will give the figures involved in this section, that he will also state whether there is any departmental or legal authority for the position of deputy chairman and that he will indicate the compensation that will be involved in that particular case, apart from the ordinary directors.</P>
    <P>Is it not a fact also&mdash;we have it on record in this House and I know it to be true&mdash;that the men who accepted positions as ordinary members of the board&mdash;as representatives of the common stockholders, as they are described&mdash;were not consulted in regard to many of the major decisions taken by the chairman, under the authority, I admit, conferred on him by Deputy Lemass and his Party in the 1944 Act?  If these men had been really directors, live directors, with any spirit of independence, would they not have challenged that kind of procedure? Had they done so and had they reported that kind of activity to the present Minister or his predecessor, some of the millions which we have had to vote here recently and which will have to be collected from the taxpayers might have been saved.  They simply played the part of &ldquo;yes-men&rdquo; and allowed this great national concern to get into a state of bankruptcy and we are now asked for permission to compensate them for their inefficiency, incompetence and lack of courage. I do not propose to subscribe to that kind of thing and I hope the Minister will not press the amendment.</P>
    <P>In any case, the stockholders' directors, as they are described by Deputy Lemass and others, are&mdash;not all of them&mdash;professional directors.  The majority of them are directors of eight or ten other companies and they are not like the railwayman who will lose his position as a result of redundancy and will get compensation as a result. They have incomes, some of them, amounting to £10,000 a year.  They spend a few hours in Córas Iompair Éireann and then run around to a bank and from the bank to an insurance company.  They have a lot of other <Col N="579" /> pickings and they are not going to starve, if the House requests the Minister to decide that they are not entitled to any compensation for bringing this great national concern into a state of bankruptcy.</P>

      <P>I am loath to intervene in this debate, but I think it would be wrong to let it go out from the House, no matter what our feeling of natural irritation may be, that, because a brochure critical of Government policy was issued by these people, in their capacity as directors of Córas Iompair Éireann, the section, for that reason and that reason alone, should be opposed.  That would not be to the credit of the House, and, if Deputy Sweetman thinks over it, he will agree.</P>

      <P>That is perfectly true.  The question should be examined objectively, and, if we look at it objectively, we will see that there is no debt due from the people of this country to this group of directors.  I do not think it could in any circumstances be put forward that, on sympathetic or humanitarian grounds, any of these gentlemen should occasion us even five seconds' qualms of conscience about opposing this section.  As Deputy Davin very properly pointed out, these directors&mdash;it is unfortunate that it was so and the present position might perhaps not have existed if there had been real directors who would insist on being directors, and, if not allowed so to act, would have resigned&mdash;were there as nominal directors.  Most of them are professional directors and one of them, I understand, is a director of about 16 different concerns.  I do not think the Minister should ask the House to accept this section.  I do not know if he <Col N="580" /> has any very coercive reasons up his sleeve which he is going to trot out for the benefit of Deputies, but they will want to be extremely coercive before he will be successful in convincing some of us that the section should be supported and the amendment rejected. These gentlemen took these positions on the board of Córas Iompair Éireann and I do not think that any one of them, if called upon, would be in a position to make a case to the House as to why the compensation envisaged in the section should be paid to him. I urge the Minister to reconsider his approach to it and to accept Deputy Larkin's amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say very briefly and succinctly what I think about the section.  It is unfortunate that it was ever put in the Bill, because it seems to me rather strange, in the light of the knowledge the House now has of the management of Córas Iompair Éireann, that the question of any compensation to a director should be considered.  I am amazed that the reverse view is not taken and I think that the moneys paid to these gentlemen might well be described as moneys paid to aid and abet them in their bungling and mismanagement. My view of the matter is that this House should not pay any award to directors who may now lose their positions in the light of a record which speaks volumes in the dismal failure of the concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take a slightly different view.  It has been the general principle that, where a person loses his employment because of any change such as this, compensation should be paid, and that principle runs through other sections of the measure.  I want to maintain the principle of compensation, but the compensation paid ought to be reasonable, and, taking into account the history of Córas Iompair Éireann under the management of the directors concerned.  I do not think the treatment afforded to them should be exceptionally generous.  In order, therefore, to maintain the principle set out in the section I would be prepared to support it if the Minister would agree to alter the wording which says that the compensation shall be &ldquo;an amount <Col N="581" /> equivalent to the fees received by him as director for the period 1948 and 1949&rdquo;.  I suggest that the provision be altered to read:  &ldquo;one hundredth part of the fees received by him, such sum not to exceed £10, whichever is the lesser.&rdquo;  In that way, the Minister will maintain his principle and the House will have a method of showing clearly what compensation these gentlemen are entitled to.  It is also possible that some public funds might be utilised for the purpose of presenting to each of them a leather medal.  A toy train set might work more efficiently than some of the trains that they sent out for service during their period of office.  It is ludicrous, in view of what has been said regarding these people, that a substantial sum of money equivalent to £1,000 or £2,000 should be paid to them by a Parliament that has for a long period condemned their management of transport.  If we want to keep the principle in the Bill, let the compensation we fix be a compensation that will show very clearly and very properly the appreciation we have of the services they have rendered to the community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to confess that I have not at the moment any clear view on this section at all.  I appreciate the arguments made by Deputy Larkin, Deputy Sweetman and the other Deputies who spoke in opposition to this section.  I thought that on one of the few occasions on which we do agree, Deputy Cowan was going to make a proposition which was running through my mind.  He rather drifted from it, I think, at the end, but the principle of which he spoke was what occurred to me when some of the other speakers were speaking in opposition to the section.  I think, rightly or wrongly, and in my own opinion rightly, that a precedent has been established where, when people lose positions of profit as distinct from positions of trust or honorary positions, by reason of reorganisation carried out through legislation in this House, it has been customary to compensate them for their probable losses or for their estimated losses.  Consequently, I feel, even though there may be justification&mdash;and I think the Milne Report shows that <Col N="582" /> there is&mdash;for the complaints made by the Minister and by other Deputies on the Government Benches in the past and by the Deputies here this evening that a precedent has been established. Sir James Milne, on page 25 of his report, refers to the conduct of board meetings and the lack of supervision and of a co-ordinated transport plan and I think he attributes a great deal of the ills of the transport system here to that.  I believe, however, that the precedent is correct and that some measure of compensation should be paid to people who lose or may lose positions of profit because of this Bill. We have no way of estimating what their losses may be until the Minister gives us the figures which Deputy Davin asked for earlier this evening. I think it is very necessary that we should know what would be the total of the fees contemplated in subsections (a) and (b) of Section 59.  Although I have criticised Córas Iompair Éireann, the Córas Iompair Éireann Board and their general handling of the transport undertaking of this country and although I will still criticise them, I feel it would be fair to allow some measure of compensation. I cannot pass judgment on the section without knowing the figures which Deputy Davin requested.  I would like to know them and I would like to know whether the Minister would be prepared, if we thought those figures excessive, to reduce the amount and give some fair compensation, compensation which would be adequate in the opinion of the majority of Deputies in this House.</P>
      <P>I should like to call the attention of the speakers who have gone before me to the fact that this section contemplates compensation not only to the Córas Iompair Éireann Board, which is one of the dissolved undertakings, but also to the board of the Grand Canal Company.  I do not know whether Deputies Larkin and Lehane feel that there is any grievance against those directors.  I do not even know who they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point which should be considered by Deputies is whether or not the impact of political events from 1943-44 onwards may not have been to a great extent responsible for the type <Col N="583" /> of management which is complained of, whether or not it was the political policy of the Government then administering the affairs of the country that the administration of Córas Iompair Éireann should have been carried on in the particular way it was carried on and which was adversely commented upon by Sir James Milne.  If Deputies feel that that, in fact, was the position, that it was the wish of the Government then administering affairs that the board should act as they did, then I think it would be unfair to blame the individual directors and any blame to be apportioned must be borne by the Deputies sitting opposite.  These are some matters which I think should be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>We all appreciate the reasons why a number of Deputies on these benches feel that this section should be deleted in its entirety.  First of all the Minister should intervene and give us the facts and the figures.  Secondly, some fair measure of compensation should be arrived at and if the figures supplied by the Minister are too large in the estimation of the Deputies of the House, there should be some machinery to enable them to be reduced.  Conversely, if it should be the case that we believe the figures too small, perhaps there should be some machinery to enable the House to increase them. At any rate, we should get this information and I appeal to the Minister to give it to us at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I have no knowledge of that.  I must confess to the House that this particular section gave me more worry and concern than any other section in the Bill, but I felt that the precedent had been established for me in previous legislation and that there was a principle of compensation for loss of office.  It is true, I think, to say and only fair to say that those people were elected, legitimately elected, and that they were elected as directors of a private company. <Col N="584" /> As the Oireachtas is now engaged in winding up that private company and in taking it over as a State concern, we have, therefore, set out in this Bill in the various sections compensation for everybody who will be adversely affected as a result of the transfer.  I think it is only fair to say that compensation in respect to any employee of this company does not depend on how they performed or did not perform the duties which were allotted to them and which they were paid to carry out.  These were some of the reasons which weighed with me.  The other factor in it&mdash;it has been mentioned by Deputy O'Higgins&mdash;was that there was more than the board of Córas Iompair Éireann to be considered. There was the board of directors of the canal company.</P>

      <P>One, I think.  I take it that, since no Deputy who has spoken so far, has made any adverse comment on the provision which it is proposed to make for the directors of the canal company, they have no objection there.  I confess that it worried me that I could not make a case for compensation for those directors of Córas Iompair Éireann on the work which they performed as directors.  I am not even going to attempt to do it because it would be utterly impossible for me.  Frankly, they had very few duties left to them to perform.  In so far as they had duties to perform, there is no evidence to show that they performed them very effectively or very intelligently in so far as they performed them at all.</P>

      <P>I do not want to go into that.  I have been asked for figures.  I will take the directors of Córas Iompair Éireann first.  The deputy-chairman had fees of £1,500 a year which means that, under the section of the Bill as it stands, he would be entitled to compensation of £3,000. It is only right that I should say this, <Col N="585" /> that I do not know how he, or anybody else, could become deputy-chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann except for the purpose of justifying a fee of £1,500&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because there is no such post as deputy-chairman in the 1944 Act.  Not only that, but it is laid down in that Act that no meeting of the board could be held in the absence of the Chairman, although I do know that meetings were held in the absence of the chairman and were presided over by the deputy-chairman.  How that board came to create the position of deputy-chairman is more than I know because, as I say, no such position is mentioned in the Act under which the board was elected.  It is laid down specifically in the Act that no meeting of the board could be held in the absence of the chairman.  Therefore, you did not want a deputy-chairman. However, the fees were £1,500. There were four other directors, and their fees were £900 each per year. These were the fees for Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Grand Canal Company, the chairman had somewhere about £550, the deputy-chairman approximately £340, and the three remaining directors £275 each. The totals, in one case, are £5,000 odd, and in the other £1,715.  I felt myself more or less coerced into putting this section into the Bill.  It is hard to make a case for it except on the general principle that we are providing compensation for loss of office for all other classes, and that a similar provision was made in previous legislation. We cannot even apply a test as to how they performed their duties because we are not applying it to anybody else.  Whatever about the directors of Córas Iompair Éireann, I do think there is a good case for the directors of the Grand Canal Company. However, in accordance with the line which I have taken since the Committee Stage of the Bill started, I am inclined to leave this to the House. I would like to hear expressions of opinion from all sides of the House on <Col N="586" /> it and let the House determine it.  I felt that I should do that.  The principle is there.  It is a matter for the House to decide.  If there is a question of any contest or vote on it, I am prepared to leave it entirely to a free vote of the House as far as I am concerned.</P>

I am concerned at the attack which has been made on those gentlemen, because it is unfair, and no one knows that better than those who made it.  I have no interest in it.  In case there might be a misunderstanding in the minds of Deputies, let me explain that, when we talk about the directors, they were elected by the stockholders to represent the stockholders' interests.  They were not appointed by the Government or the Dáil to carry out any public policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We will see what they did.  They were elected by the stockholders to represent the stockholders' interests; they were paid what the stockholders decided to pay them and nobody was concerned either with their election or remuneration except the common stockholders whose representatives they were.  In case anyone thinks there is any political consideration in <Col N="587" /> it, let me remind Deputies of the names of those individuals: Mr. W.E. Wylie, K.C.; Mr. J.F. Costello; Mr. C.D. Hewat; Mr. John McCann, not to be confused with Deputy McCann; he is the Chairman of the Grand Canal Company; and Mr. H.B. Pollock.  We are told that these gentlemen as stockholders' directors are responsible for the maladministration of Córas Iompair Éireann.  There was no maladministration of Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They were effective directors of the concern.  Up to the date on which I ceased to have any connection with it, I am not aware that the Chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann on a single occasion used his power to override their decision, to veto their opinion upon any question of policy. They participated in the direction of the concern and were responsible for its success up to the end of 1947.  But, at the end of 1947, the present Minister came into office and from then Córas Iompair Éireann has lost money.  It lost money in 1948 because the Minister for Industry and Commerce, exercising his functions under the Act, refused to give them the right to increase fares to meet the cost of increased wages, refused to allow them to effect any economy whatever, refused to allow them to proceed with any development plan, refused to allow them to effect any change in the organisation of the company during the whole of that year.</P>

      <P>What happened in 1947 was not due to bad administration.  It was due to these abnormal factors. What happened in 1948 was not due to bad administration.  It was due to the deliberate actions of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, whatever his justification for them.  At the end of that year the company showed a loss of £1,250,000.  That was the consequence of the administration of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and for that consequence a scapegoat had to be found.  The scapegoat was the former chairman and there was directed against the former chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann a campaign of personal abuse unprecedented in this or any other country on the part of public representatives against a person holding an office of that kind.  At the end of that campaign of abuse he was removed and a new chairman appointed by this Government came into office and, working with these directors, produced a bigger loss in 1949, and because, through the administration of the Minister for Industry and Commerce under the chairman appointed by him, there was still that bigger loss in 1949, a new scapegoat has to be found and that new scapegoat has been found in the form of the stockholders' directors.  That is what is going on here. Every Deputy opposite knows that that is what is going on.  They are trying to cover up the results of the activities of the Minister for Industry and Commerce by putting the blame on those who were the victims of his administration,  <Col N="589" /> who were held there bound hand and foot by his action.</P>

You can do it if you like; you have the power and the responsibility. We have heard suggestions from the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the Great Northern Railway may be brought into this system.  The Great Northern is just as &ldquo;broke&rdquo; as Córas Iompair Éireann. There has been no campaign against its directors and, presumably, those who are opposing compensation to the directors of Córas Iompair Éireann will oppose equally strongly compensation to the directors of the Great Northern, and that is going to increase their enthusiasm for the idea of amalgamation with Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>

      <P>There are considerations not merely of personal spite to be brought into this argument, but considerations of policy, and these considerations of policy are far more important than the personalities of the directors of Córas Iompair Éireann, far more important than the desire of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his supporters in this House to find some scapegoat for the results of their administration.</P>

      <P>Did not Deputy Davin say here that because of their administration we had to vote £4,000,000 to meet losses in the past year?  It is not true, of course.  They did not lose £4,000,000 last year, but Deputy Davin said that and that was the case made by others.  I do not care whether you give them any compensation or how much.  It is true that in the 1944 Act, <Col N="591" /> when we abolished the Great Southern Railways and the Dublin United Tramways Company and created Córas Iompair Éireann out of the amalgamation of these two undertakings, provision was made for compensation for such of the directors of these concerns as were not elected by the common stockholders to be directors of the new company.  There were some who qualified for compensation under that provision. It was, I think, a reasonable provision to make and I justify it on the ground of reasonableness and also on the ground that it was perhaps desirable to encourage some of the directors of these concerns to retire.  We are dealing here with people who are in no sense our nominees, in no sense responsible to us for their administration. But, so far as they had responsibilities to anybody, presumably they discharged them to the satisfaction of the people concerned, because they were re-elected when they offered themsellves for re-election.</P>

      <P>There would be no compensation.  It is, therefore, a questionable matter whether this is the correct method of determining the compensation to be paid in such cases.

So far as we know the meeting of stockholders in this year might have decided on their own initiative to terminate the appointment of these directors of the concern whose term of office was over.</P>

    <Title>Private Deputies' Business. - Price of Pigs&mdash;Motion.</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that, in order to restore the pig <Col N="592" /> industry, the price paid to the producer should be increased sufficiently to cover the cost of production on home-produced food, and a reasonable profit.&rdquo;&mdash;(Deputy P. O'Reilly.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is an eminently moderate and reasonable one, a motion which one would naturally expect from a Deputy of Deputy O'Reilly's standing.  Deputy O'Reilly has never come into this House to sponsor any wild or extravagant schemes; he has come forward always in a constructive way to put before the House proposals which he considers would be beneficial to the economic life of the country, and particularly to the agricultural industry.</P>
      <P>This motion seeks to preserve that very important industry, the pig producing industry, by assuring the producer some reasonable margin of profit. I advise the Minister to accept this motion.  If he does so, he will be doing a very wise thing.  It does not ask for anything extravagant; it merely asks for an increased price for the producer. That increase is possible without raising the cost of bacon to the consumer. We all know that there is a very wide, an unnecessarily wide, margin between the price that the farmer or the pig producer receives for his pigs and the price that the consumer pays for the bacon.  I think if there was an intensive survey of all the profits that are derived by the various sections of the community who handle pigs from the time they leave the farmer's yard until they cross the retailer's counter, it would be found that there was scope for an economy which could be utilised to increase the price to the producer.</P>
      <P>That is the first piece of advice I want to give the Minister.  I want to give him another piece of advice, and that is that if he intervenes in this debate he should not do as he has so frequently done in other agricultural debates, and that is to drag the level of the debate down to that of a political brawl.  In every Estimate the Minister has introduced, and in almost every debate on agricultural subjects, instead of dealing with matters in a constructive way the Minister has concentrated on turning the whole discussion into a Party political rampage.</P>

      <P>I believe the Minister is worried now that he has not yet dragged this debate down to the same level as he has dragged other debates. He was absent from the House last week and we had a discussion on this subject in a calm and business-like atmosphere.  Deputies from both sides of the House intervened and there was no mud-slinging, to any extent at any rate.  I think it is humiliating for the farming community that in every discussion regarding their industry there is a tendency on the part of the Minister to turn the whole proceedings into a farce.</P>
      <P>Agriculture is a serious business.  It is a very serious business for those engaged in it and for the nation as a whole.  It ought to be debated with a reasonable amount of seriousness and the problems affecting it ought to be dealt with constructively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>For a long time during the inter-war period agriculture was made the cockpit of Party politics. That was a disgusting state of affairs and it was detrimental to the agricultural industry.  During the ten years when he was spokesman of the Opposition, the late Deputy Hughes raised the tone of agricultural debates here to a dignified level, a level they had not reached before and from which they since have descended since he was removed from the House in such unfortunate circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister ought to have the good taste to listen to the sound advice I am giving him, and that is, <Col N="594" /> that he should deal with this problem seriously and in a constructive way. One Deputy, in the course of the debate last week&mdash;I think it was Deputy Browne&mdash;made the point that pig production does not pay and that it never paid.  He suggested that the pig was just the savings bank for the ordinary small farmer and agricultural worker. He seemed to be complacent about that statement and to think that that was a very natural state of affairs, a practice which ought to be preserved. I would not have intervened in the debate if it was not to controvert that view.</P>
    <P>I think the people who engage in pig production are entitled to some remuneration. They should not be regarded as fools who keep pigs merely for the love of doing so or because they regard them as suitable pets about the house.</P>
    <P>At Question Time to-day I asked if there was any recent investigation of costings in the matter of pig production carried out by the Department, or if there were any recent experiments in the feeding of pigs with various food mixtures.  I was anxious to get the results of such experiments because they would be of immense value.  I asked a similar question last year and I was referred by the Minister to volumes issued by the Department of Agriculture.  He gave the numbers of the volumes and I looked them up in the Library and found they were for the year 1939.  Apparently, that was the last experiment which the Department carried out in relation to pig-producing costings, or at least it is the last recorded in the volumes of the Department of Agriculture.  It was the only one mentioned in the agricultural reports.</P>

      <P>The Minister will have an opportunity of speaking and, when he comes to speak, I would like him to give any costing figures he may have at his disposal.  I have been unable to locate any in the official publications of the Department later than 1939.</P>
      <P>The really serious consideration which arises in regard to pig production is the fact that we cannot control the export market.  We have no means of controlling that market except through the medium of trade agreements under which we try to secure for our producers a price guaranteed to cover the cost of production.  In regard to cattle we are, perhaps, in a more advantageous position because our cattle prices are linked to the prices paid to the British producer.  There is no such link in regard to pig prices.  There the price is related to the price of bacon imported into Britain from other countries. Has it ever occurred to the Minister to consult with the other countries who are exporting to Britain?</P>
      <P>For many years the British Government and the British people have played off one exporting nation against the other.  They play off the Danish farmer against the Irish.  They play off the Canadian farmer against both.  Is it wise for exporting nations to go on competing recklessly against each other in order to provide the British with the cheapest possible food?  I do not think that is a policy which should be pursued by this country.  I think we should consult with the Danes in an effort to find out if it is possible to co-operate with them.  The Danes have set an example to the world in regard to cooperation. They may have imitated us in that respect, but they have gone one step further in perfecting their cooperation. Perhaps they could go a little further still and be induced to co-operate with us in order to secure the best possible price for their bacon while, at the same time, enabling us to procure the best possible price for ours.  I do not think that line of approach has ever been considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a tendency to make this a political issue.  There is a tendency to say that the Fianna Fáil Party killed the pig industry and that the present <Col N="596" /> Minister revived it.  Does any one really take that view?  I think Deputy Rooney made that point As everybody knows, the position is that pig production started to increase in 1948 and continued to increase rather rapidly. Everybody knows that from the date on which a farmer decides to go in for increased production until the pig is ready for the factory a period of nearly two years elapses.</P>

      <P>Until the young sow produces her litter there is often a lapse of a period of 12 months.  We know that sows do not come to maturity as young now as they did in former years.  I am giving an average figure.  A further period of six months will elapse before that litter is ready for the market.  Therefore, there is a period of close on two years before there can be any expansion in production as a result of a change of policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and some of the Deputies on the Government Benches have tried to convince us that bonhams can be produced and brought to the stage of being ready for market <Col N="597" /> within a period of two or three months. That is ridiculous.  I do not think anybody could seriously accept that proposition. It must, therefore, be admitted that whatever increase has taken place in pig production is the inevitable result of the return to seminormal conditions, an increase in feeding stuffs and so on.  If Fianna Fáil could have killed the pig industry they would have killed it during the first seven or eight years in which they were in power.  We know that the pig population figure was practically the same in 1930 as it was in 1940.  We know that the figure has remained constant since the middle of the 19th century.  We have always produced in or about 1,000,000 pigs per year.  It was only during the emergency that production declined.  It was inevitable that there would be a substantial increase after the war.  Therefore, let us not make a political issue of it but let us approach it from the point of view of pure economics.  Let us see if we can now ensure that pig production will continue and that those engaged in it will receive a reasonable reward. The old idea of the farmer working for nothing and beggaring himself ought to be killed.  It will not be killed by masking and disguising statistics.  The pig-producing industry cannot be preserved in that way.  I do not know what plans the Minister has for preserving the pig-producing industry and safeguarding the interests of those engaged in it.  He has not given any indication, so far, of any plan.</P>
    <P>There are people outside this House who have studied the theory and practice of farming and who have outlined plans for this industry&mdash;plans which I would regard as being rather sensible. I have read from time to time suggestions made by Dr. Henry Kennedy, one of which was the extensive growing of barley and potatoes as pig-feeding stuffs.  There is a great deal of sound sense in that proposition.  A pig-producing industry based entirely on imported foodstuffs is an insecure industry both for the producer and for the nation and for the bacon factories also.  A pig-producing industry based on the production of a heavy potato variety and a heavy feeding barley is an industry which I think will endure. <Col N="598" /> These foodstuffs, combined with milk, can make a suitable ration for pigs and can be produced on the farm independent of fluctuations that may occur in countries abroad.  It is along these lines, I would be inclined to suggest, that our pig industry should be put so as to give it a sound foundation.</P>
    <P>There is no use in wild extravagant advertisements calling upon farmers to go into pig production.  I remember last year an advertisement which appeared in the public papers and in which we were told about the virtues of the sow pig.  We were told that the sow pig would produce 20 pigs in the year worth £5 each at ten weeks old. That was a definite clear-cut statement made by the Minister in an advertisement which was paid for out of public funds.  We all know that at the present time pig production has increased but the price that the farmer gets for his ten-weeks-old pig is less than half that which the Minister solemnly guaranteed at that time.  I do not know how he will reconcile that guarantee with honesty and truth and fairness towards the citizens of the country.  Surely, if you tell people they will get £5 each for ten-weeks-old pigs and they go into production on the Minister's advice it is a flagrant abuse of office and power to leave them to suffer the loss.  I do not think advertisements should be in that form and I do not think the Minister was wise to have guaranteed £5.</P>

      <P>Surely everything that adds to the cost of pig production must be taken into serious consideration We had a question to-day about the increased price of lime.  I think I showed the Minister that in the county of Carlow the price of lime has been increased.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are to produce barley to feed to pigs we have to utilise lime in heavier quantities than ever in the past.  As I say, we have to take all these factors into consideration.  I do not think the Minister was contributing to an increase in pig production when he increased the price of lime. That adds to the cost of producing barley and, as I have said, barley and potatoes are the basic foods upon which our pig industry should rest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot help wondering if the Minister was wise in sending out of this country 10,000 tons of cheap oats which could have been used to supplement the pig ration.  He told us yesterday, that he proposed to import pollard at a very high price.  Is it sound policy to send oats out of the country at a low price and to bring in pollard at a high price?  The Minister may be able to convince the House that that is sound policy and that it will contribute to an increase in pig production but that is not my opinion.  Let us, therefore, try to divorce this question of pig production from all political animosity and hostility.  Let us face the matter, as reasonable men, on the grounds of pure economics.  I have heard hundreds of farmers saying that they are going to cut down on pig production because there is nothing in it at present prices. That is bad for the country and it is certainly bad for the consumers in the country.  We want to maintain production. It is a difficult problem to maintain production, when you have an exportable surplus, if the market is not as good as you would like it to be.  The committee that was appointed during the war to go into the economics of post-war agricultural policy dealt with this question at considerable length and I think they found it one of the most difficult problems they had to face. Their advice, however, was that at least the price of pigs on the home market&mdash;the price of pigs supplied to Irish factories&mdash;should be maintained at a remunerative level.  Surely that ought to be the aim of the Department of Agriculture and of the Minister for Agriculture?  Surely they ought to strive to ensure that the farmer who <Col N="600" /> goes in for pig production, which is an expensive branch of the agricultural industry, will get a fair reward?</P>
    <P>I should like to see the philosophy that has been evident in this House, to the effect that the farmer is expected to work for nothing and that the pig ought to be a savings bank for him, discarded.  We do not know what the farmer is to save but he is expected to have the pig as a savings bank.  That suggestion ought to be stopped, and I think it ought to be removed from the mind of every Deputy in this House. There ought to be guaranteed to any farmer or any agricultural labourer who goes in for pig production a price that will, at the very least, cover his costs of production.  I believe that the pig-producing industry can be made much more efficient than it is.  I was impressed and I think any farmer would be impressed by the methods adopted in regard to pig production by the Mitchelstown Creamery.  Some aspects of their system of production commend themselves to the farmer, particularly on the scientific side and also in relation to the very desirable type of housing that is provided&mdash;the scientific efforts that are made to preserve the natural heat of the animal so as to reduce feeding costs to the minimum.  As I say, I think that even the smallest farmer would have a good deal to learn from the system of housing and feeding adopted by the creamery. Although that particular creamery caters for over 3,000 pigs there are certain points, for instance in regard to the design of the housing, that could be adopted even by the farmer who is keeping only three or four pigs.</P>
    <P>Then, again the idea of sowing half an acre, an acre, or two acres of potatoes solely for pig feeding, converting them into ensilage and using them in that way has very much to commend it.  I am all for reducing the cost of production to the lowest possible minimum, reducing it by efficient methods of production, and thereby enabling the farmer to sell at a price which will be acceptable to the general community. There is no desire unduly to increase the cost to the consumer if it can be avoided.  I believe, and I think the Minister will agree, that it is possible <Col N="601" /> to give the increase that the farmer desires and requires without increasing the price to the consumer.  If that is done, Deputy O'Reilly and myself will be satisfied, but I think that it is a matter that has got to receive the most thorough-going investigation and consideration.  Nobody will be happier than I if a reasonable solution for the problem can be found.  I think that there has never been a more moderate proposition put before the House. There has never been a proposition which ought to command such universal support.  I am inclined to anticipate that the Minister will accept the motion with enthusiasm and that it will be unanimously adopted by the House.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cogan's anticipations are well-founded. The motion on the Order Paper is reminiscent of the Connecticut parson's sermon, referred to by President Coolidge.  President Coolidge was a taciturn man and when he returned from church he was asked had he enjoyed the sermon.  He said he had.  He was asked what the parson spoke about and he said: &ldquo;Sin&rdquo;.  He was asked what did he say and President Coolidge summarised his sermon by saying: &ldquo;He was agin it&rdquo;.  We are all in favour of the price paid to the producer of pigs being increased sufficiently to cover cost of production of home-produced foods and to give him a reasonable profit.  So far as I am concerned, if anyone wants to challenge a division on that motion, I am for the &ldquo;Tá&rdquo; Lobby hot-foot.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that Deputy Cogan was <i>bona fide</i> in his intervention to-night.  I do not believe that Deputy Cogan would be pleased if he saw the pig industry thrive and prosper, as he said he would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I invite Deputy Cogan to read his own speech and ask himself is his contribution here in any sense indicative of a desire to see that industry thrive and prosper, as he says.  Has he any idea of the injury he does to the industry by echoing the mischievous, the intentionally mischievous, falsehoods invented by the Opposition Party? Deputy Cogan's case here is that Deputy Corry is right in his contention <Col N="602" /> that the price of pigs has been beaten down by the curers without let or hindrance and that the Minister's assurance that he would put forth his best efforts to ensure that producers would get 190/- for pigs of the top grade was not worth the breath that was used to utter it and that therefore, pig producers would be well advised to get out of the business while the going is good. That is the tenor of Deputy Cogan's general approach to this question this evening.  He takes his cue from Deputy Corry.  I wish him well of his commander.</P>
    <P>The best arguments are facts.  The best tests of a policy or an undertaking are results.  Last November it was clear to me that certain curers entertained a hope that they would be allowed to do now what they were encouraged to do under Fianna Fáil, what they were taught to do under Fianna Fáil.  They found they were wrong.  They beat prices down.  I went to a meeting of the Sligo County Committee of Agriculture last November and I warned them in public that they would not be allowed to beat prices down, that I wanted to see the men who were working in the bacon factories employed but that my first duty was to see that the farmers who worked on the farms were not robbed and that I would not allow them to be robbed.  I warned them that I would proceed against them in three separate steps&mdash; that is, that if they continued to depress prices I would permit the export of fat pigs; that if that failed to redress the balance, I would permit the export of store pigs; and if that failed to redress the balance, I would build a factory beside every existing bacon factory.  Now I meant that literally, but they thought I did not.</P>

Now I furnished myself to-day, out of solicitude for the minority representatives in this House, with nothing but quotations from &ldquo;Truth in the News.&rdquo;  In the kept newspaper of the Opposition, on the 20th February, there appears an advertisement <Col N="603" /> under the name of Messrs. O'Mara's, Ltd., for pigs from 1 cwt. 7 lbs. to pigs of 1 cwt. 3 qrs., not 185/-, 190/- but 195/-.  Deputy Cogan says that the price was never lower.  Donnelly's of Dublin quote for pigs from 1 cwt. to 1 cwt. 2 qrs., 192/-. On the 13th we find 190/-, on the 6th February, 190/-.  Now, compare that with the 186/- that they tried to get away with not long ago.</P>
      <P>What is the use of getting for the pig producers the very price offer that they were led to hope to get, if the net result is that Deputies get up in this House and urge the people not to produce pigs because they are not getting 190/-?  Is it malice that makes Deputy Cogan get up here to-day and, with those figures published in the paper, say in public that the pig producers in this country, and particularly in his own area, cannot get 190/- because it is not to be had?  Does he deny that the price of 195/- is offered him for pigs from 1 cwt. 7 lbs, to 1 cwt. 3 qrs. and that 190/- is offered him for pigs weighing from 1 cwt. 3 qrs. 1 lb. to 1 cwt. 3 qrs. 14 lbs?  Does he deny that that is true?  How can he expect me to accept as <i>bona fide</i> his intervention in this debate to-night, when he never once mentioned that, whereas there had been an abuse&mdash;to which I was the first to draw attention at Sligo&mdash;now the abuse has been corrected? Does he attribute it to some passing scarcity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why did not Deputy Cogan tell that story of the price offered him to-day? Why did he use his position in this House to charge me with having failed in my undertaking, when he knew that that was not true?  Does he blame me for suspecting that his contribution to this debate was not <i>bona fide</i>?  The burden of his allegation against me was that I promised the people that I would do my best to see that they got 190/-and that I have failed them.  But he had in his hand the clear and certain evidence that, as a result of the measures taken by me, they were getting not only 190/- but in some cases 5/- a cwt. more.  Why did he conceal that knowledge?  He sits in silence now.  But is it honourable, is it decent, <Col N="604" /> to belie somebody in the hope that they will not have by them the means to confute the falsehood?  I do not think so.  Whatever about honour, whatever about justice, it is time Deputy Cogan learned that it is not discreet.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan returns to the lamentations that the cost of pig production in County Carlow has been raised by a rise in the price of lime.  One would imagine that it was not the Deputy who asked me questions to-day at 3 o'clock about the price of lime.  Five tons of factory lime, brought 15 miles and spread on the Deputy's land, for 12/- a ton.  I would pardonably, I think, ask him did he want it brought to him in a perambulator?  Did he want them to pay him for taking it?</P>

      <P>Deputy Cogan seems to rebuke me for my failure to recommend to the farmers of this country the production of feeding crops from our own soil with which to raise pigs.  Has the Deputy ever heard of Ymer barley? From whom did he hear of it?  Was it the fairies?  The Deputy heard of it from me.  If we have no potatoes, or a grave insufficiency, whose fault is it? The public-spirited Deputy Blaney and his colleagues who went around this country thumping a tub to tell everybody that potatoes were not worth growing.  And they succeeded, to the grave cost of those who listened to them, in discouraging a great many people this year from planting potatoes &mdash;with the result that I have to try to buy potatoes in Amsterdam. Deputy Cogan would rather be seen dead in a field than plant them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cogan to talk to me about oats, Deputy Cogan who deplored that oats worth their weight in gold were exported from this country! Who was it started the oats racket in this country, who was it started the whole racket in getting farmers to sell their oats, despite the advice of the Minister for Agriculture?  Who was it denounced the Minister for Agriculture for speaking at Waterford and warning the people not to sell their oats but to hold them for they would be badly wanted before the end of the year? Who was it summoned a public meeting to start a campaign to ensure that the oats would be taken from the small farmer?&mdash;Deputy Cogan, and he was followed by Deputy Blaney.  Then, from the cavernous recesses of the Fianna Fáil club, the public spirited Deputy Davern took up the echo and a lovely triumvirate they made.  The unfortunate small farmers of this country were persuaded to sell their oats to the Minister for Agriculture, who came into office after 15 years of Fianna Fáil.  There was not enough economic storage in this country to hold half the wheat that was being used in the mills and those oats had to be stored all over the country, transported up and down the country, until there was £2 10s. a ton for them, under Deputy Cogan's beautiful scheme. Then, having saddled the unfortunate Minister for Agriculture with the duty of disposing of these oats, he wants to know, six months after they are sold, &ldquo;Why did you sell the oats?&rdquo;  For brazen-faced audacity, for Deputy Cogan to formulate the word &ldquo;oats&rdquo; in this House, I never met his match.</P>
      <P>I do not deny that he gave me during last year as much persecution as a living man ever had in regard to those oats.  I was grieved to think that small farmers over this country, especially Deputy Blaney's neighbours, were robbed by being induced by somebody in whom they trusted to bring their oats in and sell them, and I knew some of the poor creatures to be going around the following summer with a bag seeking to buy for 24/- a cwt. what they had sold for 16/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not a patient man and I do not pretend to be.  I cannot conceal my <Col N="606" /> contempt for the fraudulent hypocrisy of somebody who has the impudence to agitate in the country, against my strong remonstrance, for the tomfool oats scheme that Deputy Cogan was responsible for and then to come up, 18 months later, to beat his breast, bemoan its consequences and try to blame it on me.  If the Deputy were 45 times Deputy for Wicklow I would not listen to that and I doubt if very many others in this country will listen to it with anything but contemptuous loathing.</P>
    <P>I do not think I would have done my job if I had, without regard to anything else, forced the curers into raising the price of pork to a level that would have resulted in putting a heavy burden on the bacon consumers of this country, because two-thirds of the bacon that is eaten in this country is eaten in the kitchens of Irish farmers.  Now I notice that the public spirited Deputy Corry's heart is bleeding all over the chamber at the price that was charged by the curers to the wholesalers and the retailers.  I do not give two fiddle-de-dees what price the curers charge to the wholesalers and retailers.  They are well able to look after themselves.  I have long been a member of both camps and I do not want Deputy Corry, or I did not, when I was a shopkeeper, want Deputy Corry or anyone else to be bleeding his heart over me.</P>
    <P>My concern was for the retail price, what was it going to cost the man or woman who went in to buy it.  Bacon was sold in Carrickmacross last Christmas at 2/- a lb. and the best of hard, salt, long clear bacon is to be had to-day for 2/6 a lb. in any country shop in Ireland, except where there is a rogue behind the counter.  My advice to any woman is, if she meets a rogue behind the counter, to lift her basket off the counter and start for the door. He will be over the counter to catch her shawl and bring her back.  If we can get good hard, salt, long, clear bacon for the people for 2/6 a lb., taking the whole side, 1/8 for the shoulder, 2/1 for the belly and 2/8 for the back, and at the same time get 190/- to 195/- for the man that sells the pig, is everybody content?  I am, and <Col N="607" /> that is the way I am going to keep. Anyone that does not like that can lump it.  That is a fair price for the producer.  That is a fair price for the consumer on the present basis of costs.</P>
    <P>Deputies will see one of the advertisements that give Deputy Cogan such offence.  Deputy Cogan, deep in his heart, thinks it is a reckless thing to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to anything in black and white.  I do not.  I am happy that the Deputy should have the advertisement avowedly published by the Department of Agriculture under my instruction relating to the profit to be derived from a sow pig 18 months ago.  Is there any Deputy who will deny that the farmer who put in one sow or two sows 18 months ago is better off to-day than he was before he bought the sows?  They paid him well.  The Deputy says that because a cart of bonhams cannot be sold at £5 a piece they are no longer worth £5.  That shows the Deputy's familiarity with the pig business.</P>
    <P>There is nobody in Ireland can make money buying bonhams and keeping them to be fat pigs.  That system means that the man who breeds the bonhams gets the cream and the man who feeds them gets the skim.  The only man who makes money in the pig business in this country is the man who breeds the pig, feeds the pig and fattens the pig.  Anyone who wants to breed bonhams and sell them at ten weeks old, if he can find a &ldquo;gom&rdquo; to buy them, more power to his elbow.  But if he is a farmer and cannot find a &ldquo;gom&rdquo; to buy them, he will bring them home and fatten them himself unless he is too lazy, and then of course he will sell them to anybody who will take them off his hands at any price he can get for them because he does not want to be bothered with them.</P>
    <P>I knew a man once who professed to be poor.  I offered him a pair of bonhams and said he could pay me for the bonhams when he had them fattened. He said it was a very good offer, but he asked: &ldquo;What would I feed them with?&rdquo;&ldquo;Have you nothing at all in your place?&rdquo;  I asked and he replied: &ldquo;Not a thing.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;I <Col N="608" /> will lend you the meal until you have them fattened and you can pay me for the bonhams and the meal.&rdquo;&ldquo;That is a very good offer,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but what will I do if one of them dies on me?&rdquo;  I replied: &ldquo;We will not spoil the ship for a ha'porth of tar.  If either of them dies on you, pay me for the other.&rdquo;&ldquo;That is a great offer, thank you,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;I will think it over.&rdquo;  I never saw hair or hide of him since.  What was wrong with that fellow was that he did not want to have his peace of mind upset and the man who sells his bonhams to-day for £2 or 50/- apiece must be one of the boys who does not like to have his peace of mind upset.</P>
    <P>If there are any farmers in Deputy Cogan's neighbourhood whom he is now discussing with Deputy O'Reilly, I should be very grateful if he would bring them a message from me that if they are selling their bonhams for £2 apiece, the sooner they become cobblers or tailors, the better it will be for themselves and the country.  If that causes the Deputy to raise his eyebrows, he will raise them often.  The curse of this country is the microscopic minority of lazy ne'er-do-wells who encumber some of the small farms of this country, who always have their hand out for something for nothing and who never want to do a day's work, if they can wriggle out of it.  So far as I am concerned, the sooner these boys get out of farming, the better it will be for everybody.  The blessing of this country, however, is, and the last two years have demonstrated this if they have demonstrated nothing else, that the farmers, left alone, are the best people in the world to run the land of Ireland and it is the first time they got a chance to give that demonstration in the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>I said that facts are the best arguments and results the best test of a policy.  Let me give the Deputy and the House a few facts and a few results of the policy which he has been concerned so stridently to condemn.  In 1948, the number of pigs delivered into bacon factories was 238,972 and in 1949, the number was 546,626.  In the month of January, 1948, the number of pigs delivered into factories was 19,851; in 1949, 21,759, and in 1950, <Col N="609" /> when the Deputy's heart is bleeding, 55,984.  I must say that it was only the hardier nails of the Fianna Fáil Party who could muster the brass to intervene in this discussion.  All honour to the tough old roots who faced the music, but the picture of that galére talking about 190/- for pigs as being inadequate reward&mdash;God bless the mark!  In 1939, the price was 73/- per cwt.; in 1940, 93/6; in 1941, 106/-; in 1942, 108/-; and in 1943, 135/-.  Then the bacon went under the counter.  In 1944, it was 165/-; in 1945, 166/-; and in 1947, 179/-.</P>
    <P>Then we had to call out the Guards, when they started setting up bacon factories in the coal cellars.  When I came into office, I found bacon factories in coal cellars.  I found one house and it was like something out of &ldquo;Superman&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Phantom&rdquo;. There was a hidden door and a concealed trap and you fell down about seven feet and discovered a bacon factory in the basement.  There was another gentleman who got wind of the word that we were coming and he cleaned up the whole show, but damned if he could get rid of the salt, so he dug up the garden and laid a nice layer of salt all over it.  He buried the salt, but he could not make it look as if the grass had grown uninterruptedly, and we dug the salt up again.  Talk about Al Capone and the Cicero district of Chicago!  It was trotting after the illegal bacon curers of the City of Dublin, who were flourishing.  There was the greatest possible respect for them in the Dublin market.  They could go in and pay any price you liked to ask for a pig and then they cured it in the most extraordinary places.</P>
    <P>I have told the House about the respectable locales, but some of the stuff we found at the back of Capel Street, not to speak of some of the stuff in yards off Marlborough Street, was cured in conditions and presented an appearance that would stagger the toughest forensic physician who ever examined an exhumed remains.  I disposed, with the help of the much blown upon pigs and bacon marketing organisation and the Garda Síochána, of those warriors and the price went up to 194/-, but it went there largely as a by-product of &ldquo;skull-duggery&rdquo; and as <Col N="610" /> such gave me no satisfaction at all. But in 1949 the average price from the 1st January to the 31st December was 190/3 and we exported surplus bacon to Great Britain for the first time in 14 years.  What was better, we sold bacon to the people at a lower price&mdash; and in any abundance they cared to call for&mdash;than they had seen for certainly ten years before.</P>
    <P>What is the point of using this House for the purpose of proclaiming that the curers and their efforts to exploit the farmers have been allowed to succeed? Why do Deputies do that?  Do they not know that I am as solicitous as they to get a fair price for the farmers? Do they not know that 15 years ago I was fighting in this House to expose what was then the undoubted exploitation of the farmers by the curers?  Do they not know that Fianna Fáil fought hard to cover that up and that repeated exposures from my place on the far side of the House forced the Fianna Fáil Party to set up a commission which effectively revealed the unjust profits to the curers and made known to the people what was then a mystery?  Why should they charge me, in the face of the facts, with having reneged on those principles?  Why should they believe that the Government they are supporting would for one moment tolerate an attempt to exploit the farmers of this country?  I do not know.  I do not think I have ever been inaccessible to any Deputy of this House who wanted to see me on any matter, and I do not see why Deputies should take any pleasure in getting up to level against a Minister of the Government they are supporting charges that are demonstrably untrue.  I do not see what pleasure it gives them to create the impression in this country that they have not access to the Minister to bespeak his activities for the abatement of any abuse which they might know of and which he did not.  Why should they wish to present a picture to the country that the Ministers of this Government are supinely indifferent and have no interest in securing for the farmers justice and fair play unless they are held up to exposure?</P>
    <P>Now I gladly accept Deputy Lehane's <Col N="611" /> offer if he wishes to make it to let his motion for an inquiry into the bacon factories be set afoot.  If he moves that I accept it.  I will put him up and I will ask him to make his first subject of inquiry the Cork Farmers' Abattoir and Clover Meats and Shaw's of Limerick.  I will ask why is it that when I looked confidently to the co-operative factories run by the farmers themselves to hold the line, to back me up, to show that honest prices could be paid, they were the first to beat the prices down.  Why, when I asked them to give me a hand in holding the line, were they the ones who told me they did not agree?</P>

I am glad to remember that with them or without them I was able to smash the ring, but I would have liked to have them on my side and I wonder if a commission sits what verdict it will pass on them.</P>

I think that the facts to which I have directed the attention of the House entitle me to claim that fair-minded Deputies will <Col N="612" /> concede that against considerable difficulty I have restored to the bacon producers of this country that which I think is their due.  I ask the co-operation of those who can help me to see that it is not taken away from them again.  I gladly join with any or all of the Deputies of this House in the pious affirmation that it should be restored to the bacon industry and that a price should be paid to the producer sufficient to cover the cost of production on all home produced food, and a reasonable profit.  So it should always be and so Deputies can be plumb certain it will be for as long as I am Minister for Agriculture and for the length and breadth of that period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is significant that the Minister has ended by reading from the motion which is before the House. May I also read it in my reply.  I see that very little time is left to me.  I did not like to insist on my right to 15 or 20 minutes when the Minister had not completed his statement.  I shall now avail of the opportunity to reply to some of the points that were made in the debate.  I will begin by reading the motion again (motion read).  I wonder is that what was being discussed since this motion was introduced? In my opinion, everything and anything was discussed except the terms of the motion.  We had Deputies speaking about bacon curers' profits, the cost of bacon to the consumer and a variety of other subjects, but we heard very little said about the terms of the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my introductory remarks I said that I was well aware that one could sell pigs at £9 10s. a cwt. if one fed them on imported foods.  I do not think, however, it is possible to do that at present costs of production on the food produced on the farms of Ireland.  All the speakers seemed to avoid that aspect of the question.  They all agreed that £9 10s. is not a paying price.  Deputy Cogan dealt with the point that was made by Deputy Browne that pigs never paid.  Deputy Browne said that &ldquo;it is by the export value of potatoes grown by the farmer that you have to fix the price of pigs to give the producer the production cost&rdquo;.  To <Col N="613" /> my mind what he should have said was that when the producer has no other outlet for his potatoes than to feed them to pigs he has to avail of it, but that it is not a profitable one.  Deputy Browne also spoke about the export value of the market for potatoes which the Minister for Agriculture was able to secure.  The point is that nobody went so far as to say that pigs were a paying proposition except one.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keane said &ldquo;that 190/- a cwt. is a glorious price for pigs and he would like if it could be maintained&rdquo;. He also said that there were other producers of pigs than farmers, that workers and people in the towns &ldquo;who could afford to have a pig house at the back were getting into pigs and were feeding them on the ration and only the ration&rdquo;.  That is what the farmer who is endeavouring to produce food on his farm for the feeding of pigs is faced with&mdash;a ration composed largely of imported maize with a reservation of the pollard of the wheat milled in the country and diverted into compounds.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keane, a Labour Deputy, also said that &ldquo;supply and demand govern every market in the world.&rdquo; Does that mean that, because pigs have become plentiful in Ireland, the price should come down although the farmer is compelled by law to pay a minimum wage of £3 a week to his labourer?  Does it not follow that, when the farmer is compelled to do that, he is entitled to a minimum price for his products so as to enable him to pay that wage?  If he cultivates his land with the aid of family labour is he not entitled to get by way of price for his produce £3 a week for himself and family labour?  If one were to follow Deputy Keane's argument to its logical conclusion, should one not say that the 70,000 unemployed people that we have in the country should be used as a means of lowering the wage paid to every worker?</P>
    <P>The Minister covered a good deal of ground in his speech, but he did not mention what it would take to produce a pig on what is grown on a farm, the very thing with which the motion deals.  In the short time at my disposal I do not intend to follow the <Col N="614" /> Minister in all that he did say.  One thing he said struck me as being rather strange.  He said that unless a farmer was too lazy he should not offer his bonhams at £2 but should feed them into bacon pigs and get £9 10/- a cwt. for them or, as he said £9 15/- at the moment.</P>
    <P>To my mind the Minister must not have much experience in the rearing of bonhams, except perhaps as a hobby. I do not believe he was ever reduced to the necessity of having to stay up at night with a sow farrowing or of giving that constant attention which the rearing of a litter of bonhams demands.  We know all the labour there is in rearing a litter of bonhams until they are eight or ten weeks old.  If the Minister was aware of all that he would not talk about lazy farmers.  If it were not for the small farmers who reared bonhams, we would not have had much bacon in 1946 and 1947.  In view of that, it is not very encouraging that such a remark should be made about them at the present time and I resent it on behalf of the small farmers of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe, but not from necessity as I have to do.  The Minister says that under his policy we now have three pigs for the one we had in 1947.  In that period there was no one fattening pigs except the small farmers who fed them on the potatoes, barley and oats which they produced themselves.  It was their work then which laid the foundation for the building up of the pig population again, but when that happened the price of bonhams came down by half.  We were encouraged to keep two sows instead of one, but the small farmer, the lazy fellow as he is called, now finds that he is selling the litter of two sows and only getting the price of one.  Were the two litters fed on what it took to feed the one before?</P>

      <P>The Minister must be aware that each district has its own type of farming.  Monaghan is noted for flax growing, and other areas for <Col N="615" /> the growing of barley and oats.  The small farmers in particular areas specialise in the production of bonhams. It is their system and it suits them because they have a good deal of family labour.  Even if they had the capital, which they have not, they are not just prepared to feed 40 bonhams into bacon pigs.  In any event they have not the housing to enable them to do so.</P>

      <P>However, I am still satisfied that £9 10s. 0d. per cwt. is not a sufficient price for a farmer to get for producing pigs from the produce of his farm.  On another occasion on an adjournment debate I gave figures of cost of production and figures to show that potatoes were worth only 8d. per stone for feeding pigs.  Any farmer who is prepared to produce potatoes at 8d. per stone to feed to pigs and to sell the pigs for £9 10s. 0d. per cwt. must have better facilities for producing potatoes than I have.  I am sorry that, through my generosity to the Minister, I allowed myself too little time to reply fully to the debate, but I commend the motion to the House and I hope it will be accepted.</P>

      <P>On the motion for the Adjournment, Deputy Cogan gave notice that he would raise the subject matter of Question No. 18 on to-day's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>To-day I asked the Minister if it was proposed to extend the parish plan to all parishes in the Republic of Ireland.  The Minister replied that he intends to put the parish plan into operation in the Co. Longford, Tipperary North, Tipperary South and Westmeath in April next. I am glad that the Minister has tonight introduced a non-Party atmosphere into the discussions here by attacking non-Party Deputies.  I welcome that change of atmosphere and I am glad to avail of it.  The question <Col N="616" /> which I asked the Minister was an important one.  We know that a good deal has been said throughout the country about the parish plan.  It has been explained that that plan entails the appointment of one agricultural instructor to every three parishes, that is to say, we shall have small and I hope compact areas with which one agricultural officer will be able to deal and in which he will be able to keep in closer touch with the farming community than the agricultural officers of the present time who have to roam over the best part of a large county.</P>
      <P>On the whole, agricultural instruction and technical advice to the farming community is desirable and is welcomed by farmers.  I think the young men who will be appointed as agricultural instructors under this scheme will do good work.  But the reply which the Minister gave me to-day leaves room for some misgivings. I am told by the Minister that these officers will be appointed for four counties out of the six.  That could be very easily justified by the Minister's saying that he had not sufficient funds at his disposal to extend the plan to all counties. It could be explained by the Minister's saying that he had not sufficient agricultural instructors to cover all the counties.  But, when I asked the Minister to-day by way of Supplementary Question why these four counties were singled out, his reply was that other counties had not given unqualified approval to the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This raises an important issue.  The Minister in a very polite letter to the secretaries and chairmen of county committees of agriculture asked them for their opinion in regard to this scheme.  That was quite a proper thing to do.  The county committees, as democratic bodies representative of the farming community in the main, gave a careful consideration to the scheme and in due course gave the Minister the benefit of their opinion in regard to it.  Some county committees expressed absolute, unqualified and enthusiastic approval of the scheme as outlined by the Minister.  There were other county committees, however, who while accepting the scheme, offered <Col N="617" /> some constructive suggestions as to how it might be amended or approved. One would have thought that the suggestions received by the Minister from the county committees would have been given careful consideration.</P>
    <P>If the Minister did not think that the suggestions were feasible, he should have written back to these committees expressing his point of view in regard to the scheme.  Instead of that, no reply was received by any committee to the suggestions which they put up to the Minister.  Then the announcement was made that four counties had been selected for demonstration of the scheme and that every county that had put forward constructive suggestions had been put on the long finger.  That is the very negation of democracy.  If county committees have any function at all, it is to cater for the interests of their county and to give advice to the Department of Agriculture and the Minister in regard to what they consider to be the needs of the agricultural industry and as to any scheme which may be put forward.  If we are to have a position in which any committee that goes down on its knees to the Minister and glorifies any suggestion that he puts up is to be given special privileges and favours and any committee which offers a constructive suggestion to the Minister is to be penalised, then democracy in this country is dead.</P>
    <P>This scheme will cost money.  Unlike farmers and farmers' wives who are feeding pigs, these instructors will not work for nothing.  They will require to be paid a salary.  I do not know whether it will be a high salary, but I am sure it will be a decent salary. I think these men will have high qualifications and I believe that they will be excellent officers.  They will have to be paid out of money voted by this House.  Why should the taxpayers of Carlow, Wicklow and any of the other 22 Counties that were turned down in connection with this scheme be denied the services of these officers when they are contributing out of taxation for the payment of these officers?</P>
    <P>Surely, it is the first principle of just government that the benefits of government should be distributed evenly over all sections of the community and over <Col N="618" /> all areas?  I admit that under certain circumstances, such as arose in regard to the land reclamation project, you may be justified in confining the operation of the scheme to a small area because you have not the organisation or the men to carry it out, but in no circumstances can you be justified in denying the benefit of a public scheme to a county simply because its representatives have not given that scheme their unqualified benediction and admiration, but merely offered some suggestions as to how the scheme could be improved.</P>
    <P>I think if the Minister will look up the facts he will find that there was acceptance of the scheme.  I do not exactly know what the position is in regard to Wicklow, as I am not a member of that committee, but so far as Carlow is concerned the committee accepted the scheme and did make suggestions as to how it could be improved. One of the suggestions was that local committees should be appointed to synchronise the activities of the agricultural instructors and another suggestion was that the scheme should be co-ordinated with the present scheme of agricultural instruction and that the county committees should control its administration in their respective counties.</P>
    <P>It does seem to be wrong, and heading towards centralisation, to take control of a matter relating to agriculture out of the hands of the local agricultural committees.  However, the Minister may justify that on the grounds that the entire cost of the scheme will be paid out of a central fund, out of general taxation.  He may justify it on that grounds, but on whatever grounds he may justify the present scheme&mdash;and he is quite entitled to justify it&mdash;he cannot justify penalising any county because the committee in that county may have expressed their own independent views in regard to the matter and may have dared to make suggestions.  There are countries in Eastern Europe, I know, where it is regarded as a criminal offence to dare to make a suggestion to a Minister.  Is our Minister for Agriculture going to introduce, gently but firmly, the same system in this country?  I do not know.</P>
    <P>I hope he will reconsider this whole <Col N="619" /> matter in the light of the points I have put before him and extend the scheme. There may be some county committees which have refused to work the scheme, but if there are Carlow is not one of them and Wicklow is not one of them.  I believe that in so far as it is necessary for the Minister to have co-operation from county committees there will be very few such committees refusing to co-operate and even in these counties the only extent to which I think co-operation would be required would be the lending of agricultural instructors by the committees concerned to the Department.  If any county refuses to lend them, the Minister may act as he thinks fit, but certainly Wicklow and Carlow did not so refuse.  They did make certain constructive suggestions which the Minister could accept or reject at his discretion and which they would have been quite willing to discuss with the Minister if he so desired.  But the Minister had no right whatever to penalise these counties for making suggestions.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask him why he refused to discuss agricultural policy with the county committee of agriculture in County Carlow.  He has been invited there for a long time, but so far he has declined to honour us with a visit.  We would have been quite happy to discuss this project with him in a most amiable way if he honoured us with a visit, but the Minister has acted in a high-handed and dictatorial manner in this matter; he has acted in a way which, I think, tends to reduce democratic government to a farce.  If county committees are to be ignored, trampled upon, penalised for expressing their opinions, we cannot have democratic government in this country and I am sure the Minister would be very slow to have that condition of affairs arising.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Years of experience of public life teach one to suppress one's feelings on suitable occasions.  I wrote a letter to all the agricultural committees outlining a scheme for reorganising what are popularly called extension services.  The last paragraph of that letter read:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="620" />&ldquo;I cannot too strongly emphasise that this letter is not a demand, nor is it an announcement of a change of policy.  It is a <i>bona fide</i> request to your committee for the benefit of their advice on the merits of the proposal and any decision on this matter will be taken in the light of that advice.  It is in order to have the help of that advice that I venture to trouble you with this communication.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>After a lengthy discussion it was decided to postpone the matter until the Minister's letter, which was addressed to Mr. John P. Nolan, Chairman, should be copied and a copy put into the hands of every member of the committee so that they might consider it at leisure.  The committee met on 14th April and, after a discussion on the various points mentioned in the letter, Mr. Burgess proposed and Mr. Brennan seconded:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That this committee agrees, in principle, with the views of the Minister for Agriculture for organising agricultural instruction on a parish basis, but would strongly advise against interference with existing county administrative units &mdash;each county should be dealt with as a unit and areas equivalent in size to the proposed three parishes defined within its boundaries.  We also advise that administration of the scheme of instruction in agriculture should remain the function of the county committee of agriculture as we do not favour centralisation, which appears to be the intention if the Department is to administer instruction in agriculture for the whole country from Dublin.  In view of the suggestion in the letter that after the proposed reorganisation, instructors in agriculture will be described as &lsquo;parish agents&rsquo;, we advise the Minister against the use of the description &lsquo;agents&rsquo; and see no good reason for departure from use of the term &lsquo;instructors&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, I had not the slightest quarrel with County Carlow for holding its own view.  I was most obliged to them for writing me freely and frankly their view.  I noted that they took each proposal <Col N="621" /> in the scheme I submitted to them, rejected it and explained the reason why.  I wanted their view.  I had asked them to speak out frankly and not to think that I would take the slightest offence; and, when I got their judgement, I accepted it in respect of the area represented by the members present at the meeting of the Carlow County Committee of Agriculture.  Is that authoritarian?  I did not want to trespass on any area where a county committee had charged itself with responsibility for instruction in the sphere of agriculture.  I did not want any committee to feel that this was an ultimatum to them to stand aside while I took over, irrespective of whether or not they wanted that.  I wanted them to understand that if they would prefer to operate their own agricultural extension services, according to their own plan, they were not to have the slightest hesitation in saying so.</P>
    <P>But the proceedings did not end at Mr. Burgess's proposal.  Mr. Lennon then took the field.  He said he wanted to oppose.  He said that the Minister's ideas about intensive instruction in agriculture were obviously of United States of America inspiration and warned that even the United States of America department of agriculture admits that soil fertility there is decreasing at an alarming rate.  He then quoted extensively from <i>Rerum Novarum.</i>  He went to the source. <i>Quadragesimo Anno</i> was not enough, so he went back to 1891.  &ldquo;On the toil of the working man nations grow rich,&rdquo; said Mr. Lennon, &ldquo;notwithstanding which our Minister for Agriculture expects to make our nation grow rich by appointing more &lsquo;black-coated agents,&rsquo; and encouraging the toiler to emigrate.&rdquo;  Having read my letter carefully, Mr. Lennon said he was convinced of the impossibility of its application in practice and proposed, as an amendment, a direct negative to the proposition of Mr. Burgess.</P>
    <P>Mr. Nolan then took the field and energetically seconded Mr. Lennon. But they could only muster Mr. Hogan to their support.  Faithful to the principles of <i>Rerum Novarum, Quadra-gesimo Anno</i> and Holy Mother Church, they struck their blow, like Horatio of <Col N="622" /> old and his two companions defending the Citadel of Truth.  What with the terms of the resolution, which did not cause me the slightest annoyance, which I fully appreciated and with which I had no quarrel or complaint, and the bellicose sallies of Mr. Lennon, Mr. Nolan and Mr. Hogan I came to the conclusion&mdash;and I think it was a justifiable one&mdash;that the triumvirate and, indeed, the majority of the council, would object to my proposal and would prefer to run their own show.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Was not the resolution carried?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The resolution was carried agreeing in principle.  But, having agreed in principle, they then proceeded to disagree with every particular. Now, I am not quarrelling with that.  I asked them for their view. I was grateful to them for taking the trouble of going through my scheme and rejecting every proposal contained in it.  They agreed in principle, but then proposition 1 was written down; proposition 2 was written down; proposition 3 was written down and proposition 4 was written down.  I am very grateful to them for taking the trouble of studying the scheme so carefully and condemning it and rejecting it so categorically.  My only reluctance to establish the parish scheme in every county in the country is the reluctance to trespass where I am not wanted.  I do not want the Carlow County Committee of Agriculture to feel for one moment that if, to-morrow or the next day, on seeing the plan in operation they wanted to change their mind and say: &ldquo;On seeing it in operation, we will try another&rdquo; they may fear from the Department or from me, if I am Minister, the slightest irritation or reluctance to offer them the best co-operation we can offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But this is a parish plan.  It is not a county plan.  The very heart and essence of this scheme of extension services is the parish.  I can understand if certain administrative counties cannot see why importance should be attached to that aspect of the plan. I have no quarrel if they say they prefer the geographical unit.  This is <Col N="623" /> a free country.  They have a perfect right to what they like.  I prefer the parish; and it is either going to be a parish scheme or it will not be a scheme I sponsor.  There is nothing to stop the county committee of agriculture dividing up County Carlow into areas equivalent in size to the proposed three parishes defined within its boundaries. Why cannot the county committee of agriculture do that themselves? Any help we can give them will be given to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason that prompted the Carlow County Committee to find difficulty in regard to the parish plan was the fact that the boundaries of the parishes run into two or three counties.  That did present a difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The county committee might leave me to carry out my own plan and I would get over that.  If the county committee does not like that, there is no reason why they should not divide Carlow up into the parishes they prefer and thus operate more comprehensive extension services than they have at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister provide the funds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On any terms on which I can be of assistance within the law I shall help.  If the county committee of Carlow changes its mind, I shall welcome their proposal.  That goes for any county in the country.  In so far as they were kind enough to give consideration to my letter, and a courteous dissentient reply, I am much beholden to them.  I appreciate it and I do not in the least resent the difference of opinion they have expressed.  I would be glad to see Carlow the fifth county adopting this plan.  I would be gratified by that signal mark of their confidence.  But they must rest assured that, if they are not prepared to accept the plan or express their confidence, this Minister for Agriculture still regards himself as their servant to command so long as he is fool enough to take the beggarly £1,525 which is the miserly salary doled out to Ministers of this country by the people of the country.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, 23rd February, 1950.</P>
