      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a point in connection with something that occurred during the debate on the Department of Justice.  I was speaking about a case that I said was not <i>sub judice</i> and the Minister said it was and that he would make me prove it was not.  Another Deputy said it was not <i>sub judice.</i>  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle ruled the matter out of order on a statement of Deputy T. F. O'Higgins that <i>certiorari</i> proceedings might be taken.  The fact is that the Minister for Justice never entertains any matter that may come before the courts.  In his closing speech last night the Minister intimated that there was a petition before him in connection with this case, which means that it was completely out of the hands of the court, otherwise the Minister would not interfere.  Therefore, I say that the Chair has been misled and I have been misrepresented <Col N="1390" /> by the action of Deputy O'Higgins.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation. I was informed that <i>certiorari</i> proceedings might be taken.  I was not interested in that.  I tried to get that in several times last evening.  I accepted a petition in the normal way.  Certain facts were brought to my notice which I acted upon and I said that last night. It did not matter to me about other proceedings.  So far as the law is concerned, an appeal from the District Court finishes in the Circuit Court. There is no further appeal.  There were a whole lot of points raised about warrants and I was not interested in that. I exercised the responsibility of the prerogative of mercy in the ordinary way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>The main point I want to make is to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance on the Estimate for the Office of Public Works this year.  It has been decided to spend a very large amount of money on the erection, reconstruction, repair and overhaul of primary schools.  Everybody knows, particularly school managers, the parents and children, that for a long period of years the primary schools have slowly but surely deteriorated. We have been faced with the problem for a considerable time of a large number of our primary schools in very bad condition.  The fact that proposed expenditure on these schools has almost doubled within the last few years is definite evidence of the interest that is now being taken in that section of the work under the jurisdiction of the Parliamentary Secretary.  The proposed expenditure will be welcomed and should be welcomed by all, particularly by those Deputies who, time and time again, have questioned and badgered in an effort to get something done to put the existing buildings into a proper state of repair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A considerable amount of money will be spent on drainage and under various other headings in the Estimate. I see no reason why anybody should <Col N="1393" /> complain or why there should be any criticism on this Estimate.  Anybody who has the interests of our schools and the drainage of the country at heart must now be convinced that a definite effort is being made to do as much good work as possible as quickly as possible.  I do not know what the intentions are with regard to the purchase of more machinery.  I understand efforts are being made to get drainage machinery, heavy excavators and so on, in Great Britain, the United States of America and elsewhere.  I hope that that effort will continue and that it will be possible at some stage to have as many arterial drainage schemes as possible handled simultaneously.</P>
    <P>I am glad that more engineering staff has been recruited over the past few months.  The main purpose of that staff will be to carry out the surveys and draw up the plans for arterial drainage.  Because of these surveys and because of having a definite programme mapped out it will no longer be necessary to continue straight from the outfall of the river; instead of having to do that the work can now be carried on three, four or five miles along the river since all the plans and lay-out will be in the hands of the engineer in charge.</P>
    <P>While other Departments of State must evoke a certain amount of criticism both from Opposition Deputies and Government supporters alike, this Estimate in its present form should call for very little criticism.  As far as I am concerned I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that I have every confidence in him and in the way he is continuing the work of his particular office.  I am sure that while he is in charge the good work will go ahead and satisfaction will be given everywhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Being a member of the Parliamentary Secretary's own Party it is only natural perhaps that Deputy Commons should be somewhat lavish in his congratulations to the Parliamentary Secretary for the way in which he is going ahead with arterial drainage. Last night Deputy Commons referred to the fact that the Fianna <Col N="1394" /> Fáil Party had nothing but plans and schemes ready.  We must remember in this connection that when the Arterial Drainage Act was passed by the Fianna Fáil Government we were passing through an emergency and the machinery that is so readily available to-day could not be procured during those years.  The preliminary work was done.  The surveys were made and the plans were drawn up so that when the emergency conditions disappeared the Government would be in a position to implement the plans and schemes already made.  The present Government is now in a position to get the machinery and the present Government is now implementing the plans and schemes that were drawn up by the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Commons that the West of Ireland is very far down in the priority list as far as drainage is concerned.  Dates have been mentioned as far away as 1951.  There seems to be no hope of the Corrib or the Suck being done between now and 1951.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary, when he is replying, to give us some little hope that the drainage of both the Corrib and the Suck will be carried out in the near future.</P>
      <P>There is one bit of work done under this Estimate of which we are all aware coming into Leinster House.  I refer to the structure between the entrance gate and the door of Leinster House.  It was originally intended that we should have more parking space.  As far as one can judge, the present architectural monstrosity is a much bigger obstruction than the obstruction that was there before.  I do not know how one would describe this piece of work; some people call it a walk.  In my opinion, it is dangerous, because one has to mount three steps at one end and descend four steps at the other.  I consider the money spent on it was waste of public money.  That money could have been put to a much more useful purpose in relation to roads or drainage in my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another work to which I would also like to refer; that is, the cenotaph on Leinster Lawn.  I think it is proposed to expend something in the region of £30,000 to £35,000 on that <Col N="1395" /> It seems rather extraordinary that the proposed memorial to the men who gave their lives for the Republic should be put to one side by this same Office of Public Works.  It was the Fianna Fáil Government who planned that particular memorial.  Now, the Parliamentary Secretary, in collusion with the Minister for Finance and on the recommendation of the Clann na Poblachta Minister for Health, has decided to postpone that particular memorial.  As a Galway man, I think the Parliamentary Secretary should have exerted his influence and not have allowed Fine Gael to get away with everything.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>It was definitely decided by the members of the previous Government to go ahead with the Garden of Remembrance, and if they were in power to-day the work would be proceeding at the moment.  But now it is being postponed.  We know the excuse that is given, but it is only an excuse.  Of course, we all realise that when the Parliamentary Secretary was in Donegal at the by-election, he shook hands with the Minister for Defence and said: &ldquo;There is nothing now between me and Fine Gael.&rdquo;  It is no wonder, therefore, that he is conniving with them in putting up a memorial to their leaders and that he is forgetting the men who died for the Republic.  As a Galway Deputy, I wish to register my protest against that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to Deputy Kitt speak on this structure that is outside the front of Leinster House.  I agree with him that it is not a very inspiring construction.  It is not a work of art, anyway.  I think his argument in favour of changing it is very weak when he states that it is a danger because there are three steps up on one side and three steps down on the other side.  We all know that Fianna Fáil are tired now, and so I suppose it is hard to expect them to climb up the three steps on one side and climb down the three steps on the other side.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the drive that he has put into his work with regard to arterial drainage.  I do not intend to speak on this from the political angle at all. Evidently the Parliamentary Secretary has been working very hard in his Department because the fruits of his work are there to be seen.  I should like, however, to draw his attention to the priority list with regard to arterial drainage.  I understand it was made out before he came into office.  I could never find on what basis that priority list was prepared, but whatever the basis, I must say that the West of Ireland was sadly neglected when it was being prepared.  I was glad to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary that the Corrib is to be tackled in the near future.  Surely there was never any excuse for putting it in a low place on the priority list.  In my opinion, it should have been at the very top.  If the idea was to do drainage in this country on the basis that the good land must be drained first, then I certainly do not agree with that at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My opinion is that arterial drainage should be tackled first with regard to the number of people whose livelihood was affected by drainage.  If, for example, we take the West of Ireland, we have more people there to the <Col N="1397" /> square mile who are affected by flooding than we have in any other part of the country.  May I give the Parliamentary Secretary one example?  He knows the River Suck, the length of which is only 96 miles&mdash;that is the main river. The tributaries which flow into it extend to 89 miles.  There are 10,700 people affected in that area by the flooding.  I am bringing the human element into this because I am afraid the human element was not considered when this priority list was being prepared. In my opinion, the West of Ireland was neglected in the past. There is the greatest amount of emigration from that part of the country, and if we are going to be serious in tackling the question of emigration, I do not see why the West of Ireland would not get preference, so far as the priority list for drainage is concerned, in order that the holdings from which those people have to emigrate might be improved.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if there is any hold up with regard to the number of engineers available for the work.  I am not too confident that the scheme for the preparation of work on the Corrib is being carried through as fast as it might be or could be.  I should like, therefore, to know from the Parliamentary Secretary whether there is any hold up as regards the availability of suitable engineers for that work.</P>
    <P>I hope that when the Corrib is being done the Parliamentary Secretary will carry out his promise that the River Suck will not be forgotten and that the machinery will not be removed from the West of Ireland before the River Suck is tackled. There is, however, something that could be done in the meantime with regard to the flooding of the area affected by the River Suck.  I asked a question recently in the Dáil in connection with the sluice gates in Ballinasloe.  The reply I got from the Parliamentary Secretary was to the effect that he had no authority whatever with regard to the opening or closing of these sluice gates.  He agreed with me that it was a disgrace that these sluice gates were not now permanently kept open in view of the fact that the mill affected had been <Col N="1398" /> closed or burned down since 1944. The Parliamentary Secretary informed me that that was a matter for the local drainage authority.  I got in touch with those people and was informed that they considered that if these sluice gates were kept open continuously it would have a serious effect on the operation of the waterworks at Ballinasloe.  That, of course, is true, but if we consider it in this light, that the water has to be kept at a certain level in Ballinasloe in order to keep the waterworks in a suitable condition, that means that the people for miles up the River Suck will suffer from the flooding of their land. That is to say, they will have to suffer the results of the flooding in order to facilitate the people of Ballinasloe.  I do not want to see any hardship imposed on the people in Ballinasloe, but I certainly do not want to see any hardship imposed either on the people who live on the banks of the River Suck.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to have this matter thoroughly investigated.</P>
    <P>The local engineer in South Roscommon interviewed the town clerk in Ballinasloe.  He put up the suggestion to him and to the urban council there that, if they considered lowering the intake at the waterworks, it would solve the whole problem.  So far, nothing has been done, and the flooding still goes on in the area of the River Suck.  I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to try to have these sluice gates kept open continuously until such time as the arterial drainage works are put into operation in the locality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want, first of all, to draw attention to the different form in which sub-head B. for new works is given to us in the Book of Estimates this year.  Heretofore, we always got details of the various works on which money was to be spent.  This time, we have only a total under the heading of each Department.  We have no information in the Book of Estimates this year as to the individual works which are to be undertaken.  I think that we are entitled to have that information. No explanation has been given as to why it has been cut out <Col N="1399" /> this year.  One can only conclude that it is an attempt to stifle criticism.  As a consequence, I, at any rate, am in the position that I do not know whether the £10 of a token Vote for the Garden of Remembrance is still included or not.  The Parliamentary Secretary assured me last year that it was only deferred.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Garden of Remembrance is merely deferred.  I do not believe that there is even the remotest possibility of its being completely abandoned.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The reference is column 1095, Volume 116.  So far as one can see the scheme is abandoned.</P>

      <P>We are not given any information, even as to whether the £10 is continued.  We have been given no information as to what the Government proposes to do in relation to that scheme.  We were told previously that they objected to the site.  They have certainly taken it over for other purposes but we have no information as to what they mean to do.  We have no such hesitation about the cenotaph on Leinster Lawn. In spite of what the Parliamentary Secretary says, I am personally satisfied that it is not intended to go forward with the project for the Garden of Remembrance.  There is no evidence of it.  All the evidence is to the contrary.</P>

      <P>We have been told during the year, in reply to various questions, that the site for the Garden of Remembrance was required for the infant clinics.  We on these benches do not object to infant clinics.  We started a scheme for infant clinics and this Government has done nothing in that regard except to carry on from where we left off.  It has surely come to a pretty pass if we have to hide behind infants' swaddling clothes to protect ourselves when we are trying to let down the memory of the 1916 men, because that is what it amounts to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, there has been no hesitation about the memorial on Leinster Lawn to the founders of a partitioned State while the memorial to the real founders of the State, the 1916 men, about whom there should be no question whatever, has been deferred, to use the Parliamentary Secretary's expression.  He has not told us for how long we shall have to wait.  Maybe if we all live long enough, we may see something erected to the memory of the 1916 men, but I am doubtful if we shall because the Government's action in this matter is quite in keeping with their whole attitude to the I.R.A. in every way.  They are the only men who are being sacked; they are the only men whose pensions have not been increased and the general <Col N="1401" /> policy of the Government is quite in keeping with that.  The erection of the cenotaph is going ahead.  Immediately the Government took office they saw to that.  In fact it looks like a deliberate attempt to try to recreate the whole civil war spirit.  At the same time, they abandoned the Garden of Remembrance. What else is one to think except that that is their intention?  I hope they do not succeed in their efforts, but it looks as if they are trying to do that.</P>

      <P>It looks very bad from people who protested to be staunch republicans that immediately they came into office they proceeded with the erection of the cenotaph to the founders of a partitioned State and dropped the memorial to the 1916 men.  Let the people who call themselves republicans satisfy their consciences on that matter but that, in fact, is what is happening. I think the whole position is most unworthy and discloses a partisan attitude. It is something which a little sane thinking, if they were not blinded by political prejudice, would not have allowed to happen.  I hope it is not too late yet for a reconsideration of the whole question by the Government.  I hope that they will try to look at it in the way I have just put it, that they are recreating the civil war spirit, and it is having that effect.  It is high time their decision was reconsidered.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowan made a remark some time ago that the erection of the cenotaph on Leinster Lawn was the result of a decision by the Fianna Fáil Government.  So far as I am aware, all the Fianna Fáil Government undertook to do was to replace the previous temporary memorial which had to be taken down as dangerous and which was put up by the former Government. They did not undertake to build the elaborate monument such as that which is being put up at the moment.  I want to correct the belief which apparently Deputy Cowan holds about that matter.  I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will take some steps along the lines I have suggested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>To me it seems rather ridiculous and entirely out of place for Deputy Colley to mix up republicanism. Partition and the civil war spirit with the Estimate we are considering this morning.  So far as the Garden of Remembrance, the cenotaph and all these other memorials are concerned, I think the greatest memorial we can erect in remembrance of those who laid the foundations of the State is to see that the people of this country will have drainage, good schools, good roads to their houses and all the other facilities that would properly come under an Estimate such as this.  As the Parliamentary Secretary has stated on various occasions that the scheme for the Garden of Remembrance will be carried out at a certain stage, I fail to see why Deputies opposite should be harping so much on that question.  It is gratifying to see that so much extra money is being voted for the erection of new schools and the repair of existing schools which are in a bad condition.  It is also gratifying to see that so much extra money is being voted for drainage.</P>
      <P>There is one matter that I wish to bring to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary.  While the Deputies for North Kerry will no doubt look after the drainage of the Brick and Cashen, I am interested in the matter in this way, that as soon as the drainage has been carried out there I should like to see the machinery brought to South Kerry to carry out the drainage of the River Maine.  In fact, while the work is being carried out in the Brick and Cashen area, I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will see that a full survey is made of the River Maine so that work can commence there immediately the machinery is available.  I think that on that matter we are very fair.  We are giving preference to North Kerry because we feel it is more necessary, although, indeed, some of the finest land in the county is being continually flooded for want of the drainage of the Maine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will say that the Parliamentary Secretary and the officials of his Department&mdash;and it is a very important Department&mdash;have always been anxious to do their best to carry out <Col N="1403" /> the various schemes put before them and that at all times the Parliamentary Secretary's officials have been courteous to those who made representations to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel rather disappointed at the way the Parliamentary Secretary presented his Estimate.  He was not, in my opinion, by any means as elaborate as he might be.  He just gave us a list of figures and we were as wise when we read the Book of Estimates as we were having listened to his opening statement. Deputy Commons mentioned that he could not understand why Deputy O'Grady should be critical and dissatisfied about the rate of progress; but as far as this side of the House is concerned, I think that we have had fairly good reason to be dissatisfied in view of all the great promises that were made particularly regarding arterial drainage, by members of the Coalition in this House and outside it for a number of years.</P>
      <P>Experience, of course, is a great tutor; all the difficulties are seen now and it is found that it is not so easy after all to get on with this arterial drainage business as the people were led to believe.  I understand that the preliminary work on the Brosna scheme commenced in 1942 and that it was six years before it could be started.  The Glyde and Dee was started a few years later and it was only a few weeks ago that the actual work was begun.  These schemes were in preparation for a number of years and it took a long time to prepare them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as drainage is concerned, everybody seems to talk for his own area, but there is one river in this country which is the basin of Ireland, if I might say so, and that is the Shannon, and I have not heard any mention of it in the Parliamentary Secretary's opening statement; neither have I heard any mention of it this year from Deputy McQuillan, although last year and the year before he was very vocal regarding the hardships that resulted from the overflow of that river.  With regard to the greater part of the country I represent, and also, <Col N="1404" /> I believe, to the eastern side of the Shannon, unless something is done I feel that the arterial drainage of certain rivers leading into it will be, to a certain extent, wasteful expenditure. The Parliamentary Secretary may say to me that the Brosna scheme is being carried out and that it is not doing any harm, but I know people from the Shannon's flooded areas from Athlone to Meelick who tell me that if there had been as great rainfall during the past two years as in previous years their position would be far worse as a result of the drainage of the Brosna.  Nothing has been done to ease that except, perhaps, that some instructions were given regarding the sluices at Meelick, but there again I understand that enough has not been done.  Anyway, this seems to be a very difficult scheme.</P>
    <P>The drainage commission recommended some sort of partial drainage scheme, but seemingly the Board of Works are very reluctant to undertake even that.  It is about time to be frank with the country and with the people who are living alongside the Shannon and who are suffering injury year in, year out and tell them whether it is proposed to do anything at all with the Shannon or if it is ever going to be done and if it is not, in what way they are to be recompensed for the losses they are undoubtedly suffering and must continue to suffer.</P>
    <P>In addition, I would like to know all about this priority list which must have been made out over a number of years. I should like to know if it was and if there is any change in it.  In his concluding statement I think that the Parliamentary Secretary should inform this House of the number of arterial drainage areas in the country in which it is proposed to carry out drainage, their order on the priority list and the approximate time when survey work would be likely to take place.  If he does, I think it will save him a good deal of the trouble of having to meet deputations from the country or of being called to meet them in their own locality, to tell them why this or that river has not been tackled.  I think that a clear statement on that at the present time is very necessary.</P>
    <P>The Suck was mentioned and, of <Col N="1405" /> course, that too is a river that requires attention.  It is a very difficult river to drain, because it is very sluggish and in my opinion it is almost flowing against the hill.  We have other rivers in Connaught, the Moy, the Dunkellin river that the Parliamentary Secretary knows sufficiently about, the Killimor river and a number of other smaller rivers.  I think a statement should be made about all these and, in fact, about all the rivers in the whole State.</P>
    <P>I see in the Book of Estimates that 11 extra officers have come to the Department during the past year at an extra cost of £19,483.  That is not a very big increase, but when we come to the arterial drainage section we find only the same number of engineers as last year.  Of course, we have four more engineers in that we had three engineers of grade 1, four engineers of grade 2, and 12 engineers of grade 3 last year, with four temporary junior assistant engineers, while this year we have 16 engineers of grade 3 and I presume that the four temporary junior assistant engineers were promoted to the rank of grade 3 during the past year.  That is no great indication that there is going to be a great speeding up of any of this survey work we hear so much about and all this preparation of plans.  It is quite easy to come in here with an Estimate for the amount of money which it is proposed to spend, but perhaps at the end of the year we will find that a very considerable portion of it has not been spent at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is easy to get 45 applications, but engineers for drainage are in a different category from <Col N="1406" /> engineers for roads or housing, and I should like to know if any attempt has been made to get, if you like, experts &mdash;expert architects or engineers, if I might so describe them&mdash;who were engaged on any of the big drainage problems or undertakings carried out throughout Europe.  It would be very useful, if we could engage some such people, because there is a feeling in the country that our whole approach to this drainage problem is somewhat antiquated and that the work could be carried out on more modern and scientific lines.  I do not know whether that is true or not, as I am not an authority, but such statements have been made to me.  I have also been informed that the River Shannon can never be drained if the drainage of that river is attempted in the old-fashioned way, that certain new methods will have to be adopted.  Perhaps that would be more costly and perhaps the expenditure would not be justified, but it is a matter which should be gone into and considered.</P>
      <P>There is another item of which I should like an explanation from the Parliamentary Secretary.  It refers to &ldquo;Maintenance, repairs and other current charges&rdquo; in respect of the different Departments.  In connection with the Department of External Affairs, there is an estimate of £69,647 this year as compared with £47,347 last year, an increase of £22,300.  I should be glad also if the Parliamentary Secretary could inform us as to when the Corrib drainage work is likely to commence.  If the Parliamentary Secretary draws up a priority list and stands by it, if he says: &ldquo;There is no use in deputations coming to my office or asking me to meet them.  That is the list and we are going to carry out the work in strict order of priority.&rdquo; he will be doing a very good day's work not only for the people concerned but for himself and his Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no criticism to offer of this Estimate, save in respect of one sub-head.  I refer to the decision to proceed with the erection of the memorial cenotaph on Leinster Lawn.  I deplore that decision, because the memorial is purely sectional in its <Col N="1407" /> significance, erected to the three leaders of one Party in the British-engineered civil war.  I deplore the decision, because I believe that it is calculated to recreate the bitterness engendered by that civil war.  Deputy Colley referred to this danger, and I trust that he was sincere in his anxiety to avoid a recreation of civil war bitterness.  Unfortunately, on too many occasions from members of the Party opposite have we seen deliberate attempts to provoke that bitterness, to maintain it and to intensify it.  I deplore the decision, and I think the Government by that decision have, to an extent, played into the hands of those sections of the Fianna Fáil Party who realise that they have no political existence other than that based on the bitterness they can create.</P>
      <P>The opposition expressed from the benches opposite is an opposition which does not evoke in my mind any respect for its sincerity, particularly in view of the fact that, when the Party opposite was in power, they submitted to members of the Fine Gael Party plans upon which they proposed to proceed with this project. I am not concerned with what the attitude of the Party opposite was or is to-day.  I think it is unwise that, in 1950, we should be erecting memorials of a sectional significance, calculated to reopen the scars left by the civil war.  Our job in this House should be to heal those scars.  There are many people in this country who now vote, and, I think, who are even members of this House, who were not born when the civil war was fought. These people are entitled to some consideration.  The future is with them, and perhaps our main duty is to them, and to the younger people still, those born in the intervening period.</P>
      <P>We want to build in this country a united people who will be able to claim jurisdiction over all their territory and able to march together to greater conditions of individual security, peace and freedom.  We are not going to do that by continually harking back, whether from this side of the House or the other, to past bitterness, past divisions and past dissensions.</P>

      <P>I want to refer, as my colleague, Deputy Beegan referred, to the Corrib.  I had a question down to the Minister for Finance within the past fortnight asking him to indicate when work on that drainage scheme would commence.  The reply I got was that he regretted he was unable to give me that information; in other words, there was no indication that work on the scheme would go forward in the foreseeable future.  That is a very bad state of affairs and I think the Parliamentary Secretary would be well advised to tell the House in his reply clearly and fairly what the position is with regard to the drainage of the Corrib catchment area.</P>

      <P>It is only fair to himself and to the House that he would tell us when it will be done.  There is a second matter which I want to raise.  The Parliamentary Secretary, in his reply, might indicate to the House the reasons for the change in the notepaper issued by his Department. Previously, the Office of Public Works used to indicate on their notepaper in Irish and in English the particulars of the office from which the correspondence came.  The harp indicated the country.  Now they are using note heading purely in English, and even the name of the country, the Republic of Ireland, is not on it. There must be some reason for the change.  It is rather a significant change that all the Irish wording should be omitted from the Office of Public Works note heading and that they should revert to English type, and that even the description of the country is omitted.  There must be some reason for that, and I think the Parliamentary Secretary should tell the House what that reason is.</P>

In particular, I am delighted at the way in which work on the Brosna scheme is progressing.  The Parliamentary Secretary, the engineering staff and the workers generally are to be congratulated on the results achieved so far. There is one matter about which I am not too clear, and that I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to explain when replying.  I want to know the difference, if any, between the kind of work that is being carried out, for instance, under rural employment schemes, for which there is an allocation this year of £290,000, and the rural improvements schemes, for which there is an allocation of £125,000.  I raised this matter because I know there is a certain amount of confusion between the county engineers in the constituency, one county engineer, in particular, who is a very efficient man, the county engineer for Offaly, and the officials of the Department, as to the kind of work that may be carried out under these two schemes.</P>

      <P>I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to ask the commissioners and the chief officials to get the files in connection with the Clonmacnoise cemetery and to give me and my colleagues and Deputies from adjoining constituencies who are equally interested in this matter an assurance that the agitation which is going on for some time, which is quite a proper one, supported by his Lordship, the Bishop for the area, the energetic parish priest, who is responsible for the administration of the parish, will have effect and that this matter will be cleaned up, so far as he can help to do it, before the Vote comes up for consideration next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other matter.  Is there any hope that, before next year, after all the discussion on the matter that has been going on for years, long before this Government came into office or the Parliamentary Secretary was appointed to his present position, the approaches to Leinster House will be put in a more presentable condition? Instead of wasting money on putting up the stone work outside&mdash;I do not know how to describe it&mdash;I suggest that they should regard it as a primary duty to have proper waiting rooms at Leinster House for the visitors who come here from all parts of the world.  I do not know of any Parliament House&mdash;I have been in <Col N="1412" /> about half a dozen, on the Continent and in Great Britain&mdash;where the appearance of the entrance is so bad. Surely the Parliamentary Secretary, out of the big Vote at his disposal, can do something before another 12 months elapse.</P>

      <P>This Estimate has a bearing on a problem that has a bearing on every Government Department. The particular relation to that problem that this Estimate has and that this Parliamentary Secretary has is the provision of protection in time of crisis for State servants and people of that sort.  There have been some reports recently that even those air raid shelters which survived up to the present are being demolished.  We have a very good example on the premises.  Out on the Lawn, up till recently, there was a shelter.  That shelter was put up there for the purpose of enabling this institution to function in time of danger.  In particular, it would be necessary for the staff if, unfortunately, the times were such that they would need such things. That shelter is being demolished to make way for a monument which is being built.  The energies of the Board of Works are going into such things at the moment.</P>
      <P>Nobody likes to be, so to speak, the prophet of disaster or to point to unpleasant things.  Each one of us hopes and sincerely prays that the necessity for considering these things <i>in extenso</i> will not arise.  Nevertheless. what I want to say to the Parliamentary Secretary is this&mdash;I have said it to other Ministers&mdash;the present situation is one to make us think.  What already exists in the nature of protective buildings and installations under the Parliamentary Secretary's control, I suggest, should be maintained, and thereafter the Parliamentary Secretary's Department should be exercised with at least plans and preparations to provide the necessary protection for State servants and others, if such protection should be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Remember that on the provision of such protection, facilities and organisation, the very running of the Administration might largely depend in certain unwelcome contingencies.  It <Col N="1413" /> boils down to this, that what we have we should maintain.  A survey should be made of what we are likely to need and at least plans drawn up for the quick provision of what we might need, if the occasion should arise&mdash; and that, of course, means also making sure that the necessary materials are always available.  That is that, but I think it is opportune to mention it.</P>
    <P>Comment has already been made, I understand, in this debate on the form of the Estimates as between this year and last year.  It is, unfortunately, a symptom of Coalition Government that it tends to recede more and more from the public eye if it can, and that it tends to conceal its activities as much as possible.  We have already had occasion in the past few days to complain of unorthodox action on the part of Ministers.  One of the great safeguards for the working of a system such as we have is the disclosure of the accounts of the Departments and the Estimates of the Departments each year&mdash;the proposals for expenditure and for operation during the current year.  It gives an opportunity for discussion in this House.  It definitely commits a Minister in advance to certain things, and it enables both Deputies and the public to get the information which they should get.  That has, heretofore, in this case, been made very possible by the detailed form in which the Estimate was made up.  Take, for example, sub-head B &mdash;new works, alterations and additions. For the year ending 31st March, 1950, considerable details will be found on page 56 and onwards of the Book of Estimates for the year 1949-50.  There, in considerable detail, will be found the purposes set out for which the sums of money are voted, and the breaking down of the totals into considerable detail.  It simply means that, in the beginning, when voting this money we know precisely for what purposes the Minister for Finance is getting the money, and at the end of the year he can be held accountable in that respect not only before any committee but actually in this House.  Here we have an unwelcome change and, I think, not a very good change.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1414" /> On page 46 of the present Book of Estimates, under the corresponding sub-head, we find simply bulk totals, namely, summarised totals dealing simply with the various establishments &mdash;the President's Establishment, Houses of the Oireachtas, and so forth. That is an undesirable change: there is not the same amount of information available to us as there was in the past. Why is that so?  It definitely hampers Deputies in securing information or following up any particular sub-head and, shall I say, it is a bad thing, especially where a Coalition Government is concerned.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I should like to bring to the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary is that during the year I made certain inquiries about the conditions of service of labourers and storemen in the furniture stores department&mdash;those on the Board of Works sheets and those on contractors' sheets.  I got a reply from the Parliamentary Secretary in that regard but my informants tell me there is still a discrepancy between the terms of service and the advantages of people in the different categories.  Apparently, these people are doing precisely the same work and, except for an accounting distinction, there appears to be no distinction between them as far as status or work is concerned.  There is, however, when everything is taken into account, some difference in the question of net remuneration.  Again, I take this opportunity of asking the Parliamentary Secretary to look into the matter.  It is a grievance which these people feel and which, I think, would cost the State nothing to adjust and to obviate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the way he is managing the whole scheme of drainage.  Drainage is of national importance to every section of the people and to every county.  On this Vote I want to raise the question of the drainage of the Moy.  I fully realise and am aware of the fact that there is a priority list.  The only difficulty I find myself up against is the delay in reaching the Moy.  The drainage of the Moy is of great importance to the people of my constituency and County <Col N="1415" /> Mayo in general.  The fact that nothing has been done even to reach the survey part of the drainage seems to indicate that it will be a considerable time before the drainage scheme in general for the Moy will be put into operation. However, I am not blaming the Parliamentary Secretary.  I know that he is moving as quickly as possible and doing his work well and, from what I can learn, his scheme is a great success and has shown great benefits even during his short term in office.</P>
      <P>At the same time I should like to point out that, as far as the Moy is concerned, a scheme was prepared as far back as 25 years ago.  That scheme will be found in the Board of Works. The matter has been raised on several occasions in this House but nothing has been done.  I understand that a survey of the Corrib is in operation and I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to see that, while his officials are on the spot on the Corrib, they should extend their activities to the Moy.  I suggest that a survey of both rivers could be carried out, one after the other.  It would be a desirable thing to have drainage carried out on both rivers at the earliest possible moment. So far as the Moy is concerned, there are certain peculiarities attaching to it.  The chief point about the Moy is the destruction its flooding causes to the farming community who live along its banks.  The Moy is one of our big rivers, one of the main outlets from two lakes, Lough Conn and Lough Cullen. Into those lakes flow four or five other rivers.  After a sudden heavy fall of rain these rivers raise the level of the lake to a remarkable degree and the result is that large areas of land are flooded.  For instance, if you have a heavy fall of rain to-night, thousands of acres will be flooded inside 24 hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Convenient to the Moy there is some splendid land, good grazing land and land that is fairly safe and good for tillage.  A big number of the farmers for miles and miles each side of the Moy have to depend on hay as a winter food for their live stock.  There are times, and I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary has had the same experience in his county, when a heavy fall of rain <Col N="1416" /> in July or August would have the effect of taking away every bit of the hay saved along the banks of the Moy.  That is one reason why I want the Minister to devote serious attention to draining the Moy.  I understand the Corrib has priority over the Moy but, now that the machinery is there and the survey is proceeding, I earnestly suggest the extension of that survey to the Moy.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I would like to mention is the grant of £806 for the repair of embankments at Belderring. I do not know whether that matter properly comes under this Estimate.  I have been informed that a grant has been sanctioned.  The importance of this matter cannot be over-stressed, because there is a grave danger of floods in that area.  It is an area where there is a big number of registered unemployed.  If the repairs were undertaken they would serve two purposes. They would give employment in the area and they would relieve the dangers of flooding.</P>
    <P>That is about all I have to say on this Estimate.  There are other matters which I will raise on other Estimates.  I make a final appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to give the Moy a prominent place on the priority list.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can never understand why this Vote should be cramped because, in connection with nearly every item in it, there is a proposal to increase the grant and to increase the work under the different heads. There is extra money being provided for the building of schools and for drainage works.  For the first time, so far as my county is concerned, there are arrangements being made for the commencement of field drainage in connection with the North Kerry drainage scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With Deputy Palmer, I would like to stress this point, that the next scheme in order of merit should be the Maine drainage scheme.  As a matter of fact, I should have said the completion of the Main drainage scheme, because a good many years ago the Government provided money for the inauguration of that scheme and it has never been completed.  I think that <Col N="1417" /> we have a prior claim in that respect. I can never understand how this matter of a priority list was worked out.  One would imagine that a scheme that was under way ten or 12 years ago and on which a considerable sum was expended should have progressed more instead of being shelved all those years in order to facilitate some other area.  It certainly should be one of the first to get consideration after these schemes that are now under way are finished.</P>
    <P>There is one matter I would like to mention to the Parliamentary Secretary and, through him, to his officials. I have made representations to the Department time and again with regard to the conditions of the workers and the people on the Bourne-Vincent estate, especially with regard to housing and rates of wages.  It would appear that the departmental officials accept the reports of officials down there rather than the representations that we make.  I want to insist that, so far as I am concerned, any information that I have with reference to matters that I mention is reliable.</P>
    <P>I challenge the attitude of the Commissioners of Public Works when they accept the word of the superintendent down there against our representations.  They seem to think that we have no knowledge of local affairs and of how things are being handled down there.  I want to tell the officials that I am not going to leave it rest at that, nor will I stand for their acquiescence in the reports of the officials down in that place.</P>
    <P>I made the statement here that housing conditions on that estate were deplorable and I suggested the workers were entitled to an increased wage.  An inspection was carried out by the engineers and a report was submitted to the Department which, I claim, was not a true report.  The Commissioners of Public Works accepted that report as against my statement.  I am prepared to reiterate everything I said and I will continue to press for justice for these men.  One of the officials of the Board of Works challenged my statement and he even challenged the Parliamentary Secretary's decision in <Col N="1418" /> one matter.  I warn that official that I will not leave it rest at that, either inside or outside this House.  That particular official seems to have some peculiar antipathy to me.</P>

      <P>Very well.  I have raised this question of the drainage schemes and I also welcome the Parliamentary Secretary's decision to establish an office or section representative of his Department in our county, to carry out these drainage schemes, rural improvement schemes and other such schemes under the direct control of the Department.  Heretofore, we had them supervised by the local county engineers who had more than enough work on hands to prevent them from paying proper attention to these works.  Now I understand that a special office is being established which will arrange for an all-the-year-round programme.  I welcome that departure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the work he has done.  In my opinion, this is the most <Col N="1419" /> satisfactory report on development and the most satisfactory Estimate in regard to expenditure, ever presented to this House from the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make some observations regarding a few matters concerning County Dublin.  I would like the Board of Works definitely to spend a little more time in dredging Howth Harbour.  They have gone there on a few occasions and have succeeded in dredging the harbour just along by the pier wall, about nine or ten feet out, with the result that it is very little use to the fishermen and to seafaring men using the harbour every day for their livelihood.  Dredging is very important and this applies to Howth and Balbriggan as both harbours are used extensively by the few fishing boats we have left along the east coast.  As supplies have improved, I do not see why it should not be possible to have this work carried out.  I hope neither I nor any other public representative will have to bring this to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary or the Board of Works again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a few occasions I have raised questions regarding the west pier road in Howth.  I was down there on Sunday at the blessing of a fleet and I saw where there is an attempt made to do something about filling up the potholes there and repairing the road generally, but I must say it was not before its time.  I hope that, on this occasion, judging by the number of people who visit Howth Harbour as well as the number who use it for their livelihood, the harbour will be properly attended to. With regard to the east pier, Howth is more or less a tourist centre and the pier is under the charge of the Board of Works.  I cannot see why a few lights could not be put along the east pier.  There are some lights on the west pier, but a little more should be put on the east pier and a few more seats for the people who go down there in the evenings or at night time.  This is a matter that has not altogether to do with the harbour, but people going there to appreciate the scenic beauty of the place would like to have somewhere to sit down in comfort.  The <Col N="1420" /> Board of Works should add a little to the amenities of that harbour, by putting more seats along the east pier, now that it is realised that the tourist industry is worth something to us.</P>
    <P>There are some rivers in North Dublin which have been referred to also by other public representatives.  I do not know what the position is in County Dublin regarding arterial drainage.  I have never been able to get an answer on that.  I suppose we will have to wait until the major rivers are cleaned.  The River Ballough is causing a lot of flooding, especially in the late winter and early spring.  It cannot be cleaned under the Works Act.  When things are more forward in regard to major rivers, I hope the Minister will consider minor ones of that kind, as they are doing a considerable amount of damage to land and flooding houses locally.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is one burning question. It is about time that the Government should become model employers. I am not saying anything against the Parliamentary Secretary.  This Government or some future Government must consider the labourers employed by the Board of Works, who work permanently in cases from the age of 19 until they are 65 and go out then without any pension.  If we are encouraging private employers to introduce pension schemes, we should first be in a position to say that our own house is in order.</P>

On the other question which was ruled out of order, I hope that at some future date something will be done about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In his statement to the House, which as far as it went appeared to be well prepared, I thought the Parliamentary Secretary might have been more informative. There are two or three matters about which we could have done with more information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy going to break his record on this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, for a short distance. One of the matters I refer to is schools.  The provision for schools is increased, but it would not have been any harm to tell the House to what extent that will represent an increase in the number of school buildings either to be erected or reconstructed. A mere increase in the provision for schools might only mean that it would go largely towards the increased costs of materials, sites, and erection.  I should also like to have heard from the Parliamentary Secretary some statement as to the whole policy of the Office of Public Works with regard to schools, school repair and maintenance, some indication as to what is in the mind of the Office of Public Works in that whole matter.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary himself satisfied with the system by which schools are erected and maintained?  Are we making any progress in dealing with the dilapidated building we have all through the country?  If we are building a large number of new schools, is there any truth in the suggestion that, as a result of the present maintenance system, we are allowing other buildings gradually to get into that condition? It is a very desirable thing to spend money on schools, and it has been the aim of the Government of this State for a long time to deal with <Col N="1422" /> the problem of school buildings.  However desirable that work may be, it will not be satisfactory if there is not a system of maintenance of these buildings which will ensure for them the longest possible life.  I thought we should have heard from the Parliamentary Secretary much more information on those matters and perhaps some other matters in connection with this problem which might suggest themselves to his mind.</P>
      <P>In regard to arterial drainage, I suppose some of the remarks which I have made about schools could be applied to that.  I thought we would get a statement from the Parliamentary Secretary as to the length of time which it would take to complete the Brosna scheme.  As that scheme has been in operation for more than two years, I expected to hear when the work was likely to be completed.  The Glyde and Dee scheme was started recently and I expected to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary also some estimate of the probable time which would elapse before the work would be completed.  The Parliamentary Secretary also made reference to the Brick and Cashen and the Feale schemes.  When he announced that some money was provided to start this work I thought he would have stated whether any firm estimate was available as to the actual cost.  It is very hard for Deputies, who are not in possession of the information which the Parliamentary Secretary may have, to reconcile these two statements-that we had in the Estimate provision to enable work to be started this year and, at the same time, an admission that there was no firm estimate available as to the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Commons endeavoured to make use of this debate to do the childish stuff to which Deputies some times resort when endeavouring to establish that somebody in charge of this work was lackadaisical at some time and somebody else was very energetic.  What we want to get from the Parliamentary Secretary is to what extent plans are being prepared for the implementation of the full drainage programme envisaged in the Act of 1945.  That programme was to get four <Col N="1423" /> schemes under way as quickly as possible, to build up a reserve of catchment areas in respect of which plans would have been prepared so that the work could be enlarged at any time. Side by side with that you had to build up the field engineering staff and the office engineering staff.  In addition, as the Act provides, you had to build up a maintenance organisation for taking over those areas when the work was completed.  In that way as well as having a staff organisation for going ahead with the new work, you would be, at the same time, building up an organisation for its maintenance when completed, as well as taking over some older drainage districts which were dealt with many years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Were not all these plans ready in 1932?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have given the House an assurance that my speech will be brief, I am not going to give Deputy Davin a lecture on this matter.  I am referring to the plans envisaged in the Act of 1945, and I am asking the House to agree with me that it would not be unreasonable to expect the Parliamentary Secretary, instead of telling us that there is a sum of £200,000, £300,000 or £400,000 extra provided this year for this and £20,000 extra for that, to let us have a comprehensive picture of how these developments are going on and whether, in fact, we are making any progress.  There is no use in Deputies saying that the Act was passed in 1945 and that no work was done until such a year.  I am out of the Office for Public Works for a long time.  The preparation of the schemes for the Glyde and Dee, the Brosna and Cashen took an enormous amount of time.  Years have passed since then and other developments have taken place. How far have we gone on the road towards reaching a realisation of the general plans that those who were responsible for the 1945 Act had in mind?  Sometimes an appeal is made here with regard to what is called the &ldquo;priority&rdquo; list.  That is utter nonsense.  I have heard the Parliamentary Secretary making use of that supposed list outside this House, <Col N="1424" /> apparently for political purposes. Some people may fall for it; some may swallow it, but it is ridiculous to talk of such a list.  There was never anything other than a list prepared by the chief engineer for his own guidance. It had neither the approval of the Government nor of the Parliamentary Secretary.  Their approval was never sought to such a list. It was merely a list of the catchment areas drawn up by the chief engineer for his own guidance if he had a free hand in his approach to the preparation of the particular schemes.  In all my conversations with him my attitude was that, as far as each area proved suitable from an engineering point of view, there should be a scheme drawn up for each province so that no province could say that the dice was loaded against it.</P>
      <P>When I hear Deputies talking about what is happening and how pleased they are with the progress that is being made, I cannot help remembering sitting on those benches and making a forecast of the length of time it would take to implement the Arterial Drainage Act of 1945.  It was then only a Bill and I remember prophesying-and I remember the Clann na Talmhan Deputies and others then in Opposition telling me I was a pessimist, merely trying to throw cold water on the scheme and that it was only a matter of providing machinery-how long the scheme would take.  I wanted to be frank with the House because I knew the public would be expecting something, and I knew the public would not have their expectations realised.  I thought it just as well that they should have a general idea of the difficulties confronting those in charge of this work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you want to give the Parliamentary Secretary credit, you can give him any credit you like in regard to the work that is being done.  Just think for a moment of the length of time it has taken on the Brosna scheme so far.  Just think of the possibility of that scheme lasting perhaps two years more.  Just think of the hundred other catchment areas, some of which are larger than the Brosna and some of which I admit, <Col N="1425" /> are smaller, and think of all the time it would take to prepare schemes for these.  Perhaps it is not a bad thing that it should be brought home to some Deputies now that I, speaking from those benches, issued a warning as to the length of time this work would take with all the will in the world behind it.  Some Deputies laughed at the idea, and it is not a bad thing now to have them standing up here saying they are perfectly satisfied with how things are going and that the rate of progress is all that can be desired.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting to the Parliamentary Secretary or to the House that there are not great difficulties in the way of building up the necessary staff, first of all to do the outdoor work of surveying; secondly, the indoor work of preparing designs and, thirdly, the building up of a maintenance organisation.  I do not say that will be an easy matter, but I am suggesting that those who make the statement that we can be satisfied with the rate of progress are not speaking their true minds, because they could not be satisfied.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal of truth in the statement that has been made that in these 100 catchment areas, many of which are incapable of being improved from a maintenance point of view under the Works Act and all the other small jobs done over the last 25 years, which, I suppose, will continue, there is undoubtedly a worsening of the general condition in the main bed in these main catchment areas.  I know from my own experience of county roads passing through these catchment areas that they have considerably worsened from the point of view of winter flooding in the last 25 years.  My contention is that they have worsened because of a number of factors to which reference has been made from time to time in this House.  It is because of that worsening and because of the prospect of that continuing over a number of years that I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to go ahead.  It is not a matter of debating whether I ordered the Brosna, the Glyde, the Brick, the Dee or the Cashen.  The Parliamentary Secretary when he comes in here should give an <Col N="1426" /> explanation as to what work exactly is being done under the 1945 Act.  He should tell us: &ldquo;Here is £750,000; the Brosna is being done; there is so much still to be done; there are so many men employed; I hope to employ many more, if necessary; it will take five years to finish the job; if I can recruit more labour I will get the work done in half the time and, on the assumption that it would originally have taken five years, I will get it done in two.&rdquo;  We should not have Deputies getting up here and saying that things are fine. We should not have other Deputies getting up and asking that the Moy should be taken out of its order on the supposed priority list and brought up to a certain stage.</P>
    <P>I am interested in a number of catchment areas which affect many farmers. It is nonsense to come in here and talk about taking these catchment areas out of their order on a sheet of paper.  That will not secure the execution of the work.  There is in the country more approval for work of this solid type which will leave behind it a lasting benefit and a lasting memory.  Since there is that approval for this kind of work we should hear from the Parliamentary Secretary, when he is introducing his Estimate, a statement setting out exactly what the position is and how the work will be carried out. Not only should we have that statement, but we should have, from month to month, definite evidence of the execution of the works proposed under the Act.  The plans that were made should be implemented.  With the best will in the world, it will be a slow job. The public should be told that definitely.  It is a pity they were not told that five or six years ago.  It is a good thing to see now that there is on all sides of the House a realisation of that fact.  When the engineers are given liberty to undertake their task and apply their knowledge to the drainage problems of the country, we can all rest assured that the execution of the work will leave behind it something of lasting benefit to those who will come after us.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene in this debate solely to correct certain misstatements made here, re-echoing <Col N="1427" /> similar misstatements which have been made outside the House, on the subject of the cenotaph on Leinster Lawn. These statements and the propaganda which is being disseminated outside may have an effect calculated to do something which this Government certainly does not intend and with which they have been charged, namely, of formenting the resurrection of the old civil war bitterness and quarrels.  For that reason, I intervene here to-day.  I propose calmly to tell the House and the public the facts in connection with the erection of the cenotaph on Leinster Lawn-the real facts, and not the distorted accounts that have been given here and outside.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley here to-day stated as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The erection of the cenotaph is going ahead.  Immediately the Government took office they saw to that. In fact, it looks like a deliberate attempt to try to recreate the whole civil war spirit.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He repeats that statement again about recreating the whole civil war spirit and he then goes on to refer to a remark that Deputy Cowan is stated to have made some time ago; he, Deputy Colley, states as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Deputy Cowan made a remark some time ago that the erection of the cenotaph on Leinster Lawn was the result of a decision by the Fianna Fáil Government. So far as I am aware all that the Fianna Fáil Government undertook to do was to replace the previous temporary memorial which had been taken down as dangerous and which was put up by the former Government.  They did not undertake to build an elaborate monument such as that which is being put up at the moment. I want to correct a belief which apparently Deputy Cowan holds about that matter.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to correct the statement that was made by Deputy Colley, and to show that it was unfounded and untrue. In fact, I want to give the facts to the House.  A temporary cenotaph was erected in memory of the late Arthur <Col N="1428" /> Griffith and Michael Collins on Leinster Lawn in August, 1923.  Some Deputies may remember the form which this cenotaph took.  It comprised a central cross and two large pylons, to which medallions, in plaster, of Messrs. Griffith and Collins were affixed.  The cenotaph was designed by Mr. George Atkinson, and the medallions were the work of Mr. Albert Power.  The erection itself was of timber framing covered with expanded metal lathing and cement.  In August, 1928, a medallion of the late Mr. Kevin O'Higgins was added to the cenotaph.  The intention, at the time of the erection of that cenotaph, was that it was to be merely temporary, and that it should be replaced in time by a permanent memorial.  When the medallion of the late Mr. Kevin O'Higgins was being affixed in August, 1928, it was discovered that the timber framing of the cenotaph was covered with mildew and steps were then taken to ventilate the interior so as to minimise the risk of dry rot.  The life of the structure at that time was estimated at five years. Cracks in the structure were observed towards the end of 1935 and, following inspection, the principal architect of the Office of Public Works recommended that it should be removed at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>The then Taoiseach, the present Leader of the Opposition, acting very properly, consulted with the Leaders of the Opposition, and having so consulted, he announced on the 15th August, 1939, that in view of reports by the Commissioners of Public Works that the temporary cenotaph was in imminent danger of collapse, it had been decided to take it down and replace it, as was originally intended, by a more permanent memorial to Messrs. Griffith, Collins and O'Higgins, and that the new memorial would be erected on the same site as soon as a suitable design had been prepared and approved.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of Deputies to this fact that so far back as 1939 the last Government took a decision to erect a permanent memorial.  They very properly took that decision and took the necessary steps in regard to it.  The temporary <Col N="1429" /> cenotaph was accordingly taken down, the three plaster medallions having been removed intact and stored away. Following on that decision by the last Government, they had plans prepared for the erection of a permanent memorial.  A sketch design for the permanent memorial was prepared by Mr. H.G. Leask, Inspector of National Monuments, Office of Public Works. When submitting this design to the then Government, the Commissioners of Public Works made these observations:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the whole, the design seems to us to be in keeping with the suggestions that were made and with the surroundings.  It may be considered, however, that the seats shown on the front are liable to detract from the dignity of the memorial, unless they are indispensable as &lsquo;breaks&rsquo; in its face. The carrying down to near the base of the borders of the plaques might perhaps be considered also.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Other matters were then taken into consideration in connection with this design and views were expressed as to its suitability and as to the conformity of the design to the surrounding buildings. Mr. Leask then prepared a revised design in the light of the views that had been expressed.  The former Government, on the 7th August, 1940, accorded provisional approval to the revised design and directed that the revised design should again be submitted to the Opposition for their approval.  Owing to the conditions created by the emergency, it was not possible to continue with the work of the erection of the memorial and, accordingly, it was postponed.  On 16th September, 1947, the matter was brought to the Government on a memorandum submitted by the then Taoiseach.  Regarding this memorandum, it was decided:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  That the Minister for Finance should give directions for the preparation and submission to the Government of a new sketch design of a monument in the form of a column or obelisk, including provision for a cross and for portrait plaques of the <Col N="1430" /> late Arthur Griffith, Michael Collins and Kevin O'Higgins; and</P>
    <P>(2)  that the new sketch design when approved by the Government should be discussed by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach with representatives of the Fine Gael Party who should be informed by the Parliamentary Secretary that the Government is prepared to have a monument, in the approved form, erected on Leinster Lawn.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The original design by Mr. Leask was not in the form of an obelisk.  It was in quite a different form, and if Deputies are interested they can see a photograph of the sketch.  The design by Mr. Leask as prepared for the Government on a memorandum submitted by the Taoiseach was changed to a column or obelisk, to the form in which it will stand in Leinster Lawn.  The then Taoiseach, acting perfectly correctly and with great courtesy, submitted it to the Fine Gael Party.  I myself saw it with General Mulcahy. General Mulcahy on the 7th July, 1940, wrote to the Taoiseach as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Chara:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I have examined the plans for the cenotaph memorial on Leinster Lawn left with me on Wednesday last, the 2nd July.  They have also been seen by some of my colleagues.  We approve of the plan bearing date 1/5/'40, and marked that the words &lsquo;showing new scale&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was in July, 1940, that the sketch plans were submitted to General Mulcahy.  They were Mr. Leask's plans.  By this letter of the 7th July, 1940, we approved of the Leask memorial.  Subsequently, as I have stated, on the 16th September, 1947, the Government decided not to go on with these plans, but to have a new sketch design of a monument in the form of a column or obelisk, including the provision for a cross and for portrait plaques.  These were then to be submitted to General Mulcahy and to my colleagues and, in fact, were submitted. That having been done, the architects of the Board of Works were directed to proceed with the making of designs for a column or obelisk.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1431" /> The preparation of the new design was delayed in the Office of Public Works owing to the pressure of work on the architectural staff of the office.  Mr. Raymond McGrath, the principal architect, then submitted plans, and, in the meantime, the change of Government had taken place.  Mr. McGrath submitted plans to me and to my colleagues following this decision for the erection of a column or obelisk.  We approved of the present column or obelisk, with some changes and additions.</P>
    <P>It will, therefore, be seen that Deputy Colley has done something which might be a great public disservice, and which could have caused very great bitterness, had I not taken the opportunity here to-day to correct it.</P>
    <P>So far from endeavouring in any way to foment the feelings or the spirit of the civil war or to revive bitterness, the whole policy of this Government, and the real reason for its foundation, has been to put an end to that bitterness and to this personal strife.  There was never the slightest intention, in connection with the erection of this memorial which was decided upon as far back as 1939 by the previous Government, to revive the old bitterness. That allegation has been made to mislead people, decent people very often, into the belief that we were doing something to resurrect the old bitterness of the civil war by proceeding with the plans for the erection of this memorial to Griffith, Collins and O'Higgins.  Nothing was further from our minds.  We continued, as I have said, the plans that had been formulated by the last Government.  They were slightly changed but they would have probably been changed if we had never come into power.  A column or obelisk was what was decided upon by the last Government.  That column or obelisk is going up now with some slight changes in its design, merely from the point of view of bringing it more into conformity with its surroundings.</P>
    <P>Much propaganda has been made in regard to the project for the Garden <Col N="1432" /> of Remembrance.  Deputy Colley, in a most unworthy speech, said that we were reviving the civil war spirit because we had not proceeded with that project and because we were proceeding with the memorial on Leinster Lawn.  I hope I have convinced him that that is not so.  In fact, his statement was a deliberate attempt to revive the old civil war spirit.  The Deputy went on to say that Deputy Cowan was under a misapprehension and that he wanted to correct it.  I have now shown that Deputy Cowan was correct in his statement and that it was Deputy Colley who was incorrect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley said that his colleagues had not undertaken to build an elaborate monument such as that which is being put up at the moment. I have now shown that we are continuing in sequence what was done by the last Government.  I want to emphasise that for people in this House who are open to conviction and to a decent reception of the truth and for people outside as well, so that there may be an end to this controversy which has been conducted in the columns of the Press to the effect that this was being done to revive the bitterness of the civil war.  This Government never had any intention to abandon the Garden of Remembrance. So far as they are concerned that project is going ahead and will go ahead as soon as the Minister for Health says that he does not require these grounds any longer for the use to which they are at present being put.</P>

So far from there being any endeavour or effort on the part of the Government to revive the civil war spirit or to fail in their duty to commemorate the efforts of those who took part in the <Col N="1433" /> struggle for freedom, apart altogether from the project of the Garden of Remembrance, the Government have been considering the erection of a proper memorial adequately to commemorate the long struggle of the Irish nation for its existence and its freedom and the efforts and sacrifices of all who participated in that struggle. We intend before we leave office to erect that additional memorial to commemorate the long struggle of the Irish nation for its existence and its freedom and all the efforts and sacrifices of all those who participated in that struggle.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Deputy Cowan made a remark some time ago that the erection of the cenotaph on Leinster Lawn was the result of a decision by the Fianna Fáil Government.  So far as I am aware, all the Fianna Fáil Government undertook to do was to replace the previous temporary memorial, which had been taken down as dangerous and which was put up by the former Government.

      <P>Before passing away from the matter may I say in regard to the recital of the facts by the Taoiseach, so far as he recited them, <Col N="1434" /> I should like the House and the Taoiseach to believe that there are other facts which could be recited if this matter were to be discussed at length, which I think would be very unwise I myself could supply some additional facts if it were considered wise to take this matter in the sense in which it has been taken by the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach and the members of the Government will appreciate in dealing with this matter &mdash;I happened to be in the Office of Public Works on some of the dates mentioned&mdash;that it was most awkward for us in the sense that we were participants in the unfortunate struggle of 1921, 1922 and 1923, and that there were many suggestions that we made or would like to make and would like to insist upon, and many recommendations that we would have preferred to accept rather than the ones that were forced upon us, but we refrained from doing so because of our desire not to stimulate bitterness.  If we were to have an examination of the statements made by the Taoiseach, there would be some other interesting sidelights thrown upon it, but I have no desire to prolong the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A.P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider a decision which he made during the last <Col N="1435" /> 12 months.  I drew his attention to the fact that every Saturday and every Sunday in the 15 acres in the Phoejoinix Park boys are forced to dress and un dress in the open before and after football matches no matter what the weather is like, in hail, rain or snow. If they want to play a match, they must expose themselves to the ravages of the weather and run a fearful danger of contracting tuberculosis.  I asked the Parliamentary Secretary to erect a few more pavilions to protect these boys.  At the moment there are 16 pavilions and 27 grounds.  That means that as many as 54 teams are sometimes taking part in matches. That is to say, 38 out of the 54 teams must dress and undress in the open.  I want the Minister to reconsider this from the point of view of asking if the Government is being penny wise, pound foolish.  We spent all day yesterday talking about the provision of thousands of pounds for hospitals and sanatoria while a few hundred pounds would put up these pavilions which might save many thousands of pounds later on.</P>
      <P>Let me remind the Parliamentary Secretary that when Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Dr. Brennan put down a motion calling for more playing grounds and playing pavilions the Minister for Local Government was very sympathetic and stated in the House that it was the policy of the Government to provide facilities for recreation and that he encouraged local authorities to do so also, and Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Dr. Brennan graciously withdrew their motion on that undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally, I would not ask that the money be refunded at all, as it is only a fiea-bite from the Exchequer and should be a gift from the people to the boys who play football, but if we did want it back, it could come back. Even at the moment, the boys pay a small fee, 1/- or 1/1 per team, for the use of the pavilion and they would be prepared to pay 1/6 if necessary to recoup the Government for their expenditure on pavilions.  I strongly exhort the Minister that at least 38 <Col N="1436" /> more pavilions should be put up in the soccer section of the Phoenix Park.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWalsh" hpid="Mr. R. Walsh Mr. R. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the Parliamentary Secretary very long, but I want to draw his special attention to the question of the Moy. I would ask him how things stand there at present.  As has been stated, the Moy is the greatest draining river in Mayo.  There is hardly a river, hardly a drop of rain falls in Mayo, but eventually finds its way into the River Moy.  Therefore, the drainage and cleaning of the Moy is of vital importance to Mayo, and I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to go into the question and let us know at least how the matter now stands and what are the prospects for the drainage of the Moy in the year approaching.</P>
      <P>Another matter I should like him to clear up is the question of farm build ings and the grants made for them. Some small farmers have come to me apparently under the impression that they would get a very large grant.  I am not quite sure of the position myself and perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would make a statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go at length into the question of the site for this memorial.  All I have to say is that there are plenty of sites in Dublin City which could be taken over for the purpose of a Garden of Remembrance. There are alternative sites for the building of the institution that the Minister is erecting in Parnell Square, a very small distance away.  I do not see why that institution was not erected in the centre of Mountjoy Square.  I do not object to this beneficial institution being established for the people, but I certainly felt sore at the proposal not to erect a memorial to our dead who died in the service of this country but to erect an institution that could be erected a very short distance away, so that it would not discommode the people who would be availing of it in any way or put an additional journey on them.  I certainly think that an alternative site could be found, and I can suggest, for instance, St. Stephen's Green.  It would be very fitting to place the <Col N="1437" /> memorial to the people who brought about the independence of this part of Ireland where formerly the statue of a British king stood.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to Deputies for their advice on this Estimate. Of course, the most important matter appeared to be drainage.  It was one of the greatest interests here, naturally enough.  That is what we would expect and I am sure you will not mind, Sir, if I spend a few moments on that.  I was more than surprised at Deputy O'Grady moving this Estimate back for reconsideration.  He dealt with drainage and drainage alone, and he was one of those Deputies who felt that we were not doing the work we should do regarding drainage.  At the same time, he had the decency to be a bit grateful for the fact that we have moved into the Fergus in his constituency at the moment and I appreciate that from him.</P>
      <P>During the debate on all the Estimates this year and last year it has become a very familiar thing to refer back to something some Minister of the present day said when he was a Deputy.  On this occasion I am going to refer back to the statement of Deputy Smith, then Parliamentary Secretary, in column 1322 of Volume 92, on the 16th February, 1944, when he was speaking on the Second Reading of the Arterial Drainage Bill under which we are now working.  He was referring to the report of the Drainage Commission and stated that the Government had accepted the report almost in detail.  Then he went on to say that the Drainage Commission whose report had been accepted&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;mentioned a sum of, roughly, £250,000 per annum.  That commission was composed of men who had a practical knowledge of the subject, and also of men who have considerable engineering ability. These men gave it as their opinion that the maximum sum that the central drainage authority was likely to be able to expend in any one year would be £250,000.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely not even Deputy O'Grady could blame me when the maximum amount. <Col N="1438" /> according to Deputy Smith, then Parliamentary Secretary, that the Fianna Fáil Government could expend in any one year was £250,000 and when I come along this year with an Estimate of over £700,000&mdash; more than three times as much as the Fianna Fáil Government said was the maximum that could be spent&mdash;I fail to see how Deputy O'Grady or any other Deputy can be dissatisfied.</P>
    <P>We had much talk by Deputies about the priority list and I regret that Deputy Beegan, Deputy Kitt and Deputy Lydon are not in the House. I was questioned about the Corrib. If I were to adhere to the priority list left to me by the outgoing Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Secretary, I would be dead and in Heaven, and so would Deputies Kitt and Killilea, before the Corrib drainage scheme would have been started.  So far as that scheme is concerned, I asked the consent of the Government to take it out of its position on the priority list, because I felt that the Province of Connacht was entitled to an arterial drainage scheme.  Deputy Smith speaks here with his tongue in his cheek and says he believes that each province should get its share of arterial drainage, but it is only lately he said that because, as I say, if we were to proceed according to the list, that scheme in the Province of Connacht known as the Corrib scheme would not be started. At the moment, a survey of the Corrib is in hands and we expect it will be completed this year.  I cannot say exactly when we will finish on the Brosna.  We are going ahead at a fast rate with that scheme.  Deputy Smith, at column 1322 of Volume 92 of the Official Debates of 16th February, 1944, said it would take at least five years for the scheme to be finished.  I do not believe that at all, nor do I believe, as Deputy Smith said when introducing that Drainage Bill, that it would take 28 years to carry out the arterial drainage of the country.</P>

      <P>It would not be popular for any Deputy to question the spending of that amount, but I want to point out that, in 1947-48, the last year of Fianna Fáil Administration, the amount spent on national schools was £134,942.  This year, we are spending £700,000 on the building and reconstruction of national schools.  I have here a copy of the <i>Connacht Tribune</i> of July 8th, 1950, and, according to it, at a public Fianna Fáil meeting in Caltra, Deputies Kitt and Killilea jumped on the band wagon.  Deputy Kitt is a national school teacher and he referred to the expenditure of what <Col N="1440" /> he called the inter-Party Government. He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Fianna Fáil system was the prudent system&mdash;pay as you go.  They had left the country in a sound financial position when the Coalition Government took over.  In view of the international situation at the moment and the fact that the present Administration had placed this country in pawn, due to their borrowing policy, the people must face the future with a feeling of apprehension.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A statement like that, particularly down the country, is real sabotage, so far as this country is concerned.  It amounts to saying to the people: &ldquo;Do not invest money in this country; do not help to build up this country because this Government is running the country into debt and it is going into the pawnshop.&rdquo;  I wonder does Deputy Kitt object to £700,000 being spent on the building and reconstruction of national schools this year?  I wonder does he object to the expenditure of over £700,000 on arterial drainage this year?  I believe it was the previous Government that held this country in pawn. The country was stagnant, and they maintained a position in which some of our schools in rural areas were shacks and over a million acres of land were subject to flooding.  If it is going to put this country in pawn to spend money on works of that description, I am willing to put it in pawn every day the sun rises.</P>

      <P>So far as arterial drainage is concerned, I must pay a tribute to my own Minister and to the Government because the purse is open for the expenditure of money as fast as we can spend it.  This year, we have an increase of £16,000 for the building up of staff.  We are recruiting our engineers as fast as we possibly can, so that we will have special schemes always prepared and available. This year, we are spending £395,000 on extra machinery.  We believe machinery is a great thing for arterial drainage. We are doing that in every way we can, because it is the opinion of the Government that the quicker this question of drainage is finished, the better.  Every Deputy, of course, referred to the little things in his own areas.  The Moy, the Suck and every other arterial drainage scheme was referred to.  We have great interest in each and every one of them.  We are doing our best in every way we can to get through with that work.</P>
      <P>Deputy John Flynn of Kerry referred to the workers, especially those engaged in the Bourne Vincent Memorial Park.  May I say, <i>en passant</i>, that not long ago I had occasion to visit that park unofficially.  Certainly, I must pay tribute to the people and the workers there for the condition in which it is kept.  I am inclined to think that it is one of the nicest beauty spots in Europe, if not in the world, and I think that sufficient capital is not made of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the payment of the workers, I am receiving a deputation introduced by Deputy Dunne, General Secretary of the Federation of Rural <Col N="1442" /> Workers, and I will be always only too glad to meet any grievances they have to put forward.</P>
    <P>There are several matters that I do not want to deal with here but I will look into any suggestions put forward by Deputies.</P>
    <P>I must express appreciation of the present chairman and the commissioners and staff in general for their work.  During my time in office, I have received the greatest co-operation. Sometimes I rush things and try to get things done and they put the brake on me in their own way but still I find them very good, honest, hard-working people.  While hard things may be said about the Board of Works, I believe they are as hard-working a Department and as honest a section of the Civil Service as ever served a Government or ever will.</P>
    <P>I must also pay tribute, and I am delighted to do it, to our ex-chairman, Mr. Joseph Connolly.  Since the Estimate was introduced last year, Mr. Connolly has retired under the age limit.  It would be the desire of the House, and it is my desire, after his many years of loyal service, to wish him many years of happiness in his well-earned retirement.</P>
    <P>Any statements Deputies have made or suggestions they have put forward will be considered and I will try to put them into effect during the coming year, to the best of my ability.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to note that increased grants are being provided in this Estimate under the sub-head &ldquo;Rural Employment Schemes&rdquo;, which shows an increase of £110,000, and under the sub-head &ldquo;Rural Improvement Schemes&rdquo;, which shows an increase of £25,000, making a total increase for these very useful and essential services of £135,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to point out to the Parliamentary Secretary that, in my opinion, based on experience, it is necessary for his Department to convey to the county engineers the purposes for which these sums are provided under these two sub-heads.  I can indicate a certain kind of application that was submitted to the county engineer in one county in my constituency for the repair of a road concerning which 29 farmers were interested.  This is a case where a road was provided by the Land Commission out of a Land Commission Estimate nearly 20 years ago.  It is used by 29 small farmers and cottage tenants.  The condition of this road for a number of years past has been so bad that it cannot be used in winter by the children of the district going to the local school, and it certainly cannot be used by the farmers for their domestic purposes. An application for the repair of this road was made, in the first instance, to the Land Commission and turned down.  Since the coming into operation of the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1948, that application was repeated: it was turned down by the county surveyor for the County of Offaly on the grounds that the application was of such a nature that it was not covered by the Act.  I understand &mdash;in fact, I know&mdash;that an application was recently submitted to the Parliamentary Secretary or to his Department to have this essential, urgent and necessary work carried out by way of a grant provided under the rural improvements scheme.  The Parliamentary Secretary has replied to that application by stating that this is a job that should be carried out with moneys provided under the farm improvements scheme.  The application <Col N="1447" /> went first to the Land Commission; then to the county engineer, and then to the Parliamentary Secretary for the provision of a grant under the rural improvements scheme.  The Parliamentary Secretary has now decided&mdash;in his wisdom or otherwise&mdash;that this is a job that should be carried out with funds out of the farm improvements scheme. It may be correct to say that two or three or four or five of the farmers who use this road&mdash;who got holdings from the Land Commission almost 20 years ago&mdash;could, out of their own resources, make a contribution to the carrying out of this work.  I want to assure the Parliamentary Secretary, however, that the overwhelming majority of the 29 families concerned are not in a position to make a contribution.  It is absolutely essential and urgently necessary that this work be carried out without further delay.  With all the funds at the disposal of the Parliamentary Secretary, I think it should be easy for him to decide now that this work should be done out of the moneys which are presently placed at his disposal.</P>
    <P>There should be no further quibbling about getting a job of this kind done. The application&mdash;it is only one of a kind&mdash;refers to the Ballylinn Road, near Ferbane, County Offaly.  I am raising this matter because it is a case where the work is essential, and there should be an indication given to the county surveyor to go ahead with it. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will provide the funds necessary for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I want to raise another matter, which I mentioned in passing on a previous Estimate, and that is the necessity for repairing the road from Shannonbridge to Clonmacnoise during the present year.  With all my colleagues for the constituency, and with the support and encouragement of Deputies of all Parties from the adjoining constituencies, this application was submitted, as the Parliamentary Secretary knows, to his Department some time ago, after it had been considered for a considerable time by the Department of Local Government.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows all about this case and he is definitely sympathetic. <Col N="1448" /> I hope, in co-operation with the Minister for Local Government, he will see that this essential work, which is in a sense of national importance, will be carried out this year.</P>
    <P>I am sure it is the wish of all Deputies that the historic cemetery at Clonmacnoise should be kept in a proper state of repair and that the roads leading to what is regarded as an outstanding national monument should be in a condition to enable motor cars to be used without any difficulty by visitors who come from all parts of the world to see this famous place.  From my knowledge of this road, it would be difficult for even two small motor cars to pass each other.  There is only a short road leading to Clonmacnoise and it would not entail much expenditure to put it in a proper condition.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will make his contribution a generous one. Further, he should take it as a personal responsibility to see that the work is properly carried out.  The bishop of the diocese and the energetic parish priest of Shannonbridge, who has been pressing this claim for a number of years, are extremely anxious to have the work done.  Only a small grant would be necessary.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may have some doubt on one point, and I want to remove that doubt. Apparently it has been the practice for years to allocate money from some Votes at the Parliamentary Secretary's disposal for the carrying out of essential work only in areas where there is a minimum number of unemployed. It may be correct to state that in the employment exchange area covering Clonmacnoise and Shannonbridge there is not a sufficient number of registered unemployed, but I have an assurance from the parish priest, and so have my colleagues, that if the necessary funds are made available the necessary number of persons, sons of small farmers who are not registered, together with the small number who are registered as unemployed, will be ready to carry out this work.</P>

      <P>Vote 10 provides the necessary funds for the annual programme of employment schemes in urban and rural areas, and for other related services which subserve the purpose of giving employment, including sanitary service works and the rural improvements scheme.  It also includes provision for the salaries, travelling expenses, etc., of the staff of the special employment schemes office responsible for the administration of the Vote (subheads A to E inclusive).</P>
      <P>The amount of the Estimate as compared with 1949-50 is less than in the first instance by £350,000, being the sum provided in the former year for the farm improvements scheme, now merged in the farm buildings scheme and the land rehabilitation project administered by the Department of Agriculture.  A further reduction of £80,000 has been made in respect of the seed distribution and lime distribution schemes.  The provision for the three services in question has been transferred to Vote 27.  An addition of £110,000 is provided in sub-head G for increased expenditure on sanitary service works largely due to the accumulation of arrears of these schemes during the war and the early post-war period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-heads F and G include sums of £56,000 and £184,000 respectively, being contributions towards the cost of sanitary service works undertaken by local authorities.  These items are regarded as capital services, and therefore, <Col N="1450" /> proper to be met from borrowing, as is the practice in the case of the portion of the cost provided by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The provision in sub-head K (rural improvements scheme) is to enable landholders to carry out various kinds of works for the benefit of their lands, principally small drainage schemes, and the construction and repair of accommodation roads to houses, lands and turbary.  Until recently the benefiting landholders were required to contribute one-quarter of the cost of the works, but to meet cases, mainly in the congested districts, where the farmers are unable to pay so much, a graduated scale has now been approved, with State grants ranging from 93 per cent. where the average poor law valuation of the holdings affected by a proposed work is less than £6 to 75 per cent. where the average poor law valuation is £18 or over.  Where the number of beneficiaries is less than seven, and at the same time the average poor law valuation is less than £18, the State grant is increased by 2 per cent.  To meet increased expenditure which may be expected to follow these more liberal terms, an increase of £25,000 has been made in the sub-head as compared with 1949-50.</P>
    <P>The provision under sub-head I is for the development of bogs used principally by landholders for the supply of their domestic requirements of turf.</P>
    <P>Provision for employment schemes in the various urban and rural units of area is made under sub-heads F, G and H.  The moneys are distributed broadly in proportion to the number of unemployment assistance recipients in each area.</P>
    <P>Sub-head J provides a relatively small sum to meet any remaining cases of repairs to public roads which were subjected to heavy turf transport during the emergency.</P>
    <P>Sub-head L&mdash;Miscellaneous Schemes. The provision in this sub-head is partly for contributions towards the cost of major harbour works.  The amount of the contributions in each <Col N="1451" /> case is governed by the labour content of the works in question.  The remainder of the sub-head is required to meet any special cases of unemployment which may be brought to attention during the course of the financial year.</P>

      <P>With all due respect, we are all wasting time, of which there is a limited amount for all speakers. I waste very little time and if I had been allowed to continue I would have finished by now.  I made way for the Parliamentary Secretary because otherwise he would be at sixes and sevens discussing the Estimate for which he is responsible.  That is shown by the fact that his statement has disclosed that he has altered the scale of contribution under the rural improvement schemes, in which a grant up to the maximum of 93 per cent. can be given where the valuation does not exceed £6.  That is what I understand from the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a move in the right direction.  While we are not giving the 100 per cent. grant, it is a very substantial contribution and the people benefiting will be making a token contribution, which is of great importance. For instance, when a person going to hospital is under the impression that he is paying for the cost of maintenance&mdash;though in a great many cases 90 per cent. of the cost is borne by the local authority&mdash;by paying some little contribution, he leaves the hospital with his head in the air, feeling he has not been a burden on the community. In the same way, this contribution towards the making of these roads and other minor works will mean a better return for the money expended by the State and there will be better work done.  Where employment is given to the beneficiaries, they will see to it that, when they are working in their own interests and paying something towards the cost, the works will <Col N="1453" /> give more satisfaction than under any possible system of supervision.  As I have often said before, this is one of the best schemes introduced to benefit the rural community.</P>
      <P>There is very little change under the various sub-heads of the Estimate in the past year.  I had not time to make a comparison with previous years, but I am under the impression that in certain sub-heads the Parliamentary Secretary is not making as much provision as was made in the past.  Sub-head I&mdash;Development Work in bogs used by landholders and other private producers, £60,000, is the same as last year.  I do not know if that is up to the standard that was being provided in years gone by.  In face of the existing situation, the Parliamentary Secretary would have been wise if he had increased the contribution this year, so as to boost the production of our own fuel supply.  It would have been money well expended in the interest of the nation.</P>
      <P>Sub-head J is a very important one, although the provision for it is very small.  Those who have experience of the county roads subject to very heavy traffic during the emergency know very well that they are not yet back even to the pre-war standard.  It will take a good deal of money to do that.  All Parties agree that such roads in backward areas are very important to the people living there under exacting conditions of life; in fact, they are more important than main roads are to those fortunate enough to live on the main roads.  It would be wise if larger sums were provided for the benefit of those people who, in days gone by, made their contributions as ratepayers to the upkeep and maintenance of these roads. As a result of the national emergency, heavy lorries with huge loads of turf were driven over them at high speed, for which the roads were never designed, and for that reason, if the Parliamentary Secretary had made an extra contribution, it would have been money well spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other criticism I have to offer is that, of the total amount of £954,000 provided, the Government propose to borrow £240,000, as is well <Col N="1454" /> known.  Deputies on this side of the House agree that it would be a wiser policy, in the interest of the nation and of the people as a whole, to let each year pay for itself and not be passing the burden on to posterity.  On the other hand, those who are now responsible for the government of the country seem to say to themselves: &ldquo;What do we owe to posterity?&rdquo;  I think that is a very narrow point of view to take. We should shoulder our own share of responsibility and not pass it down along the line.  A similar argument was put forward in the days gone by when it came to doing works of a public nature.  Then it was said: &ldquo;We will wait until prices fall; we will wait until such-and-such a thing happens; we will postpone the effort and let our children and our children's children bear the burden.&rdquo;  If each generation adopts a line of policy of that kind, in time to come this country will be a nice place in which to live.  If we all shed our responsibility by not paying for the provisions which are necessary each year, we are going to hand over a legacy of debt to future generations. In doing that, I hold that we will be lacking in our duty.  However, the Government of the day are responsible for that line of activity and I want to place on record that we on this side of the House do not believe in it; that we are opposed to it, as it is a bad principle for the people and for the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one matter I want to bring to the Parliamentary Secretary's attention.  As he is aware, in my constituency Bord na Móna turf production seems to have ceased.  I want to give the areas where there is a big register of unemployed persons who will have to be provided with employment this year by the Parliamentary Secretary's Department in order to replace the work which they were doing under the Bord na Móna turf scheme.  In the Pontson, Crimlin, Belderrig, Keenagh, Doobeg, Clydagh electoral divisions there was a big production of turf by Bord na Móna. These are six areas where there is a big register of young unemployed men who had full-time employment while the Bord na Móna turf production was <Col N="1455" /> in operation.  This year there will be no Bord na Móna operations in those districts, and for that reason I want those areas specially catered for so that those people will get alternative employment.</P>
      <P>In the Belderrig area there was great disappointment last year in connection with a rural improvement scheme. There are 50 unemployed young men registered in that district.  The road scheme was approved by the Department, but was not put into operation until two weeks before Christmas, with the result that these 50 registered unemployed were left idle without any hope of being able to earn anything for the Christmas season.  I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to see that the schemes in those areas will be put into operation as early as possible so as to give these people an opportunity of earning something to provide for the Christmas period.  In addition, there is the question of repairs to a road leading to Belderrig National School.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for the change he has made with regard to work on the repair of by-roads.  I appeal to him to be generous to those areas from which there are applications for the repair of by-roads.  Such a by-road may lead to a village and there may be fairly large farmers living on it who are big ratepayers. They are as much entitled to be provided with a proper road to a village as the man living along the main road.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to be generous in regard to the local contribution which will be demanded from these people who have to contribute to the cost of repairing the roads leading to their houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the Estimate, I should like to recall to the Parliamentary Secretary's memory that there was an inter-departmental committee established about 1944 which dealt with the question of rotational work in connection with minor relief schemes.  Officials representing different Departments of State did very useful work in reorganising the <Col N="1456" /> whole minor relief administration by providing for spells of work varying from five to 12 weeks according to whether it was a rural, an urban or a corporation area, altering the manner in which the unemployed were selected for work, thus enabling men who are really fit for work to be chosen for the purpose, making certain very important changes, particularly in the Dublin Corporation area, where for a long time there had been great dissatisfaction in regard to the manner in which these relief schemes were administered.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to set up a similar committee to investigate the whole question of the repair of non-public roads.  I mentioned this last year on the Estimate, but I have no doubt the Parliamentary Secretary has had many other matters to attend to as his Department covers a wide range of activity.  I would ask him, however, whether he would not be willing to set up such a committee of a purely advisory kind.  On the previous occasion the officials did excellent work. It was most complicated; it required most elaborate research into the administration and costings of the minor relief schemes of every kind throughout the country.  It required investigation into the character of the unemployed chosen for the work in areas throughout the length and breadth of the country.  I mention this because there are 20,000 miles of non-public roads.  It is an enormous mileage of road, having regard to the fact that repairs at the moment are carried out, not on a functional basis, not in relation to the condition of the road or to the number of people who live on it, but according to whether unemployment grants are available, according to whether the Land Commission consider it wise to improve a road under the improvement of estates Vote or whether enough people can be found to pay the contribution under a rural improvements scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows the problem as well as I do.  Probably it exists in his own constituency.  If you take, first of all, the minor relief grants, you have various types of areas benefiting from <Col N="1457" /> these grants.  You have certain areas in the extreme west of the country where roads have been repaired over and over again and are in almost perfect condition because of the high incidence of unemployment and where the Minister might consider in some cases actually making use of the money for a special form of land reclamation in the areas and not for roads at all. Then you have another type of area where there is a moderate number of unemployed men, where there is a large number of applications for road repairs, and where people wait their turn year after year in the hope that they will get a free grant as they do not wish to take part in a rural improvement scheme, because there are just enough unemployed and they can see the schemes being carried out every year and they hope that their particular road will be repaired under one of these schemes.  Then you have the areas where the number of unemployed is so low that very few schemes can be carried out, but the people, rather than go into a rural improvement scheme, wait for an indefinite number of years to have the roads repaired.</P>
    <P>In the year 1938-39 there were some 4,057 minor relief schemes sanctioned, indicating the high level of activity in that year and showing what can be done in the way of repairing roads when the unemployment position permits it.  At the present time very, very large numbers of persons have emigrated from these areas.  There is a position obtaining in many areas&mdash; North-West Longford, for instance, is one of them&mdash;where the farms are so small that the people do not want to go in for rural improvement schemes and where there are not enough unemployed from the Parliamentary Secretary's standpoint to warrant a minor relief scheme being granted.  In these areas the roads are continually deteriorating.  If one takes the question of bog development schemes, there are a great many border-line cases where, according to the present Administration, a grant cannot be given; at the same time there are cases where grants are given.  Some people consequently wait a long time to have their bog roads repaired.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1458" /> I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on his decision to try the experiment of altering the contribution to the improvements scheme and varying it with the valuation. I hope that he will succeed in his purpose, but I think he should publicise the scheme a bit more.  I have been around Longford telling people about this.  One cannot always rely on the local newspapers reporting the Parliamentary Secretary, and there should be some publicity in regard to that new plan.  I might add that the rural improvements scheme started with the previous Government and has been in operation for some years, but it has never been a highly popular scheme.</P>
    <P>As I understand, in the financial year, 1949-50, there were some 591 sanctions issued, but that at that moment there were 700 applications outstanding from previous years.  To be quite fair to the Parliamentary Secretary, I believe the delay in inspections was not his responsibility; it was shared between him and the previous Parliamentary Secretary.  When the scheme started there were not sufficient inspectors, and there was a backlog of applications awaiting attention.  The figure certainly indicates that the scheme is not as popular as it might be, and something more needs to be done to publicise it and make it acceptable to the people.</P>
    <P>With regard to non-public roads, so far as I can gather from answers to parliamentary questions in the year 1949-50, about £204,000 was made available for the repair of roads under the three heads&mdash;minor relief schemes, rural improvement schemes and bog development schemes.  That was based on an estimate made in the Parliamentary Secretary's office to distinguish between expenditure on roads and other works.  The corresponding amount in 1938-39 was £301,000.  As we have been told already, £225 now will do the work that £100 did in 1938-39 on roads because of the increase in the cost of wages and the materials used in connection with this type of work.  That reduces the figure for the last financial year to about £90,000.  Whatever figure one divides <Col N="1459" /> into the 20,000 miles of public roads, whether one takes the actual figure of £204,000, and even adding to it the amount spent by the Land Commission on the improvement of roads, if that is divided into the total mileage of public roads to find out how much is provided per mile the answer is infinitesimal.  The answer is that there remains this great group of roads upon which expenditure is negligible.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that that is one of the main contributory causes to emigration. I had occasion to speak to a prominent auctioneer who sells small farms in a certain part of the country and he gave me figures showing the very great decrease that has taken place in the price of residential farms according to whether they are situated on public or non-public roads and the tendency for non-residential farms, far back along a non-public road, to become derelict.  As a consequence of that, the residence becomes perhaps the home of an agricultural worker and the farm becomes an out-farm. Everybody knows that that is happening throughout the country.  It was happening during our period in office. We had the excuse that the damage done to the roads was due mainly to turf development and the consequential effects of the world war in general made it impossible for us to consider a new technical method of repairing and maintaining the non-public roads of the country.  I think we can well be excused for having postponed that matter.  If the Parliamentary Secretary will read my observations on it in the course of a discussion on a private member's motion he will find that I was quite frank and admitted that the matter could not be postponed indefinitly and that, no matter what the cost may be to county councils and no matter what problems and difficulties arise, sooner or later the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Local Government should appoint an advisory committee to go into the question and see what can be done for the repair of non-public roads on a technical basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1460" /> I would like to conclude by adverting to the value of these works in connection with unemployment.  There are parts of Longford where neither the Local Authorities (Works) Act nor the land rehabilitation scheme by themselves can provide enough employment in the winter months to satisfy the people living on boggy, moory land, particularly in the north-west of the county.  Whatever effort is made by the Government to give employment in these areas, there is a definite gap and a gap which is very discouraging to men living on small farms who hitherto looked forward to that work in the winter months.  There seems to be a reluctance among them to register for unemployment.  The fact of being able to do turf work in the summer months during the war period brought money to the household and a great many families ceased to register during the winter months.  Some of them have a certain amount of pride about going back on to the exchange.  As a result of that, it is possible that some of them may consider emigrating, though they might not otherwise have considered it in the past.  The whole matter boils down to the question of trying to reorganise the repair of the non-public roads on the basis of a modified administration, bearing in mind technical and employment considerations.  I would like to hear the Parliamentary Secretary say he would at least attempt the job of appointing a committee.  This would do no harm and it might do inestimable good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Childers has covered most of the ground perhaps better than I can do it.  I am frankly disappointed with the position at the end of two years of administration by the present Parliamentary Secretary. Coming from the West of Ireland, I had anticipated better results than have been obtained in relation to the minor relief and bog development schemes.  As I pointed out last year, if one has not got the money one cannot do the work.  Last year the money was insufficient.  It is altogether insufficient again this year.  I think that is a great mistake.  The people in the plains may not be interested in this matter.  In the poor districts <Col N="1461" /> in the West of Ireland and, possibly, in the north the question of providing money for the repair of by-roads, bog roads and bog development generally is all important.  The people in these areas cannot make a living on the little farms they have.  In the county that I represent, in the very first year this Government took office, on the instructions of the auditor the amount of money spent was surcharged&mdash;I think to the tune of something like £4,000.  Now the manager applied for a remission and got that remission together with a warning that these by-roads were not to be repaired in future.  The result was that, not merely those by-roads but all others that might be of doubtful legality, were cut off the list.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielORourke" hpid="Mr. O'Rourke Mr. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>They were cut off because the auditor had made surcharges in respect of a number that had been done for years.  I know it is not the Parliamentary Secretary's Department that is responsible.  Those by-roads were cut off as regards repairs, and the county council can do nothing about them.  The sad fact is that nobody is doing anything about them.  A deputation was sent by the county council to the then Minister for Local Government, the late Mr. Murphy&mdash;Go ndéanfaidh Dia trocaire ar a anam&mdash;and we asked him to try and have these roads put in a legal position so to speak, or to get the auditor to allow them to go through for repairs.  The net result of the interview was that he said he could not do anything about them.  He did promise that he would bring those roads and others to the attention of the Board of Works, and try to get them done under that Department.  I have no evidence so far that anything has been done.  I have very strong evidence pointing to the fact that those roads are now more neglected than ever.  I do not know where the matter is going to finish up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I go about a good deal, and there is hardly anywhere I go that I have not complaints about the desperate condition of those by-roads.  It is hard to blame people if they think that it is <Col N="1462" /> not fair that they should have to contribute specially to rural improvement schemes when, in fact, they are contributing in the rates to the general upkeep of all other roads in the county.  That did not start under this Government.  It went on in the past so that these by-roads are being treated as if they were something like an outcast.  There is nothing done about them.  I have been in the Parliamentary Secretary's county and I have found there, too, a very large number of families, living on by-roads, who are in the same plight as those I speak of.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers, I think, dealt very ably with this question.  I quite agree with him that something should be done about it.  We should either have new legislation permitting the county councils to repair these roads, or the Board of Works should be given authority to do them.  Even when they were being done, they were never done sufficiently.  I have in mind a number of bog development schemes, bog roads and bog drains for which I personally applied for a grant.  I have been patiently hoping to get a grant some day, but, so far, my hopes have been in vain.  I imagine that many people who do not live in the boggy districts do not fully understand the importance of these bog development schemes.  The people in those areas can hardly be said to have holdings of land at all.  Their valuations range from about £2 to £5.  They have merely patches of reclaimed bog in most cases.  For generations they have been depending on the production of hand-won turf to supplement whatever little income they have to enable them to keep their families. When the roads become unusable, and when the bog drains get choked up so that they cannot get the turf out, well, that spells disaster for them.  I know that a good deal was done in years gone by, but a bog drain does not remain open long.  It closes up again.  When the drains do close up they have to be reopened and cleaned up.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to bog roads. If you have 30, 40 or 100 families using carts on them, they will get cut up in a few weeks.  In many cases, too, there <Col N="1463" /> should be a continuation of the existing roads by connecting them with others. I think that should be one of the objects of a rural improvement scheme to try and connect existing roads with new roads.  If that were done, it would be possible for the county councils to take over those roads and keep them in repair.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers welcomed the improvement in the conditions as regards rural improvement schemes.  I agree, too, that it is a good thing.  The 90 per cent. grant is the highest that has ever been given.  It would be desirable if the Department could give the full 100 per cent., because in many of those areas the people who would benefit are very poor indeed.  There is a point on that which I want to make, and it is that I am afraid the new regulations have not got sufficient publicity.  I am afraid that very few, in fact, of those who live in the poorer districts are aware of the change that has been made.  They are still of the opinion that they would have to put up 25 per cent. which, of course, in their case would be prohibitive.  Even when the 25 per cent. had to be put up, some very good schemes indeed were done. Nowadays, there is the possibility of getting minor drainage work done under the Works Act.  Even before that Act was passed, some very useful work was done under the old rural improvement schemes.  There should be more work done now, especially in regard to roads and drains.  I think that would be the case if steps were taken to bring to the notice of the people the change that has been made.</P>
    <P>The employment side of this is very important.  Deputy Childers also referred to it.  In the constituency which I represent we have, even to a much greater extent, those poor areas such as he has referred to, people with little patches of land which are not sufficient to support even two or three people.  If they cannot find something to supplement their small incomes, well then there is nothing for them but to emigrate.  That has been the case over a very large area in the County Roscommon, especially in the extreme southern end, the west and <Col N="1464" /> the north-west.  There, again, minor relief jobs and bog development jobs are of the greatest importance.  I want to emphasise, as he did, that the winter time is the slack period.  With the road work that is in hands and with the drainage work under the new schemes, there will be employment for the big majority of the people, but from October to March next will be the slack period.  I appealed to the Parliamentary Secretary last year to try and get a supplementary grant. The amount of this Vote is not at all sufficient.  It is almost useless for the purpose that he should have in mind. I would again appeal to him to try and get a supplementary grant to help out those poor people who live in the boggy areas, both from the point of view of providing them with road accommodation to their homes and to the bogs, as well as providing them with employment during the winter months when work is slack.</P>

      <P>With regard to these minor relief schemes the position unfortunately is that they are only carried out in an area where a certain number of people are unemployed.  I think that very good national work could be done if a proper selection was made as regards the schemes to be done, and if sufficient money were allocated for the purpose by the Government to those areas which are really most in need of such schemes. I am afraid that under the present system we are not getting a proper return from the minor relief schemes &mdash;that is when we confine them to areas where a certain number of people are unemployed.  I feel strongly on this because I know a lot of work that could be done, but which is not covered either by the county councils or by any of these schemes. The result is that the people in such areas are suffering considerably. Deputy Childers and Deputy O'Rourke have dealt with the cul-de-sac roads which seem to be nobody's baby.</P>

    <P>If minor relief schemes could be carried out on roads adjacent to an area in which there were people unemployed, it would provide work for these people and at the same time <Col N="1465" /> enable a considerable amount of useful schemes to be carried out.  In my constituency it often happens that you have a big labour content in one end of the county and work is carried out that could easily be carried out by the county council instead of being carried out under minor relief schemes.  If there was a proper survey, steps could be taken beforehand to see that certain roads which fell into a bad condition were repaired the following year.  In the same way, minor relief schemes to prevent coast erosion might be carried out, though I believe coast erosion is not recognised by the Department as a work upon which this money could be spent.  Nevertheless, these are works of national importance and I urge on the Parliamentary Secretary that some change should be made in the method of dealing with them.  I welcome the alteration in the contribution.  Of course it will not affect my constituency very much because the valuations are higher than, say, in the West of Ireland, from which I came originally. The alteration will not afford very much relief to County Dublin, but nevertheless it will be a help to some people, and if the Parliamentary Secretary could give further relief in that direction it would be welcomed.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Davin would only hold his tongue I might be able to proceed.  I think the Deputy got plenty of time to say all he had to say <Col N="1467" /> on the Estimate.  From time to time we have been pressing on the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department the necessity for carrying out a number of minor relief schemes all over the country.  He hides behind the fact that schemes can only be provided where the number of unemployed reach a certain figure in a particular electoral division.  So far as I understand, local employment schemes are coupled with peat schemes.  There are local employment schemes and peat development schemes and when we ask the Parliamentary Secretary questions in regard to these matters, we find that there is an entirely new departure in the type of reply we get.  If I ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether it is his intention to carry out certain work in certain areas during the coming winter, if the individual who made the application recently happens to be one of the Parliamentary Secretary's key men, his name will be mentioned as the only person who has applied recently, but if he is some other individual, who has not been tied up with the Parliamentary Secretary's organisation, there is no question of any name being mentioned.  The whole idea is in keeping with the policy that is being put into operation in my constituency since the schemes were taken over from the county council and run directly by the Board of Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before proceeding further, I want to make it quite clear that I am quite satisfied that there are in the Board of Works officials who are as good, as honest and as sincere as are to be found in any other Department and it is because we have these particular types of officials in that Department that things are being run on reasonably straight lines.  As I was about to say, the only man who need apply in my constituency at the moment for a position as a ganger is a key man of a certain organisation and the only individual who can apply successfully for a relief scheme is a key man in that organisation.  Moneys of this nature are provided by the State to do two things&mdash;to provide employment for people who are in urgent need of employment and, secondly, to do an essential <Col N="1468" /> type of work required in certain localities.  Any questions I have put down on this matter have been put down with the object of being helpful to the Parliamentary Secretary in getting as much money spent in my constituency as possible.  I always understood that Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries have a certain difficulty in their own Department because there are people in these Departments who are not prepared to make money available for these works. Quite recently, I had quite a number of questions regarding minor employment schemes, but on the 28th June I put down a general question to which I received the most evasive type of reply that was ever given to any question in this House.  I asked the Minister whether:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In view of the number of displaced bog workers still unemployed in each electoral division in the rural districts of Tuam, Glenamaddy and Mountbellew, he will consider making an extra sum available from the Employment and Emergency Schemes Vote for the repair and reconstruction of the numerous village and bog roads in those areas which are now in a deplorable condition.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary's reply was that on the 24th June only 126 people were registered as unemployed or, in other words, an average of two people in each electoral division.  The Parliamentary Secretary knew of course that that was an evasive reply. While there may be one or two areas where there would be no unemployed there would certainly be areas&mdash;and he knew it as well as I do&mdash;where a large number of people would be unemployed. We have them at the moment in Dunmore, Tuam and Glenamaddy, and in a whole number of other places.  While the number of registered unemployed may have dropped, it has dropped because a very large number of people have been disqualified from unemployment benefit because they have not been able to avail of the offers of work which would mean travelling to Kildare or elsewhere. Surely the Parliamentary Secretary must know as well as I do that there are a large number of <Col N="1469" /> people in my constituency who because of certain circumstances cannot travel to Kildare, while if work were made available to them at home everybody knows that they would jump to it.  I will challenge anyone here to say that if the county council started a scheme on any road throughout the whole county&mdash;probably the same thing applies to Mayo&mdash;if the Board of Works started a road or drainage scheme, or if anybody else comes in to-morrow morning to start any type of scheme, that they will not be flooded out with people applying for employment immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is not held up. Dams were put down and ructions were made locally because the dams were flooding the land.  Was that because there was no work?  A new gang were brought in on Monday.  So why tell a deliberate untruth?  If any work is started to-morrow morning the workers are available and willing. This thing of hiding behind the <Col N="1470" /> number of registered unemployed in any particular area is only driving the fool further.</P>
      <P>We have a number of very important peat schemes and the people cannot possibly get their turf out.  I think that more money should be made available for bog roads and a case could have been made by the Parliamentary Secretary, if he tried, to have much more money made available because he knows the position.  I am not mentioning those things because they do not exist; I am mentioning them because every day when I go back my own people complain to me and in every part of my constituency that I visit people complain to me about the bog roads, and the Parliamentary Secretary knows that it is the truth.  Due to the rain that fell during the last fortnight the turf is left in the bogs and people must wait for the fine weather until they get a chance of taking it out.  Prior to taking this office the Parliamentary Secretary himself made a case for more money to be allocated to this type of work, and he should now have made an effort to get the Minister for Finance to put up more money.  It would not merely do very useful work which is badly required, but it gives employment to people who cannot get employment anywhere in the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any of the places where I have seen the new system of allocating money on rural improvement schemes the offers have not been satisfactory, nor have they been availed of, and I am afraid that a still further system will have to be provided.  During the past fortnight I had a number of questions, and when I go back to these people I find that they still cannot do the work on the basis of the new offer and I find that in general there is not much change.  There may be a reduction from £75 to £65, but that is not very helpful, as a lot of those people are very small farmers.  Not alone that, but a number of people travel over these roads into land or for some other purpose, who will never contribute anything at all and although 20, 30 or 40 people may use those roads, at least to some small extent, when it comes to putting up the money <Col N="1471" /> under a rural improvements scheme, it always falls on four or five people. The others are not prepared to contribute at all, because they do not use the road every day.  I do not think that the present scheme meets in any way the motion which was tabled in this House some time ago. It may have gone some very small distance, but it has not materially altered the position at all.  The Parliamentary Secretary and his Department will find after a very short time that this new system is no improvement on the old one and that some other system must be provided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was my intention to make the usual introductory statement, but I took it that the Vote was agreed to and that Deputy Davin was merely raising a point.  Deputy Killilea raised a point about the statement not being made, but he was missing from the House.  Knowing that Estimate No. 10 was coming up for discussion&mdash;the Board of Works Vote, as he calls it; it is the Special Employment Schemes Vote&mdash;he took a little run out to read his oration of last year, because he started off as he started last year, talking about gangers and so on.  To make it worse, he said that it is only works in which people in a certain organisation are interested that are being done.  As I explained last year, I have not got the selection of the works and neither have I the appointment of gangers. It is the Special Employment Schemes Office which appoints them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Killilea started another here about the unemployed.  I could quite understand a Deputy from Galway, and from North Galway in particular, talking that kind of stuff if he were talking to a Parliamentary Secretary who lived in Cavan, Kildare or Louth, but he must realise that I live in the very centre of the area he every Friday night and return on Monday or Tuesday morning.  I live amongst these people and I know them well.  One would imagine from Deputy Killilea's statement that, whenever he goes into Dunmore, Glenamaddy, Williamstown, Creggs, <Col N="1472" /> Kilkerrin or Mountbellew he is immediately surrounded by registered unemployed people looking for work as an alternative to emigrating, as he says.  That, of course, is not the case at all.  There are no unemployed people whatever in that area.  The fact is that, in all that area, two small grants in Dunmore North, in the Clooneyquin area, where Deputy Killilea said the two jobs were not going to be done, of £60 or £70 each, represent all the money we could spend last year amongst the North Galway registered unemployed.  Still Deputy Killilea talks in this fashion, when the position is that men cannot be got at any price.  As a matter of fact, some bog development works which we had in progress there had to be closed down.  Deputy Killilea knows well that a certain county council job of £1,000 on the Island River in the Ballymore-Williamstown area had to be closed down for six months because the necessary men could not be got.  What, then, is the use of coming to the House and indulging in all this fudge?</P>
    <P>Every Deputy was inclined to congratulate me on the rural improvements scheme except Deputy Killilea. I was happy to accept the congratulations of Deputy Childers, because I think he was one of those who went into the Lobby and voted against it, as, of course, did Deputy Kitt and Deputy Killilea.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was absent again.  Deputy Beegan challenged a vote on it, and the Deputy probably walked into the Lobby without knowing what the vote was about.  A change was made in the old rural improvements scheme, because three-quarters of the time of the staff was wasted in going down to see people who made application and estimating the cost and so on.  When they came back and the people were told that <Col N="1473" /> their contribution of 25 per cent. was so much, we found they were not able to contribute and the scheme fell through.  That happened in at least 90 per cent. of the cases, especially in the poorer areas represented by Deputy Killilea and myself.  In cases where two farmers with valuations of perhaps £100 or £200 applied and qualified under the scheme, they were well able to contribute their 25 per cent. of the cost, but where you had nine or ten small farmers with valuations of £2, £3 or £4, they were not able to contribute, and the result was that the people whom the scheme was mainly intended to benefit were unable to avail of it.</P>
      <P>As a result of a motion sponsored by Deputy Commons and Deputy Beirne asking for a 90 per cent. contribution, I went back to the Government and got them to consent&mdash;willingly, I should say&mdash;to a scheme under which, where the valuations are under £5 or £6, we give a grant of 95 per cent.  The grants go up on a sliding tion goes over £18, that is, the average valuation of the land accommodated by the particular road, they are asked to contribute the 25 per cent.  as was the case under the old scheme.  Deputy Childers said honestly enough that the scheme did not get enough publicity, but all we could do was to give it publicity in all the local newspapers and the daily papers.  I ask Deputies now to co-operate with us and to make its advantages known where they are not at present known; but so far as I can see the scheme is very well known, and people are taking every opportunity to avail of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I have to say to the people of the Twenty-Six Countries, and of Galway in particular, who may have been poisoned by certain statements, is that where they are not able to contribute and where they can make the case, we can give them a full cost grant.  If their valuations are low, we can bring the amount up on a sliding scale until we give 95 per cent. of the cost, their contribution being 5 per cent.  For every £100 of the cost, we give £95, and they contribute £5, in respect of a <Col N="1474" /> road into their own houses or into their own villages.  If that does not suit them, I am not going to butter their bread on both sides.  I think it is a very good change, and I ask Deputies to let it be known to any of these people in the backward areas who do not know about it.  I am sure that all Deputies have an interest in these neglected people, and I can assure them that, coming from that area myself, I have a very keen interest in them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin referred to the Ballylinn Road.  That is a matter I will look into.  I can assure him that, if the people cannot afford to pay, we will do the best we can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>But let them not try to wipe our eye, because we will not let them do that.  With regard to the Clonmacnoise road, I am very interested in it and we will not stand in the way of the necessary work being done, as I am sure the Deputy appreciates. Deputy O'Grady referred to the rural improvements scheme as a move in the right direction.  I agree that it is.  Deputies appear to be confused about certain schemes.  Deputy O'Rourke raised the point that £60,000 is not enough for bog-road development. Heavy turf traffic has ceased.  The coal famine is over.  There is not now as much turf being carried over these roads as there was when the county councils were using the bogs.  Last year we discovered that, while £60,000 did not do all that was necessary, it certainly satisfied the people in several areas.  Deputy Killilea, I think, said that none of this money was spent in Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say none of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy said very little of it was spent in Galway.  I hope I am not giving myself away when I say that there was more money spent on the development of bog roads under that scheme in Galway last year than ever was spent before. Probably it was not spent around <Col N="1475" /> Deputy Killilea's home, but some of it was spent in Galway, I want to assure him.</P>
      <P>As regards the minor employment schemes, of course, we can only give full cost grants where there is a number of registered unemployed.  The money under that sub-head is not voted in this House for making roads or drains anywhere. That money is voted for doing those works in areas where there is a sufficient number of registered unemployed. Deputy Burke, on one occasion, put down a question to me as regards the number of registered unemployed in a certain area in North County Dublin.  I told him there was none. He would not believe me.  He came to me afterwards and I gave him the exact list and it surprised him.  Many people will tell you they are registered unemployed but on inquiry you will find that they are not registered.</P>
      <P>As regards the suggestion put forward by Deputy Childers as to the setting up of a commission of inquiry in connection with these roads, I believe I will do that.  I think it is necessary that it should be done.  We are advancing to a certain extent, but we do not know exactly in what direction we are advancing.  Probably this year we will set up such a commission of inquiry and I am sure the Deputy will be of assistance to me in that.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Rourke raised a point as regards certain roads that the council were doing in Roscommon.  The county manager has sent in a list of these by-roads under the new rural improvement scheme.  We will look into that matter and, if it is possible, we will give a grant to the extreme limit.</P>
      <P>I am very grateful to all the Deputies for their contributions to the debate and for their suggestions.  I will consider them and anything I can do during the coming year will be done. I believe that the Special Employment Schemes Office is the one office that deals, so to speak, with the needy in the matter of roads, by-roads, drains, and I will assist them in any way I can. Deputy Killilea took great exception to the fact that I made reference to the people who made application&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. MacBride) Seán MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. MacBride)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £239,600 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1951, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for External Affairs, and of certain Services administered by that Office (No. 16 of 1924), including a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of this Vote shows an increase over the similar provision <Col N="1477" /> last year.  The increase amounts to £80,000 odd and the particular subheads under which the increased expenditure arises are shown in detail in the Vote.</P>
    <P>I propose to begin by dealing with the strictly financial aspects of this Vote.  My reason for adopting this course is that the fact that we are now spending more than before on our external affairs has been the subject of criticism by Deputies opposite.  I know that they have compared the present expenditure on this Vote with what it was when they left office, and have used the contrast to support the charge that money is being spent on our external relations on an unnecessarily lavish scale.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to criticism of public expenditure.  On the contrary, I realise that that is one of the primary functions of the Opposition in any democratic assembly.  But criticism, to be of any value, must be informed criticism.  Vague and unsubstantiated charges of extravagance, unrelated to concrete facts, are not only valueless in themselves, but they can be positively harmful to the national interest.  I think it only right to give Deputies opposite an opportunity of relating anything they have to say about the increased expenditure under this vote to the specific circumstances which have occasioned it, and, for that purpose, I want to analyse briefly the reasons for the additional expenditure on external affairs&mdash;not as compared with last year, because I know that that is not what Deputies opposite are interested in&mdash;but as compared with the last Vote which the previous Government prepared before going out of office, the Vote for the financial year 1948-49.</P>
    <P>The difference between that Vote and the Vote which I am now presenting to the Dáil is £185,000 odd.  I think that, in order to get a realistic figure of the increase, we must deduct from that total the sum of £8,000 provided under sub-head C4 of this year's Vote to cover expenses in connection with the Holy Year.  This is a fortuitous and non-recurrent item which does not form part of the normal increase on <Col N="1478" /> the Vote and will not appear in the Vote next year.  Deducting that £8,000, we get a net figure of £177,000 odd as the amount of the increased expenditure on this Vote since the Fianna Fáil Government left office.</P>
    <P>This increase is mainly due to three distinct factors which, between them, account for over 85 per cent. of the increase.  The first is the fall in the exchange value of sterling due to the devaluation last September.  Certain currencies, of course, readjusted their official exchange rates so as to maintain the previous parity with the £ sterling.  But others, including the American and Canadian dollars, the Swiss franc and&mdash;although to a lesser extent&mdash;the Belgian franc, did not do so.  So far as these countries were concerned, therefore, the effect of the 30 per cent. depreciation of the £ last September is that the foreign currencies which we require to pay, not only for salaries and allowances, but for local wages, rents, office expenses and so on, are now costing us 40 per cent. more in Irish currency than they did before.  The effect of this is spread over several different sub-heads in the Vote and the aggregate cost is not, therefore, immediately apparent on the face of the Vote itself.  I have had the necessary calculations made, however, and the aggregate cost to this Vote of the devaluation of sterling last September comes out as between £50,000 and £55,000.  Therefore, approximately 30 per cent. of the increase of £177,000 to this Vote within the last two years is attributable to this single factor of devaluation&mdash;a factor entirely unrelated to any increase or expansion of the services provided for in this Vote.  I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; the Committee to sit again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he is in a position to state when work will start on the proposed new national schools at Ballincolling, Kilmurry (Crookstown) and Knocknamanagh, Minane Bridge, County Cork.</P>

      <P>I understand from the Commissioners of Public Works that the working drawings and <Col N="1480" /> specification for the proposed new Ballincollig National School have been completed.  The official lease of the school site is at present with the manager's solicitors for signature by the local parties.  When the lease has been completed the Commissioners of Public Works will proceed to have bills of quantities drawn up preparatory to the invitation of tenders for the erection of the building.</P>
      <P>In the case of the proposed new Kilmurry National School certain arrangements have still to be made as regards the production of evidence of title to the site, so as to enable the plot to be vested in trustees before a grant towards the cost of the new building can be sanctioned.</P>
      <P>The Department has sanctioned a grant for the new Knocknamanagh School.  The arrangements for the erection of the building will be in the hands of the Commissioners of Public Works, who will now have the working drawings and specification prepared. It will also be necessary to have the site vested in trustees by an official lease.  This lease is being prepared by the Department's legal adviser, and it is hoped that it will shortly be issued to the manager's solicitor for signature by the local parties.</P>
      <P>I am not therefore in a position to say when work will start on the erection of these three schools.</P>

With regard to the Kilmurry school, it will not be possible to fix a grant until the evidence of title has been produced. Immediately it is produced it will be possible to fix the grant and, as far as the Department of Education is concerned, it is on the priority list for allotting the grant straight away once the legal formalities are completed.</P>

These representations were carefully considered by the company, but the conclusion was reached that the provision of such a stop would not be feasible.  The travelling creamery operating near this area could not cater for an extra stop, and it would be quite impracticable to put an additional travelling creamery into operation to cater solely for this district.  I would suggest that the farmers concerned should co-operate in making arrangements for the conveyance of their combined milk supplies to the nearest separating station or travelling creamery stop, as is at present being done by farmers in many other areas.</P>

      <P>I can assure Deputy Derrig that the scheme embarked upon is designed to benefit to the maximum degree the apple growers of that area <Col N="1492" /> and other areas concerned, but in order to make the relatively expensive installation requisite successfully to carry on this business, one must aim at a minimum area of 1,000 acres of apples, and it is not easy to get that area in any restricted district.

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware of the unfairness arising from the present system of revision of valuations on the initiation of rate collectors owing to the dissimilar interpretation of their duty by these officials and the resulting variation in the degree of their activity, some initiating large numbers of cases for revision while others take practically no action; and, if so, whether he will introduce proposals for legislation to amend the law so as to provide a system of revision of valuations which will have a more uniform effect on all concerned.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to judge the extent of any unfairness which dissimilar interpretation by rate collectors of their duty to list properties for revision of valuation and the resulting variation in their activity in that respect may give rise to.  The annual list of valuations submitted by each rating authority to the Valuation Office for revision is merely a summary of what is furnished by rate collectors and ratepayers.</P>
      <P>The present system which has been in operation for close on a century, while perhaps not ideal, has in practice been reasonably satisfactory.  This matter has, however, been kept under review since 1948 and I am now having the position specially examined with a view to seeing what steps&mdash;including enactment of amending legislation, if necessary&mdash;might be taken towards achieving a better system.</P>

      <P>No.  As I said, what comes to the Valuation Office is merely a summary of what may be furnished either by rate collectors or ratepayers and the list does not distinguish between what has been initiated by a ratepayer and what has been initiated by a rate collector.  I am having a review made of rate collectors' duties, which have accumulated over a period. I would not like the Deputy to feel that I am accepting his view that there has been a spate of increased valuation. The latest figures I have show that whereas pre-war any one year shows an increase of 2 to 2½ per cent. on the previous year, the situation now is that, after nine years during which no valuation was done, the average increase is about 4 per cent.</P>

      <P>The Cork Harbour Board is comprised of 23 members, two of whom are appointed directly by the live-stock industry.  An election is due to take place this year.  Under the provisions of the Harbours Act, 1946, four vacancies are filled by ministerial nominations.  These nominations are not made until the other vacancies have been filled.  It is my intention in making nominations to this and other harbour boards to have regard to the desirability of ensuring that important local interests will be represented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.D. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state (1) the prices paid for hides by (a) British tanners, and (b) Irish tanners, and (2) the prices charged for leather by (a) British tanners, and (b) Irish tanners.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the first part of the Deputy's question refers to native hides.  The current price payable by Irish tanners for firstclass native hides is 8d. per lb.  I have no information about the prices paid by British tanners for native hides, the prices of which were decontrolled as from the 1st July, 1950.</P>
      <P>Regarding the second part of the Deputy's question, it is not practicable, owing to the varieties of leather in use, to give comparable prices for leather produced in each country.</P>
      <P>As to the prices charged for leather by Irish tanners, I would refer the Deputy to the tabular statement circulated in the Official Report in reply to a question asked by him on the 1st March, 1950, which showed the prices of the main products of each tannery in September, 1949.  Since then the prices of some of these products have increased, the increases being in the region of 3d. per lb. for bends and 6d. per square foot for box sides.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the price of Irish hides is 8d. per lb. and the price paid by the British tanners is 19½d. per lb. and that the price charged for leather by Irish tanners is as high as the price charged by British tanners, even though the latter pay practically three times the price for the hides?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, of course, if he has investigated this matter and made inquiries, must be aware that the figures were arrived at in two completely different circumstances.  The whole basis of the price of hides and the price of leather in Great Britain is completely different from the basis on which the prices are arrived at here. The Deputy is further aware that there was a fairly substantial increase in the price paid for native hides in this country in the last few months and that the increase in the price of leather is very largely, if not entirely, due to the increased price paid for hides.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.D. Lehane</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.D. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>How the Minister can say that the increase in the price in the leather is due to the increase in the price of hides is most amazing.  The price of leather here is just as high as in Great Britain where they are paying 20d. per lb. for hides.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy ought to tell the whole story, if he is conversant with it.  He ought to give information regarding the way in which prices are subsidised on the British side, an element which does not enter into the position here.</P>

The observations made there will be utilised, in conjunction with similar observations from a number of other stations in Ireland and abroad, for the making of forecasts at Shannon and Dublin Airports.</P>

It should not be assumed that maximum grants from the fund would be available by reason of the fact that a local authority may fix rents on levels determined with the object of receiving maximum grants.  I have not the particulars which would enable me to furnish the Deputy with a reply to this part of the question.</P>

      <P>(1) Tenants of 60,590 labourers' cottages are entitled to purchase their cottages under the Labourers Act, 1936.  (2) Approximately 8,000 cottages have so far been vested. A number of reasons have been given by county managers in explanation of the refusal of tenants to avail themselves of the terms of the Act.  These reasons include disinclination to take on liability for repairs, objection to the period of the purchase annuity, the amount of the annuity, discouraging effect of delay due to title difficulties and absence of provision to enable tenants to acquire by payment of lump sums.</P>

    <P>The extent to which practical steps can be taken by amending legislation to promote purchase under more attractive conditions and to facilitate <Col N="1512" /> vesting is at present under active consideration but I am not yet in a position to state when such amending legislation can be introduced.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1514" /> I assume the Deputies are referring to the nursing staffs of district mental hospitals.  The scales of remuneration of the nursing staffs in the provincial mental hospitals were the subject of a careful review as recently as 1947 when revised scales were introduced and since that date these officers have, in common with the general body of local authority employees, received an upward revision of their remuneration by way of bonus.  I do not feel that I would be justified in present circumstances in agreeing to a further upward revision for these officers in isolation from the other classes of local authority officers for whom I am responsible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the staffs, apart from those in Grangegorman and Portrane, are sufficiently paid having regard to the extra number of years it takes to qualify for a permanent appointment in these hospitals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the members of the mental hospital staffs are any better or worse paid than the other officers in the local authority service for whom I am responsible.  In the circumstances, I think that there is no need at the moment for a review of their conditions of service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is it that there is differentiation between the various mental hospitals down the country and those in Dublin&mdash;£50, I think on the maximum?  In Dublin they reach the maximum in four years; and in the country it takes 12.  They have the same work to do and the cost of living in Ballinasloe and Sligo is just as high as it is in Dublin.  I think the staffs in the mental hospitals down the country deserve better treatment</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, affecting Private Members in this House.  I intended in the debate on the Department of the Minister for Justice to raise a certain matter, as I have already informed you. When I had started to develop the point in question I was informed by the Chair that the matter was <i>sub judice</i> and, accordingly, I refrained from dilating upon it.  It subsequently transpired from a statement made by the Minister for Justice that the matter <Col N="1517" /> was not, in fact, <i>sub judice</i> and that, in some way or another, the Chair had been misled&mdash;I do not know by whom &mdash;but it felt that it would be in their particular interest to stifle debate on that question.</P>
      <P>I, Sir, would suggest to you that this was not merely an abuse of the confidence and reliance which the Chair must place in the words of members of this House, but that it was also a gross violation of the rights of Deputies of Dáil Éireann to express criticism and to give voice to the information which they have in regard to the administration of a Government Department. I am rising to ask what steps the Chair proposes to take to ensure that, in future, its confidence and the authority which it exercises will not be taken advantage of by such a trick to prevent the publication of other grievances.</P>
      <P>While I am on my feet, I would like to say another word.  In the course of the debate yesterday, I used the word &ldquo;sanatorium&rdquo; instead of the word &ldquo;hospital.&rdquo;  I want to make it clear that I had not the regional sanatorium in Galway in mind.</P>

I understand that the only basis for the action taken by the Chair yesterday in preventing me from speaking on this matter was the word of a Deputy, and that word, apparently, was not a word which could be relied upon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. MacBride)</NameTxt>
      <P>The second of the three factors which I mentioned is the development within the last two years of the E.R.P.  I wonder whether Deputies are aware of the magnitude and scale of the operations which the working of the E.R.P. involves.  If anyone thinks that participation in the programme is simply a question of indicating the extent of your needs and receiving the dollars necessary to cover them, he is very much mistaken.  On the contrary, the operation of the plan is based on an elaborate and highly technical administrative machinery, which includes, among other things, the preparation of advance programmes by the participating countries, the clearance of those programmes with the O.E.E.C. in Paris, the examination of import applications to ensure that they come within the scope of the programme, the issue of authorisations in respect of approved imports, and a detailed auditing procedure necessary to secure the reimbursement in dollars of the cost of consignments from the E.C.A. in Washington. The magnitude of the work involved in all this may be gathered from the fact that, up to date, our allocations under the E.R.P. have totalled over $131,000,000, of which we have received in dollar reimbursements from the E.C.A. in Washington, after completion of all the programming, <Col N="1519" /> authorisation and auditing procedures required, over $88,000,000.</P>
      <P>This has involved additional staff. Deputies may say, of course, that this necessary staff has been provided on an unduly lavish scale.  I think I have as sharp an eye for public economy as anyone in the House, and I say that this is not the case.  So far as headquarters is concerned, I think it would be difficult to find in the Civil Service more hard-working and zealous staff than have been handling E.R.P. matters in my Department and I know that, with their utmost efforts, they are constantly hard put to it to complete important work with the necessary degree of promptitude.  I have had the unusual experience of hearing not only officials of the O.E.E.C., but even representatives of other countries taking part in that organisation, making comment on the inadequacy of our staff provision in Paris.  The staff in Washington was increased as much at the instance of the Minister for Finance as on my initiative because it was found in his Department that the necessary reimbursement procedures could not be carried through without serious difficulties and delays in the absence of staff in Washington to handle them at that end.</P>
      <P>The third factor which has contributed to the increased expenditure on this Vote is the new provision made throughout the Vote, and particularly under the heading &ldquo;Miscellaneous&rdquo;, for the improvement of our information services abroad.  This work, I agree, is a matter of policy, and I propose to deal with it in some detail later.  All I need say just now, in order to complete the picture I have given, is that the proportion of the increase on the Vote since 1948 which is attributable to this cause is roughly £69,000.  That covers the Grant-in-Aid of the Irish News Agency, the provision of £10,000 for information material under subhead C (3) of the Vote, the salaries and allowances of public relations officers in Washington, New York and London, and the staff of the information division at the headquarters of the Department in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The three factors which I have dealt <Col N="1520" /> with&mdash;the devaluation of the £, increased official activity in connection with E.R.P. and the development of our information services abroad&mdash;account between them for £150,000, or nearly 85 per cent. of the net amount of £177,000 by which the expenditure on this Vote has increased since 1948.</P>
    <P>The rest of the increase is due to a number of minor and more or less routine factors.  The improvement of Civil Service remuneration which took place in 1948 accounts for £7,500; the new Legation in the Netherlands, to which we were already morally committed in 1948, for approximately £5,000; and the provision made for the appointment of Vice-Consuls at Boston, Chicago and San Francisco for approximately £4,500.  The balance is made up of routine salary increments, increases in the pay of locally-recruited staff abroad to meet higher living costs and other similar factors.</P>
    <P>An efficient information service has been provided to keep missions abroad fully informed of up-to-date developments at home and, by so doing, to enable them to represent the country more effectively.  In these and other ways, the efficiency of our representation abroad has been greatly increased and I am fully convinced that the expenditure incurred in doing this was not only fully justified but long overdue.</P>
    <P>The salaries and foreign allowances of our representatives abroad are lower than those of almost any other country.  Almost no other country spends so small a percentage of either its national income or its annual Budget on external affairs.  In order to put the matter in proper perspective, let me take a few concrete comparisons. The total amount of this Vote is less than what the British Foreign Office spent last year on the provision and maintenance of official motor cars for its officials.  The staffs of some diplomatic missions of foreign countries are larger than all our staffs, at home or abroad, put together.  For example, there are more people on the staff of the British High Commissioner in Pakistan than there are on the staff of the Department of External Affairs here in Dublin.  Comparisons of this kind could be multiplied <Col N="1521" /> indefinitely but, to my mind, whatever comparisons are made will all bring you to the same conclusion&mdash;that, both in the number of their personnel and the financial provision made for them, our missions abroad are organised and financed on extremely conservative and economic lines.</P>
    <P>Turning now from the financial aspects of the Vote to the work of the past 12 months it can be truly said, I think, that the past financial year was a particularly active and eventful one in the sphere of our external relations.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of the year, the Republic of Ireland Act entered into force, and, for the first time, the Republic of Ireland was specifically recognised as such by the States of the world.  Then we had the passage by the British Government last May of the Ireland Act in which fresh legislative sanction was sought to be given to Britain's occupation of our six north-eastern counties.  In the domain of general foreign policy, we found it necessary to define our attitude towards the North Atlantic Pact in official Notes, the texts of which were recently presented to the Dáil in a White Paper.  On the other hand, we accepted an invitation to participate in drafting the Statute of the Council of Europe and, in due course, became a member of that organisation.  Our four representatives attended the Consultative Assembly at Strasbourg in September and, apart from their effective advocacy of our claim to the unity of our national territory, they played a conspicuously active and useful part in the deliberations of the Assembly.  We also continued during the year to play an active role in the work of the O.E.E.C., and I think our election to the Executive Committee of that organisation at the end of the year may be regarded in some part as a recognition of the value of our efforts.</P>
    <P>Apart from this activity in the policy field, a good deal has been accomplished during the year in other directions.  As regards our trade relations, not only were existing agreements renewed and extended, but a trade arrangement was made with Germany for the first time since the <Col N="1522" /> war and a comprehensive Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation concluded with the United States. with which country we have also concluded, within the last few months, a Consular Convention.</P>
    <P>As regards cultural relations, the new Advisory Committee got into its stride during the year with notable and most successful results.  It arranged art exhibitions in the United States and Italy; it arranged for the publication of a series of cultural booklets, the first of which has already been published; it arranged for the making of a film tribute to the poet Yeats, which I hope will be shortly released in this country and will later be exhibited widely abroad; it made a contribution towards the visit to Dublin of the Hamburg State Opera Company; and afforded similar practical encouragement towards a number of other activities of cultural interest, including the organisation of summer schools by the universities, the visit of an Irish lecturer to Holland, Sweden and Denmark, the continued publication of certain foreign cultural reviews of interest to this country, and so on. During the year, too, a new information division was set up in the Department and a serious beginning was, for the first time, made to tackle a task which, indeed, more than any other has absorbed the energies of the Department and the missions abroad during the year&mdash;the task of bringing before the bar of the public opinion of the world this nation's just and indefeasible claim to the unity of our national territory.</P>
    <P>In introducing this Vote, therefore it may be better if, instead of attempting to give the Dáil a detailed account of all the various activities of the Department, I confine myself to dealing with the aspects of its work which are of special interest, either because of their importance in the framework of the national policy or because of their novelty.</P>
    <P>Naturally, our principal concern during the year and the primary object of all the Government's efforts in the sphere of external policy has been to hasten the solution of the problem of <Col N="1523" /> Partition.  We know that we are not alone in that aim, and, before I go further, I wish, on behalf of the Government, to place on record our appreciation of the support which we have received in this matter from all Parties in the House, as well as our frank recognition of the value of the help given to the anti-Partition drive throughout the world by the All-Party Committee.</P>
    <P>Deputies are familiar with the lines along which our efforts to find a solution of the Partition problem have been directed.  Basing ourselves on the belief that the Partition of this ancient nation is an intolerable and indefensible injustice which nobody who accepts the principles of democracy and the right of national self-determination can possibly seek to condone, the object of all our endeavours has been to bring the objective facts about Partition to the knowledge of democratic public opinion throughout the world.  We retain the confidence that, whatever obstacles we may encounter and whatever attempts may be made to confuse the issue, if we can once succeed in bringing the true facts of the Partition situation home to the moral conscience of the democratic world, it cannot remain indifferent but, on the contrary&mdash;if the professions of democratic faith and love of liberty which countries make so freely mean anything at all&mdash;the public opinion of the world must assert itself in favour of undoing this flagrant wrong.</P>
    <P>In the pursuit of this policy, the Government has found on all sides, both inside and outside the country, great and invaluable aid and encouragement. In the United States, in Britain, in Australia and in many other countries as well, men and women of Irish stock have come forward in their hundreds and thousands prepared to devote their earnest and unselfish efforts to the accomplishment of the task which confronts this small nation.  Nothing that we can say or do here would be an adequate recompense for the help and encouragement we have received in this matter from our own people abroad.</P>
    <P>Nothing worries me more than the <Col N="1524" /> thought that, among those who have helped us so powerfully abroad in this way, there must be many who, because they are unknown to us, have never received as much as a word of thanks for their unselfish work.  I am sure that Deputies on all sides of the House will wish to join with me in expressing here our deep sense of obligation and gratitude to all those men and women of Irish stock abroad who have done so much to advance the cause of ending Partition.  They have a valid claim on the gratitude of the whole Irish nation.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the results achieved by their efforts have been most encouraging.  I will not detain the House by enumerating here all the evidences we have received from abroad during the past 12 months of support and sympathy in the anti-Partition drive.  Among the many manifestations of sympathy we have received, however, there are some which I think I must mention.  I am thinking in particular of the resolutions calling for the unity of Ireland and condemning Partition passed by the Houses of many American State legislatures, and particularly by those of Massachusetts, Illinois, California, Rhode Island, Michigan and New York.  I include with them the many public declarations of sympathy and support made by individual members, not only of many State legislatures, but of the United States Congress itself.  We derived tremendous encouragement also from the resolution pledging its support for the reunification of Ireland passed by the American Federation of Labour at its Convention in October, 1949, and from the similar resolution pledging its support in the anti-Partition fight passed by the Congress of Industrial Organisations at its convention in the following month.</P>
    <P>I could add many other examples drawn not only from the United States but from other countries as well; but I think I have said enough to show that the efforts to advance the anti-Partition cause abroad have achieved positive and stimulating results; that it is no longer a movement confined to people of Irish birth or descent; but that, on the contrary, due mainly to the unselfish labours of our own people, <Col N="1525" /> there is now a large and influential body of disinterested public opinion outside this country which, having been apprised of the facts of Partition, and having had an opportunity of forming an impartial judgment on these, has pronounced itself clearly and firmly in favour of putting an end to this injustice.  I want to take this opportunity to express to all those who have lent us moral support in this way &mdash;many of them people with no connection with this country and no reason for viewing Irish problems in other than an impartial and detached way&mdash;our grateful recognition of their help.</P>
    <P>Needless to say, this progress in the anti-Partition drive has not been achieved without encountering obstacles and difficulties.  The opposition and difficulties which have to be surmounted are considerable and many of them still persist.  I do not want to go into all this in detail now, but there is one point which I feel bound to mention because considerable use has been, and is still being, made of it to counter our efforts to make the facts of Partition better known throughout the world.  I refer to the argument which, no doubt, many Deputies have heard used that, in the present state of the world, a problem such as the Partition of Ireland is a matter of minor importance and that the efforts of the Irish Government to keep this problem before world public opinion at the present time shows a disregard of the danger threatening our civilisation. This is a subtle and an easy line of propaganda for those who desire to maintain the status quo.</P>
    <P>There are many points of view which can be put forward in answering that argument.  I will only mention one. We undoubtedly stand at a fateful juncture of history and what characterises the present world situation and distinguishes it from any situation which has existed for centuries is that the fundamental conflict which exists is not merely one of national policy or military strategy; it is a conflict between two entirely opposed ideologies embracing two entirely different conceptions of the purpose and the meaning of human life.  In the final <Col N="1526" /> analysis, the struggle must be fought out, not between armies on the battlefields or navies on the seas, but in the souls of men.</P>
    <P>On the one side, you have a dynamic ideology which is opposed to the concepts of human dignity and liberty in which we in Ireland believe and which has already made great gains.  What we, in company with the other democratic countries of the non-Communist world, have to oppose to this is the fundamental beliefs which form part of our tradition and outlook&mdash;belief in God and belief in the democratic way of life and belief in fundamental, human and political rights, including the right to national independence and to national self-determination.  Our ability to evolve a dynamic based on the principles which are fundamental to free people, capable of matching the dynamic of Communism depends on the extent to which we give objective reality to our own fundamental beliefs. The greatest danger we have to avoid in this connection is the habit which has become so common of professing faith in these beliefs while finding excuses for not living up to them.  It is that attitude of expedience and opportunism which, while professing belief in the principles of democracy and freedom, tolerates with equanimity the flagrant and inexcusable violation of those principles which has weakened the spiritual dynamic upon which the free peoples of the world must depend in the final struggle with Communism. It is not we who claim that the injustice of Partition should be ended, who weaken the cause of freedom and democracy in the present world struggle, but those who destroy the moral basis of the common cause by treating so glaring a violation of the principles of democracy and freedom as a matter of no consequence.  That is one of the many answers to the argument to which I have referred.  I would be failing in my duty as a responsible Minister if in this situation I were to acquiesce in the continuance of a situation which is weakening and dangerous to our nation and to the ideals for which we stand.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words in connection with the work of our information division.  The work of our <Col N="1527" /> information services has been of tremendous importance in many fields of our national activity: for the development of friendly relations, of trade, of tourism and for the achievement of our territorial integrity.</P>
    <P>In all these spheres it is essential to have the proper organisation to ensure a steady supply of up-to-date and accurate information about this country to the foreign Press and others concerned.  I regard it as my primary task and duty to overcome what can really only be described as practically a conspiracy of silence, in regard to Irish affairs.  That consideration is, to my mind, a more than adequate justification for what we are proposing in this Vote to spend on our information services.</P>
    <P>I need not deal with the Grant-in-Aid for the Irish News Agency.  The agency has recently been the subject of very full debates in this House.  I feel that I should perhaps tell the House something about the information services which are covered by the global expenditure to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>In the first place, we have now engaged whole-time on information work both here, in Dublin, and in New York and Washington, a special staff.  Provision is made in the Vote for the appointment of similar staff in London.</P>
    <P>With the help of this staff a good deal of progress has been made towards remedying the lack of information about this country which has hitherto obtained abroad.  We began in November, 1948, the publication and distribution of a weekly bulletin on Irish affairs which has now quite an appreciable circulation.  It goes to Press and foreign correspondents, public leaders, diplomatic missions and other important organisations in other countries.  Supplies of it are sent to our missions abroad and distributed by them to persons likely to be interested. Our missions at Washington and at Canberra issue local bulletins of their own, based in large measure on the information contained in weekly bulletins sent to them regularly by the Department.  The material carried in these bulletins includes, as <Col N="1528" /> well as feature articles on various aspects of our national life, such as the rural electrification scheme, our national education scheme, the work of Muintir na Tíre and so on, up-to-date information bearing on the problem of Partition.  It is, if anything, an understatement to say that the bulletins seem to be widely appreciated. Every week we receive many letters about them and almost without exception they are flattering and encouraging.</P>
    <P>A more important index of the value of the bulletins is the use made of the material contained in them by the foreign Press.  We keep a very close check on that and I am glad to say that the results in that regard have been most impressive.  The amount of space devoted to material from the bulletins not only in the North American Press but in South America, Australia, New Zealand, Belgium, Italy and Britain is proof of both its usefulness and of the lacuna which it fills.</P>
    <P>In addition, the information division here in Dublin co-operates with the All-Party Research Conference on Partition. A considerable amount of other material also bearing on the Partition problem has been prepared by the information division and circularised abroad through our missions and private organisations interested in the problem.</P>
    <P>What we must bear in mind in considering our information services is the amount of leeway which we have to make up and the extent of the efforts made to disseminate abroad information prejudicial to our aims and interests.  I wonder do Deputies realise the extent of the propaganda in favour of the maintenance of Partition done by the Six-County Administration.  It publishes a monthly entitled <i>Ulster Commentary</i> which is widely distributed abroad and a publication entitled <i>Ulster Speaks</i>&mdash;both expensive illustrated productions.  In addition the Ulster Unionist Council puts out a steady flow of propaganda material which is particularly copious at election times.  They issue a monthly entitled <i>Ulster is British</i> as well as a monthly called <i>The Voice of Ulster.</i>  It also distributes a great deal of semi-official <Col N="1529" /> propaganda in the form of signed booklets and inspired articles and even books.  I do not know the extent of the expenditure which all this represents, but I have a shrewd notion that it comes to considerably more than the provision for information services which I am asking the Dáil to approve in this Vote.</P>
    <P>But this is only the beginning of the story.  Partition is maintained not merely from Belfast but from London, and nowhere is that fact clearer than in the field of publicity.  The Partitionists can rely on the British Central Office of Information with its annual budget of £5,000,000 and its vast technical resources.  It is sometimes contended that these resources are not used to defend Partition, but that contention is untrue.  I have here a magnificent and expensive production entitled <i>Springboard for Britain</i> which, as its title implies, is intended to justify Britain's springboard or bridgehead in Ireland.  That publication is disseminated by the British Central Office of Information.  When you add to this the vast resources of the British Foreign Office, with its network of public relations staffs in 45 or 46 different countries, you begin to get a true idea of the inadequacy of our expenditure on information services in relation to the task which has to be accomplished.</P>
    <P>I could enlarge further on this aspect of the matter, if time permitted. The only point I want to make, however, is that in this task of winning sympathy and understanding abroad for our claim to the unity of our national territory, we are up against a publicity machine which may fairly be described as formidable.</P>
    <P>The lesson of all this is that, in this field, we must make the most effective use we possibly can of our limited resources.  I think we are doing that. I think that, taking everything into consideration, including our relative lack of experience in this field, we have not been wasting time or money. But we must be prepared to face the expenditure of the money involved. What I am asking for now is what I believe to be the minimum which we need.  As the value of these services <Col N="1530" /> prove themselves and as the anti-Partition campaign extends in scope, we may well find it necessary to make an even greater financial effort to counter the increasing barrage of propaganda which will be directed against us.</P>
    <P>All this modern concentration on overseas publicity emphasises a feature of international relations nowadays which we must all bear in mind.  There may have been a time in the past when foreign policy was determined in fashionable drawing-rooms and at diplomatic dinner parties.  What mattered in those days was the flow of opinion in a narrowly restricted upper class.  But nowadays we live in a democratic age.  The factor which at present governs international relations and determines foreign policies is public opinion and by public opinion I mean all that complicated inter-play of forces&mdash;the Press, the radio, the speeches of public men, the statements of important organisations and so on &mdash;which at the same time, shapes the point of view of the ordinary man in the street and serves to make it articulate. Any scheme of foreign representation which leaves this important fact out of account and restricts itself to sending ambassadors and Ministers to exchange views in high official circles and Government offices, is simply out of date.  It ignores the concrete factors upon which international understanding depends in modern conditions.  That is why practically every democratic country nowadays has built up, alongside its official diplomatic and consular services, largescale overseas information programmes, utilising newspapers, magazines, information offices, high frequency broadcasting, films, pamphlets and cultural contacts&mdash;all with a view to winning sympathy and understanding abroad on the democratic level on which foreign policies are determined at the present day.</P>
    <P>From another, and possibly more important, aspect the development of cultural relations is probably one of the most fundamental methods of minimising national antagonisms and, therefore, of achieving peace.  The more <Col N="1531" /> it is possible to ensure that nations have a friendly and understanding appreciation of the customs and mode of living of other nations, the less likely are they to be antagonistic to each other.</P>
    <P>I will not go over the work of the Committee on Cultural Relations in detail because it is set out very adequately in the report which they have just issued; but I do want to take this opportunity of paying a tribute of gratitude and appreciation to the members of this voluntary committee.  I think it would be difficult to find any other similar body which has thrown itself so wholeheartedly and enthusiastically into its work.  The initiatives they have undertaken have been conspicuously successful, and everything they have done to make our national culture better known abroad has achieved its main object of stimulating interest where it did not exist before and creating an eager desire to know more about the country.  In devoting their time, knowledge and experience so unselfishly to this work, the members of the committee have performed an important public service and I am glad to have this opportunity of expressing to them the grateful appreciation of the Government.</P>
    <P>The work of this committee is not, of course, a mere exercise in national self-satisfaction.  We are all proud of our national cultural achievements and glad to think that they are being made better known and appreciated abroad, but that is not the whole story.  The work of the Advisory Committee on Cultural Relations is of the utmost value in several different practical fields.  It is of direct benefit to our tourist industry.  By drawing attention in different ways to the principal products of this country, it helps to expand our trade.  It helps to create new outlets abroad for our writers, our artists, our actors and other cultural workers.  Above all, it is one of our most important means for creating that background of knowledge about this country abroad which is so important to a sympathetic understanding of our national aims and policies.</P>
    <P>A review of our general relations with other nations would not be complete <Col N="1532" /> without a reference to the recent visit to Rome and Paris of the President and Mrs. Ó Ceallaigh.  In many ways, it was an historic event and the reports in the foreign Press show clearly that its significance was not lost on people abroad.  Probably many of us here at home could not help thinking, when we read the reports of the magnificent receptions accorded to our President abroad, particularly by the Holy Father and the President of France, how much it would have meant to past generations if they could have lived to see the head of this State accorded abroad the honours due to the President of an independent Republic.  I know that everywhere they went, the President and Mrs. Ó Ceallaigh created a deep impression and were accorded enthusiastic welcomes, and indeed, ovations, which constituted a striking manifestation of the goodwill towards Ireland which exists in the countries they visited.</P>
    <P>Another event in the sphere of our diplomatic relations which took place during the course of the year and which gave us all special pleasure was the appointment of the new Nuncio Apostolic, Monsignore Felici.  I think we may justifiably regard the appointment of so distinguished and experienced a prelate to represent the Holy See in Ireland as a special privilege and a special mark of the Holy Father's Paternal regard for this country.  Certainly no more worthy successor could have been found for the late Monsignore Paschal Robinson, whose memory is so deeply revered in this country.  In the short time he has been here, Monsignore Felici has won the esteem and regard of everyone who has come in contact with him, and I am sure that Deputies generally will join with me in hoping that his mission here in Ireland will be a long and successful one.</P>
    <P>So far as this Vote is concerned, there has been no increase in our representation abroad.  I intend, however, to introduce later in the year a Supplementary Estimate providing for the establishment of a mission in Western Germany, a country with which we had important commercial relations before the war and with <Col N="1533" /> which our trade exchanges have now begun to develop very satisfactorily once again.</P>
    <P>Owing to shortness of time, I cannot deal in any detail with the other changes that have occurred in our diplomatic relations in the course of the last year but the House will remember with appreciation that we have, for the first time, received during the course of the year an Ambassador from India and an Ambassador from the United States.  The new Canadian Ambassador has just arrived from Canada to take up duty in the country, although he has not yet presented his letters of credence.</P>
    <P>I do not propose, either, to deal with the question of foreign trade.  There have been many satisfactory achievements in this field.  Our foreign trade, especially our export of industrial goods to European countries, has increased appreciably in the course of the last year or two.  This is an important development and I hope that it will be possible to continue to promote our export of industrial goods to European countries generally.</P>
    <P>Before concluding this rather disjointed and brief opening statement, which covers a very wide field of activities in the Department, I should like to pay very special tribute to the members of the staff of the Department of External Affairs.  Tremendous burdens have been placed upon them during the course of the year.  Very often it meant that they had to forgo their holidays, that they had to work late at night and to work at week-ends.  They have always been prepared to fulfil these duties unselfishly and have been of tremendous assistance.  They deserve the thanks of this House.</P>
    <P>There is a separate Vote in relation to European co-operation.  I do not know whether the House would like to discuss the two matters together.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be just as well to take them separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1534" /> At the outset I should associate myself, on behalf of the Opposition, with the well merited tributes which the Minister for External Affairs has paid, first of all, to our President for the work which he did by his visit to Rome &mdash;to Italy and to France&mdash;and also to our friends abroad in the United States who have, as they did upon former occasions, rallied behind us in the presentation of the case of justice which we are endeavouring at the present time to bring to the notice of people in the United States and other countries in regard to the partition of our country.</P>
    <P>The Minister welcomed, as we do, the arrival of the new Papal Nuncio. We were all very happy that the Holy Father has made such a choice.  We hope that the Papal Nuncio's stay here will be very happy and fruitful.  It is only right, too, that I should repeat the Minister's tributes to the staff of the Department of External Affairs. When I was in office, I heard tributes to their efficiency and to their courtesy from very many of our people and I am glad to say that, in Opposition, I have heard the same tributes paid to them.  We are very fortunate in this State in having a very able, efficient and patriotic Civil Service.  I hope that the State will long be served by such a body.</P>
    <P>The Minister is seeking from the House a Vote for the supply of the sum of £359,000.  When you compare that sum by looking at the long sheet that is presented in the Book of Estimates with sums for previous years, you note that for the year 1947-48, which was the last year of Fianna Fail administration, the sum set down for the audited expenditure in that Department was just less than £154,000.  The sum that is being sought by the Minister, therefore, is, roughly, two and one-third times that amount.  I would probably not be criticising severely that sum of money at all were it not for the fact that this Estimate is brought forth by a representative of the Government whose members accused us of extravagance, of extravagance in the administration of the public service which could not be defended. The Minister for Finance, in his first statement on finance, following <Col N="1535" /> his accession to office, mentioned the Department of External Affairs as one of those upon which he intended to use his axe, one of those on which the expenditure was not justified.  It is a sufficient commentary upon that, I think, to find that his colleague, within two years, has to introduce an Estimate which is two and one-third times the amount of the audited expenditure for the last year of Fianna Fáil administration.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister for Finance had particular pleasure in singling out that Department, because I happened at the time to be the head of the Department, the chief of the &ldquo;extravagant bunch&rdquo;, as we were called, who would have to be put out of office if the country was not to be impoverished.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not compare his £359,000 with £154,000, which was the audited expenditure; he compared it, instead, with the sum of £173,000, or some figure of that order of magnitude, which was the Estimate in the Book of Estimates which was prepared by us but which we did not introduce.  It was precisely that figure for which the Minister for Finance was particularly careful not to take any responsibility. It was a figure that arose out of the extravagant attitude of Fianna Fáil. He was not going to take any responsibility for it.</P>
    <P>Let us even take that figure.  The present figure is at least twice that amount.  Let us consider the successive steps by which the present figure has been reached.  First of all, in the first year of the new Government, there was an increase of £25,000; in the next year, £100,000 additional increase, and now £80,000 additional. The point is, were we extravagant? If we were extravagant, then surely a sum that is two and one-third times the amount is very much more extravagant. If this is a reasonable sum to put forward, then the necessary conclusion is that it was at least far more reasonable in our time to look for a sum that was only a fraction of the sum required now.  The Government cannot have it both ways.  My view is that the sum we asked for in the circumstances was not extravagant.</P>
    <P>There will be a difference of opinion <Col N="1536" /> among different members of the House as to whether the sum required at the present time is or is not extravagant. As the Minister properly said, some of these items are based on questions of policy which the Government will have to defend on their merits, and there are questions of increases which cannot be avoided.  My own view, as I have often said, is that if we are to have a foreign service at all and if it is to be effective it must get the sum of money that is necessary to make it effective.  That does not, however, relieve the Minister in charge or any member of this House of the responsibility of seeing that every penny that is voted is spent to the best advantage and that no money will be voted except money which will, in the opinion of the people who are voting for it, produce results that are commensurate with the sum that is to be spent.  There is not one person in this House who could not, if he were in the Department over which the Minister presides, think of very many ways of spending money which would bring in some advantage. If you scatter seed broadcast, even though it may only be on rocky ground, you will find some crevices in which the seed will grow and you will always be able to point out that from the expenditure of money, if it is lavish enough, certain useful and profitable results will arise.  But we cannot sow the seed broadcast like that, hoping that, here and there, in some odd places, we will get profitable results. We have in this Department, as in every other Department of State, to attempt to cut our cloth according to our measure.  We have to ask ourselves what our resources are.  We have to ask ourselves what we can aim at successfully accomplishing.  That ought to be the guide in every question where expense is involved and where aims are in view.  Probably, with that standard, there are no two members in this House who would produce quite the same Budget.</P>
    <P>One of the values of a Cabinet system of Government is that the ideas of one individual who is looking for money for his Department have to be related to the ideas of other members who also want money.  There is, or there ought to be, a definite upper <Col N="1537" /> limit to the amount that is available at any particular time and the Minister can only get a share.  I think the Minister here can congratulate himself that he is getting more than his share according to the figures in the Estimates. If you look at the long sheet I have already referred to and compare the total sums that have been voted for the Public Supply Services you will note that the Minister has got well beyond what would be a proportionate increase.  I am not finding fault with that.  I think that we were, in our time, particularly careful about expenditure in the Department of External Affairs, some might say over-careful. As I have said already, the number of things which could be engaged in with some profit to the country were so many that you could spend not merely this sum of money but very many times this sum of money and get some profit from it.  We had to ask ourselves at each particular stage whether the money that was being spent was likely to produce commensurate profit or adequate profit or adequate results.</P>
    <P>The Minister, very rightly, has set out in his statement to explain how the increase has been brought about.  The first large item in the increase was that which followed necessarily from devaluation. That undoubtedly has added considerably to the expense of our foreign service as measured in pounds. He has also indicated that there has been a natural increase and also a special increase in regard to the remuneration of our civil servants.  I think most of that, however, had taken place in the previous year, except the ordinary natural incremental additions. I should like to point out also that in the year 1947-48, to which I made reference, a great deal of additional money for salaries of civil servants had also to be provided.  But these are additions that are inevitable.  There is no use in our complaining about them if we want to have our services abroad.</P>
    <P>The information services to which the Minister referred have been given a further addition of, I think, £69,000. On that, I am in no position to judge. I do not think anybody on this side of the House&mdash;I do not know how many <Col N="1538" /> are on the other side of the House&mdash;is in the position to judge how wisely or unwisely that money is being spent. There is one portion of it, however, which I think is not likely to be wisely spent.  We opposed from the start what is called the news agency.  Mind, I distinguish very carefully between the news agency and the bulletin service.  The bulletin service was a service which I could quite well understand. It was being sent to selected groups for a very special purpose.  You felt that if they did not throw it into the waste paper basket it was going to be of value having reached them.  You had to hope that that bulletin which was being sent would be of sufficient interest to induce those who received it to read it.  You could not make certain of that but there was a reasonable prospect of such a proportion who received it reading it as to think it would be of value.</P>
    <P>With regard to the news agency, unless I am completely mistaken as to its scope and purpose, I think it is bound to lead to a waste of money. If it is a news agency, it will have to compete with agencies with millions of pounds' capital, and I do not think it could possibly do that.  If it is not a news agency, but a bulletin service, I think the Minister and the Government would have been far better advised to bring it in as such.  The very name of news agency suggests that it is a business concern which will be engaged in the collection of news and the selling of that news in competition with other news services.  I do not think it can succeed with the capital it has; I do not think it can succeed more or less as a side-line of the Department of External Affairs.  If it is to be seriously entered into, it will have to be done on a much larger scale and on quite a different basis.</P>
    <P>I am distinguishing now very carefully between the bulletin&mdash;you can call it news or anything else you like&mdash; and the other service.  It is admittedly a departmental service, coming from the State, to inform selected groups and individuals&mdash;maybe these would be editors of newspapers and so on&mdash;of matters which they thought might possibly be misrepresented <Col N="1539" /> through the ordinary news channels, or which possibly would not come to their notice at all otherwise.  But providing the day to day news, as suggested by the title news agency, is bound to be a waste of public money and I do not think we can afford that. If I were convinced that there was a good national service being provided by such an agency, I would he altogether in favour of it.</P>
    <P>I know the need that it is intended to meet.  There is no doubt this country has been for generations the subject of misrepresentation in a powerful Press, through powerful agencies that had a deliberate purpose behind the misrepresentation.  To hold this country against our people's will needed as an excuse misrepresentation of our people and of their aims and of their character.  When that was done it was done brutally and ruthlessly and I for one would be very happy indeed if I thought that could be countered by any such method as the Minister thinks can be done by means of this news agency.  But I think it is altogether ineffective for that purpose.  I think it will not be used sufficiently.  He seems to suggest that already he is satisfied with it or was it the bulletin?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The bulletin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that, in his opinion, through information he has received, the bulletin has already borne fruit.  I am glad to hear that.  It confirms the view I had that that would be a service that would bear fruit, a service that was really needed.  Talking about the portion of this money that is to be devoted to the news agency, I have not yet had anything presented to me that would convince me that that is a wise expenditure of public money.  I do not think there is on the purely financial side anything else I need call attention to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in another section of his statement, speaks of the question which is naturally the question in our external affairs that occupies most of our thoughts, and that is the question of Partition.  I speak of it as in our external affairs because it is a matter, in the first instance, between this State <Col N="1540" /> and Britain.  The fact that we have a minority whose views were utilised by Britain to appear to justify what Britain has done does not, in my opinion, take away from the fact at all that Britain is fundamentally responsible for the partitioning of our country.  In every country there are minorities and in most democratic countries you have minorities that may be religious and that may be racial for the time being.  You have minorities of all these descriptions.  Does that mean that every State where there is a minority has to be cut up?  In our case, my view is that there is no distinct racial minority here, in any part of this country, that we are in all parts a mixed people.  We might have a little bit more of one mixture in one part of the country compared with another, but I do not think that our minority is a racial minority in any true sense.  Anybody who has examined the matter to its roots can satisfy himself that that is so.  Fundamentally, it is not a religious minority either.  We have had in this country some of the greatest patriots, men who struggled to achieve the independence of this nation, who were Protestants. You have had Protestants, whether Presbyterians or Church of Ireland or Episcopalians, in our country who were patriots.  They were even leaders of our independence movement in the past.  How, then, can it be suggested that the opposition to national independence is based on religion?  The objecting minority is a political minority, and everybody knows it.</P>
    <P>The difference between the minority and the majority in this country is that the minority wish a certain external policy; they wish to be linked up with another State, to become part of that other State, whereas the majority seek independence.  That is the fundamental difference that exists.  It is an ordinary political difference of opinion which in any democratic State would be resolved in the ordinary way, by a majority vote.  Britain used that minority as other States will use minorities, in order to procure their own domination over the lives of another people.  Therefore, it is in my opinion true that the partitioning of our country is due to Britain.  Britain, <Col N="1541" /> of course, will put up that shield of the different views held by the minority to defend herself against the accusation which I have levelled and which others who believe as I believe level against her.  The same pretence can be used to support the division of any country. You will find these minorities very often concentrated locally into majorities. What happens in our case is that this minority happens to be a majority in a certain area.  That could also be paralleled in other countries, but it is not used as an excuse for the partitioning of these countries.  The continuance of Partition we rightly regard therefore as an outrage upon our nation.  The excuse of the existence of a minority is proved to be a pretence by the fact that in the area cut off you have local minorities compelled to accept majority rule of the whole. In Tyrone, Fermanagh, South Down, Derry City, South Armagh, and so on, all the people in all those areas are expected to obey the rule of the Belfast Parliament on the basis that they have a majority in the whole of the area although those are local majorities.  If there were any justification for that in that case, surely there is far better justification for expecting that the minority in the whole of Ireland would accept the rule of the majority in that area.</P>
    <P>Partition is with us the burning question.  As long as that division of our country remains, the first thing that must be in the minds of every Irishman in times of crisis or in times of no crisis, is the undoing of that wrong.  In time of crisis and in time of non-crisis, it will dominate every political issue in this country.</P>
    <P>I take it that that was what the Minister was pointing out.  Now I am pointing to something which the Minister proposed to say&mdash;he was good enough to supply me with a copy of it but evidently, owing to the shortness of time, he did not use it.  I am not sure whether he dealt with the point to which I am about to refer.  This being the issue which will dominate every other issue, public opinion will naturally, in a time of crisis, revert to that particular point.  If there should be other considerations, no matter how <Col N="1542" /> important those considerations would appear to other peoples to be, this would be the prime consideration as far as we are concerned.</P>
    <P>We have supported the Government in the policy which it has indicated with regard to the Atlantic Pact and its attitude in case of another war.  The Government has clearly indicated and stressed that the policy of neutrality is an inevitable policy so long as the division of our country remains.  Any other policy would divide our people and if there are those who think that there are tremendous issues at stake in the world at the present time, which would completely over-shadow this petty question, as they call it, of the partition of our country, then it seems to me that it is they who particularly ought to give consideration to this question of Partition and get it out of the way. As far as we are concerned, it is not a petty question.</P>
    <P>It is sometimes suggested that we will constitute a dangerous gap in western defence.  If defence is really what is in mind, that gap need not exist.  That is a gap which can readily be filled, I believe, in accordance with the wishes of the majority, if not all, on the opposite side and in accordance with the wishes of all, I think, on this side.  If we get the necessary equipment&mdash;I am not stating national policy, because that is a matter for the Government: I am interpreting what the Government has already stated to be its policy&mdash;there will be, as far as we are concerned, no gap here.</P>
    <P>Now, as in the past, we will guarantee that as far as our equipment and our man-power enables us, we will defend this part of the front, if you like to call it that, more effectively than any other man-power could do, since we would be defending here our own hearths and our own homes.  We will do it with due regard to the home point of view and with an understanding of the needs of our people and their wishes and desires.  We will not be, as might very well happen, under other circumstances, unwelcome people trying to defend this area.  We will be here, then, the most effective body that can be found in the world, taking man-power into account, the most <Col N="1543" /> effective man-power that can be got, as we will be defending our own immediate rights.</P>
    <P>We will be acting in the same spirit as we acted in the previous war, in the spirit that we do not want our territory and would not permit our territory to be used as a basis of attack on anybody else, particularly our neighbours, and that we were not going to permit, as far as we could prevent it, any other Power to come into this country and if any other Power did come in against our will we would do our utmost to defeat that Power and in doing our utmost to defeat that Power we would naturally work in conjunction with every other people who were trying to defeat that Power.  There is no question whatever that, if there are those who are sincerely anxious about the present world situation, who were anxious about the situation before it came to the present crisis, and who are really anxious about the preservation of an intact front, the first thing they would do would be to make the necessary equipment available to our people.  We &mdash;the previous Government&mdash;sought for that.  The excuse at one period of the war was that the equipment was not available, and when it came to be available it was more urgently required elsewhere.  At a later period, it was not given because the war was evidently being won and there was no need for anxiety.  But those who went through that period of anxiety in other countries should remember that such anxiety can occur again.</P>
    <P>If I can in any way support what I understand is the attitude of the Government in trying to seek arms from outside so that we might be equipped here to defend ourselves, I shall be only too happy to do it.  I think that that is the attitude which is taken up by the Government, and I want to say from the point of view of the Opposition that I at any rate&mdash; it has not come up as a definite Party question in any way&mdash;will do everything that I can to support their efforts to get that equipment.  I believe it is the best thing that could be done in the interests of our <Col N="1544" /> country, and, as very often happens when you do things which are just, you get a very profitable return. It will therefore be the best for other countries as well.  However that may be, there are some who will say that there are claims superior to ours and they may continue to deny us the arms which are necessary.  That will undoubtedly put us in a very difficult position.</P>
    <P>I intend on a more appropriate occasion, namely on the Taoiseach's Vote, to speak more fully about that and to urge, as I have already urged, that the Government ought to be active in providing for our defence to the utmost to which it is possible for them to provide for it by the organisation of various services and, particularly, by making sure, so far as we can at this stage make sure, that the food and the other things required by our people which can be produced here will be produced here.  I did not intend on this Vote to go into this question of defence to the extent to which I have gone.  I have done so because I was dealing with the suggestion that this question of Partition is a petty matter. My answer&mdash;and I think the Minister gave an answer somewhat parallel to mine&mdash;is: &ldquo;If you think it is petty, then you should help to put it out of the way.  We do not think it is petty. We think the matter is very important for the life of our people and for any success we might have in our defence afterwards.  We think it is of tremendous importance and surely it is for you who think it of little importance to try and get rid of it.&rdquo;  I do hope that we can get rid of it.  I believe that in this particular matter there is no difference between what the Government propose and what we would have proposed.  Our proposals go back very far.  They had their roots back in 1921 in the proposals made by the Republican Government of that date in which we felt we could, consistent with national ideals, permit a local Parliament to be set up in the area where there was a local majority and that we could give to that Parliament powers comparable to the powers which they have at present, provided the sovereign powers over the area which are at present held by Britain&mdash;<Col N="1545" /> which is another proof that Britain is directly responsible for Partition, because she holds those powers over that area&mdash;were transferred to an allIreland Parliament.</P>
    <P>I think the majority in this country have been at all stages fair in their attitude towards the minority.  There has been no idea at any stage that they were to be crushed or compelled to do things which it was unreasonable to expect them to do.  Our attitude towards them has always been inspired with the spirit of justice and brotherhood. Some people would go beyond justice and become generous to an extent which I would regard, possibly, as a fault.  They are entitled to expect justice, but, when you go beyond that, you are generous at the expense of some other people.  If you do that, you have to be very careful as to whether what you are doing will be lasting.  If it is done on the basis of justice it will be lasting.  We have appealed to our fellow-countrymen in that part of Ireland to join with us in building up a common country which we can all be proud of.  We want them to come into it in the spirit of Tone.  We want to blot out the memory of past dissensions. We want unity on the basis of the common name of Irishmen.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that his information service is bringing the facts of Partition before the people of the world in the hope of bringing them to bear on the consciences of people who are fair-minded.  I hope he is succeeding in that.  It was our immediate aim once we had settled with Britain in 1938.  If anyone goes to the trouble of looking up the declarations which I made as head of the Government when I was entering into negotiations in 1938, they will see that the primary purpose we put before us was the ending of Partition.  I made it quite clear that any other settlements that might be arrived at did not affect the fundamental issue, that they could only be regarded as partial, as payment on account, so to speak, and that until the unity of our country was secured there would necessarily be in this country always a feeling of hostility towards the State that brought about this division.</P>
    <P>Once the settlement was reached, the <Col N="1546" /> next step we had projected was to do the sort of work which is being done at present.  The same type of work would have been done by us, I can say quite honestly.  It might not have been done in quite the same way, but the same kind of work would have been done by us to try to bring the facts of Partition particularly to our friends in America, Australia and New Zealand and to our friends in Britain, and also to bring the facts of Partition, so far as we could, to the attention of the minority in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>I do not know how far that by itself will be sufficient to bring about the result we hope for, but it is the natural way for any Government which wants to try to do this work and to do it in the only way in which it can be done effectively in the long run, and that is, peacefully.  It is the only way in which they should proceed.  I take it from the Minister's statement that the efforts which have been made will be intensified until it is felt that the facts of Partition, the injustice that is being done to our country by it and the damage which it is doing to international relations, particularly our relations with Britain, are being brought to the attention of all the people whom we can reasonably hope to influence.</P>
    <P>I do not think that I should detain the House further.  I indicated that when the Taoiseach's Vote is being considered I shall take advantage of the opportunity to talk about the question of national defence and also the question of the world situation and its natural bearing upon ourselves in the crisis which it may involve for us.  I have asked that the Vote be referred back.  I did that in order that I might not be hampered, in the first instance, in what I wanted to say by strict rules of order which would apply if the Estimate was presented without being referred back.  I still object to the news agency expenditure. If I had the choice I would have no hesitation in saying I would rather see that money spent in improving and widening the circulation of the bulletin.  I shall have to await a further statement to know whether or not I should push the matter to a division on the basis of this news agency.  Perhaps there may be aspects <Col N="1547" /> of it which will be presented later which will make it easier for me to accept the inclusion in this Estimate of that particular sum.  At the moment my feeling is that we ought to be very, very careful of expenditure in that particular field.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that he has a very keen eye in watching public expenditure. It is sometimes useful for us to see ourselves as others see us and I do not think, if the Minister is interested in knowing how others see him, that is a view which would be shared by many; I am afraid his reputation is quite the reverse.  However, I can only judge on these Estimates as they are presented here.  I have no means of judging details with regard to some of the expenses of entertainments and so on.  I know there have been a considerable number of changes, for instance, in Ministers accredited to this State.  The sum is a very large one as compared with the sum provided in our time but it has to be admitted that we are at the end of a war period and quite a number of new Ministers have been appointed.  I do not know whether that is sufficient to account for the amount spent on entertainments or whether it is unduly lavish.  I can quite understand that there is room for an increase in the amount, apart altogether from the question of cost, though I am sure catering costs have gone up.  Apart from that the number of occasions on which official entertainments would be absolutely necessary has gone very much beyond what it was in our time. I think it is right that that should be pointed out.</P>
    <P>There is one further matter to which I think I should make reference.  The Minister has said that the day has gone when relations between countries can be conducted as they were formerly conducted; the day has gone, in other words, when one had only to influence perhaps a king, who was more or less an absolute ruler, by having representatives and ambassadors at his court, or influence a special set in drawing-rooms.  That naturally suggests a corollary: if that is so and if we have now a number of international councils <Col N="1548" /> and bodies, do we really need the same sort of machinery, such as legations and so forth in each of the separate countries in which we have them at the moment?  I am merely giving expression now to a thought which naturally occurs to anybody deliberating upon how one can modify one's machinery to meet modern conditions in order to diminish expenditure.  If the Council of Europe develops, should it not then be possible to have a single representation, an embassy or a legation at the headquarters of such a council?  Ministers are now dealing with each other in a way in which they never dealt with one another in the past.  They are directly meeting in council.  Would it be possible, therefore, to diminish expenditure by having a pool system, as it were, at the headquarters of the representatives of the various states?</P>
    <P>There are obvious objections to that and one could not adopt a suggestion of that sort without the most careful examination.  One would have to find out in each State whether one would get the service through the central group that one gets at present from the embassy or legation.  Very often centralisation is not good economy.  If I were in the Minister's position that is an idea I would certainly examine and consider.  I merely put that suggestion forward for consideration; I do not say that it should necessarily be adopted or that it could be adopted. In order to be successful one would want collaboration with all the others involved.  Representation abroad is a very heavy burden and the question might arise as to whether or not by the co-operation between the different States expenditure on external affairs could not be diminished.  I do not like the Minister's comparisons with what Britain spends.  If the Minister wants to make a comparison with what Britain spends on a single embassy he must also make comparison with the total British expenditure. One cannot even do it satisfactorily on that basis because quite obviously an Imperial State would need very heavy representation in certain cases.  For that reason comparisons of that kind do not appeal to me.  I am not at all satisfied with them.  Comparisons with <Col N="1549" /> the smaller States would be much more appropriate though I do not say for a moment that these comparisons may not prove the case the Minister wants to make even more satisfactorily from his point of view since external representation must be a very substantial burden on the Exchequer.  External representation is, of course, a heavy burden on small States.  I was wondering whether, now that these States meet so frequently in these various councils, some pooling arrangement might not be made between these States by means of which expenditure on foreign affairs and foreign presentation might be considerably diminished.</P>
    <P>Another matter in relation to economy is the question of appointing honorary consuls.  Before the change of Governments that particular matter was exercising my mind.  I had thought over it for many years.  I saw certain objections to it.  It was only when I found out the amount we would have to spend in order to be represented in those countries where I felt representation was necessary in order to get the services that were needed for our people going abroad that the idea of honorary consuls had any favour with me.  The Minister quite rightly said that the difficulty is to get suitable people.  I agree.</P>
    <P>If one has a representative of one's country abroad he must be a man whom one will be able to stand over. He must be a person of character and integrity; he must be a man who stands well in the local community and he must be prepared to give considerable service.  As far as the State is concerned, that service will naturally have to be honorary service.  A small sum may be given for certain expenses, such as the maintenance of an office or something like that.  If the service is to be of any value it must be given voluntarily so far as this State is concerned. Of course those who undertake such a service would naturally regard it as an honour and a matter of prestige.  I am sure if they undertook the service they would perform their duties satisfactorily since they would regard it as an honour to represent our country.  There are a number of <Col N="1550" /> Irish people in South America, in the United States of America, in Europe and in Asia who would be very proud to act as honorary consuls for this country.  I think there is need for this consular representation.  I am wondering whether the Department, because of all the other activities it has had to undertake, has had time to pursue that matter.  I think it should be pursued.  I am very sensible of the extra work that is being done by the Department and the need for its expansion because of O.E.E.C.  I was aware of that already before I left the Department.  I saw at once that to get information, to keep contacts and to play the part that it was necessary for us to play in that organisation, would involve increased staff.</P>
    <P>On this question of honorary consuls there has been little progress made. I am wondering whether that is due to the fact that difficulties arose which made progress impossible, or whether it is that the staffs have been so occupied with other things that they had not had the time to give it the attention that is absolutely necessary in order to make progress in that direction. There are cities in the United States&mdash;I know they have often been mentioned to me&mdash;in which we should either have a direct State consul or an honorary consul.  There are other cities too in Europe and in the East, the names of which do not occur to me at the moment, in which certain requests of that sort have been made.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to try to meet any further expansions that are necessary in order that our people would get the services which the citizens of other States get from their State services.  If our citizens are to get those services, and if our friends are to have the opportunities of availing of such services, it seems to me that the most economical way of expanding them, in many cases at any rate, would be by way of having honorary consuls.  I think that I have dealt with all the matters I wish to deal with on the Estimate.  I propose, on the Taoiseach's Estimate, to go more fully into the matter of national defence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The House, I am sure, <Col N="1551" /> is somewhat disheartened by the amount of time which the Leader of the Opposition devoted to the statistical aspect of this Estimate.  The criticism that was made in reference to the increase in the amount of the Estimate had a certain amount of force and relevancy, but only, I submit, if we were dealing with a sovereign State where we would be in a position to pay attention, as the Leader of the Opposition said, to getting the best value for our money and to every aspect of our expenditure. But that is, I submit, an unreal approach to this problem.  If the Leader of the Opposition were to criticise the Estimate in the fashion that I propose, I would be very concerned to follow his lead, but, frankly speaking, as we are concerned, according to the Minister and according to the Leader of the Opposition, with the one burning question of Partition, the real criticism of the Estimate is that not sufficient money has been devoted to a proper presentation of that case.  Rather than holding it as a criticism of the Minister that his Estimate is now two and onefifth times more than what it was under the Leader of the Opposition, I think that the criticism to be devoted or levelled against both Fianna Fáil and the present Government is that they are not realistic enough in regard to this question of Partition.  They are both playing at being a Government, and having a Minister of External Affairs, a very grandiose title which we do not merit.  When we accede to the state of being a sovereign nation, when we control the 32 Counties, and when we can really speak in the name of the Irish people, then, I think, we will be entitled to a Minister of External Affairs.  We can then submit it to grave scrutiny as to how much we will spend on it and on our consular and other services.  I think that when we do attain to that state we will require a very much diminished vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with many of the economies which have been referred to by the Leader of the Opposition, economies in our consular services, entertainment, news agency and other aspects. But in the present situation, before we have acceded to that state, I am sure that many members of the House will <Col N="1552" /> agree with me-and that more will agree with me as time goes on-that this Government and any succeeding Government which has Partition, and the ending of Partition, at heart, should devote the utmost of its resources to every aspect that is necessary to end that question.  Perhaps I might put that point more forcibly in this way: we cannot view the question of expenditure on the Ministry, or Department of External Affairs at the present time on the same basis as we would view expenditure on other Departments which have to give value for their money.  The value that we expect from the Department of External Affairs is to take a leading part in the winning of the independence of this country, and for that our resources should be unlimited, provided they are wisely spent.  The Irish nation, I am sure, will endorse any expenditure of money sanctioned by this Government for the support of any movement, peaceful or otherwise, for the ending of Partition.</P>
    <P>Both the Leader of the Opposition and the Minister rightly congratulated the President of this country for his services on many occasions abroad on behalf of the Irish State.  I have to congratulate and to commend him even more so for a statement he made last week.  I think history will record the sentiments to which he gave expression as being well worthy of filling a place with those sentiments which are in line with the whole of Irish patriotic tradition.  I feel sure that the people of the country will pay most heed to this statement and that it will do more to bring us nearer to a solution of Partition than any of the very correct, no doubt, and very sincere attempts of the Minister to influence world opinion &mdash;to influence this very tricky thing called public opinion in very many parts of the world.  I should like to put on the records of this House, and to quote, with my humble approbation, what the President of this country said.  I think we should all be proud to have a President who is able to voice the national aspirations of this country in the manner in which our President, Seán T. Ó Ceallaigh, does at the present time and always has done.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The giant task handed on to us by Rossa and the faithful minority of true Irishmen who shared his political faith has been almost completely accomplished.  There is one big blot on this bright picture, and it is that the freedom we enjoy does not extend to the whole of the 32 Counties of Ireland.  Six of our Ulster Counties are still in bondage.  While the Six Counties remain unfree, there never can be true peace in Ireland. The gallantry and the sacrifice of the youth of the first quarter of this century brought freedom to the Twenty-Six Counties.  It must be the task of the youth and the manhood of this generation to liberate the remaining six.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>How we are to proceed to the attainment of that liberation is a matter of grave concern to most of us for what is the position?  It is very appropriate that we should discuss this matter on the 12th July.  What is the position in the north-eastern counties? What is the fundamental relationship there that gives rise to all the haranguing and the mobilising of forces that takes place on this day in the north-eastern counties?  To restate it quite simply, we have as the Leader of the Opposition said,&mdash;he put it more forcibly&mdash;a minority of a minority maintained in office by force of power and nothing other than that.  Nothing can disguise that.  By a farce and a mockery of the democratic forms, they retain power.  They retain that power solely by the aid of a bitter sectarian organisation, which is designed to divide the workers, the wage earners and the small people generally of these north-eastern counties into hostile, religious, sectarian camps and to prevent the common people in that part of the country uniting against their real arch enemies, the present ascendancy <Col N="1554" /> gang who are the lords of the linen mills and the shipyards.</P>
      <P>The position that exists at present is&mdash;and it must not be forgotten&mdash;that there is continuous, insidious and carefully fostered policy of discrimination and suppression against the Catholics and nationalists who form the majority in Ulster and who are governed by a minority of a minority.  Instead of the Government in that part of our territory, who at times profess cordial relations with the democratic Labour Government of England attempting to suppress or to wipe out that blot on our social and cultural life, instead of attempting to hold back and discountenance the Orange Order&mdash;because it is the basis of their power, they cannot do that&mdash;they actively encourage and give countenance in every way to every manifestation of intolerance, animosity and hatred displayed by this Orange sectarian crowd from day to day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thinking over this matter, it is time, I submit, that this Government which so abuses democracy in the north, which does not know how to carry out its functions, which is maintained by a foreign power, which is alien to our whole life, was given notice to quit. I looked forward in my youth to the accession of Fianna Fáil to power as a means of breaking Partition.  Suffice it to say in the simplest possible way without in any way blaming them or saying that their failure was in any way culpable, our hopes of ending Partition that way were disappointed. They failed.  When this present Government came into power, my hopes and the hopes of thousands of others were renewed.  We were enthused at times with the idea that pressure from certain sections of the Government on the English Government might be productive of good results.  From time to time, we were heartened by talks of discussions between Attlee and the Minister for External Affairs or between Morrison and the Tánaiste but nothing, absolutely nothing, tangible came from all this, except the Ireland Bill.  When the Labour Government came into power, we all expected that with all the democratic traditions and tendencies that naturally have enriched the Labour movement, we would find a change in the attitude of the British <Col N="1555" /> Government to Ireland and that justice would be done to Ireland.  Instead, the House knows how the British Labour Government reacted to all the representations made to it, how it fell a victim to the Tory Government in the north-east of Ireland, how it betrayed its democratic traditions.  So that&mdash;let us face the fact and let us put it on record as far as Labour men are concerned&mdash;the present Labour Government is no better than any Tory Government in regard to getting a clearer understanding of the true position of Ireland, the true position in regard to Partition and in regard to the ending of the wrongs for which they are manifestly to blame in so far as they maintain the present order there.</P>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs is responsible as the Minister most concerned in the Government, for dealing with this question.  We all expected that his drive and energy would certainly produce some results in regard to this question of Partition but I am slowly coming to the conclusion, I must say, that no mere constitutional approach will bring this question any nearer solution.  The Leader of the Opposition is exactly at one with the Minister on this matter.  All he could say was&mdash;and I do not blame him; I do not blame anybody for saying it; it is the easy way&mdash;that things can be done peaceably, that this question can be ended peaceably.  That I submit is historically false and it is becoming clear to me as time goes on that it merely means that the present position is to continue indefinitely with the Orange mob in ascendancy in Belfast.  It means nothing more than that.  This attempt to influence international opinion, to influence even British Labour opinion, seems to me to be productive of very little results. I think that, if not yet, very soon most of us must come to the conclusion that peaceful means have been exhausted. Time presses.  The Leader of the Opposition and the Minister referred to the crisis that is coming upon us and in a crisis an imperial power is preoccupied with other problems and has not the slightest time to be bothered with the question of Partition. But we are bothered with it. <Col N="1556" /> As Irishmen we certainly are concerned to have the problem solved and solved in our own lifetime, not handed down as a heritage to our children.  The President naturally called upon the manhood of this generation to liberate the remaining counties of Ireland and not to leave it to the manhood and youth of the following generation.  It is difficult indeed to discuss this matter in all its aspects, particularly as for the most important Estimate of the year time unfortunately has been very seriously curtailed</P>

      <P>We have no reason to disparage ourselves in having spent 20 years educating people about Partition and doing everything we could by the written and spoken word and by means of the tours made by Ministers of State and Leaders of the Opposition, all of them very useful in their way and all of them creating a little bit of understanding of this country among people who are very dense of understanding, but there is a seed of thought in the President's word over which one might think deeply.  O'Donovan Rossa was not constitutionalist.  He was not one who had any reliance upon parliamentary aims and there is in the President's speech the thought that some action on the part of the manhood and youth of Ireland will speak more loudly <Col N="1557" /> and more forcefully to the world than any ordinary propaganda and will compel public opinion to prevail upon the British Government to cease the occupation of the north-eastern counties.</P>
      <P>Not that I want to despise, or diminish in any way appreciation of, what has been done either by the Minister and his Party or by the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues in carrying abroad the case for Ireland.  I think that that work should be intensified and that the Minister's Vote should be increased.  I think that this House should spontaneously vote a couple of hundred thousand pounds to the Minister to build up a position in which any action that may be taken for the reconquest of the Six North-Eastern Counties will be fully understood by the people of the world and that they will know that we are merely taking what belongs to us and that we have right and justice on our side.</P>

      <P>I feel that what I have to say on this Estimate has been considerably reduced by the excellent speech that has just been made by Deputy Connolly.  Undoubtedly Partition has loomed very large in the discussions in this House over a period of more than a quarter of a century. If we were to go back on the records we would find, I think, that everything that could be said regarding Partition, the evils of it and the inequities of it, has been said at some time or another by every Minister for External Affairs and if one were to close one's eyes and distort one's hearing somewhat one would not know whether a speech on Partition was being made by Deputy de Valera or by the present Minister for External Affairs.  All that has been said for more than a quarter of a century and up to the present we have come no nearer the end of Partition than we were 25 years ago and that is as far as what is known as constitutional action is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, I think, unfortunate that in the discussions in the House in the last few days certain observations regarding Partition were made by Deputies, particularly by Deputies who have had a considerable amount of experience. <Col N="1558" /> Partition is a national question and any person who sincerely believes that he has some solution of the problem to offer should not, just because of petty Party politics, be subjected to criticism of a kind which is harmful to the interests of this nation and which gives succour and encouragement to the small gang of Quislings who hold six of our counties apart from us at the moment. No useful purpose has been served by observations which have been made, and I hope they will not be made any more, as to who was responsible in 1921 for the present Partition situation.</P>

      <P>I have said that no person has a right to say that and no person has the right to say, with regard to 1925, that a person who happened to be serving in the Army of this State in that year was helping to fasten Partition on this country.  No person serving in the Army of the State to-day has any right to influence political considerations or political decisions.  No person who served in the Army of the State ten years ago had the right to influence or decide political decisions and no person who served in the Army in 1925 had a right to influence or decide political matters.  I think these are matters which ought to be made perfectly clear and which should be understood.  So far as this problem is concerned, we would be much better off trying to find a solution than hurling abuse at one another.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I wish to make in opening my contribution, because it is very important that there should be a unity of endeavour and any person who endeavours to upset that unity is not acting in the best interests of the country.  I appreciate that exceptionally good work has been done in the matter of drawing attention to the evils of Partition in Strasbourg and elsewhere throughout the world; but if we were to attend international conferences for the next 100 years, if the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for External Affairs, the Leader of the Opposition or any other Minister or Deputy were to spend the rest of his life, and if Ministers in the future were to spend all their time going to international conferences and appealing to the moral consciousness of the democratic world, they would get nowhere.</P>
      <P>Our own history teaches us that no amount of talk, no amount of appeals, no amount of logic and no amount of reason has ever succeeded so far as Britain was concerned in achieving anything that we as a nation were anxious to achieve.  The freedom we have in the Twenty-Six Counties of Ireland to-day is due not to the talkers and not to the logicians but entirely to the persons who used the rifle and the machine-gun, and, if we are to achieve the ending of Partition in this country, it will be by these methods, and by these methods only, that we will succeed in doing so.</P>
      <P>Down here in Dublin and this part of the country, we have no real idea of the conditions under which our fellow-nationals exist in the Six Counties.  We have no idea of the way they are insulted, derided, walked upon, denied human rights.  As Deputy Connolly has said, that has been done and is being done by a small body of people organised in the Orange Order.</P>
      <P>I was reading a couple of days ago, in a Six-County paper, the <i>Impartial Reporter,</i> of 6th July, a reference to the unfurling of a banner in Enniskillen. This is what was said at that meeting:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1561" />&ldquo;They had two enemies in the world to-day, the Church of Rome and the Communism of Russia. These were the two enemies they must fight against.  If they failed in the fight they became the slaves of Rome or the slaves of Joe Stalin. There was no difference in these two totalitarian Powers.  Both had the same object.  One was religious slavery and the other was economic and religious slavery.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the presentation of a banner to the Luther Branch of the Loyal Orange Lodge No. 624, a banner to be used to-day.</P>
    <P>That is only one sample of the things that are being said up there.  It is quite a frequent thing in the Six Counties to have challenges thrown out to us.  Those challenges are not reproduced in our Press, for some reason or other.  I wonder, if we fail to accept those challenges, are we worthy of our past, are we worthy of the people who made such sacrifices to bring about the freedom of this country or, when we talk about honouring these men, are we really sincere or are we talking with our tongues in our cheeks?</P>
    <P>In those Six Counties of Ireland it is not an infrequent occurrence for nuns to be spat upon in the streets. That is part of our territory.  Why do we permit that?  Why do we tolerate it?  We can stop it but, instead of doing anything to stop it, we prefer to have those annual recitations in this House on the Department of External Affairs about Partition.  It is time that we stopped these recitations and it is time that the youth of this country was organised.  It would be much better that it were done by the Government than by anybody else.</P>

      <P>It is of no importance. What we want to do is to recover that territory and bring it within the jurisdiction of this State and we must bring it within the constitutional jurisdiction of this State, subject to this Parliament and to this Government.  There can be no question whatsoever of any federal solution that will allow this ascendancy in the six northern counties to maintain their power over Irish nationalists for one day, even for one minute.  That cannot be permitted or tolerated.  Where our claim is for the recovery, the return, of those six northern counties, that claim is rejected.  We get nowhere by offering then something instead, offering them a local parliament, even subject to the jurisdiction of this Parliament.</P>
      <P>I had intended to say just a few words on this Vote in regard to our international associations and international commitments.  I gather from statements made by the Minister and statements made by Deputy de Valera and statements made by other Ministers that if Partition were to be ended to-morrow this country would take its part in the Atlantic Pact.  That is not stated in that simple way but the inference to be drawn is that if the United States of America were to exercise influence or force on Great Britain to agree to the ending of Partition then America and Britain could be assured that this country would join the Atlantic Pact.  That is not said in so many words but that is the natural inference from the words and the way they have been stated.  I think&mdash;I have expressed the view before and I express it again&mdash;that in a global war in the near future, at all costs and whatever the sacrifice, this country ought to maintain its neutrality and ought not to be involved in any such war. Many people, I am quite sure would seriously like to be involved in war&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The issues are serious just as the issues in 1914 were serious and just as the issues in 1939 were serious.  So will the issues in another war be serious indeed. Naturally, what persons are concerned about and what we are all concerned about is: what will be the position of our civilisation and what will be the position of Christianity when that war is over?  It is on that problem that I desire to make a few observations. All over the world and for many centuries this country has sent its missionaries abroad.  Even to-day in Korea, where fighting is going on, Irish missionaries are at work there. In the event of a world war I feel that in the interests of civilisation and in the interest of Christianity it would be a desirable thing that even this small nation, if it can possibly be saved, should be saved from being obliterated. We may be occupied by the Russians; we may be occupied by the Americans. I do not want to see this country occupied by either power.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I say that if our neutrality can be maintained it must and ought to be maintained and that no language ought to be used by any of our statesmen that <Col N="1565" /> would suggest that we would sell the rights we have even for the purpose of obtaining the liberty of our Six North Eastern Counties.  Occupation forces are not very nice things to have in any country.  At the moment, the Americans have an occupation force in Japan.  I was interested to read an article in regard to that in the <i>Catholic Herald</i> of the 2nd June, 1950.  That article was written by an Irish priest, Father Patrick O'Connor.  I hope that nobody will say in this House that Father O'Connor had not the right to write this article, that he did not write it in a journal of repute and that what he says is not worthy of consideration. He starts his article in this way:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Japan has been stampeded into Government-sponsored birth control. ....  In using the machinery of their Government to promote artificial birth control, Japanese politicians act in accord with the urgings of certain Occupation officials who have lectured them publicly and privately on the subject.  The most highly publicised of these advocates is Dr. Warren S. Thompson, head of the Scripps Foundation for Population Research, Miami University, Ohio.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I want to finish on this note.  The whole tendency in external affairs at the moment seems to be to hold up America as the great defender of Christianity.

A small nation must necessarily spend a great deal on propaganda. Its very existence amongst <Col N="1567" /> nations depends upon the goodwill and the standard of justice and fair play as between nations.</P>
    <P>I am very glad the Minister has done so much with the bulletins.  I always held that view from experience in the past that the bulletins are the best and the most effective way for carrying out propaganda.  The Minister has not, so far, justified the activities of the Press agency.  I agree entirely with what the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy de Valera, has said about that.  I am not going to go over that ground again because time is precious just now and, besides, the ground does not require to be gone over.  I am greatly afraid the Minister has bitten off more than he can chew in the Press agency end of the business.  With regard to the bulletins, that activity is excellent.  I regret they are not available for us to read them in the Library. I would be every interested if we could have them.</P>
    <P>So far as one can judge, the Department of External Affairs has got away from allowing bulletins to be used in any way in a Party sense.  They are now being used rather from the cultural point of view.  The difficulty about our attempts to spread our culture is that there is not a sufficient drawing together of the cultural activities under one institute in order to supply the full amount of material that should be available for use abroad. There have been several activities, of which we have got a fairly brief account in the first Report of the Cultural Committee.  It is very interesting, but I think it might have been a little bit fuller.</P>
    <P>Someone made a complaint to me with regard to one very small matter. I do not want to indulge in carping criticism.  I have in mind the Art Exhibition in Venice.  There was someone let down there.  I think there might have been a wider representation of pictures there.  There were only two sent.  I am drawing the attention of the Department to that so that anything like it will not occur again.</P>
    <P>With regard to the criticisms made on the activities of the former Government and the present Government with <Col N="1568" /> reference to Partition, some people seem to forget that the former Government had first to clear the way.  Until the position with regard to the Twenty-Six Counties had been firmly and finally established, as it was by the Constitution and by the agreements arrived at, which included the economic war, it was not possible to deal with Partition.  It had been the policy from the outset, from the statement made when Fianna Fáil was founded by the Leader of that Party, that the line that would be taken would be first to clear the situation with regard to the sovereignty of the Twenty-Six Counties and then to proceed with Partition.</P>
    <P>No time was lost after the agreement was made which recognised our Constitution and a very general and vigorous attempt was made to start an organisation in the hope that the Partition problem would have been solved before the next war came.  Clouds were gathering at the end of 1938 and most people regarded war as inevitable and it was just at that time that it might have been settled.  Unfortunately, some of the hotheads at that period&mdash;I do not want to go over that aspect of the question or to attack anybody&mdash;taking the law into their own hands, des troyed the opportunity which had arisen during that year when Partition might have been settled.</P>

It would lead to all sorts of trouble.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to, but I was more or less tempted to follow that line.  I was really answering the point that unless, first of all, the foundation of the Constitution had been <Col N="1569" /> properly laid and established it was not possible to deal with the question of Partition.  That has now been dealt with and under present circumstances the propaganda which is going ahead is of a very admirable kind.  I think we can take a certain amount of encouragement out of the fact that we were able to achieve our Constitution during that period between 1932 and 1938.  We can encourage ourselves in the hope that we can also solve this other question with the Six Counties, without having to go to the necessity of making war upon them.  They are, as many of our leaders have said, our own fellow countrymen, and a peaceful victory, a victory by reason would be infinitely better than to have to settle it by other means.</P>

      <P>In addition to the honest and united attempt of the nation at present on which we are all agreed, a great deal can be done directly on the cultural side to bring about a sympathetic understanding with the Six Counties.  In many respects, on many of the cultural things, they are even better than we are and they have more local and national feeling.  In matters of detail, a tremendous amount of work can be done to undermine the bigotry in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be useful if the Minister <Col N="1570" /> would give the House and the public an indication of the Government's personal encouragement and welcome for the inter-Parliamentary Union which will be coming to Ireland in September. There will be about 35 nations represented and perhaps more. It is an opportunity of showing these people the attractions of this country and our cultural developments, and indirectly of influencing that type of opinion by strengthening our goodwill amongst nations, which makes it all the easier for us to solve our difficult problem of Partition.  All these things are bearing in the same direction. Although the problem of Partition will not play explicitly a single part in these conferences, it will be taken in the ordinary course of all the other problems which arise for other nations. At the same time, we do get an opportunity on that occasion which we never have had before of influencing political opinion all over the world and for that reason I am sure that we will all welcome the coming of these people to the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister on the very detailed way in which he has presented his Estimate.  We are very proud of his activities and of the successes obtained.  I do not propose to follow Deputy Cowan to Korea or to try and compare birth control in Japan with the Estimates.  I do agree with a lot of what he said in regard to Partition. I was very glad to hear Deputy Little, in following him, say that they on the opposite side, while they believed that the question of Partition should be ended by peaceful negotiations, never excluded the right to use other means, if necessary.  I think that is something that everyone can agree to and it is a phrase that everyone in this House would like to re-echo, that we are all anxious to see Partition ended, anxious to see it ended by peaceful negotiations, as we do not want to be forced into the position of waging war on our fellow-countrymen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was never our intention to wage war on our fellow countrymen, but there are people in this country who believe that, if England continues to hold the Six North-Eastern Counties <Col N="1571" /> by force, if they will not listen to the reasoned arguments of our politicians and political representatives, then in other days younger men will adopt the attitude that their fathers adopted in clearing the British out of the TwentySix Counties and will complete the job by driving them out of the Six Counties.  We feel and hope that such an action will not be necessary, but if such an action is necessary and if anyone, any group of people, either directed by the Government or otherwise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We can claim through our attitude that we are to some extent responsible for that.  We feel and hope that that united front will continue and, as Deputy Cowan said, we hope that bickering from one side of the House to the other will not be responsible for upsetting that united drive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with great attention to the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy de Valera, in a long and not too critical review of the Estimate.  He approached practically every item in a sort of mild criticism of the Minister's speech and his words might be used in justification of it.  He said during the course of his speech that so far the productive <Col N="1572" /> results compared favourably with the extra amount spent.  In the form in which you put them, practically everything that you said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg your pardon, Sir. Practically everything that Deputy de Valera said during the course of his criticism could be used in justification of the increased amount of expenditure shown in the Estimate. He even went so far as to explain that devaluation was responsible for it to a certain extent.  He did criticise the news agency.  When the News Agency Bill was going through the House his Party criticised the method that was adopted.  They are still timidly critical of it, but they believe and I believe that it is the only method we have to counteract the opponents of a united Ireland and the channels that they use to get their propaganda all over the world.  The Government are adopting every method that is possible to bring home to the world the great wrong that is done this country by the British in maintaining Partition.  Partition is only maintained and is only possible because Britain holds an army of occupation there.  While that army of occupation is there, young men of patriotic spirit, whether all of us in this House approve of it or whether the people outside approve of it, will for ever try to band themselves together and use all the influence and pressure they can bring to bear upon us here to end that terrible wrong. If necessary, they are prepared to lay down their lives in defence of the measure of freedom that we have succeeded in getting.  I am sure that the young men of Ireland to-day, if given an opportunity, are prepared to go into any organisation, any national voluntary movement, not alone to defend the Republic, but to end this awful wrong of Partition that is being perpetrated on this country by the presence in north-east Ulster of an army of occupation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather surprised at the attitude that Deputy Fitzpatrick has taken in regard to the partition <Col N="1573" /> question, about which all of us are so deeply concerned.  Deputy Fitzpatrick is a member of the Government Party and therefore must be regarded as a Deputy of some responsibility.  From my point of view, that Government Party has taken up the question of solving the Partition problem in a constitutional manner.  It rather surprises me, and I am sure it surprises some members of the Government Party, that he should show by his present attitude that he is not satisfied with the progress which that Party is making towards the solution of this difficult question.</P>
      <P>We have had to suffer from this disability for quite a considerable time and we may have to suffer from it for some time longer before a solution is found for it, but I think that any Deputy who advocates methodes such as Deputy Fitzpatrick has at back of his mind, but to which he has not given full expression, is doing a disservice to the nation inasmuch as he is possibly inciting young man to take action which would be undesirable, because the Government could not in present circumstances stand behind it or attempt to solve the problem of Partition by methods such as he has in his mind and such as Deputy Cowan appears to have in his mind by reason of the formation of this force which he has created and which he has said will solve the question of Partition with a minimum of bloodshed.  From that expression alone it would appear to me that Deputy Cowan's force is preparing at some period, not too distant, to take such action by force of arms as will secure the results which he hopes to achive.  But that is only a pious hope.  Is he going to bring such a force into the North of Ireland and start what would be tantamount to another civil war, because whatever action will be taken in the North of Ireland will of necessity have to be taken against Irishmen who hold views opposed to the views which he holds?</P>

      <P>I can assure Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Cowan that we on this side of the House are as <Col N="1574" /> anxious to end Partition as they are We have been working on it for quite a considerable time and, during the Deputy Fitzpatrick was a member of an organisation which did not give us much help to end Partition.</P>

      <P>Whether you were in front of us or behind us, you certainly spiked our guns.  I can assure Deputy Fitzpatrick that we were making considerable progress in the education of public opinion.  We were striving to educate the type of mind in England which required enlightenment and we were securing a measure of success in that respect.  The action which the I.R.A of that period decided upon prevented us from securing results and, indeed, secured no results other than a series of sentences of long imprisonment for the unfortunate people who participated in it.  I would appeal to Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Cowan not to be instigating action of the kind which they appear to have in mind.  Both if these Deputies are now members of constitutional Party.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Fitzpatrick was having a little jibe at the Leader of the opposition and said: &ldquo;You now have a Republic,&rdquo; I can hardly imagine that he was serious in making such a statement. We have got a limited Republic. We have not got the Republic for which he and I and others fought, and until we get a Republic legislating for the complete territory of this country we should be very loth to describe the present State as the Irish Republic.  It is three-quarters of a Republic and I am sure Deputy Fitzpatrick is no more satisfied with that than I am.</P>

      <P>Silence is golden in that particular respect.  I would like to refer now to the question of the expenditure involved in respect of the Department of External Affairs.  In 1947 the total expenditure was £161,760; in this year's Estimate we find a figure of £359,350, an addition of £197,590.  Now, I shall not criticise the value of the expenditure in the present Estimate as against the provision made in the year 1947-48.  The Minister for Finance, when introducing his first Budget, stated that he could not accept any responsibility for the Estimates as regards either their form or their amount. &ldquo;They are at present,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;being closely examined in the various Departments and offices concerned with a view to effecting the minimum of economy.&rdquo; That statement was contained in a covering note which was circulated with the Budget statement.  He was not satisfied with the covering note and the expression of opinion conveyed to the House in that note.  He went on, in the course of his Budget statement, to pick out the Departments that he would especially economise on.  For one reason or another, perhaps for the reason the Leader of the Opposition <Col N="1576" /> gave to-day, he lighted upon the Department of External Affairs where, he said, he would make special economies. Now no economies were made. Rather, there was an additional expenditure year after year.  Salaries and wages went up from £31,551 to £60,397; there was no economy in that particular section of the Department. Travelling expenditure rose from £750 to £4,750, £4,000 more.  Incidental expenses rose from £500 to £2,900; telegrams and telephones rose from £2,000 to £5,600.  Finally, entertainment rose from £2,000 to £6,500; representatives abroad rose from £93,163 to £193,553. The Irish News Agency, which did not exist in our time, has now been established at a cost of £25,000.  In addition to that there is an item marked &ldquo;Information Material&rdquo; for which a sum of £10,000 is being embarked.  I do not know, because I have not got any information, as to whether this &ldquo;Information Material&rdquo; which will the £10,000 has any connection with the Irish News Agency.</P>

      <P>I said initially that I am not objecting to the expenditure of this vast amount of money and I am not objecting to this vast increase in the expences of the Department if the expenditure of this money will benefit the nation.  If the expenditure of this money will bring kudos to this nation, the money will be well spent.  If it does <Col N="1577" /> anything to secure world sympathy in regard to the partition of our country, it will be money well spent.  The point I want to drive home is, was the Minister, in 1947, when he was campaigning to secure election in County Dublin, so immature and so ignorant of the administration of a big public Department, or so completely innocent, that he could make statements which led people to believe that, if he were elected on a majority suffrage, he and his Party would bring about such economies in the cost of administration as would result ultimately in a reduction in the cost of living?  If the Minister made that statement in the full knowledge of what the administration of a large public Department means, then he was guilty of deceving the voters and he was doubly guilty when he repeated these statements in the course of the general election which secured a change of Government. There has been no reduction in the cost of living.  There has been no economy of the kind of the people were told would be brought about.  Indeed, the opposite is the fact.  Before the public knew where they were the Government elected to bring about these economies, about which the Minister for Finance was so vocal, increased the Ministry by two seats.  That was their first effort at bringing about an economy in regard to the administration of this State.  Other Deputies have referred to matters more germane to a general discussion on external affairs, but all that I am concerned with at the moment is the fact that this Department is costing the people of this State more than twice the amount it was costing during the time when the Minister and his colleagues were denouncing the late Government as being a Government of spendthrifts, an extravagent Government with no regard to the financial affairs of the State.</P>

      <P>The only results the public can see in respect to this Department are the continuous flights abroad of the head of the Department, the huge entertainment of foreign and home diplomats and the establishment, to all intents and purpose, of a diplomatic club in this city at the expense of the people of this state.  If Deputy Fitzpatrick thinks that is a satisfactory result, he is entitled to think that, but I do not think so.  I have already stated that, if the vast sum of money involved in this Estimate is not bring to this nation the sympathy of other states in support of our national difficulty the money will be well expended.</P>
      <P>I could if necessary, go in to greater detail on this Estimate.  I am sure that if I and my colleagues were to examine it much more closely than apparently Deputy Fitzpatrick has done, we would find many directions in which economies could be made, and made with very great effect.  As I have said I have pointed out the deceit that was practised on the public during the last election.  That is not peculiar to this particular Department but is Common to every Department of State.  We were told that, in all these Departments, economies were to be made, that the costs of the administration of the state were to be reduced and that condition were to be much better.  I would ask Deputy Fitzpatrick, has cost of living been reduced in this State and has employment increased?</P>

      <P>I will refer what I am saying to the Estimate.  We were told that the cost of all Departments was to come down, and that we were a squandermania Government, Our Leader was misrepresented by every means in their power.  That was carried on more so by the Leader of the Clann na Polblachta and his minions on the hustings at that time than by anybody else. I welcome their conversion, as a result of the experience that they have had in office, that any money that was spent by the then Taoiseach and Minister for External Affairs was spent in a judicious manner as far as the resources if this nation could afford to carry on the work that was necessary to be done in connection with this Department.  I suppose, in view of changed times, the Minister can justify any expenditure. I hope that if ever we are in power again that never again, either on public platforms or in this Assembly, will details in regard to the administration of external affairs be subjected to the low, mean method of misoresentation that was carried on against us.</P>

      <P>Pardon me.  We are not finding any fault with the expence. It is the Deputy who was to cut down expenses by 30 per cent., including the cost of living.  We were anxious to see that this nation should be properly represented abroad, so far as the resources of the nation will enable us to do that.  If, as our honoured leader has said here, it is possible to have representatives in certain towns abroad to afford facilities to our people who may be there, whether that representation be of a temporary or a permanent nature, I am sure such a step would be welcomed by everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want now to deal with Deputy Fitzpatrick's speech. He has one leg in the Government and the other leg outside the ditch trying to encourage the other fellow along.  I am sure Deputy Fitzpatrick will never make a mistake because, when one thing goes against him, he is certain to have something else to fall back upon.  Of course it is not a bad thing for an army to have some ground to which it can retreat but I do say that we in this House as public representatives should have some backbone to stand up to a position and to recognise that we have a Constitution here which Fianna Fáil introduced and that that Constitution caters fully for all points of view in this country.  I am relating it now to the question of Partition.  I do not see why any public representative should <Col N="1581" /> take advantage of his position in this House to encourage any young fellow to join any organisation except the Army of this State.  If the Irish people are not capable of electing a Government to guide them properly, and if we are not going to protect the democracy which numbers of Irishmen went to a premature grave to try and preserve, there is no use in any Deputy or anybody else trying to have a foot across both sides of the ditch, because that is what it really means.  If the question of Partition is going to be handled at all, it will have to be handled by the people of Ireland in a constitutional way.  I would not be afraid to go across if the occasion should arise; I am not going to shrik any responsibility in that way but I do say that this is a matter which should be left to the Government of the country.  Sufficient mistakes have been made in the past without adding to them in future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Traynor dealt with that matter fully but unfortunate people, whether their motives are good or bad, should not be encouraged by any act in this House to proceed on the same lines again.  Any action we can take here to unite the people to end Partitition or any help we can give the Minister for External Affairs towards that end should come through Dáil Éireann and from Dáil Éireann only.  We should try to unite the nation on that basis, not by trying to have a foot on each side of the ditch.  Again I welcome the conversions that have already taken place.  I am delighted to see that the misrepresentation that has been carried on in this regard has changed completely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>May I intervene for a few moments to recall one matter to which reference has been made by Deputies in this discussion? We have had views expressed from different sides of the House with regard to the problem of Partition and the means and the policy which should be adopted towards its solution.  I should like to say, from the point of view of the Fine Gael Party, that our <Col N="1582" /> concern is now what it always has been, the unity of Ireland not merely in its territory, but also in the minds and the aspirations of all its people irrespective of whether they live in the Twenty-Six Counties or the Six North-Eastern Counties.  In the view of anybody who sincerely desires that end, it must be accepted that any unity of territory achieved by force would constitute merely a barren victory because it would leave, as we have learned here to our cost, a festering sore of spite and malice which would keep both parts of our nation asunder for many generations to come.  It is for that reason that we, in the Fine Gael Party, and I think Deputies on most sides of the House deprecate very much this idle talk of achieving a solution by force.  If force were used&mdash;and force can only be used by the Government and under the direction of this Parliament&mdash;and used successfully, the unity of our territory might be achieved but we might store up for our country at the same time a heritage of disunity for the future that might time and again dislocate and impede the national effort.  We believe, with the Minister and with the Government, that the unity of this country can and will be achieved by mustering the world opinion in our favour, possibly by the pressure of world events.  Unity achieved in that way, when it comes, will be a real unity for our people north and south.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to say anything with regard to the other matters raised in this debate except that there have been references to private armies, to volunteer forces and, I think, also references to the Constitution.  It is abundantly clear now to all Deputies and to the people of this country that &mdash;and this is true of all the Constitutions this country have had since 1921&mdash; respect for the Constitution freely established by our people is the only guarantee for national salvation.  That is accepted by all sides now and, as the Taoiseach stated clearly, no departure from that principle will be admitted under this Government or, I believe, under any Government here. We in the Fine Gael Party would not under any circumstances be a party to any departure from those principles <Col N="1583" /> which we believe are the essential guarantees for the liberty of our State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to thank the Leader of the Opposition and most of the Deputies who have spoken for the reasonable and objective discussion that has taken place on this Estimate.  With one or two notable exceptions, the discussion was of a most helpful and constructive nature.  I think, by and large, criticism of the Estimate, as put forward by Deputy de Valera as Leader of the Opposition, was limited mainly to the expenditure in relation to the news agency.  As Deputy de Valera pointed out very correctly, probably no two Deputies would agree as to the exact direction, scope and method in which expenditure should be undertaken in order to put forward, if you like, Ireland's case to the world generally.  The question of the news agency was discussed at length in this House last year and I do not propose to go back into the various arguments in favour of it.  I merely would like to say this in passing: I would ask the Opposition to give the news agency a fair and reasonable trial.  I would remind the Opposition and Deputy de Valera that he himself at one stage felt that such a news agency would be of benefit and would have taken steps to create it were it not for the fact that his actions, he felt at the time, would have been misrepresented by the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in a difficult position on that now as the Minister knows&mdash;if I might interrupt on a personal matter.  I do not want to go into it but I think that the Minister completely misrepresented my personal attitude on that.  He quoted a letter supposed to have come from me but I doubt very much that it actually did.  I understand that it was more or less a personal letter to the Minister and in any case my position regarding it was quite clear.  I had an open mind.  I examined the thing thoroughly and I satisfied myself that we could not compete effectively in that field, that is, strictly in the field of a news agency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister that my attitude was that I was fully aware of the harm done by news agencies in the way in which they represented news from this country and I would like to be able to combat it.  The Minister, then in another capacity, made a proposal and I had it examined.  My own view was that it would not be possible for us to enter that field with success because it was too large.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody who is interested can look up the debates and read the letter which contained presumably the Government's reason and the reason stated in writing in that letter was that the Opposition would make such a thing unworkable by being unreasonable.  However, I do not want to raise this.  I merely want to put it to Deputy de Valera and the members of the Fianna Fáil Party that the decision to start a news agency was taken by the Dáil.  They may disagree with that decision but like all of us they must be prepared to admit that possibly they are wrong and that other judgments are right.  I ask them in view of the decision that was taken to give the news agency a fair trial and to co-operate to the maximum with the news agency in the interests of its success.  That, I think, <Col N="1585" /> is not an unreasonable request and they should be in a position to be the first to welcome it if it is a success.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Meanwhile I would ask Deputy de Valera and his Party to give every assistance to the news agency in order to ensure that it will be a success.</P>
      <P>That was broadly speaking the main criticism put forward by Deputy de Valera on the Estimate.  I am sorry that Deputy Traynor for whom I have a great personal regard should have introduced a different note in his criticism, a note which, I think, is unworthy of him and in which he did not do justice to himself.  He talked about continuous flights and continuous entertainment carried on by the Minister. I have not undertaken one single journey out of this country that it was not essential for me to undertake and I think if the time were to be measured I have taken fewer journeys than my predecessors in similar circumstances. I never criticised their expenditure on the Department of External Affairs when Deputy de Valera was Minister for External Affairs.  I criticised the late Government for their expenditure on trans-Atlantic airlines and such matters.  I never criticised their expenditure on external affairs.  On the contrary, any criticism I did offer in relation to that matter was for not spending enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that Deputy Traynor is not in the House because I would like to remind Deputy Traynor that some short time ago he made a statement which was reported in the Press on similar lines about entertainment.  He then went on to state that I was building an additional restaurant at the back of the Department of External Affairs for entertainment.  That was untrue.  The restaurant, or rather the canteen which is being built at the back of the Department of External Affairs is a Civil Service canteen which was decided upon by the last Government and the work was undertaken before the change of Government.  I think the sooner Deputies on the Opposition Benches give up pursuing this particular line of propaganda the <Col N="1586" /> better.  I do not think it does them credit and I do not think it helps them politically in the country.</P>
    <P>I pointed out that between £50,000 and £55,000 increase in the cost of the Department is due to devaluation. Approximately £30,000 is due to additional work in relation to European Recovery Programme and the balance of the increase is due in the main to the information services and the news agency.  No Deputy has suggested how any of this added expenditure could be reduced, save and except in relation to the news agency, and Deputies were all prepared to say that that money would be better spent on some other method of propaganda.  I think it a pity that notes of that kind should have to be introduced into the discussion which is a serious and important discussion.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera made some suggestions in relation to the running of the Department, suggestions which are most helpful and constructive.  He referred to the possiblity of appointing more honorary consuls.  That is a matter which we have under consideration and which has not been forgotten in any way, but there are unfortunately a number of difficulties in relation to honorary consuls.  Paradoxically enough, it would be unwise and practically impossible to appoint an honorary consul in a large Irish population centre, whereas it would be easy to do it in a place where there is no Irish population or a very small Irish population.  In a large Irish population centre, such as any of the big cities in America, it would be invidious to select A as honorary consul because immediately B, C, D, E and F would feel that they were insulted. Therefore, the possibility of appointing honorary consuls in any big Irish population centre would present very serious difficulties, unless there was in any given place a man who was outstandingly recognised by everybody as being the one and only person capable of discharging that honorary position.  There is a need for honorary consuls in a number of other places and the matter is being examined, mainly in relation to ports and areas of the world where our ships are now <Col N="1587" /> going.  There is quite an urgent need for representation in these ports and areas in relation to our shipping.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera also made a suggestion with regard to the possibility of pooling representation through some international organisation.  That is the matter which we have discussed from time to time.  It may be a possible development, though I can see a great many difficulties, because, in every place where we have an office, we find that there is a considerable amount of routine business&mdash;consular work, trade matters or routine work of one kind or another&mdash;which has to be performed, and, even if we could succeed in getting agreement on a pooling of representation in one central place, like Strasbourg or some other place, we would still find it necessary to maintain an office in order to discharge the work to be carried out.</P>
    <P>One thing of which I should like to remind the House is that, largely through the work of the Department of External Affairs, both its economic work and its diplomatic work, this country received over £1,000,000 in free gift this year&mdash;more than twice the total budget of the Department itself&mdash;so that it is not simply an ornamental appendage attached to the Government.  In addition, the Department collects very considerable sums of money accruing to Irish citizens abroad.</P>

      <P>The Deputy and I do not see eye-to-eye on these matters. Possibly the Deputy would like to explain on some other occasion from a <Col N="1588" /> public platform how he would obtain the necessary tobacco, oil, grain, machinery and so forth which has to be obtained from the dollar area without dollars.  Possibly the Deputy might organise an expeditionary force to get them.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera said that it might have been useful to have some comparisons with other countries of similar size.  I took one or two instances in opening my remarks, including the British High Commissioner's Office in Pakistan, as I felt that was rather striking, but I have some figures here showing the expenditure of other comparable countries.  Switzerland spends £2,168,000 on its Department of External Affairs, as against our £400,000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree entirely with practically everything said by Deputy de Valera in relation to Partition and in relation to our foreign policy generally.  He said&mdash;and I should like to echo this, lest anything said by other Deputies might be regarded as having taken away from it, or lest my silence after certain statements have been made might be regarded as agreement or as indicating a reluctance to comment on some of the statements made&mdash;that, if this State got adequate equipment to defend itself, there is no nation in Europe that would resist more fiercely, more determinedly, any attempted invasion or any interference with its sovereignty than this nation.  Of that <Col N="1589" /> I am certain and I feel that every Deputy should agree with that viewpoint.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connolly made a very wellthought-out, very reasoned and obviously extremely sincere speech.  He stated the fundamental problems, in so far as they affect us in regard to Partition, and I am sure that probably every member of the House can largely share the views as stated by him. Obviously, the continuance of Partition is a constant menace to the peace of this country.  Once you interfere with the sovereignty and unity of any nation, you create the conditions that are likely to bring about a civil war. We have examples of that in Asia at the moment.  These conditions apply here; these dangers exist here.  But I agree entirely with Deputy de Valera that the policy and the action to be taken in regard to the unification of this country must be determined by this House, by the representatives of the people.  You cannot have each and every person in the country deciding to formulate policy for the country. There must be some basis of agreement. My view has been that the present Constitution provides a framework which can be accepted by every section of the population.  I have held that view since the Constitution was enacted.</P>
    <P>Now let me put it on another basis. This country is a small country.  No matter what amount of physical and moral courge we may have, it is quite obvious that we can never win a war against Great Britain.  Putting it at the best, even supposing you had arms, you have a population of 3,000,000 against 50,000,000, so that your chances of winning are practically negligible in case of war.  It would result in a civil war with a section of our own people.  It is quite obvious that there is a section in the Six Countries who, backed by another country, would fight back if they were attacked.  After all, these people, as some Deputies have interjected, are Irishmen, too, just as much as Deputy Cowan.  We have to try to find a solution which will enable us to live and work together as a united people.  We have had one civil war in the generation to which I belong.  We know the after-effects of it.</P>
    <Col N="1590" />
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say that the Jews were wrong, then, in taking on the big odds they did and winning out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no parallel between these two situations.  Another thing that has to be faced up to in relation to the Six County position is that, rightly or wrongly, justifiably or unjustifiably, undoubtedly, a section of the population in the Six Counties have been given fears, bred by propaganda and by bigotry over a number of years, fears as to the possibility of our intolerance, fears that we would interfere with their religious or political liberty.  We know that these fears are unfounded.  We know that this is a line of propaganda which has been put across in the Six Counties in order to stir up bigotry and maintain the existing division.  Nevertheless, if these fears exist, we have to be prepared to meet them and to allay them as far as we can and I think we should go quite a long distance in doing that.</P>
      <P>Above all, I would appeal to the members of the House to remember this, that the only possibility of success in any crisis in this country, be it in time of war, be it in relation to the ending of Partition, is if you have a unified people.  I think Deputy Cowan would be rendering a service to the country if he ceased taking steps or making statements that can only result in weakening the national effort by causing disunity.</P>
      <P>I am sure the various things he says, the various steps he takes, are not intended by him to cause disunity or to weaken the national effort but, if he takes time to think, he will realise that they can only result in causing disunity. Possibly, it is unwise to take so much notice of this matter, but I do feel that Deputy Cowan would be rendering a service to the country if he realised this at this stage.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £23,250 be granted to complete the sum <Col N="1591" /> necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1951, for contributions towards the Expenses of the Council of Europe and of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation and for other expenses in connection therewith.</P>
    <P>In introducing the resolution for the ratification of the statute creating the Council of Europe on the 12th July last year (Vol. 117, No. 5, cols. 694 and 695), I set out generally the various considerations which made it important that we should participate actively in this new attempt at international co-operation in Europe.  I am glad to be able to report to the House that Ireland has played a leading and an important part in the development of the Council of Europe, both at the Assembly and at the Ministerial level, during the last year.</P>
    <P>The Irish representatives in the Consultative Assembly played an active role in the Assembly itself and in the work of the various commissions set up by the Assembly.  Ireland had four delegates in the Assembly and four substitute delegates.  These were:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton (Tánaiste);</P>
    <P>Deputy Everett (Minister for Posts and Telegraphs);</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera (Leader of the Opposition), and Deputy MacEntee.</P>
    <P>The substitute delegates were:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Deputy Aiken,</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman,</P>
    <P>Senator Crosbie, and Senator Finan.</P>
    <P>The work of our delegates and substitute delegates was above reproach. From a national point of view, they succeeded in focussing the attention of the leading parliamentarians of the principal countries of Western Europe on the question of the unnatural division of our country, and in making known to them the facts concerning this injustice.</P>
    <P>I would like, here, incidentally to deal with some criticism which appeared in the British Press concerning the fact that our delegates had the <Col N="1592" /> audacity to mention that the Partition of Ireland was one of the questions which disturbed the peace of Europe. The origin of this criticism itself is an indication of its purpose.  According to British propagandists, every question is a fit subject for discussion save and except the Partition of this country and the continued justification of Partition by Britain.</P>
    <P>While I have no responsibility for the acts of our representatives in the Assembly of the Council of Europe, I should like to avail of this opportunity of endorsing their action in bringing this matter to the bar of world opinion. Obviously, if close co-operation is to be achieved between European nations, the first essential is to discuss and, if possible, remove the causes of friction that may exist between the nations that compose the Council of Europe. Partition is certainly one of the outstanding causes of friction in Western Europe to-day.  As Irishmen, we make no apology for desiring the territorial unity of our nation.  As democrates, we make no apology for demanding that the Irish people should be allowed to determine their own affairs democratically without outside interference. As Europeans, we make no apology for seeking to remove one of the causes of disunity in Europe.</P>
    <P>Our representatives, however, did not confine themselves to matters of purely national interest.  On the broader plane, of international co-operation, they were to the fore with their contributions to the discussions on the many complex problems that arose; these included such matters as the future political structure of Europe, economic co-operation, human rights, cultural co-operation and co-operation in the field of social security. They made important contributions to the work of the various Assembly Committees, as well as to the debates in the Assembly itself.</P>
    <P>As was to be expected, and indeed, it was only proper that it should be, the delegates and substitute delegates did not always share the same views. They took an independent stand on all questions that arose before the Assembly. On many matters, such as the need for the creation of machinery for <Col N="1593" /> the settlement of disputes between member states and the powers of the Assembly, their viewpoint coincided.  I am sure that I am stating the views of every member of the House and, indeed, the feeling of the country generally in expressing appreciation of their work in the Assembly, and of their clear statements concerning the enforced territorial division of our nation. It is gratifying to find that, whatever differences may exist on Party issues at home, our representatives can talk with a united voice on national questions outside the country.</P>
    <P>The Assembly Session lasted a month, but the Assembly's work is still being carried on in the interval between sessions by some of these committees which are pursuing studies entrusted to them by the Assembly. The Standing Committee, on which Deputy Norton is the Irish representative, provides a means of contact between the Assembly and the Committee of Ministers when the Assembly is not in session.  It has met on several occassions.  The General Affairs Committee, which has been engaged on the huge task of examining the political structure of Europe and the drawing up of a report for discussion at the next Assembly Session, has met three times already.  On the first occasion, Senator Crosbie attended as substitute for Deputy Norton.  Deputy Norton attended the second and third meetings in Strasbourg.</P>
    <P>At its second meeting in Strasbourg, this Committee drew up a number of resolutions for consideration by the next session of the Consultative Assembly, and dealing with:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) Relations between the Council of Europe and other international organisations.</P>
    <P>(2) The nomination by Governments of Ministers or Secretaries of European Affairs.</P>
    <P>(3) Amendments to the Statute of the Council of Europe and of the Rules of Procedure of the Committee of Ministers.</P>
    <P>(4) The creation of an Executive Committee composed of members of the Committee of Ministers and of <Col N="1594" /> the Consultative Assembly to coordinate and plan the work of the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Social Questions continued its work since the last session and has examined various questions, including the question of European housing.  On this committee Deputy Everett is the Irish representative and his substitute is Senator Finan.  The Committee on Economic Questions, on which Deputy de Valera is the Irish representative, met in Paris last December and again in Strasbourg in June and in Paris in July.  Deputy Aiken attended the meetings as substitute for Deputy de Valera.  One of the principal aims of this committee is to evolve measures to realise the convertibility of currencies and the liberalisation of trade.  Resolutions were drawn up dealing with such matters as inter-European companies, European monetary reform, agricultural production, commercial policy, steel production and the control of cartels.</P>
    <P>The Cultural Committee, on which Deputy de Valera is the Irish representative, was responsible for drawing up the report to the Assembly on cultural matters, as a result of which the Assembly submitted to the Committee of Ministers proposals for greater European co-operation in the cultural field.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Legal and Administrative Questions, on which Ireland is represented by Deputy MacEntee, undertook the task of drafting a Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which the Assembly submitted to the Committee of Ministers after some amendment.  This committee also gave preliminary consideration to the questions of a European nationality and a European passport.  The committee met in Strasbourg on the 23rd June.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Rules and Procedure and Privileges is entrusted with the task of examining the provisional rules of procedure of the Consultative Assembly.  Deputy Sweetman, who deputises for Deputy Norton on this committee, represented Ireland at the meetings of the committee held during the Assembly Session.  The committee <Col N="1595" /> set up a sub-committee of six members which was authorised to meet in the interval between sessions to complete the task assigned to it.</P>
    <P>The work of the Consultative Assembly is, therefore, continuing between Assembly Sessions with the energetic co-operation of our representatives.</P>
    <P>A full report concerning the activities of the Irish delegates to the Assembly of the Council of Europe is being prepared and will be circulated as soon as it is completed.  I have no governmental responsibility for the acts and affairs of the Irish delegates and substitute delegates, once appointed to the Assembly; they are independent and free to act as they choose.  This is at it should be, as the Assembly is composed of parliamentary representatives rather than governmental representatives. While being most careful to retain this important line of distinction, I felt it desirable that every assistance should be afforded by my Department to the Irish representatives and their substitutes.  Accordingly, in so far as the limited resources available permitted, I placed a small secretariat, consisting of officials of my Department, at the disposal of the Irish delegates, both here and in Strasbourg.  Unfortunately, owing to shortage of personnel, I feel that the secretariat provided by my Department was not as adequate as I would have liked it to be.  In so far as it lies in my power, it is my desire to continue to afford the maximum degree of co-operation I can to our representatives in the Assembly of the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>The delegates and the substitute delegates hold office from session to session of the Assembly and, accordingly the question of the appointment of Ireland's four delegates and four substitute delegates arises for consideration before the next meeting of the Consultative Assembly on the 7th August next.  It is the Government's intention to appoint the Irish delegates and substitute delegates on the same basis as last year, namely two delegates and three substitute delegates from the Government side and two delegates and one substitute delegate <Col N="1596" /> from the Opposition.  It is proposed to appoint from the Government side the same delegates as last year. The substitute delegates from the Government side will be Deputy T.F. O'Higgins (Junior) and Senators Crosbie and Finan.  Having consulted the Leader of the Opposition, and ascertained his wishes in so far as the Opposition representation is concerned, it is proposed to appoint the same delegates and substitute delegates as last year.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the Council of Europe consists of two main bodies; the Assembly, whose activities I have just dealt with and the Committee of Ministers, which is the repository of the power to make decisions.  In the Committee of Ministers, I have represented Ireland during the last year. Four sessions of the Committee of Ministers were held during the year:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) Strasbourg from 8th to 13th August, 1949;</P>
    <P>(b) Paris from 3rd to 5th November, 1949;</P>
    <P>(c) Strasbourg from the 30th March, to 1st April, 1950;</P>
    <P>(d) Paris on the 3rd June, 1950.</P>
    <P>Since the Council of Europe was formed, Greece, Iceland and Turkey were admitted to full membership, and Western Germany and the Saar were invited to join as associate members.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, the main matters of controversy within the Committee of Ministers can be classified under three main heads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) The powers of the Assembly;</P>
    <P>(b) The relationship between the Assembly and the Committee of Ministers;</P>
    <P>(c) The relationship between the Council of Europe and the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation.</P>
    <P>In relation to the first of these three matters, namely, the powers of the Assembly, there was a tendency to construe the statute strictly so as to restrict the powers of the Assembly to a minimum.  I felt that this was unwise and would tend to weaken the effectiveness of the Assembly to such an extent that it would cease to be <Col N="1597" /> regarded as a serious instrument of European co-operation.  I felt, too, that it was unwise to deprive the Assembly of responsibility, because its members would soon lose interest and would come to regard it merely as a debating society.  This would weaken both its prestige and its own sense of responsibility.  One cannot summon over 100 of the leading parliamentarians of Europe and then not allow them to discuss the problems they wish to discuss or to propose such recommendations as they may wish to make to the Committee of Ministers.</P>
    <P>At first I found myself in a minority in the Committee of Ministers on these issues, but as I foreshadowed last year, the members of the Assembly were not content with the rather passive role originally contemplated for them by the Committee of Ministers.  From the first day of its session, the Assembly made it quite clear that it would at least insist on the right to control its own agenda and proceedings. As a result of the Assembly's attitude, there is now a much more realistic approach to this question in the Committee of Ministers and I think that from now on much greater weight will be given to the views and wishes of the Assembly than was contemplated this time last year.</P>
    <P>It is, I think, a healthy sign for Europe that the Assembly, composed as it is of representatives of the national Parliaments of member countries, should be so conscious of its own responsibility that it has not hesitated to criticise the Committee of Ministers whenever it felt that the approach of Ministers was too timorous or hesitant.</P>
    <P>I found myself at first in disagreement with the majority of my Foreign Minister colleagues concerning the relationship which should exist between the Assembly and the Committee of Ministers.  For reasons which I explained last year to the House, I have felt that there should be a much closer relationship between the Committee of Ministers and the Assembly and that Ministers should attend meetings of the Assembly and be given a right to take part in the discussions of the Assembly.  Considerable progress has also been made in this direction. <Col N="1598" /> While the exact relationship of Ministers to the Assembly has not yet been finally determined, it is now agreed that Ministers may, on certain occasions, be given the right to address the Assembly.</P>
    <P>At the last meeting of the Committee of Ministers, a decision of fundamental importance was taken, which will, in my view, largely alter the existing structure of the Council of Europe.  A joint committee, consisting of five Ministers and seven representatives of the Assembly, presided over by the President of the Assembly, is to be set up with very wide terms of reference. It is true that this body is to have power only to make recommendations, but it is quite obvious that the Committee of Ministers would find it very difficult to reject recommendations, once made by such a body.  Accordingly, I think it likely that this body will become the effective focus of authority in the Council of Europe.  I welcome this development as I feel that it will lead to a greater degree of co-ordination between the Assembly and the Committee of Ministers and will result in a more realistic approach by both bodies to the various problems.</P>
    <P>The relationship between the Council of Europe and the O.E.E.C. has given rise to much discussion within the Committee of Ministers and, while a working solution has been found, no one, I think, is really quite satisfied as to the exact line of demarcation between these two international bodies.  Unfortunately, we suffer from a multiplicity of international organisations, many of which have been built hurriedly&mdash;for an <i>ad hoe</i> purpose&mdash; without much long-term planning.  The O.E.E.C., which was set up mainly to administer the Marshall Plan, deals in effect with all the economic problems of Europe.  It has at its command a most efficient and highly-trained team of economists and has done extremely useful work.  Unlike the Council of Europe, however, it is a purely inter-governmental organisation.  Many of the topics which have been and will be dealt with by the Council of Europe relate also, of course, to economic matters.  It is, therefore, difficult to segregate the spheres of activity of the two organisations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1599" /> In order to avoid the necessity for having to build up a separate technical economic machine for the Council of Europe, I have urged that the maximum facilities be afforded by the O.E.E.C. to the Assembly of the Council of Europe in relation to all economic matters.  Because of the fact that the O.E.E.C. is an inter-governmental organisation and also because its composition is not exactly similar to that of the Council of Europe, there has been a certain reluctance to make the services of the O.E.E.C. freely available to the Council of Europe.  However, a compromise has been reached, which, I think, will get over many of the difficulties which have hitherto existed in the relationship between the two organisations.</P>
    <P>In addition to meetings of Foreign Ministers, a number of meetings was also held of officials representing their respective Ministers and of specialised committees consisting of Government representatives.  In particular, a committee of legal experts was set up to examine the recommendations of the Assembly concerning the proposed Charter of Human Rights.  I asked Mr. Cecil Lavery&mdash;now Mr. Justice Lavery&mdash;to represent the Irish Government on this committee, and I would like to take this opportunity of paying a tribute to him for the very valuable contributions which he made in the discussions of this committee.</P>
    <P>France, Turkey and Ireland were given the task of examining the accounts of the Council of Europe to ensure that accounts were properly kept and that all expenditure was in accordance with the provisions made. In accordance with this decision, I appointed the Deputy Accountant General of the Revenue Commissioners to act as auditor on behalf of this country.  This official has attended meetings of the Audit Committee, and has been of considerable assistance in evolving the accounting procedure which is to be pursued in the future.</P>
    <P>These, briefly, are the main factual events that have occurred in relation <Col N="1600" /> to the Council of Europe during the past year.  Much of the work involved was of a procedural nature.  This was inevitable in the first year, but one cannot help regretting that more fundamental problems were not reached.</P>
    <P>It is well that, at this stage, we should have fairly clearly in mind the reasons which impel us to participate actively in this new attempt at international co-operation within Europe. One cannot blame anyone for being somewhat cynical at the failure, in the recent past, of international organisations to achieve peace and contentment among the nations.  This cynicism should not, however, deter us from continuing to strive to achieve some sort of system which will enable nations to live in peace and to make available to their people the full benefits of the resources placed by Providence at the disposal of humanity.  It is easy to be cynical about every endeavour that has not yet been proved successful.  But if cynicism were to be the guiding influence, few endeavours would ever be pursued to a successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out last year when speaking on this Estimate, the world is facing probably the greatest crisis in its known history.  With modern scientific developments, a war in Europe would certainly mean the physical destruction of those areas that stand in the path of the war and may well result in the complete destruction of the civilisation we have known.  In modern warfare, there are no victors, and the peoples of all the countries are the losers, whether they are involved directly or not.  The experience of the two world wars in this century has taught us that wars provide no solution.  Indeed, Communism and Fascism grew out of the wreckage of the first world war.  The expansion of Communism throughout Europe and the destruction of the economic fabric of the world have been the main results of the last war.  A third world war, with the destructive power now at the command of the bigger nations, would only intensify the destruction of our civilisation.</P>
    <P>Wars, however, have been the rule <Col N="1601" /> rather than the exception.  It is obvious, therefore, that, unless constant and determined efforts are made now to organise human relationship in such a way as to prevent or even, at least, to minimise the likelihood of wars, humanity will again drift into a world conflict.</P>
    <P>Probably because of history and of the conglomeration of different nationalities, Europe has been the starting point and storm centre of most wars.  Either for political or economic reasons, usually wars have been caused by the attempts of one other European nation to impose its domination over some of its neighbours.  That is why the Council of Europe and the O.E.E.C. are of such importance.  Both these organisations aim at removing the causes of conflict that have in the past led to war.  Apart from removing causes of conflict, the Council of Europe and the concept that underlies it should bring closer together the peoples of the different European nations and their elected representatives. The greater the degree of contact and understanding that can be established on a co-operative basis, the less likely are nations to want to engage in conflict.</P>
    <P>No amount of cynicism or despondency should allow us to relax in any way the efforts to secure these aims. As a predominantly Christian nation and as a people with a long tradition of idealism devoid of any desire to dominate, politically or economically, any other nation, we can and should take a leading part in steering Europe to a co-operative basis of organisation.</P>
    <P>To those who, through cynicism or lack of idealism, may consider that Ireland has no mission to perform in this field, I would like to point out that Ireland is very practically and vitally interested in ensuring the peace of Europe and of the world.  The development of aerial transport and of methods of warfare have radically altered the strategy and politics of war.  Wars are no longer limited to neighbouring States, they can, and are likely to be, inter-continental.  Ireland's geographical position which, in the past, was an element of protection, may now well turn out to be an element <Col N="1602" /> of particular danger to us.  The technique and cost of modern armament are such as to put it out of reach of small neutral States to protect themselves adequately, without outside help, from a would-be invader.  In this changed and rapidly changing set of circumstances, we in Ireland have a very vital interest in straining every nerve to maintain world peace.  Linked as we are with three continents, a Christian nation with a long tradition of idealism, we can, I believe, play a useful role to this end.  However, be our efforts puny or important, be they successful or ineffective, let us strive with sincerity and idealism to influence events in the way most likely to ensure the peace and welfare of humanity.</P>
    <P>The Council of Europe differs from all previous attempts to organise for peace in two important respects, which I think invest it with far greater potentialities for good than other attempts.</P>
    <P>In the first place, unlike the League of Nations and the United Nations Organisation, it is not purely an inter-governmental organisation.  The Assembly of the Council of Europe is, in effect, the first real attempt at a European Parliament.  True, the seat of power rests in the Committee of Ministers, which is inter-governmental, but the Assembly, as it has already shown, can and will increasingly assert its authority and influence.</P>
    <P>In my view, this is of fundamental importance.  Inter-governmental organisations are slow, cautious and inevitably subject to secret diplomacy.  The Assembly, composed as it is of elected representatives of the people, both from the Government Parties and the Opposition Parties of the different European Parliaments, will bring a completely new concept to bear in international affairs.  Secret diplomacy and power politics will cease to be effective weapons under the searchlight of an active parliamentary Assembly.  It will also result in a better informed opinion in the European Parliaments on international problems and, I trust, in a greater degree of mutual understanding between the members of the different parliaments.  Such an informed public opinion, coupled with <Col N="1603" /> closer contact between the peoples of the different nations, should reduce the tendency to drift into conflict.</P>
    <P>In the second place, unlike previous attempts at international organisation, the Council of Europe excludes from its ambit all military matters and does not seek to enforce its rule by means of military sanctions.  This, too, I think, is an important factor.  Psychologically, the emphasis is placed upon the mutual desire to co-operate and is not dependent upon the use of force. It removes, to a certain degree, the element of power politics that has been so evident in other international organisations.</P>
    <P>These two elements, and in particular the first one, give me considerable hope, that it may be possible to develop the Council of Europe on sounder foundations than earlier attempts in the same direction.</P>
    <P>While this is not strictly related to European affairs, the House would, I think, expect me to give some indication of my views in relation to recent events in Asia and concerning their possible repercussions on the rest of the world.  I need not here recite the events which have caused the gravest anxieties to the Governments and peoples of the world in recent weeks. These are well known to the House. Having entered into onerous covenants in good faith, but in an era of unfinished peace amidst the shambles that resulted from the last war, the United States and the U.N.O. had little or no alternative but to adopt the course which they pursued.  With a full and sympathetic understanding of the motives of the United States and the United Nations we have watched with anxiety their efforts to maintain international peace under most difficult circumstances.  The events of recent weeks are the outcome of conditions resulting from many grievous mistakes made in the recent past&mdash;at Yalta and at Potsdam, and of even more grievous mistakes made in the more distant past by European and Japanese imperialism.</P>
    <P>This heritage from the past, coupled with the unnatural partition of Korea, <Col N="1604" /> was an easy target for unscrupulous exploitation.  As one of the architects of the unfinished peace, Russia was not slow to exploit a situation which she had in no small measure helped to create.</P>
    <P>While in no way wishing to take away from the very real sympathy which we extend to the United States in this crisis we, in common with the other democratic nations of the world, have much to learn from it.  Partitioned, unarmed and living under a doubtful democratic rule, in conditions of economic insecurity, the people of Korea were an easy prey to an ideology that promised national unity and economic welfare.  Partitioned, unarmed, politically and economically weak, the South Koreans had neither the enthusiasm nor the material resources necessary to resist an invasion led under a banner of national unity and sovereignity and backed by a strong and unscrupulous power.  In these circumstances the battle for the human conscience of the people of Korea was lost before the first shot was fired, and now the sincere and, I am convinced, altruistic motive of the people of the United States will be misrepresented throughout Asia as forming part of a desire to dominate a portion of Asia.</P>
    <P>More isolated from the centre of the storm than most other nations and partitioned ourselves, we are possibly able to view these events more objectively. Once you partition a nation and depart from the ordinary rules of democracy and liberty, you nullify the power of that nation to protect and defend itself physically and morally. Once you interfere with the sovereignty or unity of a nation, you create conditions that inevitably sow the seeds of civil war and disaster.  Is it too much to hope that even in the midst of this turmoil, the pages of history that are being written in these days in Asia will bring about a realisation that the partition of our nation constitutes a dangerous festering sore in the body politic of the democratic world?  The partition of Korea was the result of an unfinished peace.  The partition of Ireland, too, is the result of the unfinished peace between Ireland and Britain.  The efflux of time <Col N="1605" /> has in no way minimised the constant danger which the partition of our country involves for our people and for the democracies of the world.</P>
    <P>Lest anything I have said should be capable of being construed as attaching blame to the United States for the partition of Korea, let me hasten to remind the House that only a short time ago President Truman made a declaration setting out in unmistakable terms the opposition of the United States to the continued partition of Korea.  He declared:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All Americans who have come to know the Korean people appreciate their fierce passion for freedom and their keen desire to become an independent nation.</P>
    <P>The debilitated state in which the Korean economy was left by the Japanese has been accentuated by the separation of the hydro-electric power, coal and metal and fertiliser industries of the north from the agricultural and textile industries of the south, and by the effects of continuing Communist agitation.</P>
    <P>The Republic of Korea, and the freedom-seeking people of North Korea held under Soviet domination, seek for themselves a united, selfgoverning and sovereign country, independent of foreign control and support and with membership in the United Nations.</P>
    <P>The United States has a deep interest in the continuing progress of the Korean people towards these objectives.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This clear-cut statement by President Truman made a deep impression on my mind at the time it was made because of the parallel it held for us in relation to the enforced partition of our country against the overwhelming wishes of our people.</P>
    <P>The struggle which divides the present-day world into two camps reaches far deeper into the foundations of our civilisation than a struggle which is based solely on the territorial or national ambitions of one or more nations.  It is a struggle which will be won or lost in the conscience of mankind, rather than in the field of strategy or diplomacy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1606" /> I fear that insufficient thought has so far been given by the leaders of the democratic world to the fundamental issues that are involved and to the remedies.  Many decisions have had to be taken in the agony of the moment, and therefore based on the strategic and military aspects of the conflict.  Military preparedness to remove the temptation of military adventures by Russian imperialism is undoubtedly necessary, but this is only temporising and does not reach the root of the problem.</P>
    <P>To win the battle in the conscience and mind of mankind, it is not sufficient merely to decry Communism and Russian imperialism.  Our attitude, must be, not merely a negative one, but a constructive one.  Counter materialism and force, however useful, do not provide the ideal around which the human conscience can rally.  To succeed, it is essential that the democratic world should evolve a clear-cut political and economic philosophy that will enunciate clearly the principles for which the democratic world stands. These should be based upon the liberty and dignity of the human being, justice, and equality of opportunity. In the economic sphere, it must include the right to work for an adequate family wage, and the utilisation of productive capacity for the welfare of the people.  In the national sphere, it should include a clear enunciation of democratic principles and assert the right of nations to determine their own affairs freely, by democratic means, without outside interference.</P>
    <P>The democratic world lacks a charter of what it guarantees to its people. It is essential that such a charter should be provided and that, once provided, it should be scrupulously observed by big and small nations alike.  It should be the banner around which those who believe in national, personal, political and religious liberty throughout the world can rally.  I hope that the Council of Europe may be of assistance, so far as this portion of the world is concerned, in providing for what I consider to be a lacuna in the philosophy of the western democracies.</P>
    <P>On account of the shortness of time, <Col N="1607" /> I think I will not be able to deal at any length with the work related to the O.E.E.C. I have already indicated that the work involved was very considerable and that it has imposed tremendous pressure and strain on the staff of the Department of External Affairs.  If there are any questions arising from our participation in the O.E.E.C., I shall be happy to answer them.  As I think our side of the House have probably spoken at greater length than they should, I shall not be able to deal with the O.E.E.C. in detail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given us a very fair summary of the activities of our representatives on the Council of Europe.  I do not think it would be right to go into any detail on that matter or to point out to what extent our views might differ from the views expressed by the Minister.  As he said, we are there as individuals, so to speak, and even when members of the Government speak on matters of this sort I would not expect that they would be absolutely bound to speak in the same way.  We were fortunate that we found ourselves, in the main, in agreement.  I think that was valuable from the point of view of the prestige of our country.</P>
      <P>It was very interesting for me to note the unanimity with which we were able to approach certain questions and the apparent divided opinions which were held by those who were always accusing Irish people of not being able to agree and representing themselves as paragons of propriety always able to adjust their differences. As I say, it was very interesting, but I do not think I should detain the House by dealing with that matter or referring to the happenings at the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was at some pains to discover how far the views which I held coincided with the views which were held by some of the representatives of the Government side.  Statements I have seen recently convince me that the differences on certain fundamentals are not as great as I thought they were when I was in Strasbourg.  At Strasbourg I felt that the Government had <Col N="1608" /> the same kind of approach to the council and its work as some of the continental representatives.  They thought they had a Parliament of Europe and that they could immediately divide themselves up into political Parties with the Committee of Ministers acting as a kind of Cabinet of Europe.  I felt that was a line upon which we could not proceed, certainly not for a very long time to come.  I do not think any of the small States could immediately acquiesce in such a position. Some recent statements that I have seen from the Government side seem to indicate now that I was wrong then in thinking that the Government was proceeding on that particular line.  I think we are much nearer now than I had believed in our general approach to the Council of Europe.  I am very glad of that, because, if it should eventuate that there was a difference of opinion, such a difference as I felt was there at that time, it would lead to a serious difference here and become a problem for us.</P>
    <P>One matter upon which I would like some information from the Minister with regard to this Estimate is as to whether there has been a percentage basis determined for our contributions and what is the basis of determination? That information will do when the Minister is concluding.  He may not have it at hand at the moment.  I know that in the Charter to the Council of Europe some basis was indicated. It was not strictly a percentage basis, but it was an agreed basis.  As far as our country was concerned, it seemed to be quite fair.  I am not so sure about the other organisation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1609" /> With regard to the wider field, we could, of course, debate for years on the various matters arising.  I have already indicated that I propose to deal with the world situation and problems of defence when the Taoiseach's Vote is under consideration.  I think it would be better to concentrate on those matters on that Vote. I do not, therefore, propose to follow the Minister along some of the roads he travelled when introducing this Estimate.  Reading the Minister's statement, there is one matter which would immediately strike anyone perusing it; that is the reference to the statement made by President Truman. When I saw that statement, it immediately occurred to me how impossible it is for any statesman to talk about the freedom of peoples and the rights of peoples in any part of the world and in any terms whatsoever which will not appear to point directly to our country.  That was true of the statements made by President Wilson on the rights of small nations during the first world war.</P>
    <P>Several months ago I had seen statements made by General MacArthur about Korea and about the unity of that country.  Again, those statements point of our case as typical of a small country that has a right to its freedom. It seems impossible for any statesman on any occasion to choose words which will isolate the particular country to which he is referring without these words being peculiarly applicable to our country, very often in a manner more direct and impressive than the manner in which they apply to the country intended.  That is true of this recent statement by President Truman. I am sure that was the impression that it made upon the Minister and I am sure it was that which led him to quote it out here, although his immediate purpose was somewhat different.</P>
    <P>It would not be wise at this hour to travel over the wide field of international affairs.  I do not know to what extent the Council of Europe will be particularly helpful in bringing about that attitude of mind and that appreciation which the Minister speaks of as being so fundamental.  The difficulty <Col N="1610" /> at the present moment in appealing to the consciences of men in regard to the important ideological issues is the fact that all men are not free to express an opinion.  It is possible in a democratic country to make an appeal and to use reason and argument to support that appeal.  Everybody in a democratic country is free to use argument in relation to these ideologies.  But over a great part of the Continent of Europe to-day there is no chance whatever of appealing to reason because force is used to suppress individual expressions of opinion and we have, therefore, a tremendous difficulty in trying to appeal to reason in order to bring about a settlement of international matters and to get a common understanding between nations, always assuming that the aim is to benefit mankind in general and bring about a better social system.  The difficulty is that the argument which can be used here&mdash;and when I say here I mean in the western countries&mdash;is precluded in the areas behind what is commonly called the &ldquo;Iron Curtain&rdquo; and is, therefore, of no avail.  To me that rules out the basis of the Minister's own argument, except in so far as it applies to the western democracies, those states which stand for human freedom, the rights of individuals in human society and the rights of nations.  In all those states there is a possibility of appealing to reason on the basis that we are all genuinely anxious to bring about a system, social, political and economic, which will lead to increased human happiness.</P>
    <P>The trouble is that that is not possible in those countries where there is the opposing ideology, Communism. Therefore, the danger of war is far greater because once the right to argument on the basis of reason is excluded, one immediately urges the use of force.  Where fundamental matters are at stake, which people regard as more precious than life, and where the use of reason is precluded, one will inevitably find that there are people prepared to use force.  In my opinion, that is the real danger in the world to-day.  Argument is precluded and, therefore, the tendency will be to resort to force.  We are in a very <Col N="1611" /> parlous situation at the moment. Those who are responsible for the welfare of our State have a very serious responsibility to face and a tremendous task to shoulder.</P>
    <P>The Minister will perhaps permit me to ask a question which might have been more properly asked on the Estimate for his Department.  Last December I saw that there was a general amnesty in Yugo-Slavia.  It was announced in the public Press that there would be such an amnesty. Now it was generally known that two very important prisoners were being held in Yugo-Slavia: one is Archbishop Stepinac and the other is Bishop Cule of Mostar.  I do not know whether they have been released or whether this reported general amnesty actually took place.  If it did, were they included amongst those who were released or are they still detained?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that if an amnesty did take place, it did not include either of the two prelates mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>No.  In relation to the clergy in Korea, we have not been able to get any information yet.  The Deputy will appreciate that there would be considerable difficulties.  The position of our missionaries right through the Orient has been a matter of extreme worry recently.  In many areas their difficulties have been increased; in some areas this has been done by way of additional taxes and of local steps taken to increase the difficulties of the missions.  We have taken certain steps in the hope that they may be of assistance.  I do not know if these steps will be of any value, but the House can be assured that the matter is constantly under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. MacBride)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves of the terms of the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between Ireland and the United States of America, signed at Dublin on the 21st January, 1950, a copy of which was laid on the Table of the Dáil on the 21st January, 1950.</P>
      <P>The text of this Treaty has been in the hands of Deputies for some time now and, therfore, its contents are, no doubt, already familiar to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The relations between States in such matters as trade and the reciprocal treatment of citizens are normally conducted within the framework of a basic Treaty which sets out the general conditions governing the <Col N="1613" /> position of nationals and companies of one party in the territory of the other, the rights to be enjoyed by them as regards employment, taxation and access to the courts, and the general conditions governing trade, shipping and similar commercial activities between the two countries.  Treaties of this kind constitute, in fact, a &ldquo;bill of rights,&rdquo; as it were, of the nationals of each country in their dealings with the Government, authorities and private concerns in the territory of the other.</P>
    <P>This is the first comprehensive treaty of its kind which has been concluded between Ireland and the United States.  Hitherto, our mutual dealings as regards the matters covered in the treaty have been regulated by three treaties concluded between Britain and the United States in the last century which, under the general rules of international law, could still be invoked by this country after the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922.  Apart from other considerations, this position was unsatisfactory from our point of view because the treaties concerned were in many respects completely out of date and their provisions did not cover a number of matters such as the enjoyment of social service benefits and the conduct of publishing educational and cultural activities, which were unheard of perhaps 100 years ago but which developments in the meantime have made of considerable importance.</P>
    <P>The treaty consists of a preamble, 25 articles and a protocol.  Its terms provide for the mutual grant of national treatment in respect of some matters and of most-favoured-nation treatment in respect of others.  It is hardly necessary, perhaps, to go through the treaty in detail, but there are one or two points which are worth special mention.  For example, under Article 4, Irish nationals in the United States will receive the same treatment as American citizens as regards statutory compensation for disease, injury or death arising out, or in the course, of their employment.  Similar treatment is assured as regards compulsory insurance claims providing for old age <Col N="1614" /> and unemployment.  Article 4 entitles Irish commercial manufacturing and publishing firms who carry on business in the United States to the same conditions as those applicable to American firms engaged in like activities.</P>
    <P>The same principle applies to teachers and religious organisations and professional men other than lawyers. This means, for example, that an Irish doctor, although not an American citizen, may practise in the United States once he has satisfied the qualifications required by American law.  The national treatment provided for in Article IX in respect of internal taxation is subject to an exception as regards taxes connected with the acquisition of real property.  The treaty consular matters.  These were left over to be dealt with in a separate treaty which has since been signed and presented to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The present treaty will remain in force for ten years after the exchange of ratifications unless it is terminated in that period under the provisions of sub-paragraph 4 of Article VI.</P>
    <P>I am particularly glad to have the opportunity and responsibility of presenting to the House this Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation with the United States of America. There is no nation in the world with whom we have closer links, and this treaty symbolises these links.  To a large extent, our two nations mutually inspired each other in the course of their struggle for independence and in the assertion of human democratic rights.  I trust that this treaty will guide the destinies of our two nations ever closer together and enable them to play an ever-increasing influence in the assertion of national, human, political and religious liberty.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity of expressing to the United States our sympathy and appreciation of the sacrifices now being made by them in order to maintain world peace.</P>
    <P>I should also like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to Mr. George Garrett, the Ambassador of the United States, for his untiring and friendly co-operation in bringing to a successful conclusion the negotiations <Col N="1615" /> which led to the signature of this treaty.  His sympathetic understanding and co-operation were in no small measure responsible for this important milestone in the relationship between our two nations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We naturally welcome this treaty as a gesture and symbol of the good relations that should naturally exist between our people and the people of the United States.  I must confess that when I read the terms of it, I did not find a great deal of substance in it.  It seemed to me that there was little in it that was not already a matter of general practice under international law.  I was surprised to hear the Minister say that most of these relations are established by way of treaty.  At least, I gathered that from his statement. It seemed to me that most of the privileges or rights that are granted under this treaty would in fact be enjoyed under the normal practice by residents in the United States or in any democratic State.  I was interested in the question of the conscription of Irish citizens who might be resident in the United States and made amenable to American law.  As I understand this treaty, what is provided is that Irish nationals would not be subject to conscription there unless the two States were simultaneously at war and that, therefore, it was to be presumed that there was a common cause.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, it is provided that a national of ours will have a choice within a reasonable time.  I am always anxious about the phrase, &ldquo;a reasonable time&rdquo;, as to what exactly would be considered a resonable time.  The idea there, of course, would be to see that, suppose you had conscription here in case this State was at war and conscription also in the United States, you would not have somebody, because of residence in the United States, escaping service in both countries.  That is precluded, I take it, by the terms of the treaty.  We can object to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matter was whether this treaty would interfere with our Control of Manufactures Act.  I find <Col N="1616" /> that, although certain privileges are supposed to be given, nevertheless, there are exceptions to provide necessary safeguards, as far as we are concerned.  The Minister seemed to be more concerned with telling us the privileges that our residents in the United States would enjoy than with telling us what privileges citizens of the United States would enjoy in this country.  We should be very careful to see that we are making a reasonable bargain, because a small country is in far greater need of protecting itself against exploitation by a large State than the reverse.  What might appear to be equal terms in law might result in very unequal terms in practice.  I hope this Treaty has been carefully examined by the Minister and his officials to see that the things which we have found it necessary to safeguard by positive law are not interfered with by the treaty.  A case in point is the Control of Manufactures Act.</P>
    <P>With regard to other matters, compulsory insurance, etc., I take it that where a resident of a State is compelled to subscribe to insurance then, in justice, he would be allowed to benefit also.  That is secured so far as I can see in the treaty but in case there is any doubt about it, the matter should be carefully examined.  The treaty is a fairly long one and I think all international treaties of this character should be examined with great care by members of the House. Treaties have to be presented here for ratification and it is the duty, particularly of lawyer members of the House, to examine these treaties with care and to see that the national interest are safeguarded.  It not infrequently happens that those who negotiate an instrument are inclined, when changes are made and a certain phraseology is used to meet a particular aspect they have in mind, not to read its terms as widely as they can be read afterwards. You put down a certain phrase to meet a certain specific situation and some time afterwards when you read that phrase again, it appears to have a far wider meaning than the meaning attributed to it originally.  In the case of all these documents there is a great need that members of the House who <Col N="1617" /> are detached from the negotiations and the circumstances in which the negotiations took place, should consider them so as to interpret them in the broad terms in which they may afterwards be interpreted by a court.  It is in that type of close examination of documents that lawyer members of the House could help and be of great assistance.  One of the functions which they should take upon themselves is to read documents of that sort with extreme care, so as to point out any flaws that might occur in them and to see that, when a document is being accepted, it is not capable of a meaning far wider than that which was intended by those who signed the instrument.</P>
    <P>I must say for myself that I have read this document with a certain amount of care and I have not been able to discover anything of that nature, but then I am not a legal person.  I am suggesting a counsel of perfection, if you like, but I think when a document of this sort is negotiated by a Department, like the Department of External Affairs, the law officers, acting quite separately and apart from it, should get the final instrument when it is presented and examine it carefully.  I imagine that that would be done in the normal course on the part of the Government, but in case there should be any possibility of dispute afterwards as to the interpretation of it, there should be that independent examination.</P>
    <P>At the time of the negotiations which led up to the Treaty in 1921 one of the precautions we took was to provide that the document before being signed would be brought home so that it might be examined by the people at home quite independently.  If that precaution had been observed, I do not think that Article 12 in regard to the Boundary Agreement, which was interpreted afterwards in quite a different way from that in which it was intended it should be interpreted by least one set of signatories, would have been agreed to in the form in which it appeared in the Treaty.  There was an interpretation put upon it which shocked not merely those who were parties to the Treaty and supported <Col N="1618" /> it, but a number of people who had quite different opinions.  Differences in the interpretation of these often due to the fact that those who negotiate them are not aware of the wider interpretation that can be given to phrases that are used to express their ideas.</P>
    <P>I do hope therefore, although I do not myself see anything in this particular instrument that could lead to any grave danger except those clauses which might limit our powers with regard to protecting ourselves under the Control of Manufactures Act or matters of that kind, that this treaty has been carefully examined.  So far as my reading of it goes, we are protected I think in the matters I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Department of External Affairs, who always in these cases have the advice of their own law officers, when they negotiate an instrument should examine it carefully but, quite independently from them, the law officers should also examine it.  It would not be well to bring in the general law officers at an early stage; they should get the document in its final form and be asked to consider it quite independently of the Department.  To conclude, we are not opposed to this treaty, but welcome it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister if we are to understand from the treaty that Irish doctors would be permitted to practise in the United States under certain conditions; whether these conditions involve an examination; and <i>vice versa</i> whether American doctors coming here would be allowed to practise in this State either with or without an examination?  Heretofore, of course, it was necessary to pass an examination.  Am I to understand from the Minister's statement that as long as the American authorities were satisfied that an Irish doctor was well qualified he could practise in America and <i>vice versa</i> with regard to American doctors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may deal with Deputy Dr. Brennan's question first, <Col N="1619" /> the position in relation to Irish doctors practising in the United State was that, under existing laws in the United States in the different States, only a United States citizen was entitled to practise medicine and a number of the other professions.  The effect of this treaty is to exempt Irish citizens from these provisions, in other words, to enable Irish citizens to practise the profession of medicine or teaching; lawyers, however, are excluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>In our case, a treaty does not become part of the positive law; we have to implement it by legislation subsequently if it entails a change in the law.  The effect of this treaty is to enable Irish citizens to practise in the United States of America every profession except law. For some reason lawyers are excluded. Possibly it was felt that there were too many lawyers in the United States; possibly it was felt that there were too many lawyers in Congress or in <Col N="1620" /> the State Legislatures and that it would not be a popular exemption. However, we did not press that matter particularly hard.</P>
      <P>The treaty is of very considerable importance and it gives Irish citizens in the United States rights which citizens of very few other nations in the world have.  In other words an Irish citizen is now in a superior position in the United States in relation to some of the rights enumerated in this treaty than, say, a British citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of them. For instance, an Irish citizen can become a teacher, can by law practise the profession of teaching in State schools.  A British subject cannot.  I have enumerated a number of them in opening and I think the Deputy will find a list of these enumerated in a statement that was issued at the time the treaty was signed and I can let him have it.  It is quite an important treaty and I might mention that the negotiations for a similar treaty between Britain and the United States have been proceeding for some 80 years and have not yet been concluded.</P>

      <P>The Estimates for my Department which I now submit to the Dáil include two Supplementary Estimates which arise out of the Social Welfare Act, 1950, which has recently become law.  These Supplementary Estimates are for the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare and for the National Health Insurance Vote.</P>
      <P>The first is required in order that the Dáil may vote the additional money needed to pay the salaries and wages of the staff of the National Health Insurance Society after the transfer of the society to the Department of Social Welfare.  This transfer has been fixed for the 1st August next by the Order recently made under the provisions of Section 4 of the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will note that the Supplementary Estimate for the office of the Minister for Social Welfare is a token one only, as provision is made under Section 16 of the Act to appropriate in aid of the Vote from the National Health Insurance Fund the approximate amount of the additional expenditure falling on the Vote as a result of the transfer of the society to the Department.</P>
      <P>The second Supplementary Estimate, that for national health insurance, is required mainly in order that the Dáil may authorise the payment in the current financial year of the moneys estimated to be required in that year under the provisions of sub-sections (3) and (4) of Section 21 of the Social Welfare Act, 1950.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second item in this Supplementary Estimate, the additional provision under sub-head B of the original Estimate, is in respect of the two-ninths State Grant on expenditure on benefits <Col N="1622" /> and administration.  There has been a substantial increase in expenditure on sickness and disablement benefits since the original Estimate was prepared at the end of last year due probably to the fact that full benefits are now payable to persons brought into insurance on 7th April, 1947, by the raising of the remuneration limit for insurance from £250 to £500 per annum.  As the amount provided in the main Estimate under sub-head B is now likely to prove inadequate, advantage has been taken of this Supplementary Estimate to increase the provision under that sub-head.</P>
    <P>The total amount provided through the seven Estimates for my Department for the year 1950-51 (including Supplementary Estimates) is almost exactly the same as the amount provided for the year 1949-50, whereas the total expenditure for 1949-50 exceeded the expenditure in the preceding year 1948-49 by almost £2,000,000.  This increase in expenditure in 1949-50 over that for the previous year was due to the increased expenditure on old age and widows' and orphans' pensions brought about by the Social Welfare Act, 1948.  That Act raised the pension rates and eased the means conditions in respect of both types of pension.</P>
    <P>In the case of old age and blind pensions, the increase in the number of persons in receipt of pensions and in the yearly value of the pensions in payment since 31st December, 1947, may be seen from the following: On 31st December, 1947, the number of persons in receipt of old age and blind pensions was 149,314, at a yearly cost of £4,896,284; on 31st December, 1948, the number had increased to 152,539, at a yearly cost of £4,999,063, and at 31st December, 1949, it had further increased to 159,866, at a total annual cost of £6,959,502, the Social Welfare Act of 1948 having become operative in the meantime.  The number of old age pensions payable this year is expected to reach the record figure of 162,000 and the Estimate of the Department has been framed accordingly.</P>
    <P>During the two years from 31st December, 1947, to 31st December, 1949, therefore, the number of persons in receipt of old age and blind pensions <Col N="1623" /> increased by more than 10,000 and the value of the pensions in payment by more than £2,000,000.</P>
    <P>In the case of widows' and orphans' pensions, at 31st December, 1947, the number of persons in receipt of widows' and orphans' pensions was 37,102, at a yearly cost of £1,277,359; at 31st December, 1948, the number was 37,289, at a total cost of £1,294,147; and at 31st December, 1949, the number had increased to 43,299, at an annual cost of £1,709,168.</P>
    <P>During the two years from 31st December, 1947, to 31st December, 1949, therefore, the number of persons in receipt of widows' and orphans' pensions increased by more than 6,000 and the yearly value of the pensions in payment by £432,000.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of pensions, I might mention a rather important ruling which was obtained during the past year from the Attorney-General, regarding the practice previously followed of assessing home assistance as means in respect of claimants to old age pensions.  I had the question referred to the Attorney-General and, as a result of his ruling, any home assistance which a person may receive is now ignored in calculating his means for the purposes of the Old Age Pensions Acts.</P>
    <P>While there has been an increase in recent years in the number of persons in receipt of old age pensions, blind pensions and widows' and orphans' pensions and in the yearly value of those pensions in payment, it is satisfactory to be able to record a decrease in the past year in the number of persons claiming unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The number of persons claiming unemployment insurance benefit at the end of March, 1949, was 24,943; the corresponding figure at the end of March, 1950, was 20,964.  This is a drop of almost 4,000 persons in receipt of benefit.  The expenditure on unemployment insurance benefit in the year ending on the 31st March, 1949, was £1,021,675.  Final figures for the expenditure on the same benefit in the year <Col N="1624" /> ending 31st March, 1950, are not yet available, but the figure can be given approximately as £931,000.  The decrease in expenditure on unemployment benefit in 1949-50 as compared with 1948-49 was, therefore, £90,000.</P>
    <P>The number of persons claiming unemployment assistance at the end of March, 1949, was 50,346; the corresponding number at the end of March, 1950, was 40,371, a drop of almost 10,000.  The expenditure on unemployment assistance in the year ending 31st March, 1949, was £1,498,897.  The expenditure in the year ending 31st March, 1950, was approximately £1,369,000, a decrease of nearly £130,000 as compared with the previous year.</P>
    <P>While the number of persons claiming both unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance has been falling substantially, the number of persons employed in occupations insurable under the Unemployment Insurance Acts has been increasing. In 1947, it was estimated that the weekly average of the number of persons in occupations insurable under the Unemployment Insurance Acts was 304,200; in 1948, the figure had increased to 319,700; and, in 1949, the figure further increased to 341,300.</P>
    <P>The figure for 1949 includes about 11,000 persons brought into insurance by the increase in the remuneration limit for unemployment insurance from £250 per annum to £500 per annum under the Social Welfare Act, 1948.</P>
    <P>It is worthy of note that an increase in employment and in the contribution income of the unemployment fund has the effect of increasing the Exchequer contribution to that fund and so increasing the amount which has to be voted for unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>In the year 1950-51 the sum of £460,000 is estimated to be required as the Exchequer contribution to the unemployment fund, an increase of £26,000 on the previous year.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned already the great improvement in the position of old age and blind pensioners effected by the Social Welfare Act of 1948.  Deputies will remember that under that Act the <Col N="1625" /> lower age limit for qualification for a blind pension was reduced from 30 years to 21 years and, at the same time, the weekly rate of pension was increased to 17/6.  As a result of this change the number of blind pensioners increased from 5,446 at 31st December, 1948, to 5,885 at 31st December, 1949.</P>
    <P>At my request, local authorities undertook a revision of the blind welfare schemes in operation throughout the country, and a revised standard scheme was circulated to them for their consideration.  This revised scheme provided, amongst other things, for increased rates of allowances.  I am pleased to be able to state that the revised schemes have been adopted by all but three local authorities, whose consideration of the matter is not yet completed.</P>
    <P>The Consultative Council for the Blind continued its very valuable work during the year.  In particular, it surveyed the position of the industrial employment available for male blind, and I expect to have a recommendation in this matter from the council at an early date.  I would like to take this opportunity of thanking the members of this council for giving their services in this worthy cause.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the Social Welfare Act, 1950, in connection with the Supplementary Estimates which are before the House.  This Act was an important step forward in the integration and expansion of the social services which I undertook as my main task when I took office.  As I stated when that Act was before the Dáil the merging of the National Health Insurance Society in the Department of Social Welfare was an essential preliminary to the introduction of a comprehensive scheme of social security for this country.  The Order appointing the 1st August, 1950, as the day on which the functions of the society will be transferred to the Department has now been made.  I wish, therefore, to take this opportunity to pay a welldeserved tribute to the good work the society has done since it was set up in 1934.</P>
    <P>I would like to include in this tribute the Committee of Management, the trustees and the officers and staff <Col N="1626" /> of the society, both present and past. They have all helped in their own sphere to make the society the efficient organisation which it is to-day and they can all feel satisfaction in handing it over, not to disappear, but to continue its work of assisting those workers who have to be covered against ill-health and who are not able to make adequate provision themselves against the financial hardship inseparable from even short periods of sickness.</P>
    <P>Since I last dealt with the Estimates for my Department the White Paper dealing with the Government's proposals for an enlarged and co-ordinated scheme of social security has been issued.  The public has had time to consider those proposals and the Government has decided to proceed with the Bill, which will be based on the White Paper proposals.  This Bill was introduced a few days ago, and Deputies will have an opportunity of discussing it after the Dáil reassembles in the autumn.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with some of the activities of my Department and have reviewed the work of the past year. There may be other aspects of the Department's work on which Deputies would like further information.  These will, no doubt, emerge in the course of the debate and I will endeavour as far as possible to deal with them when replying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration. The Minister has given us a lot of figures.  I am afraid it would be impossible to deal with these figures because the Minister gave figures in certain directions and I would have to ask him to elaborate them by giving figures in other directions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I would like to draw attention to is the change in the Minister as displayed in the optimism with which he looks upon benefits that he has brought in now as compared to his view of the benefits that might be necessary when he was Leader of the Opposition here in 1946 and 1947.  At that time he was a Deputy of the House and Leader of the Labour Party.  He drew very vivid pictures of the sufferings of people who were <Col N="1627" /> drawing unemployment insurance and sickness allowances.  Sometimes he made Deputies very sad.  His picture of the sufferings of these people would draw tears from a stone.  To-day he hardly referred to them.  Perhaps the Minister believes that the fact that he is Minister has made these people happy, but that is the only thing he can claim because they really are drawing the same benefits now as they were drawing in 1947.  The Minister has been in office two and a half years and has not done anything to change matters as far as they are concerned.</P>
    <P>I felt, when speaking on this Estimate two years ago, that we should give the Minister a chance, that we should not be too hard on him, that we should give him time and that, if we gave him a little time, he might be able to do something.  Last year I thought we had given him enough time and we made what one might call a mild attack on the Minister.  Now he has been two and a half years there and he has not shown very much for his time.  I do not know whether we should be too mild towards the Minister or not.  Of course, when one looks across at the Minister, one finds it almost impossible to be too hard on him.</P>
    <P>In August, 1947, the Labour Party issued a memorandum on what they believed to be a fair system of social welfare.  They started off in a poetic vein.  They said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Our lands are fertile or can be made fertile; our crop yields are high in relation to the crop returns of many other agricultural countries; in a temperate climate, we have abundant rainfall.  Our civilisation is rich in beauty and romance.  Our annals are teeming with the achievements of great thinkers, inventors, poets, scientists, crusaders, who have enriched the history of mankind by their courage and genius.  Why, then, is Ireland poor?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Having launched out in the poetic, they go on to consider what would be a fair amount for a family to live upon. The Labour Party of the time&mdash;they were facing a general election&mdash;thought fit to put before the people of this <Col N="1628" /> country what they believed to be a fair standard of living for the ordinary family.  I am sure the Minister would like to forget about it, but perhaps it would be no harm for the members of the Labour Party who are present now to have their memories refreshed in regard to the idea they had, coming up to the 1948 election, about what the standard of our people should be.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It has been calculated&rdquo; (they said) &ldquo;by some leaders of medical opinion in Ireland that the lowest sum on which a family of five persons, including three children, could have been maintained in 1938 was 71/- per week.  Assuming that this figure is generally reliable, and accepting the evidence of the official cost-of-living index figure, the lowest income on which a family of five persons can be maintained at present (July 1947) is £6 5s. od. per week.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, as applied to the present cost of living, would be over £7 per week for a family of five persons.</P>
    <P>The Minister who is speaking here to-day was the Leader of the Labour Party at that time.  He either approved of that statement or he should have approved of it before it was issued. He approved of that statement and went to the electorate in 1948 promising, in fact, that if he was returned in the Government of the country no family of five would be expected to exist on less than £7 1s. per week on the present cost-of-living basis.  He leaves sickness benefits as they were in 1947; he leaves unemployment benefits as they were in 1947.  All he has done in these two and a half years is to get a higher contribution from them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a short memory or he purports to have a short memory. He forgets about his pronouncements in 1947.  He comes to this House and tells us about all he has done in the past two and a half years.  But he has not increased the benefits of these people who are drawing sickness benefit or unemployment benefit up to the standard of £7 1s. per week, where the bread winner is sick or unemployed.  In fact, he proposes in his White Paper, in the case of an agricultural labourer who <Col N="1629" /> may fall ill or become unemployed, if he has a wife and three children, to bring him up to 39/- a week&mdash;not 141/- per week.  Therefore, I think that when the Minister comes to this House and reads out long lists of figures of what has been done in the past three or four years, it is only right that we should remember the ideas expressed by the Minister and his colleagues in 1947 and compare those ideas with the ideas which they hold now.</P>
    <P>The memorandum continues, in its review of the situation, to talk about conditions in Cork City.  They quote a gentleman&mdash;I do not want to give his name, because he might not be too thankful to me if I should do so&mdash;in inverted commas as having said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Judged by this table, only 12 persons (out of 684) spend sufficient on food per man as recognised by the British Medical Association diet; of these 12 persons, five are adults and seven are children.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In 1947 we were told that, taking a sample of the population in Cork City, only 12 out of 684 were getting enough to eat.  What has the Minister and his Government done since 1947 to make that 12 any larger than it was out of 684?  They go on, in their memorandum, which was issued at the time to the newspapers and for the use of the electors of the 1948 election, to tell the people of this country what a lovely country we would have here when the Labour Party would come into office. They go on to tell the people, in 1947, what the conditions would be.  I quote further from the Labour Memorandum on Social Security, issued on the 25th August, 1947:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;So that we may have social security in the sense that every member of the community will be assured of an adequate living standard, we must have full employment and a basic family income.  That is to say, there must be jobs for all who are able and willing to work; there must be a basic minimum wage sufficient for the minimum needs of an average household.  Let there be no mistake, unless and until these conditions are fulfilled, want will flourish in the homes of the poor; public relief or unemployment <Col N="1630" /> assistance will not banish it; charity may assuage but not remedy it.  In any event, there is high authority for the affirmation that &lsquo;charity can never take the place of justice unfairly withheld&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Justice unfairly withheld&rdquo;!  Evidently the Labour Party has an idea that justice can be fairly withheld or unfairly withheld.  I do not know how they can think that.  Perhaps the Minister will explain, when he is replying, how justice can be fairly withheld.  They refer here to the fact that justice is unfairly withheld.  They say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Once we recognise that full employment is economically desirable, it will be found to be financially possible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Might I assume that the Minister, since he became a member of this Government, still holds the view that full employment is economically desirable? In this memorandum which was issued to the electors in 1947 to induce them to vote for the Labour Party, they were told if they did so, what a lovely country they would have.  Does the Minister still believe that full employment is economically desirable, because he says that if it is economically desirable then it will be found financially possible?  What has prevented it coming into being?</P>
    <P>The Minister holds a very important position in the Government.  The Labour Party hold the balance of power so far as this House is concerned and everybody knows that if the Labour Party demand firmly that a certain thing be done, it will be done, if it is possible to do it.  They say here in their memorandum that it is possible, that if it is economically desirable, it is financially possible.</P>

      <P>It is hardly worth while getting vexed over.  But why did the Labour Party do it and deceive the electors and why did they then go back on it?  They say that &ldquo;Action must be taken.&rdquo;  This manifesto was issued to the electors in 1947 when they were considering for whom they might vote. We may assume that it was issued so that the electors would vote for the Labour Party.  The Labour Party then said &ldquo;Action must be taken&rdquo;; in other words, action was not taken by the then Government.  The manifesto declared &ldquo;Action must be taken to increase real incomes either by a rise in wages or by a reduction in prices, as may appear economically desirable.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I draw attention to the fact that there are still unemployed&mdash;that has been referred to in <Col N="1632" /> the Minister's statement&mdash;and there should not be if the Minister had carried out his promises?  This is what I read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As has been pointed out frequently, full employment will not necessarily mean no unemployment at any time in any place.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>They want in this memorandum to be perfectly fair&mdash;I will say that for the Labour Party.  Possibly they were honest when they drew up this document, and they saw that there might be unemployment under certain conditions. For instance:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the conditions which existed last spring when, over wide areas, villages were snowbound and roads were impassable, when there was dislocation of industry and transport, some unemployment was unavoidable.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>So we were warned that if there was a big fall of snow there might be people unemployed.</P>
      <P>Are we to take it from the Minister's speech, where it is indicated that the unemployed are still there in thousands, that we were snowbound for the past two years?  It is the only excuse given by the Labour Party in 1947, that there should be no unemployment unless there was a big fall of snow.  That is mentioned of page 10 of the manifesto, and Deputy Davin may look it up if he wishes in order to see if there is any other excuse beyond a big fall of snow.  We had one fall of snow, but there was none since this Government came in, so that excuse does not hold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party do not like to make enemies, but they do make enemies in spite of themselves.  They do not like to make enemies if they can avoid it.  Evidently, when the memorandum was drafted, the Minister's astute mind was brought to bear and he said to the person drafting it: &ldquo;Now, be careful.  If you talk too much about this full employment they might get it into their heads that they will be drafted from one place to another,&rdquo; so there was a paragraph put in which said: &ldquo;The objection has been raised in one quarter at least that a <Col N="1633" /> policy of full employment must involve the direction of labour; that is, that the natural right of a man to choose his job will be interfered with or curtailed when the State assumes responsibility of finding work for the unemployed.  Of course, there is no basis for this objection.  Insistence has been placed on personal freedom.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So there was personal freedom guaranteed to the electors in 1948&mdash;full employment unless there is a big fall of snow, full employment during the fine weather.  The electors were told there would be full employment and at the same time they were warned: &ldquo;Do not get it into your heads that labour will be drafted.  Employment will be found for you, not that you will be sent to that employment.&rdquo;  It was a lovely programme, but I am told&mdash;I do not know whether this is true, and maybe the Minister will give us an answer&mdash;that one of the reasons why the number drawing unemployment benefit is down is that the single men are asked will they take a job like the turf job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I will go down to the benefits proposed.  I suppose that will be relevant.  There is a great disparity, we are told, between the rates of benefit provided for unemployed persons as between one country and another and they have all one <Col N="1634" /> common feature except Éire, which was then under the Fianna Fáil Government, not the same as now.  They had all one disparity except in Éire when the Labour Party were trying to seduce the electors to vote for them. They all had one common feature and that was that they aimed at maintaining a basic standard of health and vigour.  We were not doing that until Labour came in.  Every country in the world was doing it except Éire and this Labour Party made an appeal to the electors to return them and so make this country like every other country where there was a basic standard of health and vigour.  How ought we to measure vigour, I wonder?  Can the Minister give us any indication of the percentage of vigour now compared with 1947?</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In Great Britain, where the cost of food is 30 per cent. less than in this country, the basic payment for an unemployed man without dependents is 26/- per week.  New Zealand allows the single man 20/- a week, but it must be observed that in New Zealand food is costing about half...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>So naturally that was not enough.  The 26/- in Britain was inadequate for this country.  The memorandum continued:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Labour Party considers that the basic payment at present prices for an adult unemployed man should be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What do Deputies think?  Does the Labour Party remember now what they were saying around the country?  Do they remember that in 1947, when preparing for the election, they said it should be 30/- a week, with an addition of 15/- for the man's wife if she is not gainfully employed?  If she was, she would get more.  That is plus 7/6 for each of the first two children, provided that in the case of unemployment it does not exceed 80 per cent. of the wage and in the case of sickness it does not exceed 100 per cent. of the wage.  It was a very nice scheme for an election and the Labour Party got all the votes they could and then they came back here and changed their minds.  After sitting on this job for a couple of <Col N="1635" /> years, the Minister has issued a White Paper.  Instead of 30/, he proposes 24/-.  Although the cost of living is higher here than in Britain, he is giving less.  He wanted to do better than England because the cost of living is higher, but he is doing worse. Instead of the wife getting 15/-, he gives 12/-.  He does not do much cutting in the case of children, to give him his due, and he only cuts it by a token, from 7/6 to 7/-.</P>
    <P>There was a good deal of talk about the lowly paid man in this memorandum. The Ceann Comhairle did not allow me to deal with it as, not being a novice, Deputy Keane appealed to him to stop me.  The lowly paid man is to get less.  If he is unemployed, he will get 18/- and if he has a wife, 9/- extra.  Imagine the Labour Party here in 1947, and when they were talking at the crossroads in 1948, if anyone had said to them that the wife of a labouring man could live on 9/- a week. What would they say?  There has been an extraordinary change in their opinions.  They are content now to go from 30/- down to 18/- for the lowly paid labouring man; from 15/- down to 9/- for his wife; and to reduce the first two children from 7/6 to 5/-.  Their authority in Cork City said that a family of five could not live on less than £7 1s. 0d. per week.  This was told to the electors in 1948 and led some people to think they would be well off if they voted for the Labour Party.  Now the poor fellow finds that if he gets sick and has a wife and three children, he will get 39/-, not £7 1s. 0d. That is the measure of the Labour Party's promises and the amount they have achieved in two and a half years &mdash;or, rather, are going to achieve, as they have not done it yet.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when he was Leader of the Labour Party, and I was sitting over there, was a most impressive speaker and often made me very uncomfortable in his advocacy of benefits. One would imagine, to listen to the Leader of the Labour Party then, that if he got into control, the labouring man would get a fair deal.  After two and a half years, as far as sickness and unemployment is concerned, he is <Col N="1636" /> getting the same as in 1947, except that he has to pay a higher contribution. The only change the present Minister has made is to take a higher contribution, giving nothing but promises in return.  Yet those amongst the Labour Party sitting there think he has done a lot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy Davin wants to silence me.  I know he does not like to hear this.  He thinks this memorandum should not be discussed. In fact, he thinks it should be burned and forgotten and never referred to again.  It goes on to say that benefits should be given for all sorts of people, including marriage allowances.  However, the Minister is dropping that. When I was in the Department of Social Welfare, I was anxious to have that included as a good social benefit. The Minister, I suppose, found it hard to scrooge everything into the financial part of his business, and had to drop that.  Perhaps he will tell us why?</P>
      <P>According to the Labour Party in 1947, they were to give these high benefits in regard to sickness and unemployment, and for fear there might be some member of the community they were leaving out, and therefore neglecting a possible vote, they said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Everyone cannot be a contributor, and therefore we must have non-contributory benefits.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1637" /> The first thing they took up was children's allowances.  They said that for every child after the first two there should be 7/6 paid.  The Minister is two and a half years there, and it is still 2/6.  There has been no great change.  That also has been forgotten. We are told that as far as retiring allowances are concerned&mdash;we used to call them old age pensions&mdash;under the contributory part of the scheme the old person will get 25/- a week at age 65. If he does not want to retire at 65 and goes on working, for every year he works there will be addition of 2/- with a maximum of 10/-; therefore he will get 35/- a week instead of the 24/- that is given now.  If he has a wife she will also get the pension.  It is given here as 20/- a week.  Of course in the scheme it is 12/- and not 20/-. Non-contributory old age pensions will be paid at 65 and not at 70; the pension will be £1 per week and not 17/6.</P>
    <P>Naturally a scheme like this had to be paid for and the Labour Party had to face up to that fact.  They say that it will cost about £37,000,000.  I do not know whether or not that is a fair calculation.  On the whole, I think the Labour Party did not make it too high because they might have some difficulty in meeting it.  Therefore, they kept it as low as they could.  In discussing how this £37,000,000 can be met they say that within the next 12 months health and social welfare costs will be brought to £20,000,000.  That is £20,000,000 off the £37,000,000, which leaves £17,000,000.  Then they say that &mdash;&ldquo;In a condition of full employment wealth will be created rapidly, the national income will expand and the burden of taxation become relatively lighter,&rdquo; and a man with an income of £3 per week&mdash;just listen to this&mdash;&ldquo;may consider tobacco expensive at 1/7 per oz. but should his income go up to £5 per week he will probably be willing to pay more than 1/7&rdquo; per oz. for his tobacco.  I thought that it was a fixed principle of the Labour Party not to increase taxation on tobacco.  Evidently they considered the matter at the end of 1947 and there did not seem to be anything very, very wrong in doing that.  This document goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If we are in a position within a <Col N="1638" /> year or two to provide more jobs than there are idle men; if we can fill up the unused time of the small farmers and the agriculture worker by giving him work in a State forest; if we prevent illness to the extent of 50 per cent. by eliminating unemployment and poverty; if we raise the level of wages for the lower paid sections of wage-earners our national income will show a speedy response.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They go on to say that in the year following the national income will go up to £275,000,000:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To raise this amount it will be necessary to increase income-tax or surtax&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should say there is a margin of £2,000,000 left.</P>

      <P>It is an alternative scheme of social welfare.  Having raised the health of the people by 50 per cent. by waving a magic wand and putting everyone into employment and raising the national income to £275,000,000 and increased taxation by £9,000,000 there was still £2,000,000 short and they had to account for that somewhere.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To raise this amount it will be necessary to increase income-tax or surtax, or both, on very wealthy people.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now the Minister and his Party at the end of 1947 had the idea that contributions could remain as they were and, if they wanted more money, they would demand more income-tax from the very wealthy.  What has the Minister done since he took office?  He has increased the contributions and brought down income-tax.  Was there ever such a <Col N="1639" /> surrender of principle on the part of a Minister?  Before coming in, it was to be done by increasing income-tax. As soon as he came in it was done by raising the contributions of the workers and taking 6d. off income-tax. That is the result of this Coalition Government.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;We believe the Irish people will endorse this scheme once its present advantages and ultimate aim are sufficiently understood.  There can be no question of our not being able to afford it; its financial aspect may be summed up simply in the words of a well-known economist&rdquo;&mdash;they do not give his name&mdash;&ldquo;Whatever is desirable and physically possible, is financially possible.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Are we to assume that what the Labour Party issued in 1947 is no longer considered desirable by the Minister for Social Welfare?  We were told then that whatever is desirable and physically possible is financially possible.  If it is still desirable, it should be possible for the Minister to implement the scheme.  But he does not now intend to do that.  We can only conclude, therefore, that he has surrendered his principles in that respect and that that surrender was due to the exigencies of his position in the Coalition Government.</P>
      <P>I will give the House the final paragraph. I am sure the members of the Labour Party are glad I have reached the final paragraph.  They may as well have it, because it is very, very good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;These proposals are not utopian; they are not meant to be.  The benefits proposed represent the minimum <Col N="1640" /> sums which will carry a normal family over a temporary crisis; as prosperity gathers momentum, they must be increased&mdash;and increased substantially.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suppose the Labour Party would boast that they were sincere in whatever they said to the electors.  In their sincerity, they said to the electors at the end of 1947 that that was the minimum standard.  The benefits they proposed there were the minimum benefits.  Now the Minister comes along and proposes less than the minimum standard then laid down. Is it not a fact that the Minister is either proposing less than the minimum standard or the Labour Party were not sincere in 1947?  Let the Minister tell us which it is.  It must be either one thing or the other.  When we have heard the Minister's explanation we can make up our minds about the merits or demerits of this memorandum issued in 1947.</P>

      <P>This memorandum was issued at the end of 1947.  The Rules of Order do not permit of my quoting certain parts of it, but we have here in this document frequent references to poverty and semi-starvation.  What has the Minister done to remedy that? He has done nothing.  He has allowed those who are drawing sickness benefit and unemployment benefit for a whole two and one-half years to go on &ldquo;in poverty and semi-starvation&rdquo;.  Now, is that the act of a conscientious or humane man or was the issue of the memorandum in 1947 the act of a <Col N="1641" /> propagandist?  Was the Minister a propagandist in 1947 or is he an honest, conscientious man now?  That is the question that is to be asked.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, there is no doubt that if the sick and unemployed could exist on promises, they would be much better off since the Minister took over, because the Minister and his Party in this House, and the members of the Party who are not in this House, have certainly made plenty of promises about what they were going to do, but none of the promises has been carried out.  If increased contributions could be shown to be better than increased benefits, then the Minister has done well for the working man.  But that is all that he has done since he came into office&mdash;to increase contributions and not to increase benefits.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to a Bill which he introduced a few days ago.  We &lsquo;cannot discuss it now.  I can only say this, that since it took two and a half years to introduce the Bill, that would appear to me to be an extraordinarily long time for a Minister who actually said&mdash;as his lieutenants said in the 1948 election&mdash;that they had the social plan ready which is in this memorandum. There can be no doubt about this, that if the Minister had said to his officials on the first day he took over the Department: &ldquo;Draw me up a Bill on the lines of that memorandum,&rdquo; the Bill could have been ready two years ago, and not now two and a half years after.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very good.  It is as near to the truth as Deputy O'Leary usually gets.  As I say, it has taken the Minister two and a half years to introduce the Bill.  He told us a few days ago that it would be a few months before it would be circulated.  Well, if the Minister's view about a few months has the same meaning as it had in the last few years, it will be a long time before the Bill is circulated. <Col N="1642" /> Let us, however, take his word for it that it will be circulated in a few months; it will then take some months to go through the Oireachtas, and after that it will be a long time before it is implemented.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister will succeed in going through his term of office, even if the Dáil runs its full course, before this Bill is implemented.  The only question mark we have is this: will it be implemented, and will the Minister get his way, or will Clann na Talmhan get their way?  Clann na Talmhan have said that the Bill will not pass so far as they are concerned.  We will have to wait and see about that.  It will not be the Minister's fault if they vote against him.  The only fault, as far as the Minister is concerned, is that he has been far too long about bringing the Bill in.  If the Minister had been serious, if he had been very anxious about these new benefits, this Bill could have appeared long ago in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me, at any rate, to be a good thing that the Deputy who has just sat down has been exercising his intellect about Labour literature.  It is a pity he did not take a similar opportunity a great many years ago.  Anybody would think, listening to Deputy Dr. Ryan, that his concern for the interests of the people affected by this Estimate&mdash;the working people concerned&mdash;transcended the interest of the present Minister or of any other Deputy.  Deputy Dr. Ryan would have us believe that the Party now in opposition are vitally concerned about the interests of persons in receipt of unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance and old age pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wonder to me is that Deputy Dr. Ryan, and the members of the Fianna Fáil Party, do not blush with shame when they talk about old age pensions.  What is their record in regard to them?  Let them examine it themselves.  They were 17 years in office and they gave the old age pensioners an increase of 2/6 over that period with a means test, whereby the widow in a cottage, the man who had spent his years in employment on the land or in any other capacity&mdash;even if <Col N="1643" /> he happened to have a few pounds in the bank or a pig in his back yard, or if the widow happened to have a few hens running around the place&mdash;had the miserly 12/6 reduced by the Fianna Fáil Administration.  In contrast to that, the first step that was taken by a Labour Minister for Social Welfare was to increase old age pensions by 5/-.  That was an interim measure. It represented a contribution of £2,500,000 from the Exchequer for the welfare of old age pensioners.  Now we have had this performance this evening.  We were told by one ex-Minister of Fianna Fáil that he was a performer.  We had another performer to-night telling us about his concern for the people who are affected by social welfare measures.</P>
    <P>I want to take the opportunity that is presented to us here to-night of complimenting the Tánaiste, first of all, on the prodigious amount of work performed by his Department over the past year.  Those of us who have contact with the Department in relation to the multifarious matters it deals with, have had the experience of prompt and efficient service.  I am sure Deputies on all sides of the House have had that experience.  I feel that the officials of the Department of Social Welfare have worked exceedingly hard in their aim to bring to the people, within the shortest possible time, the maximum and the greatest services in this sphere that can be achieved.  I also want to say that I personally&mdash;I am sure the same applies to the more progressive Deputies&mdash;am very happy to observe the introduction of the social security scheme in the form of a Bill.  When the House reassembles after the holidays, we will be looking forward to the speedy passage of that Bill through the House.  The only possible barrier to its speedy passage is the gentlemen sitting on the Opposition Benches who see in it the seeds of their own political end.</P>
    <P>We had an exhibition, on another occasion previously, when the Opposition obstructed a progressive measure of a similar type by every means in their power.  I refer to the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  They delayed <Col N="1644" /> the putting into effect of that measure for a number of months.  I hope that we will not see a similar exhibition when we come to deal with the consideration of the Social Security Bill, because anybody who has read the White Paper, as issued by the Minister on social security, recognises that it does represent the greatest move forward in the sphere of social security which this country has yet seen, that it is in line with similar measures which have been adopted in other parts of the world such as New Zealand, Australia and other countries where Labour rules or has ruled.</P>

      <P>We, of the Labour Party particularly, are very glad that we are in a position to anticipate this measure and to have it written into the Statute Book at an early date.  Deputy Dr. Ryan also referred&mdash;had the temerity, I might say, to refer&mdash;to the lower paid workers.  The lowest paid workers in this country&mdash;and you will find a lot of them in the constituency which Deputy Dr. Ryan represents&mdash;are the agricultural workers.  During the era of Fianna Fáil&mdash;17 inglorious years&mdash;the peak average wage was 50/-.  What steps were taken by Deputy Dr. Ryan, who was Minister, who had the reins in his hands and who could formulate what plans he liked, to improve the lot of the lower paid workers?  Ask any farm labourer in any part of the country how much unemployment benefit he gets when he is unemployed and the answer is: exactly nil, not one halfpenny.  This scheme about to be introduced for the first time gives the agricultural worker the right to some form of subsistence when he is unemployed. I am aware of the fact that the scheme is hailed with pleasure by farm labourers throughout the country for that one reason alone.  I feel sure that this Government, having accepted the Bill and all that it entails, will seek to put it into operation immediately. I am confident that they will not fall back on the old Fianna Fáil trick of waiting until the eve of a general election before anything of that kind is done, that they will not yield to <Col N="1645" /> the temptation, as happened before, of waiting until we go out to look for votes to see that children's allowances are paid.  This legislation, which will be placed on the Statute Book of this country, is one of the best measures taken by this Government, no matter when we are going to have the next general election.</P>

I am not going to suggest that he obtained that document by any dubious means although it seems to be a custom of the Opposition when documents of this sort are produced to suggest that they must have been obtained by some underhand method.  Some Fianna Fáil Deputies are experts at that.  Some of the Deputies over there are more expert <Col N="1646" /> than others in research work of a less reputable kind than was mentioned by Deputy Dr. Ryan.</P>

      <P>He will not be allowed to forget it.  We have the speech here. We have a list also of the division which took place following a motion moved by the then Deputy Norton in regard to the means test when the Fianna Fáil Party to a man trooped into the Lobbies to deny old age pensioners a few shillings a week more. These are the people who have the temerity now to come into the House and talk about what this Government has or has not done.  On the single item or issue of the old age pensioners alone the Government has done more in the last two and a half years for the old age pensioners than Fianna Fáil did in 17 years.  That fact was established, and it cannot be controverted by interruption, wisecrack or anything else.  It is an undeniable fact. I am very happy that Deputy Dr. Ryan did that little bit of research work, because, as I have said, it is always an encouraging thing for those of us who are in the Labour movement to see any person openning his mind sufficiently to let in upon it some of the shafts of truth that are to be found only in Labour literature.  That document we stand for as a statement of policy of this Party and when a Labour Government is established in this country it will be implemented to the full.</P>

      <P>Let there be no mistake about that.  Let us go back a bit and read some of the interesting things said by Deputy Dr. Ryan on the occasion of the debate on the motion to which I referred&mdash;the motion in the name of Deputy Norton regarding old age pensioners and the modification of the means test, on 22nd October, 1947. As reported in column 823, Volume 108, Deputy Dr. Ryan said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;As regards old age pensioners, I want to give rather interesting figures.  In 1932 there were 77,900 <Col N="1647" /> old age pensioners getting the full 10/- per week.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Ten shillings in 1932 and 12/6 in 1947, as I told the House a few moments ago.</P>

One could go on quoting from this very interesting debate, but to me at any rate the most interesting part of it is the names on the Division List of the Deputies who voted against the motion to reduce the means test.  One of them, another very good interrupter who is not here now, Deputy McGrath, also spoke.  I think in fact I will read it all.</P>

      <P>I do not see the relevancy.  I allowed Deputy Dunne to refer to what Deputy Dr. Ryan said, because Deputy Dr. Ryan was Minister in the Fianna Fáil Administration.  That is the only relevancy I can see in his remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Killilea figures prominently in it; Deputy Moran's name is not absent from it.  Of course the other two Deputies with them, being like myself in the House for the first time, escaped.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that Deputies who address themselves to this most important question of social security should try to do so in a constructive fashion.  As a country, we are in a more or less enviable position from the point of view of population and resources. We, of the Labour Party, have always contended and firmly believe, as a principle of our existence as a Party, that full employment is possible of attainment in this country, but that there will always be more helpless sections of the community in need of assistance in the shape of social security and that it is in order to provide for such people that, in the ultimate analysis, social security is essential.</P>
      <P>The scheme which is being introduced takes, as I have mentioned, some very important steps in relation to this matter.  To my mind, one of the greatest disabilities under which the working people labour at the present day is the absence of provision for the circumstances which surround a death in a family.  I am not going to transgress the rules of order by anticipating legislation, but I do think that any scheme which would embrace provisions for such a contingency as a bereavement in a working-class family is a good scheme and something which has not been thought of before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to take up any more of the time of the House because of the restriction on the debate imposed by the time factor.  I want to conclude by saying that Deputy Dr. Ryan and every Deputy of the Opposition Party will need to talk for an awful long time inside and outside this House before <Col N="1649" /> they are shriven for their neglect of the people who are catered for by the Department of Social Welfare particularly the old age pensioners.  No matter what documents may be read here, no matter what may be said here, no matter how long and how strenuously an attempt may be made by some members of the Opposition, including Deputy Dr. Ryan, to justify their neglect and laziness in this matter in the past, one thing that stands out and can be verified in any part of the country is that the people of this land to-day know that they have a Minister for Social Welfare who is vitally interested in their welfare and who has vowed to bring in a measure that will benefit them enormously.  They are giving thanks every day that they live that Deputy Dr. Ryan and those like him who had charge of their destinies are no longer in that position but that energy is being applied to their problems at the present time by this Government and particularly by the Tánaiste.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested to hear Deputy Dunne speaking about Fianna Fáil having talked for a long time about social security schemes.  It is very interesting coming from Deputy Dunne's benches because the Labour Party from whom, we are given to understand, all these security schemes emanate have been talking and talking and doing nothing else but talking and we are still waiting for the Minister's Bill to provide this much advertised social security scheme.  There was never more talk in the country about any scheme; there was never more flag-waving; there was never such a stalking horse presented to the Irish people during the election and in this House since the election; but after all these years we are still waiting to see this scheme translated into a workable proposition before Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the one hand, the Minister said that he wants to give these people benefits, but some of his colleagues are chary about giving them.  There are some of his colleagues who, according to Press reports, take a poor view of the Minister's scheme.  The matter has been discussed; there have been rumours about this scheme; again, in <Col N="1650" /> the words of the last Deputy, there has been a tremendous amount of talk, but there has been no action so far on the part of the Minister or on the part of the Labour Party.  Perhaps now that the Labour Parties in this House have buried the hatchet, or say they have buried the hatchet, we might get some unanimity of view on this question. If the Labour Parties have buried the hatchet, it will be a good thing for the time and the procedure of this House and for the country in general.  It would not appear, however, that this burying of the hatchet has gone very deep.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good, but when a Deputy of the Labour Party&mdash;I do not know whether Deputy Dunne belongs to the red or the blue section of the Labour Party &mdash; starts to compare the position of old age pensioners to-day with their position in 1932, whether he comes from the red or the blue side, he should examine his conscience, be cause, let him come from the reds or the blues, he, by his vote, is keeping in this Government a Minister who reduced old age pensions by 1/- per week, from 10/- to 9/-, before Fianna Fáil came into power.  Deputy Dunne, by his vote in this House for the past two and a half years, has kept in power a Minister for Finance who deliberately cut the old age pension from 10/- to 9/- prior to 1932.  Deputy Dunne and the different sections of the Labour Party have kept in power Ministers who say that the value of the £ compared with 1939 is 10/- In <Col N="1651" /> other words, the £ sterling, at the time the miserable increase was given, represented 10/- compared with 1939.</P>
      <P>How can this man now argue that that increase was sufficient, that it was justified or that the purchasing power of that pension is at all compatible with the purchasing power of the pension which the old age pensioner was getting back in 1939 or, going still further back, in 1932?  These people should remember the words of wisdom uttered by the Minister for Finance, the Fine Gael Minister whom Labour Deputies have kept in power by their votes, when he said &mdash; and this is on the records of the House&mdash;that the £ had gone down in value to 10/-.  I think it is now recognised that it has gone down a little further.  What these Deputies should now be contemplating is an urging of the Minister to give the old age pensioners not alone what they have got but sufficient to bring the purchasing value of their pension up to the value of the pensions they were getting under the Fianna Fáil regime up to 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who try to put over on the House the idea that there has been an abolition of the means test in connection with old age pensions are simply out of touch with the country. The very same inspectors examine the very same hens, the very same pigs, the very same cows and the very same valuations, and take the whole lot into consideration, and, on the basis of the comparative values of money as between 1939 and the present day, the means test at present is more serve and more strict than ever it was in the history of this country.  Any Deputy who, in the ordinary course of his business, has to deal with old age pensioners who are seeking pensions knows that, where an old man has not transferred his farm of £5 valuation to his son, every stone, every brick, every shed, every cow and every hen is counted in the very same way as it has always been counted in arriving at means.  It will therefore not deceive anybody when Deputy Dunne tries to suggest that the means test has been abolished.  The means test is being operated as effectively through <Col N="1652" /> the Department of Finance as ever it was operated in the history of this State.  I do not say that there may not be some justification for the means test.  The Minister for Finance may believe that, so far as old age pensions are concerned, it is necessary to have some type of means test, but anybody who tries to put over on the House that there is no means test, or that it is not being operated in the same way as it has always been operated, is trying to delude himself and the people.</P>
    <P>There is another matter with which I want to deal, a matter which arises mainly in counties from which there is migration to other countries.  The Minister, I understand, signed some convention with the British Government in connection with people who may become ill, who may have an accident, or who may be hurt working on the other side.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Not accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says &ldquo;not accidents,&rdquo; but, whatever the reason, I want to tell the House&mdash;this is a most important question from the point of view of counties from which there is migration&mdash;that people who would normally have qualified under the Workmen's Compensation Act in Britain, prior to the new social security scheme in that country, after six months' benefit, are sent back here and thrown on the tender mercies of the National Health Insurance Society. They lose all the rights they would have had if the workmen's compensation code were still in existence in Britain.  They have to come back here &mdash;let them be permanently incapacitated or partially incapacitated, or let them be injured for life &mdash; and they have no remedy against anybody.  If these men were injured in this country, if they lost a leg or an arm in this country, they would, in the initial stages, be entitled to draw 50/- per week as workman's compensation and, under the Third Schedule of the Act, if the employers wanted to buy them off, they would have to pay a very substantial sum, a sum equivalent to the cost of buying an annuity of 75 per cent. of the amount of compensation <Col N="1653" /> they are getting.  A man of 30 years of age would be entitled&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, the Deputy is discussing the Workmen's Compensation Act.  I have no responsibility for the administration of that Act, as you know, Sir.  If anybody has a claim to make under that Act, he brings it to the courts and the courts decide the question involved.  The Minister for Social Welfare has no power whatever in that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Minister does not administer the Workmen's Compensation Act.  The only reason I allowed the Deputy to proceed was that he said that people involved in accidents in England were thrown back here on national health insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put it further. I say that the plight of these unfortunate people, migratory workers, who meet with accidents in England, who have to come back here and are thrown on the benefits provided by the National Health Insurance Society, is due to an agreement signed between the Minister and the British Government or some British Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.D. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret very much having to delay the house to-night to discuss this matter, particularly when I know that these long sittings are a great strain on the staff.  I think the House will excuse me when I say what I have to say.  I will try to be as brief as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked the Minister for Lands to-day whether he or the Land Commission or his engineers had decided that the Minane Bridge reclamation scheme was <Col N="1654" /> a desirable and/or feasible project.  The answer I got to that question was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A decision has not yet been taken in this case.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I regarded that as a very unsatisfactory answer.  I do not think that the Minister made any attempt really to answer the question that was tabled.</P>
    <P>The Minister has expressed himself on a number of occasions in this House on this matter.  I think he could have given an answer different from the answer he did give.  When I pointed out to-day that the Minister had not answered the question, he repeated that no decision had been taken, while my question was whether the Minister, the Land Commission or his engineers had decided, first of all, if it was desirable and, secondly, if it was feasible.</P>
    <P>This is a matter that I have brought before the House on a number of occasions.  As early as 14th April, 1948, that is nearly two and a half years ago, I put a question to the Minister, which he will find in column 625, Volume 110 of the Dáil Debates, in regard to this matter.  The answer I got from the Minister at that time, two and a half years ago, was that the Land Commission had the scheme under active consideration but no decision had been taken yet.  The answer I got to-day, on 12th July, 1950, is that no decision has yet been reached in this case.  On 25th May, 1948, the Minister, in column 1996, said that there were engineering difficulties and that a technical examination of these difficulties was proceeding.  On 2nd June, 1949, the Minister said, in column 2495, Volume 115:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The difficulties have not yet been finally settled but the matter is being expedited.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On November 9th, 1949, the Minister said that an adequate solution had not yet been approved.</P>
    <P>On 30th November, the Minister told us that the engineering personnel concerned in this scheme included a master of engineering and six other graduates from two universites:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To estimate the amount of time spent would cause the Department, <Col N="1655" /> that was overworked, too much trouble.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He said also that there was necessary delay to ensure that the scheme will not be a failure on completion.  The Minister to-day could not tell me whether he considered the scheme either desirable or feasible but, on 30th November, 1949, he was ensuring that on completion the scheme would not be a failure.</P>
    <P>On 30th November, 1949, Deputy Desmond asked the Minister for Agriculture if he would take over this scheme which the Land Commission apparently could not carry out.  The Parliamentary Secretary, Mr. Cosgrave, replying for the Minister for Agriculture, said that he was waiting for the Land Commission to make up their minds.</P>
    <P>On 22nd February, 1950, the Minister, who could not tell me to-day whether he thought the scheme desirable or feasible, said&mdash;column 152, Volume 119:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am anxious to see the work put in hands, as I wish to ensure that no further damage will be caused to the land and buildings in this area.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On 29th March, 1950, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Since my reply of 22nd of last month...a further inspection has been made.  It is now expected that a decision will be reached shortly.</P>
    <P>Mr. S. Collins: When is it expected that the work will commence?</P>
    <P>Mr. Blowick: The decision will be taken inside a couple of weeks....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was last March.  As far as I am concerned, I do not mind the Minister or the Land Commission or any Department of State misleading me, but I take very serious objection to anybody misleading my constituents. This particular scheme affects a very considerable number of acres of land in my constituency.  A village, a bridge and a parish church are affected.  The Minister is aware of all these facts.  The Minister went down and saw the place himself and, in my <Col N="1656" /> presence and in the presence of the officials of his Department, told the people in the area that be considered it a feasible and a desirable scheme and one that should be tackled, and he guaranteed that it would be put under way as soon as possible.  To-day we find that no decision has been reached.  Engineers of the Minister's Department were also present when the Minister stated in the locality that it was a desirable, feasible, necessary, urgent work and work that would be proceeded with.</P>
    <P>I want to know where I stand.  I have conveyed to the people in the area the replies I received to the questions I put to the Minister.  I feel guilty.  I feel that I have in some way helped to mislead the people in that particular area.  I want the Minister to tell us whether he is prepared to go ahead with the scheme or to point out the difficulties that are holding it up.</P>
    <P>This is a scheme that has been before the Department for a considerable number of years.  There were embankments on this estuary, and these have all been worn away and washed out by the tide.  A number of years ago, the county council, because they saw their roads and bridges were in danger, offered the Department of Lands a grant if they would proceed with the work.  The Bishop of Cork, because he saw the parish church was in danger, also offered to contribute. All the landowners in the area signed a petition and promised to pay their share if the scheme was proceeded with.  The case has been with the Department for a number of years and absolutely nothing has been done.  I want the Minister to tell us whether his six engineers and the master of engineering are quite inefficient and useless or whether it is some official of his Department who is blocking the work.  He should take us into his confidence.  He should take the House and the people of my constituency into his confidence and not continue to hamstring them and make fools of them and of me.  This is an important and urgent work.  Every day the water is allowed to continue to flow in and do further damage to the embankments <Col N="1657" /> in this area means an increase in the cost of the scheme.  If the Minister waits long enough he will have a scheme for which it will be impossible to provide the money necessary to repair the damage done.  If the scheme had been tackled two years ago, it would have cost considerably less than what it will cost now.  If the scheme had been started four or five years ago &mdash; when it was also being considered by the Land Commission &mdash; the cost would have been considerably less than what it will cost now.  We have a right to be told by the Minister whether he has any responsibility or whether he can put all the blame in this connection on the Land Commission.  If that is the situation, he should let the House and the people know rather than let them believe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I also had a question on to-day's Order Paper in connection with this matter.  The Minister may ask why I have raised this question so often.  Like Deputy Lehane, I have been interested in the matter for the past few years though, perhaps, I may have approached it from a different angle.  I brought it to the attention of the Department on a number of occasions. I should like the Minister to understand that I am living about three miles from the area in question. I have in my possession a letter written in 1936 by a former Parliamentary Secretary of State, Deputy Moylan, to our late Minister for Local Government when he was Deputy Murphy.  In that letter, Deputy Moylan admitted the necessity, yes, and the urgent vital necessity of going on with this work. There is no use in thinking that the present Minister alone deserves to be attacked in connection with this matter.  I admit that the present Minister is only a couple of years in the job but that, at the same time, cannot in itself excuse him fully.  The Minister is here only a couple of years but the other fellow has gone&mdash;to Tír na nÓg maybe.  However, the same staff is there and they, apparently through the Minister, are preparing the scheme. I fail to understand, if this was an urgent necessity in 1936 and if the staff were engaged on the work of preparing plans in 1936 why nothing further has been done since.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I may not be expressing myself correctly.  My point is that the staff in 1936 were not directed to go on with the work.  There are hundreds of acres of land wasting in the area in question.  It is not satisfactory to come here time after time with an excuse.  A man by the name of Mr. James Noonan, Minane Bridge, County Cork, can prove that when they were trying to get foundations for this work they could never succeed and yet they stayed there.  I would ask the Minister to realise the urgency of this matter and not to follow the course set by Deputy Moylan in 1936 of putting it in a cubby hole in his office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said previously, I can quite understand Deputy Lehane, Deputy Desmond and the Deputies who represent that constituency being interested in this particular job.  Let me say that I went to the trouble of going on the site myself and seeing exactly what the problem was and the damage being done.  It seems that the sides of the river were protected by embankments for quite a long time.  These embankments were quite sufficient to contain the back rush of the tide up to the time a sand bar at the mouth of the river shifted its position, thereby allowing a greater inflow of tidal water each time the tide rose.  The shifting of the sand bar permitted the inflow of a greater volume of water than previously and the embankments were absolutely inadequate to contain the tidal waters. I went to see for myself what the situation was.  There is no gainsaying the fact that, while it will be an excellent job, if and when it is undertaken, nevertheless something must be done.  I want to assure Deputy Lehane who seems to think that both myself and the Department are adopting a policy of marking time and doing nothing that that is not so.  I would <Col N="1660" /> point out, however, that the expenditure on that job is going to run into very close on £20,000.  I will not allow that money to be expended until I can be sure that the engineers have a good and a sound scheme to put forward. I am sure no reasonable Deputy will press me to sanction the expenditure of that amount of money on a scheme &mdash; which, I may say, will save only 260 acres &mdash; without being quite sure that the scheme is good and sound.  I could not sanction any scheme without an assurance from the engineers that they have a scheme that will stand up for more than a few months and that will not show damage after the first storm that comes in from the Atlantic.  That is common sense.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that.  However, Deputy Desmond lives near the place in question.  I am sure he knows that the getting of a foundation for an embankment &mdash; the top of which will be six feet&mdash;is not going to be an easy problem because on top there is a layer of fine sand.  Under that there is a layer of fine soil.  I want to be quite sure that when this embankment, with sluices, is erected, it will be a lasting job.  We do not want the first storm to blow it down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>If they went down further they would get a better foundation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>We Deputies or Ministers are not experts, and we must leave these matters to the engineers. An engineer who would, let me say, rush hastily into the doing of a job, without making sure it would be a sound job, would probably be asked to resign if, after a high tide or a storm, the embankment did not stand up to what he thought it would stand up to.  I am more irritated by the delay than the Deputies from Cork, but at the same time I might as well point out that the money will not be sanctioned and will not be expended until we are sure that there is a good job done there.  I do not want to hold <Col N="1661" /> out any hope of this work being undertaken immediately.  It comes as news to me that it was initiated as far back as 1936.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case, then I am only two years and four or five months there, and yet Deputies are trying to rush me.  I explained that borings had to be made.  These were made and we are satisfied now that, after a few further small points&mdash; and only small points&mdash;have been settled, the scheme can go ahead.  We are fully satisfied, and I feel I am fully satisfied, but I am not an engineer and Deputies are not engineers.  It is just as if Deputy Lehane or Deputy Desmond brought a doctor to see some person who is sick.  You do not tell the doctor how to set about curing that person.  If these engineers are fit for their job, we must rely on their advice and wait for it.  If they say it is not safe to proceed with a job until we make sure our foundations are right every inch across from one side of the bay to the other, no Minister would be justified in sanctioning expenditure. It would be like going out on a wild-goose chase, because it might give way the first time a high tide came against it, or a storm.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lehane believes he is partially responsible for misleading the people.  Why does he think that? There is no need for him to think it. All he has done so far is to ask for information as to how the scheme is proceeding, and there is nothing to be responsible for on his part.  I am sure none of his constituents thinks there is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.D. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 29th March I was told that a decision would be taken in a couple of weeks and I gave that information to the people down there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>When I gave that information to the Deputy, I thought the final borings would reveal a solid foundation, and it was then certain fiaws were discovered.  Until we find we can produce a good job we will not <Col N="1662" /> go ahead with it, and that is that.  I have no doubt about the right course to take.  It is better to go out and tell the people that we do not feel quite safe yet about this work and, even though it might mean a temporary setback to some people's hopes, it is better to have that than to put up a slap-dash job that might come down with the first storm.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lehane says that the work is getting more difficult every day that goes by.  That is not the case.  It would be if we contemplated repairing the old embankments, but instead we are contemplating putting a barrier below Minane Bridge in which sluices will be erected and which will keep down the tidal water, and at the same time form a container for the fresh water that comes down.  We must do so in order to provide fresh drinking water for stock and fresh spring water for the houses because, owing to the porous nature of the soil, there is the danger that the fresh water would be contaminated by the salt water.</P>
      <P>Our scheme is, I hold, the most suitable of the two or three proposals put forward, one of which was to fix the embankments.  There is a church and a cemetery there, and they will be in danger in a few years if something is not done.  I know that a bridge is necessary, and I can quite understand the Deputies' anxiety to get the job going.  So would I, if I had a similar problem in my own area &mdash; and I have problems in my own constituency that I would like to get going, but I will not give the word to go ahead until I am quite satisfied that the engineers have found a means of doing a job which will be sound and lasting.  I would not agree to anything temporary that might give way with the very first high tide that might come, or the first storm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied with the engineers.  I should also bring to the notice of the Deputies concerned that, in the strict sense of the word, this is not a Land Commission problem. It is a problem that the Land Commission are handling because their engineers have more experience in that kind of work than any other engineers in the country.  They have handled embankments for years, embankments on rivers, along the seashore and on the estates and farms which they took over during the years. The Land Commission was primarily established to make the tenant farmers <Col N="1664" /> the owners of their land and to relieve congestion.  This work is completely outside their scope, but, nevertheless, we are handling the job&mdash;&mdash;</P>
