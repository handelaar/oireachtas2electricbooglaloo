      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state approximately the number of head of cattle represented by the sum of £439,448 paid for wet hides and the sum of £51,581 paid for dry and dry-salted hides imported into this country during the year ending the 31st March, 1950.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Cosgrave)</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of wet hides imported in this country in the 12 months ended 31st March, 1950, was 109,336.  In the same period the number of dry and dry-salted hides imported was 18,214.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary agree that it would be very desirable to increase our export of killed beef in order to obviate the necessity for importing this number of hides?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with that objective, but some of the hide imports consist of leather of such a kind that no development of home hides would obviate the necessity for these imports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether, in view of the <Col N="1550" /> growing demand for an improvement in the benefits paid under the children's allowances scheme, he will reconsider his decision to postpone consideration of the question of improving the scheme, and have it examined now, particularly with a view to bringing the first two children in each family within its scope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in a reply which I gave here on Thursday last, the Government's next step in the matter of social security is the implementation of the proposals outlined in the White Paper issued on that subject. The Deputy may rest assured that the question of improving the children's allowances scheme is being kept under constant review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider the last line of the question: &ldquo;particularly with a view to bringing the first two children in each family within its scope&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained that the Government has before it a programme of social uplift.  It has already done a considerable amount of useful work in that regard.  Its next proposal is to put through the House the Social Security Bill which will give effect to the proposals set out in the White Paper.  When these proposals have been implemented by the enactment of a Bill, the Government will then consider the remaining aspects of its social programme, including a review of the children's allowances scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether, in the light of experience in other countries as to the high value of radio as an educational medium, he is prepared to take steps to make radio programmes available in all schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="Minister for Education (General Mulcahy) Richard (General) Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer the <Col N="1551" /> Deputy to the first part of an answer given to a similar question put by Deputy Little in February of this year. I intimated on that occasion that the Department had more than once considered the question of arranging broadcasts for schools, but that, after an exhaustive survey of the position, I had come to the conclusion that the educational benefits which might accrue would not be at all commensurate with the cost involved, nor with the amount of time and energy which would have to be expended in organising and selecting suitable and acceptable programmes.</P>
      <P>I am not aware as to what evidence can be adduced to substantiate that radio is regarded in other countries as having, in relation to school work, a high educational value.  Much of the information available to the Department would go to show that there is by no means unanimity of opinion on the matter and that teachers, in particular, complain of the difficulty in preserving and maintaining the receiving sets and of fitting into a time-table of serious work what is generally regarded by the pupils as an interlude of relaxation and amusement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware that, both in England and America, the use of radio is regarded as of very high educational value?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to understand that the Minister has consulted with representatives of the teachers' organisation on this matter and has heard expressed the views to which he has referred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I have not personally consulted the teachers' organisation here, but a fairly general inquiry has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it surprise the Minister to know that the view expressed by many teachers and the attitude adopted by their organisation is that the fullest possible use should be made of radio in the schools?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The necessary preliminary arrangements in this case are nearing completion and I hope that it will be possible, at an early date, to sanction a grant from State funds towards the cost of the erection of the new school.</P>
      <P>When the grant has been sanctioned, it will be a matter for the Commissioners of Public Works to have working drawings and specification for the new school prepared, with a view to the invitation of tenders.  While I am unable to say, at present, when the erection of the new school will be undertaken, there will be no avoidable delay in having the case brought to the stage at which a contract can be placed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Halliden</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state whether a grant has been sanctioned by his Department for the erection of a new primary school in Glantane, Mallow, County Cork; and, if so, the cause of the delay in proceeding with the building of this much-needed school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department recently sanctioned a grant towards the cost of the erection of new boys' and girls' schools to replace the present Glantane National School. There was no avoidable delay in the completion of the preliminary arrangements which had to be made before the grant was sanctioned.</P>
      <P>It is now a matter for the Commissioners of Public Works to have working drawings and a specification for the new schools prepared and to take such other necessary steps as may be required to enable the erection of the building to be proceeded with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether he is aware that the Land Commission propose to give a new residential holding on the estate of Mr. William O'Malley at Formoyle, Louisburgh, to one tenant; that the adjoining uneconomic tenants have been grazing these lands under temporary convenience lettings for a number of years and that if a residential holding is given to one tenant on these lands there will not be enough land left to relieve local congestion, and if he will state whether the Land Commission have considered the propriety of allotting these lands amongst the local uneconomic tenants; and, if so, with what result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Proposals for the disposal of the holding in question have not been approved.  The holding will be dealt with under a scheme for the rearrangement of the holdings in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider having these lands allocated amongst local uneconomic holders in preference to migrating some tenant into this holding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The disposal of these lands is purely a matter for the inspectors under the commissioners.  I have no function in the matter, as I am sure the Deputy is aware.  What I understand the inspectors are doing in this case is that they are using this particular farm of 180 acres to facilitate the rearrangement of the adjoining townland of Formoyle.  While proposals have been put forward for the disposal of the holding, it appears that, so far, they have not been accepted by the tenants, and that the rearrangement scheme has not met with the <Col N="1555" /> acceptance of all the tenants concerned. The matter is still under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister not take power under the recent Land Act to deal with rearrangements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to a certain section of the 1950 Act.  The Minister has power to delegate from the commissioners the question of rearrangement, but I do not intend to avail of that power except in cases of urgency where the question of final sanction is very important or is necessary to prevent the frustration of a scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether he is aware that a Land Commission inspector entered on the lands of Mr. Michael Navan at Cashel, Turlough, County Mayo (Irwin estate, collection No. I. S1/100 S. 2894), and purported to point out additions by way of parcels thereof to Mr. Navan's neighbours, and that no statutory notice has been served on Mr. Navan for the acquisition of these lands, and if he will accordingly state by virtue of what authority and upon whose instructions this inspector so acted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The townlands of Cashel Upper and Cashel Lower on the estate of Irwin are acutely congested and held in rundale.  A rearrangement scheme for these townlands is in course of preparation and it was necessary for a Land Commission inspector to enter on all the holdings involved, including the holding of Mr. Navan in the townland of Cashel Upper.  Mr. Navan's holding was inspected in his presence and with his consent.</P>
      <P>In connection with any rearrangement scheme it is, of course, essential for the inspector to put forward tentative proposals for consideration by the tenants, before a final scheme can be prepared.  In any such proposal it is made clear to the parties that it is a tentative proposal only and subject to the lands becoming available and to the approval of the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Commission have no proceedings at present for the resumption of Mr. Navan's holding and, consequently, <Col N="1556" /> the question of the issue of a statutory notice has not arisen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister to admit that a Land Commission inspector had entered on the holding and purported to give additions in respect of a holding that has not yet been taken by the Land Commission. Is the Minister not aware that nothing is more likely to slander the title of this land than to have a Land Commission inspector going on it when, in fact, no statutory steps have been taken for its acquisition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's statement is not correct, that an inspector went on the land to allot it or to give the impression that he was allotting land.  The Deputy must be quite well aware that, in the case of a rearrangement scheme, it is necessary for the inspector to go over practically every field and every-acre of land in the particular townland that is about to be rearranged.  He has to interview the tenants and find out what exactly they will accept under a rearrangement scheme.  I presume that what happened in this case was that an inspector went on the lands of this Mr. Navan, but Mr. Navan himself accompanied the inspector and it was with his consent that the inspector went on the holding. There was no question at all of allotting land in the way in which the Deputy has suggested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is presumably referring to a proposal estimated to cost £20,000 submitted in May, 1950, for work under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949, on the River Deel between Rathkeale and Askeaton. Last year the county council completed a scheme on this section of the river for the purpose of reducing the incidence of localised flooding.  The work was confined mainly to cleaning of the river and it is understood that it has achieved its object.  The proposal submitted this year is not for the completion of last year's work but envisages large-scale work of a different nature. It would involve considerable alterations to the river channel.  Work of this type requires highly specialised treatment and is outside the capacity of a local authority to undertake.  The proposal was not approved.</P>

      <P>The proposals put forward by the deputation from the Union which I received on 23rd March last were identical with proposals submitted to me by the Union in October, 1948, and involved the revision of the salary scales of a large number of groups of mental hospital officers. When I agreed to receive the deputation <Col N="1590" /> I had already informed the union that any claim to adjustment of remuneration must be dealt with on the basis of the principles applied to the remuneration of officers of central and local authorities and that to single out mental hospital officers for special concessions would involve unfair discrimination as between these officers and other officers of local authorities.</P>
      <P>I have since carefully considered the proposals again.  The scales of remuneration of the staffs concerned were the subject of careful review in 1947 when revised scales were introduced, and since that date these officers have, in common with other local authority officials, received an upward revision of salary by way of temporary bonus. I do not feel that I would be justified in present circumstances in agreeing to a further upward revision for these officers as a class in isolation from the other classes of local authority officers for whom I am responsible, but I am considering the claims made in respect of two classes in relation to the remuneration paid to corresponding grades in other branches of the public service.</P>

      <P>Just before the Adjournment last night I was speaking of the various ways in which members of the Coalition Government had dealt with the general criticism made against them in regard to the cost of living. In the course of his speech the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce seemed to offer as an excuse for having done little to carry out their election promises, the fact that production had increased in certain fields since they came into office.</P>
      <P>At the time of the election they did promise to increase production.  It was a fairly easy promise to make, after two of the worst winters in living memory and after the accumulated effects of the great war.  We have now been told that agricultural production is back again nearly to its pre-war level, largely due to circumstances over which the Government have little control&mdash;good weather conditions for two years after very bad weather conditions, the absence of emergency circumstances, and record prices for agricultural produce.  At the time of the election the promise to reduce drastically the cost of living was made independently of any suggestion that an increase in production might perhaps be the equivalent thereof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1594" /> There was no question of the Government members saying: &ldquo;If we increase production we do not need to reduce drastically the cost of living.&rdquo; The two promises were made quite independently of each other.  Part of the difficulty facing the Government is the memory of people in regard to statements made suggesting that prices would be drastically slashed.</P>
    <P>I discovered just now another statement made by Mr. Norton, the Minister for Social Welfare, at the time of the election, all of which has remained in the minds of workers, in the minds of the proportion of members of trade unions who voted for the Labour Party. It is this kind of statement which has caused a great deal of the indignation that we now see to-day.</P>
    <P>On October 15th, 1947, Mr. Norton is reported as saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Everyone knows that the people who make or distribute these things in a big way&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;he was referring to commodities of an ordinary kind&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;are better off to-day than they ever believed they would be.  These are the folk who pack up the luxury hotels, who can visit the luxury restaurants in various parts of the country; these are the people who have the high-powered cars in O'Connell Street every night; these are the people who got away with all the swag for the past seven or eight years.  They will continue to get away with the swag....  The worker can see the glittering loot grabbed up by those engaged in exploiting the people, those who are permitted to charge the people what they like. Those people succeeded in amassing wealth over the past seven or eight years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At another stage he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If we are to judge the Fianna Fáil Government policy, then it appears to me that the Government have only one policy and that is to allow those people to charge any price they like, sufficient to give them a return grossly in excess of what they are justified in getting under <Col N="1595" /> any process of honesty or any process of economic reasoning whatever.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Statements of that type, foretelling drastic reductions in prices, if they are analysed further mean that not only in respect of luxury articles or even of articles of a miscellaneous kind, such as shirts, clothes, boots and shoes, but in respect of ordinary commodities that go to make up about 80 per cent. of the whole cost of living, there was unjustified profiteering and a deliberate conspiracy between the Government and the manufacturers and the wholesalers and the distributors to exploit the public.</P>
    <P>The statement made by the Minister for Social Welfare in 1947 implied that the whole of the tea importers, the whole of the sugar manufacturers and wholesalers and retailers, the whole of the flour and bread distributors and manufacturers, the whole of the milk interests, the whole of the common grocery interests, the whole of the butchering trade and all that went with it, were engaged in a successful conspiracy to raise their prices and that the Government was lax even in its attitude towards the control of prices in respect of those commodities, because those commodities, at the time Mr. Norton made the speech, constituted the main factors in the cost of living.  Naturally, there were a few thousand people who, faced with post-war high living costs, became worried. Some deserted the Government of the day.  They are now coming to regret it.  Those commodities are reasonably easy to control by any competent Minister, with the assistance of competent officials.</P>
    <P>There was an implication in Mr. Norton's speech that the high officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce were in some way implicated in the conspiracy, because it would be almost impossible for the Minister of the day to direct officials deliberately to disregard evidences of profiteering in articles subject to control under emergency legislation without very severely straining the consciences of such officials.  We know that the officials in the Department of Industry and Commerce are, beyond <Col N="1596" /> dispute, honest men and I think that should be repeated as often as possible, because they inevitably came under the slur cast by the smaller Parties in particular during the election.</P>
    <P>I was referring also to another very important matter, namely, the fact that the workers of this country are never going to be led properly until those leaders among them who are supporters of the Labour Party cease trying to talk in two ways, according to circumstances.  We are about to face what may be a series of rather serious industrial disputes.  I beg the members of the Labour Party in this House to cease the double cry which merely confuses the workers, which makes it very difficult for them to apply for wage increases with a proper knowledge of the facts and which makes it almost impossible for them to direct their activities in a manner which will be good for the nation as a whole and good for themselves and which will prevent, possibly, a still further increase in the cost of living due to undue demands for increased wages as distinct from reasonable demands for increased wages.</P>
    <P>The members of the Labour Party in this House are capable, almost in the same day, of boasting of their allegiance to the Coalition Government by saying that wages went up 10 per cent. since the Government came into office and that prices remained stable and&mdash; almost in the same voice&mdash;they make the constant complaint that prices have gone up so much, that the Government's promise to reduce the cost of living has not been fulfilled and that, therefore, the workers deserve very much higher wages than they are now getting.  We shall never get the whole of the negotiations for increased wages conducted in a proper manner as long as that double talk goes on.  Either one statement or the other is true but, obviously, both of them cannot be true except, possibly, in regard to very exceptional cases affecting only one or two industrial trades.</P>
    <P>I have here some statements&mdash;which I did not read out last night&mdash;in regard to various observations of members of the Government, their supporters and members of the trade unions.  These <Col N="1597" /> statements show the complete confusion of mind which exists in the ranks of trade unionists in relation to what members of the Labour Party say in the Dáil.  Some of these statements were made by members of Parties other than the Labour Party but they all go to show the existence of a kind of patchwork quilt of opinion, in regard to prices and wages, in the Coalition Government.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in the course of a speech on the 29th October, 1948, stated that the remedy lay in the hands of the public.  Shortly after that, the Labour Party sought a meeting with the Government in order to slash living costs&mdash;just after the Minister had stated that the remedy lay entirely in the hands of the public.</P>
      <P>Senator Crosbie, a member of the Fine Gael Party, speaking on the 31st October, 1949, said that the Coalition had held the cost of living.  Very shortly after that statement by Senator Crosbie an official of a very prominent union, speaking almost at the same time as Senator Crosbie, said that the Government was trafficking in people's bread.</P>
      <P>Deputy Everett, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, was reported by the <i>Irish Times</i> of the 7th February of this year as saying that there had been no increase in costs.  Another prominent official of a union was reported as saying on the 23rd March, 1950, that the Government was allowing costs to rise gradually and that members must apply for a rise.</P>
      <P>Deputy Larkin was reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> dated 22nd May, 1950, as saying that the right to higher wages was undeniable.  Exactly three days later Deputy Morrissey, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, was quoted as saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Present retail prices give cause for a high degree of satisfaction.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could quote a great many more statements but they all go to show <Col N="1598" /> that members of the Government speak with different voices on a matter of vital concern to the public.  The President of the Trade Union Congress was reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 27th July of this year as saying that there had been a big increase in the cost of living in the last three months &mdash;and so forth.</P>
    <P>We can make an appeal in this debate, regardless of Party or of our political position, to members of the Labour Party in this House to stop the double talk and to give the workers a genuine and discreet lead in connection with the crisis that is going to arise over wage demands.</P>
    <P>I come now to the observations made by the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Cosgrave, on the index in general.  At column 1269 of the Official Report of the 23rd November, 1950, he said that in his view the index was essentially correct and that when one of the officials of his Department broadened its scope it would effect a rise of only one point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Statistics.  It is quite obvious that many of the increases that have taken place have been recent, and that since the war there must have been a change in consumption habits because, since the Parliamentary Secretary agrees that no confidence trick was carried out by the Fianna Fáil Government in establishing the new index, quite evidently there is some other reason for the discrepancy between the index price and the actual cost of living.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he could have examined that matter quite easily within the past three years&mdash;the consumption habits that, evidently, have changed: the proportions of various kinds of foodstuffs, clothing, and so forth, that have altered.  He did not have to wait until three weeks ago to propose the establishment of an advisory tribunal on prices.  Since the Government promised, that if elected, they would reduce the cost of living, one of the first things to <Col N="1599" /> be done by them should have been a thorough examination of the index and what it implies in order to see if the index of 1949 or early 1950 conformed with the consumption habits of the people as we knew them from 1932 onwards. It would have been perfectly possible for the Government to have done that, and it would have been approved by all Parties in this House.</P>
      <P>So far as I know&mdash;unless the Parliamentary Secretary contradicts me in his reply&mdash;all the sugar and tea consumed in this country are included at the ration price in the cost-of-living index.  No tea and sugar consumed at the higher price is counted nor is there any apportionment in the index so far as these two unrationed commodities are concerned.  It is an extraordinary position that when people buy jam, sweets for their children, and eat in the less expensive type of restaurant&mdash;I am speaking now of the ordinary type of person, the ordinary workers who have to have their meals out in many cases, farmers who go to market, and so forth&mdash;the money spent on the jam, the sweets and the sugar in these cases, goes to pay for the subsidy on the rationed sugar but the high price of the sugar which these people purchase in that manner is not recorded in the cost-of-living index.  The last time I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce a question on this matter I was told&mdash;it is some time ago now&mdash; that one-sixth of the sugar was sold at the unrationed price.  In spite of that, the sugar factor in the cost-of-living index&mdash;unless it has changed recently&mdash; was counted only at the low ration price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as an advisory tribunal is concerned, I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary a question.  Again taking the statement I made previously, that a very high proportion of the whole cost of living is related to about 12 principal commodities or services, those being sugar, bread, milk, tea, flour, meat, the commoner class of groceries, coal, turf, electricity current cost, transport fares and so forth, I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary in how many of those cases does he think that an advisory tribunal would assist towards keeping down the cost of living.  It may result in a certain amount of publicity which may help the ordinary people to appreciate what is going on and the reason for increases, but in connection with those groups of commodities, the Minister, with his officials and competent delegations and competent accountants, should be able to hold prices in check, as far as they can be held in check, and they should be able to prevent profiteering in those commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take tea, for example.  Tea is all imported into this country through well-known associations.  It is a comparatively simple article, it is packed in a number of different ways and the packing costs are well known and established.  The methods of distribution are fairly uniform throughout the State.  The costings for the importation of tea, its assembly, its packing, its transportation to larger centres and its eventual retail distribution should be well known to the accountants <Col N="1601" /> employed by the Minister.  I wonder whether, in regard to that particular commodity, a prices tribunal can be of much use in so far as bringing down the cost of living is concerned.  The same thing applies to bread and flour. It certainly applies to coal and turf, to such costs as gas and electricity, as all those costings can be well established. I wonder where the utility of this tribunal comes in, so far as these commodities are concerned, that go to make up the great bulk of the cost of living.</P>
    <P>It may be that such a tribunal would be useful in connection with such items as clothing, boots and shoes, articles of a more complicated construction, articles produced in varying types of factories with a great multiple of different types of costings involved, where the raw materials are imported from different sources, in different ways, under different types of agencies.  I can see the moral effect of a tribunal, sitting in public, holding no evidence of a private nature in public but nevertheless where the group concerned has to meet publicly and express their views publicly.  Some good might be effected, but I cannot see how a tribunal would be of much use in connection with a great many of these commodities.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary a specific question.  Does he believe, in respect of the articles that go to make up 70 per cent. of the cost-of-living index factors, that an advisory tribunal is going to be of any great substantial use in holding down prices? That is an absolutely specific and completely fair question to ask.  It is not a question designed as a political trap. It is a perfectly fair question, asked in the interests of the public and, incidentally, in the interests of all the traders concerned, all of whom would be occupying themselves with preparing evidence to go before this tribunal and all of whom would provide the State with the opportunity of appointing still more officials to carry out State duties of various kinds in connection with the tribunal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I know nothing whatever about the price of blankets, but if the Deputy is right in saying that the price of that article has gone up unduly, I have just answered the Deputy's point.  I said that the tribunal may be of some use regarding articles of a complicated construction&mdash;for instance, where wool is brought from all parts of the world and there is a mixture of Irish and foreign wool.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some commodities where a tribunal might help. I am not denying that there is profiteering. What I have said is that I would like the Minister to say whether he believes that there is profiteering going on in the main groups of commodities and whether a tribunal can stop it. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary can give, in the course of his reply, what percentage of the whole cost-of-living index is affected by these articles &mdash;tea, sugar, flour, bread, jam, milk and meat.  It would be interesting to get that figure and see how far they as a whole affect the whole incidence of the cost of living.  He can take any group and leave out one item or add another, but I think he knows what I mean by it.</P>
      <P>Another difficulty in regard to the establishment of any tribunal or enforcing price control in a more severe way lies in the fact that the principal job of that tribunal should be to increase production per head per worker. They may deal with blankets or any other commodities, but the only real way of bringing down the cost of living or of holding it is the way advocated by the Republican and more conservative Government of the United States and by the Socialist Government of England.  The one thing upon which everybody agrees is to increase production per head, and by such means allow workers to receive an increase in wages that will not affect the cost of living, and by such means benefit the consumer at large.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The members of the Labour Party know that that is one economic factor in which all Parties and all intelligent <Col N="1603" /> democracies throughout the world believe as the principal way by which the cost of living can be reduced or held.  Once another body or institution is established to check prices, there is always the danger that to hold down a profit in the case of some companies may reduce the incentive to more efficient production.  Industries in this country, as the Parliamentary Secretary knows, are organised in very different ways.  I can think of one textile industry&mdash;I am not going to name it, as I should be identifying persons&mdash;where there are some 30 units and the number of persons employed per unit varies from about ten to about 300.  The kind of machinery used in the factories varies from the very simple to the most complicated and modern.  Inevitably, the competence of the managers of the industry varies from the very excellent to the mediocre. The materials used in the industry vary both in origin, quality and kind. In that particular industry, the largest producer dictates the prices of the main commonly used articles to all the others, in that he maintains the lowest prices.  As a result of that, the smaller units in some cases make very small profits indeed, because the great big producer with a nationally advertised brand of goods and a desire to increase the sale to the maximum point, keeps the price very low and the smaller units in that particular industry make the lowest profit.  That is not always the case.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that, if the tribunal examines publicly&mdash;or, in so far as it can, publicly&mdash;the costings and prices of those articles, they may do nothing but get that industry into a ghastly mess.  It may be extremely difficult for the tribunal to make any kind of useful recommendation, because it is an industry where the factors in regard to prices are so complicated that the decisions of three men, listening to evidence held partly in public, could not be of the slightest service either to the Minister or to the consumer.</P>
    <P>I hope I have made my position clear. I hope I am not again trying to defend any profiteers in that industry.  I am <Col N="1604" /> just trying to point out to the Minister the complications in dealing with price control.  There may be industries, there may be trades, where trade restrictions or private arrangements exist where the entire group of manufacturers may agree to hold up the price and where they may agree possibly that prices should be determined by the weakest unit of the group making a fair profit so that the strongest unit in the group will make a very large profit.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether he knows of any great industrial groups&mdash; there are not very many in this country to consider which seriously affect the living costs&mdash;where the latter set of circumstances exist in contrast with the former.  I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether he knows of groups of industries where the price control machinery set up by his Minister has failed and where the prices tribunal is likely to reveal the second set of circumstances, that is, prices being dictated in such a way that the weakest unit makes a good profit and the strongest unit an excessive profit.  Will he tell us, will he give us an indication, whether that trend exists in the life of the State after all the work which his Minister and his officials are supposed to have put into price control over the past two or three years because the answer to that question is a very interesting one and await the answer with interest?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the difficulties in the present situation is that there might be a greater incentive to increased production by the workers, a greater incentive to bringing more highclass machinery of a modern type into various industries, if the public as a whole had a confidence in the economic policy of the Government, but the Government, unfortunately composed of various types of economic theorists, includes people who quite frankly believe in inflation as a cure for all our ills, just printing money; it includes people who, until we joined the European Payments Union, wished us to become independent of sterling; it includes some old-fashioned deflationists who, if they had their way, would like to bring down the cost of living by all the means which were known, for example, to the British Conservative Party between 1929 and 1933.  It includes a mixture and where there is a mixture of people having various economic policies it is extremely difficult to persuade the public that they should go in for long-term improvements in production methods.</P>
      <P>I should like to conclude by making a few brief references to the recent report of the Central Bank in which the Government have been given a perfectly clear warning that they must try to curb inflation.  The Minister for Finance has had to admit that there is going to be a disimprovement in the standard of living for both employers and employees if the international situation continues in the way it is at present.  I think that the Government should take the public into its confidence and instead of saying that the cost of living has not risen in the past but that it may rise in the future, they should tell the public honestly what they really think can be done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance does occasionally vary from his general practice of appearing to be a currency specialist and a currency crank.  He does occasionally issue words of warning, and his speech the other night, made by the Minister for Defence because of his absence through illness, was a clear indication to the public that the prices <Col N="1606" /> tribunal may result in pure window dressing.  It may reveal one or two isolated cases of profiteering, but all it will do is to reveal to the public what they already know: that as long as the Korean war goes on, as long as the whole world continues to rearm, there may be in this country a disimprovement in standards regarding the living of employers and workers.  The Minister for Finance quite clearly hinted in his speech that there is very little that can be done about it.  He went on to warn the public that any undue increase in wages could only result in a further increase in prices and that any undue increase in profits could only result in a further increase in prices and that no one would benefit thereby.  He was giving warning to all members of the Coalition Government who still rely on their special methods of dealing with financial crises and of bringing paradise overnight to the world that the Russians in Korea were going to prevent all their plans from proving successful.</P>
    <P>It is as well that the Parliamentary Secretary should, in the course of his reply, be absolutely frank and outspoken and follow the example of the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, who spoke almost brutally the truth about our circumstances so far as international relations affected them for the many long years of the war and, as a result, received a great measure of confidence from the public because he hardly ever attempted to gloss over anything and always warned the people that we could not remain independent of outside circumstances.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether he feels that the adverse position regarding our payments is affecting the cost of living or what he feels about the statement in the Central Bank report that the repatriation of assets through the purchase of machinery designed to increase production was not yet taking place in a material degree.  We did note, somewhat ironically, that our external assets increased considerably in 1949 over 1948 but I should like to <Col N="1607" /> ask him whether he considers that very large borrowing by the public and the beginning of the decline of our external assets, not largely for the purchase of capital goods or machinery to improve production methods but by the purchase of goods for current consumption, is Government policy.  I should like to ask him whether he thinks that the Taoiseach's grandiloquent statement that our external assets were to be repatriated&mdash;although there were many reservations after that speech was made to explain what he really meant&mdash;was a good thing.  I should like to know whether he thinks it a good thing to borrow more and more and lose our assets that give us purchasing power, not for the purchase of machinery but for the purchase of goods for current consumption.  I should like to know whether he thinks that those factors are affecting the cost of living at the present time.  In any event the directors of the Central Bank have stated publicly that steps must be taken to curb inflation.  That is a factor that must be taken into account in judging the whole question of the cost of living.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by once again pointing out that there will be more and more of this perturbation in the minds of the public and that there would not be this indignation regarding rising costs if a very large section of the public did not feel that they had been very badly let down by the Government which had failed completely to carry out its promise, not to reduce the cost of living by 10 per cent., not to maintain it at the level at which they found it, but to reduce it substantially so that every housewife going into the shops would have found, from March, 1948, that the goods were markedly cheaper and that the end had come to the reign of Fianna Fáil and the vicious profiteers who were supposed to be supporting them.</P>

      <P>The matter which is engaging the attention of the House is one of the most serious problems that have confronted the Dáil within the past two and a half years or so.  The public have been worried, and shocked, <Col N="1608" /> by the rapid and continuous increase in the cost of living under a Government, all the Minister of which in the last general election gave a very clear promise to the people that, if they were elected to office, they would reduce the cost of living.  The position became so serious that deputations from the Trade Union Congress, the Congress of Irish Unions and the Labour Party saw the Taoiseach and impressed on him, as I am sure they did, the necessity for taking immediate steps to deal with this rapid increase in the cost of living.  The pressure from my own constituents compelled me to put a motion on the Order Paper in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Eireann is of opinion that the Minister for Industry and Commerce in exercise of his functions as head of the Department of Industry and Commerce, has failed to take effective action to prevent the cost of living rising to its present high level, and requests the Government to take immediate steps to deal with the matter in the public interest.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was the position that confronted the Government.  The Government had introduced the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946 (Continuance and Amendment) Bill, 1950, and that Bill was before the House at the time.  In order to deal with this very serious demand from organised workers, from representatives of the housewives and the public generally, the Government withdrew the Bill and substituted for it another Bill, putting in one additional section enabling the Minister, by Order, from time to time to set up advisory bodies to deal with such matters as he might refer to them, and, in the main, to deal with the cost of living.  I suggest that to deal with the representations made by the bodies I have mentioned by the introduction of a section to enable an advisory body to be set up was not dealing with the matter at all, but was merely throwing dust in the eyes of the organised trade unionists, in the eyes of Irish housewives and in the eyes of the public generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary was <Col N="1609" /> instructed by the Government to introduce this Bill and on its Second Reading to make a statement to the House with regard to the cost of living.  It must have been clear to everybody&mdash; as it was clear to me when the Parliamentary Secretary was talking&mdash;that he was giving expression not to his own views but to the views which he was instructed to put before the Dáil. I have watched the career of the Parliamentary Secretary.  I have seen the capable and efficient way he handled difficult measures which he brought before this House and I was very pleased to see the way he was developing, as one might expect him to develop, as a person on whom very grave and serious responsibilities would be placed in the not too distant future, but the Parliamentary Secretary, speaking to his brief and to the instructions he got, made a speech here on the Second Reading that has done irreparable damage to the Government. He was instructed to carry out a dangerous bluff and that dangerous bluff has failed.</P>
    <P>On the day after that statement was made by the Parliamentary Secretary, a newspaper carried a big headline that the cost of living had not increased and the reaction to that all over the City of Dublin amongst all classes of the community was this: Has the Government gone mad?  Do they think we are entirely fools, to say that the cost of living has not gone up when we all know it has?  That is why I say irreparable damage has been done to the Government by that statement, and I hold the Government responsible for it and not the Parliamentary Secretary, who, I believe, if he had the responsibility himself, would not have made a speech of that nature, so ridiculous and so damaging politically.</P>
    <P>The Government were the people who were confronted by this problem and the Taoiseach was the Head of the Government who was interviewed by the Labour Party, by representatives of the trade union congresses and by representatives of other organisations. One would have expected that, in a serious matter of this kind, the Taoiseach would have come before this House and would have made a statement <Col N="1610" /> in regard to this Bill, either by moving the Second Reading of it himself or by making a statement of Government policy; but the Government has treated this House with contempt, it has treated the Deputies of this House with contempt, it has treated the representatives of the organised trades unions with contempt and it has treated the public with contempt. Not one Minister in the Government has come into this House during the three-day discussion on this Bill, not one of them has bothered his head to come in and hear what the criticisms were or to answer any of the arguments that were put forward.</P>
    <P>I say, and in doing so I do not think I am using inflammatory language, that the Government has treated this House and the Deputies of the House with contempt.  It was the duty of the Government to come in here, it was the duty of Ministers to come in here and deal with this serious problem at the present time, but they just hand instructions to the Parliamentary Secretary and let him do the best he can to &ldquo;cod&rdquo; the people and to &ldquo;cod&rdquo; the Deputies.</P>
    <P>I take very serious objection to that attitude on the part of the Government. As a representative of my constituency, I do not like to be treated in the way that I have been treated as their representative in regard to this serious matter.  But, while Ministers cannot find time to come in here and talk to the representatives of the people, some of them can find time to go elsewhere and talk about the cost of living, and even last night, when the matter was under discussion here, we find a Minister of the Government talking nonsense about civil liberties and the right of a person to express his own view, a Minister who dealt very sharply and quickly with a member of his own Party who dared to express his own view.</P>
    <P>I want to start the few observations I have to make by that criticism of the Government.  If the Government is not prepared to face its responsibilities, then I say, and I am very sorry to have to say it but I must say it, that the sooner we get a new Government the <Col N="1611" /> better.  The cost of living has not increased! Everybody in the State knows that the cost of living has increased and has been gradually increasing.</P>

      <P>The cost of living has not increased!  Everybody knows that the cost of living has so increased that the poorer sections and the middle classes are hardly able to make ends meet, and that every person, except the pretty well-to-do, has to go without items of food and clothing which are essential to a decent standard of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Industry and Commerce is the Department which is primarily concerned with this matter, and I charge the Department with failure, criminal failure, to do its duty in regard to the cost of living.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is the Minister responsible to this House for the administration of the Department of Industry and Commerce but, nevertheless, the Government as a whole has to carry responsibility before this House and before the public.  We are in a difficulty.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce himself is ill. I am very sorry that he is ill.  Every Deputy on every side of the House is sorry that he is ill.  I have the highest personal regard for the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and I hope that he will shortly be restored to full health and be able to take his place in <Col N="1612" /> this House; but the responsibility cannot be put aside by the Government simply and solely because the Minister for Industry and Commerce happens to be ill.</P>
    <P>It is a very serious, a very complicated and a very difficult problem, this problem of the cost of living.  It is not now, in a time of crisis, that steps to deal with it should be taken.  The steps to deal with it should have been prepared and should have been taken two years ago.  The Parliamentary Secretary will agree that every person on this side of the House in January and February of 1948, and the later months of 1947, promised the people that if we did get into power&mdash;and it was rather unlikely at the time&mdash;we would take steps to see that the cost of living was reduced.</P>

      <P>However, whether it was to be 30 per cent., 25 per cent., 20 per cent., 15 per cent., or 10 per cent., we did, each and every one of us, give a solemn promise to the people that we would reduce the cost of living. Having given that solemn promise, my complaint is that it is not now that steps should be taken to try and reduce the cost of living when it has increased, but that the steps should have been taken two and a half or almost three years ago.  That is one of my criticisms of the Department of Industry and Commerce, one of my criticisms of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and one of my criticisms of the Government.</P>
      <P>That matter was not left in abeyance by some of us.  As will be seen clearly, even from the extracts which have been read out in this debate by members of Fianna Fáil, members of the Labour Party, Independent Deputies, and myself on several occasions, have asked the Taoiseach what he was going to do to reduce the cost of living.  Now, when the problem reaches what I consider to be the crisis stage, we are asked to authorise the establishment of an advisory body to advise the Minister in regard to it.  The blame must be borne by the Ministers and the Government and the Ministers must know that there has been serious uneasiness about this problem.  But those who have been speaking loudest about it have been doing least about it.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is an unfair criticism to say that probably a considerable amount of the time spent outside this country by Ministers trying to improve conditions in Europe might have been devoted to action to deal with this particular problem in the past couple of years.  It is extraordinary how concerned we are about the rights, liberties and economic position of people all over Europe.  But here, where we have so many people barely able to make ends meet being very seriously affected by the increasing cost of living, we find no steps being taken to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Vivion de Valera gave us, yesterday and last Thursday night, a very exhaustive statement in which he <Col N="1615" /> dealt with the increase in the cost of hundreds, I might say, of items purchased by the ordinary people.  He showed conclusively by the figures which he quoted that the cost of living, so far as actual eating is concerned, is increased.  So far as the cost of foodstuffs is concerned, he has proved by the figures which he gave, and which I think will be accepted, that there has been a very substantial increase.  Other items have been mentioned, like housing, electricity, coal and turf.  I do not intend to go into those things. Recently, however, I have got some figures which I think are important and which should be mentioned in the course of this debate.  Blankets are a very important item in the home.  In January, 1950, all wool Ossory blankets were sold at 7/- a lb. by the manufacturer to the wholesaler.  The price at the beginning of this month was 15/- per lb., more than double in ten or 11 months.  Lucan blankets in January, 1950, were 6/7 a lb. and at the beginning of this month, 14/- a lb.  Confederate blankets, which I understand are a mixture of cotton and wool, in January, 1950, were 7/5 per lb. and at the beginning of this month, 12/- a lb. Wexford blankets, which are a mixture, were sold in January, 1950, at 6/10 a lb. and at the beginning of this month, 12/- a lb.  Thomond all-wool blankets were sold in January last at 8/- a lb. and at the beginning of this month, 14/-</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the wholesale price or the manufacturer's price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Manufacturer to wholesaler.  These are figures which I have been given, figures which I can guarantee to be authentic.  Has the wool which went into these blankets been affected by price increases?  I am sure that it has not.  Nevertheless, in that short period the prices of these blankets have doubled approximately. Then we come to blankets in the pair. A pair of 5-lb.  Ossory blankets in January, 1950, were 35/- and in October 75/-; Lucan 5-lb. blankets, 32/11 in January; 70/- in October.  Confederate Union 5-lb. blankets, 37/11 in January; 60/- in October.  I understand that in <Col N="1616" /> regard to blankets, wholesalers who may be also large retailers have the greatest difficulty in getting their orders filled by manufacturers.  The complaint is that manufacturers have held up supplies until the prices increased.  There is one firm which, in October, 1949, got an order for 450 pairs of blankets and it did not complete that order until 24th July this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the prevailing price.  Socks are a very important item.  Irish wool-ribbed socks for men in the spring of this year were 29/6 a dozen pairs and in November 43/- a dozen pairs; Kenmare socks in the spring, 33/6 a dozen pairs, and in November, 47/-; Jason socks in June, 42/3 a dozen pairs, and in November, 66/6.  Irish knitting wool in October, 1949, was 8/- a lb. and in October or early November this year 16/- a lb. Sheets, a pair, General Textiles, January, 21/-; October or early November, 25/6; and a couple of weeks ago they had withdrawn all prices; there were no more quotations.  Greenmount and Boyne sheets, a pair, February, 21/-; late October or early November, 26/- a pair.  Towels, cotton, January, 21/-; October, 29/6; and a better quality, which was 31/6 in January, was 42/- in November.  Oil yarn, January, 1950, 62/6 per 12 lb.; November, 1950, 90/5 per 12 lb.  There was a gradual increase in this item as follows:&mdash; October, last year, 48/-; December, 53/8; and then it went up again in the same month to 56/6; January, 1950, 62/6; September, 1950, 67/9; October, 1950, 79/1, and November, 1950, 90/5. Tweeds: Midleton, spring, 1950, 14/7 per yard; November, 22/6; another cloth, 14/6 in spring, and in November, 24/6 a yard.  Lucan Irish check, spring, 11/6; November, 22/6.  Morroghs of Cork, June, 28/6; November, 41/-. Claytons, June 31/6; November, 42/6. Flynns, Sixmilebridge, lady's twill, spring, 13/11; November, 19/11.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are items that go into the cost of living and are vital and essential. Parents who go out on Friday or Saturday to try to buy a suit of clothes for a small boy will have to travel this city from end to end on occasion and they <Col N="1617" /> may be lucky to get his size.  They are told quietly by the assistants that they are under the counter waiting for the price increase.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary or anyone deny that this is taking place and has been taking place for a long time?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>But it has been taking place and it is taking place.  In this matter I am not concerned with Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, or anybody else.  I am concerned with the increase in the cost of living and I am concerned with my own constituents whom I represent in this House.  While this situation lasted, when blankets could not be obtained from the manufacturers, when very necessary blankets under our different public health schemes and blankets required by St. Vincent de Paul and other organisations could not be obtained, grey blankets were refused free entry permits. That problem may have been solved in the last couple of weeks.  I do not know.  But the importers were refused permission to import those cheap grey blankets for a considerable period.  As I mentioned, I cannot say what the situation is to-day but up to a few weeks ago permission to import those blankets was refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, in regard to ladies' nylons, unless they cost more than 70/- a dozen, they would not be allowed in, and for a long time there were large quantities of nylons waiting at the docks and they would not be allowed in because they were bought at 65/- a dozen and less, 62/6.  Who was causing the increase in the cost of living there, prohibiting the people who want to supply the needs of the people from importing nylons unless they import at a price of more than 70/- a dozen?  I can understand the criticism that can arise on that point but I mention it to establish that in all this situation with costs increasing day by day, and month by month, almost hour by hour, the Department was apparently sitting down doing nothing, and when all this tremendous public pressure was brought upon them the result is that <Col N="1618" /> the Government proposes to set up an advisory body.  In a situation of crisis there is only one way to deal with the problem and that is to place the responsibility fairly and squarely on one person's shoulders, that person being the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  If he wants additional powers to deal with it, this House will gladly give him those powers.  As far as I am concerned I am certainly not going to have dust thrown in my eyes and I am not going to let it be said that I was satisfied that this situation can be met by taking away responsibility from the Minister and giving it to some body that may be set up in the immediate future which will have to call in, by advertisement, or otherwise, people to give evidence, which will hear some of that evidence in public and some of it in private.  They cannot deal with a situation of crisis such as confronts us.  In ordinary periods of peace, when there is plenty of time for everything, I can imagine that an advisory committee such as this can have some useful function. They can leisurely inquire into prices and costings and all that.  The public can go and give evidence if they like before them.  It can serve some purpose but it cannot serve the purpose of either stabilising or reducing the present cost of living; and, because I think this is a political device used just to fool everybody, I am opposed to it.</P>
    <P>One of the factors that affects the cost of living is the cost of agricultural produce.  We have the Minister for Agriculture going over to England and getting the best price he can for our farmers, and, in doing that, I think he has the support of every person in the House.  But every increase in price that we can get for our farm produce means that the cost to the consumers in the city, the cost to the people I represent, is going up.  That cannot be allowed to continue.  The cost of living cannot be rushed up on the people in the cities by every increase the Minister for Agriculture can get abroad for agricultural produce.  It has been mentioned very often in this House and it was part of the Labour <Col N="1619" /> Party policy, and, in so far as we were able to incorporate the Labour Party policy into Clann na Poblachta policy, it was part of the Clann na Poblachta policy that there ought to be a marketing board which would guarantee prices to the farmers and, at the same time, control the price of these agricultural products for our own consuming public.  There is no difficulty about doing that.  It means guaranteeing a certain fixed price to the agricultural community and arranging that everything beyond that fixed price will be used for the purpose of subsidising prices or keeping them down so far as our consumers generally are concerned.  That is one of the ways in which this thing could be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Another way has been mentioned by other Deputies&mdash;to deal drastically with the profits of middlemen.  Deputy Briscoe, speaking here last night, spent quite a lot of time defending the present system.  There is no necessity to interfere very much with the present system, but it is unreasonable that there should be agency fees as high as 25 per cent.  That thing occurs.  You want a radio and it costs, say, £25. If you know a friend in the trade you get a reduction of £6 5s.&mdash;that is, the radio costs you £18 15s. instead of £25.  Can that be justified by anybody? Can it be tolerated simply to maintain any system?  I mention that as one item that comes readily to mind &mdash;25 per cent. commission just for an agency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephTimoney" hpid="Mr. Timoney Mr. Timoney">

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>£25 is supposed to be the retail price and there is a reduction of 25 per cent. on that which is, in effect, a reduction of 33 ? per cent. on the wholesale price.  There are other items but I do not want to go into them.  I do not want to waste the time of the House referring to things that are known to everybody.</P>

      <P>Whether they are <Col N="1620" /> admitted or not, they must be known to everybody.  That is another aspect in connection with which the Minister and the Department of Industry and Commerce could, with advantage, do much to reduce the cost of living.  As I said at the outset, this situation has not been faced up to by the Government in the way it should.  The Government, apparently, have reached the position that they forget the collective responsibility that they have for all matters relating to prices and the cost of living. They say: &ldquo;It is a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce; let us send out the Parliamentary Secretary to make a speech on these lines.  Let him listen to the criticism but do not mind about the criticism.  We shall get a publicity value for this new device that may, in a couple of years' time, reduce the cost of some item by ½d. or ¼d.&rdquo;  I think Ministers, and the Taoiseach particularly, should have been present here during the course of the debate and that, having heard the criticism of Deputy Lemass, leading for the Opposition, and the criticism of Deputies of other Parties, the Government answer and their position should have been brought fully and clearly before the House.  My experience of the people is that they are generous and had the Taoiseach, or even the Parliamentary Secretary, come in here and said: &ldquo;We realise that we were not able to fulfil our promises about the cost of living.  Because of inflation and of the Korean war, prices have increased and we have no control over them, but there are certain items in regard to which we can take immediate steps to prevent prices increasing any further.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put it this way.  The Government could say: &ldquo;We realise the cost of living is getting out of hand.  We realise that the ordinary worker and the person in receipt of a widow's pension or an old age pension or any of these other allowances are not able to make ends meet, that they are suffering grave hardship.  We will cut out Europe and get all our active and intelligent Ministers engaged in the effort to solve that problem.&rdquo;  I think <Col N="1621" /> if the situation had been faced in that way, the public would have been appreciative and they would have recognised the difficulties but when they are told, and it is headlined to them, that there is no increase in the cost of living and then in another breath that there is an increase, and that we propose to deal with it by setting up a commission&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I know the Parliamentary Secretary has been held up by an organ of opinion which is not unfriendly to the Government or to his own particular Party as saying that, and it has done irreparable damage to the Government, damage that they will not overcome very quickly.  The only way they can overcome it is by taking some very drastic action in regard to the cost of living.  The Bill now before us is not the sort of action which will win public confidence or undo the very serious damage that has already been done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure many Deputies were surprised that the Parliamentary Secretary, in introducing this measure, did not avail of the opportunity to deal with the general position, the almost emergency position, which he claims to exist.  This Bill is continuation legislation designed for an emergency situation but one fails to find in it any profit from the experience gained by the former Government during the last emergency situation over the war period.  There must be sufficient information in Government files, particularly in the Department of Industry and Commerce, to have enabled the Government to entrust the Parliamentary Secretary with a statement of policy, detailing how if an emergency situation should arise, they proposed to improve upon whatever measures were considered necessary, and perhaps in certain cases not found completely effective, during the course of the last war. Apart from that question to which no answer is given by the Parliamentary Secretary or to which the Bill provides no reply, there is the general question in which the public would be greatly interested, having regard to the very <Col N="1622" /> serious news which they have heard about the deterioration in the international situation and the grave danger which is looming up.  They would be particularly interested in getting a comprehensive statement from the Government as to the position should a crisis arise, in regard to our supplies of fuel, raw materials and of the articles which are necessary for capital development works and for the proper functioning of our economy and industries. We know that there were serious gaps and serious lacunae during the last war and we should profit by that experience.</P>
      <P>New Deputies to the House will not remember, but those of us who were here at that time will remember clearly that it was a cause of complaint that sufficient provision had not been made by the past Administration, in anticipation of war difficulties, in the realm of supplies, but for at least 12 months before the war the Department of Industry and Commerce had a special supplies section doing what was possible, having regard to the fact that none of the prominent statesmen seemed to believe that such a thing as a second world war could break upon us.  We now seem to be confronted with the position that a third world war is quite within the bounds of probability, not merely possibility, and the House would like to receive from the Parliamentary Secretary a fuller statement as to what the position is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the question of the husbanding and distribution of essential commodities and the question as to how the Government propose to improve the existing system.  No less a person than the late Lord Keynes, at the beginning of the last war, when dealing with the question of inflation, described the rationing system, if purchasing power in the country is increased by factors which the Government cannot control, as a pseudo remedy, just as allowing prices to rise to whatever heights they may reach in the natural course of events, without intervention from the Government, is another pseudo remedy.  The economist put forward his own remedy at the time and it may not be the appropriate remedy in existing circumstances.  In <Col N="1623" /> any case, we do not know at present that we will be faced with the worst but, as has been said, while expecting the best, we ought to be prepared for the worst emergency that could arise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin, in taking Deputy Lemass to task for criticising the basis of computation of the present cost-of-living index, could not deny that it was made clear in 1947 that the new basis of computation of the index, then introduced, was temporary.  Everyone knew that the basis laid down in 1922 could not be regarded as meeting the conditions in 1947, but there were difficulties in 1947, as there still are, and I suggest that they were much greater in 1947 than they are now, in introducing a new basis of computation of the index.  There was the question as to whether, after the last war period, there would be a prolonged period of inflation or whether world economic conditions would recover to the extent that there might be a downward fall. In any case, I suggest, it would have been impossible to revise the basis until there was some kind of stability. It is true that we have not got that stability at the present time.  Nevertheless, the Government has been driven to the decision to carry out very comprehensive budgetary surveys of household expenditure, thereby admitting that the present basis is not satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Of course, it has to be borne in mind in that connection that up to the first world war it was only civil servants who were paid on the basis that they would receive an additional bonus in respect of an increase in the cost-of-living figure and the higher the remuneration the lower the bonus was.</P>
    <P>The labour organisations and those representing workers can congratulate themselves on the fact that they have now achieved the position that, however imperfect the basis of computation of the cost-of-living index may be, at any rate, it is some basis behind which, I hope, there is some reality and which enables them to carry out their wage negotiations on a much more satisfactory basis than in the past.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1624" /> It was mentioned in the Parliamentary Secretary's opening statement, at least it was implied, that labour under the present Government had received compensation and he suggested that previously that compensation was denied them.  I beg to disagree with the Parliamentary Secretary on that matter because we on this side of the House can point to the fact that the Labour Court was set up in 1946 and, even before that year had concluded, very substantial increases had been granted, not to all sections, but to important sections of wage earners. For example, the Agricultural Wages Board had increased the remuneration of agricultural labourers by 85 per cent. I do not say that even at that level it was sufficient or proper but, having regard to all the circumstances, to the fact that the inflationary danger certainly existed to a much greater extent than it exists at the present time, and that, unquestionably, there was a shortage of goods in the country, that figure belies the suggestion that there was no compensation and also gives the lie to the often reiterated contention of Deputy Larkin that there was a complete freeze of wage increases. The fact that the Labour Court was set up and that it gave increases from 1946 onwards shows that that was not true.  In that matter it was the lowest paid employees who received the greatest benefits.  That should always be the case, in my opinion, when wage rates are being revised or working conditions improved.</P>
    <P>The increases granted up to October, 1947, amounted to about 60 per cent. If the Parliamentary Secretary can contradict that figure I am sure he will do so.  My recollection is that at the period shortly before we left, this compensation, in cases which had been heard, amounted to at least that percentage. It therefore compared very favourably with what had been done in Great Britain, with this exception, that in Great Britain workers had the advantages of additional earnings, working overtime and receiving special bonuses and incentives.  It would be easy to argue that the total earnings which might be regarded by some as <Col N="1625" /> the real test were much higher in Great Britain.  If that were so, it was because of the special conditions there and the anxiety to proceed with reconstruction work.</P>
    <P>Labour organisations in this country, as elsewhere, accepted the policy that restraint in circumstances where there were serious dangers of inflation was necessary in demands for wage increases. This policy of restraint is based on what seems, as Deputy Childers reminded us, to be generally accepted, that is, that general increases in wages have no meaning before production has expanded at least to an equal degree.  Furthermore, unless the output of goods corresponds to the increase in the aggregate purchasing power, you will simply have prices going higher and these demands for wages will start the inflationary spiral we heard so much about.</P>
    <P>In this matter it would undoubtedly be better if we could proceed by way of agreement than by some form of penalisation, investigation and bureaucratic control.  But I quite agree that the State has to intervene if there is injustice and if conditions of scarcity mean that the poorer and weaker elements of the community are going to suffer unjustly.  We all believe that whatever sacrifices are to be made, they should be distributed evenly.  That is the reply to the statement of the Minister for Finance that the national income should be distributed fairly.  We have the corollary that the sacrifices or burdens should also be distributed fairly among the different sections of the community.</P>
    <P>In other countries they have set up production committees representative of the different interests in industry and it was one of the features in the Bill which Deputy Lemass, when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, introduced that you would have had these development councils, which would endeavour to deal with the problems of a particular industry and particularly with the great need for increasing production.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we are having an advisory committee set up.  The Parliamentary Secretary has not described it quite as <Col N="1626" /> a tribunal.  I hope that in his concluding statement he will make it clear exactly what the powers of this body will be.  If it has not rigid and very critical powers of investigation, then it could be argued that it must of necessity fail in its purpose.  It must get the facts.  On the other hand, if it is to have public sittings and if all the facts relating to the affairs of a particular employer, a particular factory or wholesaler or whoever he may be, are brought into the light of day, that is a matter, I think, that would require very careful consideration.</P>
    <P>The policy we had in mind in 1947 was that the Prices Commission should be entrusted with greater powers, that it should make price orders from time to time and that these should be brought before the Dáil.  There were also important provisions in that measure dealing with hire purchase, for example, and, of course, control, not alone of profits, but prices and trading methods, the object being to try to raise the standard of industrial efficiency. When people complain of bureaucracy&mdash;and I am not one of those who disagree with the point of view that we can have too much of it, and perhaps in many respects even in this State we have too much of it&mdash;it is forgotten that it is difficult to deal with these problems.  There is, undoubtedly, considerable reluctance on the part of employers to sit down with employees and go into the details of their business. Where the point regarding getting necessary information ceases, and where the point of interfering in the control and management of the business begins, is a rather nice one.</P>
    <P>One of the surprising things about the Parliamentary Secretary's statement is that the Government, apparently, take no responsibility whatever for this advisory committee as being an effective body.  In column 1285 the Parliamentary Secretary says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I should like to say in this connection that price control elsewhere has not been particularly effective.  I do not believe that price control can achieve everything that those who advocate it think it can or everything that all of us would desire.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1627" /> Later on, dealing with the setting up of this advisory body, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The decision is based on the criticism which was made of the system of price control&mdash;more from the fact that it was alleged that sufficient information was not provided as to the circumstances which surround the fixing of prices, rather than from any conviction as to its effectiveness.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Are we to take it from that statement of the Parliamentary Secretary that the Government do not really believe that this committee they propose to set up, this advisory body, can be effective, but that it is in view of the criticism made to the Taoiseach and to the Minister by the trade union congresses&mdash;that they are replying to the criticism which was made by setting up a body whose only function will be to give certain information, not already obtainable by them, to the public, and which may very easily and very probably be regarded as leading to the conclusion that nothing could, in fact, have been done, rather than that anything will be done or can be done?  It is not merely the Parliamentary Secretary who has pronounced on the ineffectiveness of the system of price control while, at the same time, claiming in column 1282 of the Official Report of the 23rd November, 1950, that the existing system has been reasonably satisfactory.  The Parliamentary Secretary has found himself in the dilemma that, since he has operated this system for the past two and a half or nearly three years and has not endeavoured to improve upon it, he cannot now very well condemn it.  At the same time, he has to give some justification for setting up this advisory body.  The only justification he gives is that it will provide us with information.  If that is the reason, surely the information could be provided through the ordinary channels of the Department, even as price control is at present administered or through the Statistics Branch.  Either the committee is going to make recommendations of value which can be implemented, and will succeed in achieving the object by reducing prices, or it will not.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1628" /> Take, for example, the particular case which Deputy Cowan has very pertinently put before the House, the increases in woollen goods.  Is the advisory committee to be the body which is going to decide at what stage and to what extent the manufacturer, wholesaler and retailer, in the chain of distribution, are to be permitted to add on the increased cost of the raw material in the shape of wool which they have been buying during the present year?  Is the position to be solved on the basis that allowance must be made for the fact that these different business interests are out of their capital for a certain period, and that, in fixing prices, allowance&mdash;as has, I think, been customary in the past&mdash;must be made for the cost of replacing existing stocks by new stocks which are much higher in price&mdash;or will the Government adopt the suggestion of Deputy Larkin that all prices should be frozen, that no increase ought to be permitted until the representatives of these different interests go before the tribunal to argue their case and convince the committee that the prices must be increased to the level they have in mind?  It is preposterous to suggest that the advisory committee can determine that question.  It is obviously a matter which is going to affect everybody in that particular industry from the manufacturer right down to the smallest retailer in the country.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary told us in the course of his speech that the result of any alteration in the tariffs will inevitably mean difficulties for the less efficient firms and that, in this connection, the least efficient is the criterion for the tariff because otherwise the problem of unemployment and difficulties created by a reduction in the tariff are such that the first people affected by it are those for whom the tariff is imposed.  If that is true of tariffs which, after all, are a tax upon the community in order to help infant industries to establish themselves and other established industries to compete with unfair competition from outside, it is surely a much greater argument in the case of the smaller retailer or business man who finds himself in the position that these price increases are <Col N="1629" /> being handed down to him.  He gets all the abuse and all the blame, but he is not in a position to explain to his clients&mdash;the people who deal with him &mdash;that he is no way responsible.  He may even be getting a smaller margin of profit.  Are we to take it, then, that the policy of the Government is that the least efficient, either in regard to tariffs or in regard to the distribution of essential goods, is to be taken as the determining factor?  If that is so, is it not quite clear&mdash;as, I think, it will be generally agreed&mdash;that those who have a huge turnover are in a position to buy in a large way in spite of their heavy overhead expenses and can get away with profits that not alone the Tánaiste but the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance used to describe in rather lurid language only a few years ago?  In fact, the Minister for Finance was very strong on the drapers in 1947.</P>
    <P>When the inter-Party Government put high up on its ten-point programme the reduction in the cost of living and the taxation of all unreasonable profitmaking, the Minister were very enthusiastic, one would have imagined, about undertaking this task.  It was very easy to blame the former Administration for high prices.  It was very easy to suggest that they were wholly responsible and that they were doing nothing about it.  The Ministers have had ample opportunties of remedying the distortion in the purchasing power of the £&mdash;which was one of the targets set before him by the Minister for Finance in 1948.  The £ was worth 8/- then: I do not know what, on that basis, it would be worth at the present time.  At a later stage, the Minister for Finance threatened to reimpose the excess profits tax unless he got a very speedy and substantial reduction in prices. Did he get these reductions?  That was in 1948.  He did not.  Did he reimpose the excess profits tax which he threatened would cut much deeper into the ill-gotten profits of all these manufacturers and distributors than anything that had been done under the previous Administration?  After 1948 we heard no more about the reintroduction of the tax on excess profits. <Col N="1630" /> It must be a matter of congratulation to the representatives of Labour in this State that the trade unionists are now contributing so substantially to the revenue from income-tax&mdash;that the net has been widened so much and so many thousands of new income-tax payers have been brought in&mdash;that the Minister can refer to the additional numbers he has brought into the net as one of the reasons for the buoyant revenue.</P>
    <P>It would be wearisome to go over all these past statements, but there is certainly one statement which must be put in conjunction with that which I already quoted, regarding the least efficient unit in the industry being regarded as a criterion for the tariff; and that is a statement by the Minister for Finance, as given in the Official Debates for the 25th May, 1948, column 2119, in which he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The community has paid too dearly for the industries that have been started, or for industries to start which an attempt has been made, easily to see them fade away. A lot of the people's money has gone to build up industries and gone, unfortunately, to give enhanced profits to the people who did not act in a spirit of patriotism when they were grabbing business.  I say that as regards some of them, not them all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have not heard from the Minister about these defaulters.  It was in the same speech that the Minister was so emphatic and so definite about what he was going to do if prices were not reduced.  He said, as given in column 2120 of the Official Debates:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I put forward as a reasonable point of view what I have said here, that it would be a better thing that they should go back to lower prices than that we should get the money by way of taxation.  We should leave it to them freely and decently to pass on this concession to the community through a reduction of prices.  They should now break down the prices freely, or a changed Government will meet the changed circumstances with regard to industrial tariffs.  They are no longer entitled to say that they <Col N="1631" /> must make money as fast as ever they can because a change of Government might mean a reduction in their profits.  We demand from them, then, a good, speedy and a considerable reduction in the prices of articles and if they do not give us that they will bring the other thing upon themselves.  I do not like going back to the excess profits tax.  I would much rather deal with the situation in the way I have described; but let these people labour under no mistake, because I am the only barrier between this House and the reimposition of the tax.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further on, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But if prices are not broken down, then all the arguments which have been used round the House must have their effect and the trading community must expect that there will be a move in this House to reimpose either the excess profits tax or some better form of it and the excess moneys which they are making will be taken from them.  I say a better form of the tax, because the standard set by the excess profits tax was a fictitious standard.  This standard was built up beyond which people were not allowed to go, but in effect people who were building up their business and who had not reached full capacity were taxed while it let people who had been profiteering before the war years get away with more money than they were in conscience entitled to.  There will not be an excess profits tax, but a tax that will cut deeper into the excessive profits which were made by those people during the war years and we will not be baulked by any artificial standard that was taken for the purpose of that tax.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister repeated that assurance more than once, that if prices did not come down the excess profits tax would be reimposed.  If we have the same amount of sincerity and honesty behind the proposal to set up the advisory committee, all for the sake of getting information, and on the basis that the system of price control cannot in fact be effective, then we are in exactly the same position as when the Minister promised to reintroduce this <Col N="1632" /> tax.  He had the opportunity.  He said he was no longer depending upon the public statements of accounts of firms with whose affairs he apparently had made himself familiar.  He presumably had more knowledge at his disposal as Minister for Finance and it was in all those circumstances that he made the statement to which I have referred.  I do not know whether, in view of those statements in the past, we can attach any greater measure of sincerity or honesty to the trumpetings that we have been hearing about the flour millers and fertiliser manufacturers. If these interests are exploiting the community, as is suggested by spokesmen of the Government, is this the way the Government is dealing with the situation or is the Minister for Agriculture thinking out a policy and a plan of his own?  He recommended nationalisation of certain industries to the country.  Are we looking for nationalisation, then, of certain industries to deal with basic essentials, or are we depending on the advisory committee? It is not merely in these matters that the Government have been found wanting.  It is at least a year ago since the Minister for Industry and Commerce, referring to the Inquiry on Flour and Bread, informed us&mdash;if my memory serves me arightthat the Government had then under consideration the recommendations of the committee.  I think he went on to say that some of these recommendations had already been carried into effect.  It was the same with regard to that other committee, the one dealing with restrictive practices in trade. It is at least a year ago since we were informed also that the Government had under consideration what they were going to do in that direction.</P>
    <P>The disbelief of the Minister for Finance and now of the Parliamentary Secretary in the efficiency of any system of price control is the greatest commentary and criticism of the proposal now before us.  The Government themselves do not believe it can be effected.  They will not even say it can be effective.  We must admire them at least for their candour.  Why then pretend to the country that in some miraculous way the setting up of this committee is going to lead to a reduction <Col N="1633" /> in prices, while the Central Bank and the Minister for Finance himself in a recent statement admit that the inflationary trends and the present situation in the world make it inevitable that there must be a certain increase? He contented himself by saying a &ldquo;not excessive increase.&rdquo;  We seem to have heard that before.</P>
    <P>We were told by the Minister for External affairs, in his rôle of financial expert, that money was losing its value.  He said, some time ago, that money was losing its value and that there would be a further and more substantial fall in the value of the £ internationally, and he dealt at length with the disastrous policy which was being pursued.  That was about the time our Government, following the example of the British, devalued the £.  We are now informed by the Central Bank that one of the results of that is that the terms of trade, which seemed to be turning in our favour in 1948 and 1949, are now turning against us.  They lay stress on the influence of our external trade on our economy, pointing out that with a high volume of exports a still higher volume will be necessary to pay for the high volume of imports required to maintain our present existing standard of living and if possible to increase it.  Our import excess, at £69 millions, the Central Bank said in their Report for last year, is four times the excess we had in 1938, and the proportion of our imports, which we are paying for by exports, is not likely to improve.  It it rather likely to decline.  The relatively favourable terms of trade in 1949, according to the Central Bank report, unfortunately proved transient. In 1939, they stated, our imports were 27 per cent. in excess by volume of the 1938 quantity, while our exports were 11 per cent. below the 1938 volume.</P>
    <P>They also dealt with the question of monetary circulation and having regard to the recent speech of the Minister for Finance it cannot be denied that increased monetary circulation, unless it is accompanied by an equivalent increase in the output of goods, will drive prices up still further.  It is claimed by the Government that production <Col N="1634" /> has increased very substantially. It is however admitted that agricultural production is only now achieving the position of being greater than, or perhaps equivalent to, the 1938 volume so that there is no justification for complacency regarding our position. If the Parliamentary Secretary is in a position to give us the figure I would like him to tell us how he computes that the increase in production generally and also the increase in production per man affects the position. It has been stated more than once by Government speakers that production per man has increased to such an extent that increases in remuneration can clearly be fairly expected.  If that is the position well and good, but I at any rate as one who gives whatever attention he can to these matters, have not been able to find any figures that would justify that contention.</P>
    <P>Far from benefiting the community equally and having the result which the Parliamentary Secretary claims of increasing the standard of living of all classes, we know that the 10 per cent. increase in consumption has not benefited many classes in the community, particularly the white collar workers in whom leading members of the Government used to be particularly interested in the halcyon days when they were in Opposition in 1947.  The Labour spokesmen claim that even those who have got the increase which the Minister claims should have compensated them up to the present at any rate for the increase in the cost of living have not yet attained that position.</P>
    <P>The argument that this country is comparable to Britain or that we are in the best of all possible worlds because we are better off, according to <i>Reynolds News,</i> than the British people are at the present time, gets us nowhere.  The trend of trade turned in our favour because we were producing food.  The world was short of food and it went to a very high price, and will probably remain at a high or a very high price for a considerable time to come.  Therefore, to compare this country which is a food exporting country with a surplus to a country like Great Britain, which has to import the <Col N="1635" /> greater part of its food requirements and is put to the pin of its collar to increase exports in order to pay for its food and raw materials, is not a good argument. Britain is not really a very good parallel for the Parliamentary Secretary to take.</P>
    <P>I believe that the increase in monetary circulation which according to the Central Bank has gone up by £3,500,000 this year as compared with 1949, the advances made by the banks which have also gone up by £3,000,000 over the same period, and Government expenditure which is now running at about £11,000,000 higher than it was last year, are all factors.  We need not go into the question of capital investment and all that, but whether one agrees or disagrees with the comments of the Central Bank which, in my opinion, are very moderate, and which take due cognisance of the difficulties the Government must have and the difficulties of the times, it is quite clear that the inflationary process is well on the way to full operation unless the Government takes some more definite and immediate steps than it has taken to ease the position.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I only wish to agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that there is no hope of a perfect system of price control.  Whatever the machinery may be, if price control concentrates on an examination of profits it will be found that the margins of profit are only one particular factor and not by any means the most important of the factors that go to make the selling price of goods.  There are many other factors. The difficulties are very great and if this were not merely a gesture with nothing behind it and if it would serve a useful purpose one would welcome it, but it is only another example of a Government which is all at sixes and sevens and in which no two members seem to be able to put forward the same policy to deal with the problems with which the people are faced.</P>
    <P>We have had outriders keeping off criticism from the Government carriage for the past two years and anxiously protecting it from the shafts and missiles which critics or opponents might be prepared to hurl; but now the outriders <Col N="1636" /> are more conspicuous by their absence.  The carriage itself seems to be rather creaking under the strain that has been put upon it.  The road it has to travel, I hope, will not be too difficult for it to make progress upon, but even if it is a reasonably good road I am afraid that the carriage is such a creaking one that it will not survive and that the wheels and finally the lynch pin will fall out of the vehicle before it gets very far.</P>

      <P>I could fully understand the negative and obstructionist attitude adopted by Deputy Lemass not alone in this but on equally important matters if he happened to be one of the new recruits thrown up as a result of the fury of the last general election, but Deputy Lemass, as somebody else has pointed out, has been a member of this House for a large number of years and has had the experience-and it is a unique experience&mdash;of being Minister for Industry and Commerce for 16 years.  Deputy Lemass claimed -and I admit he was right-that the machinery set up for the control of prices was established during his period of office.  If we are confronted with the situation with which the country is confronted to-day, in which there is a rising and rapid increase in the price of essential commodities, it is due to the failure of the Fianna Fáil machine.  I want any Deputy on the Fianna Fáil side who speaks after me to say whether that is so or not.  I am admitting that the machinery is the machinery set up by Fianna Fáil and it has proved ineffective, has proved to be a failure, in maintaining effective control over the prices of essential commodities.  I want to know from Deputy Lemass, or from those of his lieutenants who may follow me, whether, if they were still in office, they would do anything to face up to the situation which confronts the Government other than allow things to go in the direction which they have been going so rapidly, a wrong direction, during the past five or six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would Deputy Lemass or Deputy Kissane say that they were in a position to foresee devaluation when they were put out of office in February, <Col N="1637" /> 1948, or the possible effects of devaluation on the price of the raw material we have to import and will have to continue to import for the maintenance of our manufacturing industries? Would Deputy McGrath, who sees further than even Deputy Lemass sees&mdash;I am sure he would make that claim&mdash;say that, in February, 1948, he could have foreseen the Korean war, the possible effects of that war on the price of raw materials, as a result of the gambling of the middlemen Jewmen in buying up wool on the international market and the possible effect of that kind of racketeering activity?  I am sure he would not.</P>
    <P>Some of us who sit on this side and who make no apology for supporting the Government or for giving our support now in putting things right cannot forget what happened before Fianna Fáil were put out of office by the free will of the majority of the members of the Dáil in February, 1948.  In October, 1947, Deputy de Valera, who was then Taoiseach, announced that there was to be a general election in the early part of the following year.  On the 15th October, we had a long discussion on the control of prices and earnings, related, as it was supposed to be related, to the previously introduced Industrial Efficiency and Prices Bill.  Deputy de Valera, dealing with prices, profits and wages-and he dealt exhaustively and pretty clearly with all these matterssaid:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government is not giving any guarantee that the cost of living may not rise.  It is proposing to reduce it now and will endeavour to keep it down by subsidising certain products, but it cannot commit itself indefinitely that there will not be a rise or that any rise that may occur will be completely compensated by way of increases in remuneration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He went on in the usual kid-glove fashion, in very plausible style, to advise the trade unions and labour leaders of the day to meet his highlyefficient Minister for Industry and Commerce, the man responsible for the price control machinery which has failed&mdash;and I assert that it has failed completely-and suggested that they <Col N="1638" /> should get in touch with employers' federations, giving them every encouragement and advice, in the language which he only is capable of using, in the matter of trying to arrive at an understanding.  Then he took off the kid gloves and tells them what they will get, in equally plain language, if they do not come to that agreement which he so eloquently advocated. Dealing with the possible failure to agree on a policy of the stabilisation of wages, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government regards this temporary limitation of wage increases as vitally necessary in present circumstances, and if the trade unions cannot undertake such an agreement as I have outlined, either because there is not unanimity amongst them or because their rules prevent the union executives entering into firm commitments of this nature, then the Government will produce proposals for legislation to the same effect.  To avoid possible misunderstanding, I should say here that, if such legislation is necessary, it will relate to wage rates prevailing on this date, October 15th.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>How could any Labour Deputy with an understanding of the meaning of the programme and policy of the Labour Party, whether the National Labour Party or Irish Labour Party Deputies of that day, forget these words, knowing from previous experience of dealing with the Fianna Fáil Government from the day they came in in 1932, if there was anything certain in political life, it was that Deputy de Valera, as Taoiseach, was a man who would do what he said he would do.  There is no man or group of men in the Fianna Fáil Party, as time has proved, capable of standing up and challenging, within that Party, the policy of Deputy de Valera.</P>
    <P>We knew perfectly well when we assembled after the general election in February, 1948, the dose of medicine we were going to get for ourselves and our supporters, if we used our votes to put Deputy de Valera back into power again.  We knew we were going to get what he had promised.  We knew that he did not promise, and he made <Col N="1639" /> it very clear that he was not promising, to stabilise the prices of essential commodities, and we knew from previous experience of his lieutenant, Deputy Lemass, who, during the greater portion of the emergency, had crucified and penalised the workers and their dependents, through the agency of the infamous Wages Standstill Order, that we would have that again.  Does Deputy McGrath, or, if I may so style him, Deputy Pa McGrath-he is so popular that that is his title to his friends&mdash;challenge the accuracy of my interpretation of those words?</P>

      <P>Deputy de Valera, Junior, had the audacity to say-I hope his father will correct him, in private, if he wishes&mdash;that, when they were in power, they stabilised the cost of living.  I am sure the consumers are not going to swallow that.  We make no apology for sitting on this side of the House supporting a Government which has not, and I hope never will, so long as we support them, bring in a wages standstill Order, if they ever have to do it, without, at the same time, bringing in a standstill Order in respect of the prices of essential commodities. On the question of such a standstill Order, I want to say in the most emphatic way that this group hopes that, when this measure comes into operation, the first step taken by the Government will be to have a standstill Order on the prices of essential commodities.</P>
      <P>Since this Government came into office&mdash;and Deputy McGrath has had something to say about this to my disadvantage; he has misrepresented me in this matter&mdash;this Government has gone a good deal of the way to narrow the gap between real wages and real prices.  Deputy McGrath knows perfectly well that if his Party came back they would reimpose the wages standstill Order, under which workers could not legally look for or secure any increase in the wages they were receiving on 15th October, 1947.  Is that a fact, or does the Deputy challenge the accuracy of that statement?</P>

      <P>Since this Government came into power the wages of all classes of workers, agricultural and industrial, have been increased by a considerable amount.  The wages of road workers, forestry workers, agricultural workers and of every section of workers, have been increased.  In that way, they have benefited to some extent, and so the gap between real wages and prices has been considerably reduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>At one stage it might have been correct to say&mdash;I could not prove it because I am not an economist or a statistician&mdash;that the gap had been narrowed down to a very small figure.  The effect of the figures and statistical information before us at the present time, as well as the recent rapid increase in the price of essential commodities, is to lead one to the conclusion that to-day there is a gap of anything from 15 to 20 per cent. as between real wages and wages as they stood at September, 1939.  On the other hand, according to the figures furnished to Deputies by the Department of Finance and the information given in reply to parliamentary questions, as well as that to be obtained from the revenue returns which I am sure are very carefully studied and swallowed by Deputy McGrath and Deputy Kissane and the Deputies sitting on that side of the House, profits have increased by 25 per cent. as compared with 1947.  That is an interesting figure for the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party in view of the fact that, about a year before they left office, they wiped out the excess profits tax and never gave any solid reason for doing so.  By wiping out that tax, they placed in the pockets of profiteering manufacturers and middlemen a sum of about £2,000,000 a year which, I suggest, could have been used by a democratic and Christian-minded Government to increase the small allowances that were then being paid to the aged, the blind, the infirm, the <Col N="1641" /> widows and orphans, and other sections of the community.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowan used figures here this evening to prove that the costs of essential commodities have been increased within the last 12 months apparently without effective action or intervention on the part of the Department of Industry and Commerce. I can confirm that because I was with Deputy Cowan and others at the talks which took place in Leinster House a short time ago in connection with these matters.  I can produce documentary evidence to prove that the figures which Deputy Cowan quoted this evening are quite correct. I want to know from the Parliamentary Secretary what steps, if any, were taken by the Department of Industry and Commerce to deal with the people responsible for putting up prices to such an extent in regard, say, to wool and blankets.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowan quoted the price of wool and did so correctly.  From the figures which he quoted there is clear proof that, in some cases, prices have gone up by 110 per cent. as compared with October, 1949.  He quoted the prices charged by the manufacturer and the wholesaler for blankets manufactured from all Irish wool.  He quoted the price of the &ldquo;Ossory&rdquo; blanket, which is manufactured from all Irish wool.  The wieght of this blanket is 5 lbs.  The price per pair in January, 1950, was 35/-; the wholesale price was 40/-, and the retail price 50/-.  At the end of last month, that is October of this year, the price charged by the manufacturer for it was 75/-, or in other words 40/- more than the manufacturer charged for it in January of this year.  At the end of October, the wholesale price had gone up to 89/2 and the retail price to 111/8.  In other words, the retail price was allowed to go up from 50/- per pair in January last to 111/8 at the end of October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another Irish blanket of the same weight which in the trade is known as the &ldquo;Lucan&rdquo; blanket.  The manufacturer's price for it in January, <Col N="1642" /> 1950, was 32/11, the wholesale price 37/11, and the retail price 47/6.  At the end of October last&mdash;a month ago&mdash; the manufacturer's price of it had gone up to 70/-, the wholesale price to 80/10, and the retail price to 101/3. The &ldquo;Confederate Union&rdquo; blanket, another all Irish wool blanket of the same weight, was being sold by the manufacturer in January of this year at 37/1, the wholesale price then was 42/8, and the retail price 53/4.  At the end of October last, the manufacturer's price was 60/-, the wholesale price 69/-, and the retail price 86/3.</P>
    <P>I am entitled to ask, and to insist on getting an answer to my question from the Parliamentary Secretary, either in this House or in writing, what procedure was adopted by the manufacturers concerned to enable them to get these huge increases in prices in the case of blankets manufactured from all Irish wool.  There is no question of Australian wool in regard to these blankets.  They have been manufactured wholly from Irish wool.</P>
    <P>There has also been an increase in the price of knitting wool which, again, is made from all Irish wool.  Prices have been going up since October of last year.  Knitting wool is sold in 8lb. lots.  In October, 1949, it was being sold at 48/-; in December, 1949, the price was 53/8.  There were two increases in price in that month, and so it rose to 55/3.  In January, 1950, the price was 56/6; July, 1950, it was 62/6; September, 1950, the price was 67/9; October, 1950, the price was 79/1, and in November, 1950, the price stood at 90/5.</P>
    <P>I think that, as a responsible Deputy, I am entitled to know what machinery, if any, was adopted for the purpose of securing sanction for these rapid increases in price in the case of commodities which are used in every home in the country.  Am I going to be told that there was no effective control? If there was not, what is going to be done about it?  I suggest that, as well as having a standstill Order on existing prices in the case of these commodities, which are essential in the homes of both rich and poor, there should also be a judicial inquiry, if necessary, to ascertain what is the justification, if any, for these rapid increases <Col N="1643" /> in the price of commodities manufactured from raw materials produced in our own country.</P>
    <P>Can I be told, for instance, what percentage, if any, of the increased prices secured by the manufacturers from the wholesalers for these blankets and knitting wool, was passed back to the producer, who is the Irish farmer?  I think that all of us would be deeply interested to know how much of the &ldquo;rake off&rdquo; has gone back to the producer.  If I personally could be satisfied that a big portion of the increase was passed back to the home producer, to the farmer, then I would accept that as some explanation, at any rate, of what appears to me to be the unjustifiably excessive increase in the price of these commodities inside a period of 12 months.</P>
    <P>I have before me a report of a meeting of the Federation of Irish Manufacturers which was suddenly summoned and held on the 24th November immediately after this Bill was introduced.  The meeting was held in the Shelbourne Hotel, and was addressed by the chairman of that very important body which is supposed to include in its membership all the leading manufacturers in this State.  Mr. Frank Hugh O'Donnell, the present president of the Federation of Manufacturers, who is a life-long political and personal friend of Deputy Lemass, is quoted as follows: &ldquo;He attributed the increased prices to the rise in costs of raw materials.  Wool and cotton, which form the basis of the textile industry, had to be bought on a world market where the Irish industrialists had no control over the prices.&rdquo;  Mr. Frank Hugh O'Donnell knows well that the articles which I quoted these prices in connection with have nothing whatever to do with raw material that is purchased in foreign markets.  None of the Australian wool, which may be used in the manufacture of blankets and by firms in the textile industry in this country, since the price went up so high has yet reached this country and is not likely to reach it for a long time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass, who spoke with his tongue in his cheek, Deputy Briscoe, his very able deputy lieutenant, and Deputy childers, who was at one time <Col N="1644" /> the paid secretary of the Federation of Manufacturers, know all these things better than I do.  These figures have been placed before members of the Fianna Fáil Party in the same way as they were placed before the members of Parties on this side of the House. There is no use in saying that they are not aware of them.  I challenged Deputy Childers, when he was speaking last night, on this question, of the rapid increase in the price of blankets. With that peculiarly innocent face of his, he pretended not to know what I was talking about and suggested that I did not know what I was talking about. But now I am giving the figures and facts to prove that I do know what I am talking about.  I would ask Deputy McGrath, if he speaks after me, to defend the line of neutrality which Fianna Fáil is taking on this whole matter.</P>

      <P>I am in the habit of having very friendly conversations with Deputy McGrath outside the House and I apologise if I have attempted to bring that procedure into the precincts of the House.  I want to know from Deputy McGrath, Deputy Kissane, or any Fianna Fáil Deputy whether they admit these figures; whether they admit also that it is the operation of the Fianna Fáil price control machine which has failed to curb prices or to <Col N="1645" /> keep them within reasonable limits. If they do admit this failure of the Fianna Fáil price control machine, what practical proposition have they to put before the House as an alternative to the proposals in this Bill? What alternative are they willing to put before the House in the name of the people they speak for, in the name of the workers they claim to speak for, that will help to solve this problem?</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass secured the votes of thousands of workers and the wives of workers when seeking election to this House in the constituency of Dublin South City.  He secured those votes under cover of certain promises. Would he have got up on any platform in Dublin South City during the progress of the last election and do what in effect he is doing in this House&mdash; trying under cover of a policy of neutrality to protect the rights of the people who are trying to fleece the public and not the rights of the working-class people whose votes he secured when seeking election to this House?  He has got to take a straight-forward line on this matter.  The Government are proposing the continuance of a Bill which is absolutely essential, which is known to Deputy Lemass to be essential, and the only objection he has to it is that the Government are taking additional steps by creating this price control advisory machinery to control prices in future because the Fianna Fáil price control machine has failed miserably to carry out the intentions for which, I suppose, it was established by Deputy Lemass and the Fianna Fáil Party when in office.</P>
      <P>Anybody who has any doubt as to the question of profiteering in certain lines, whether they be on the Opposition side or this side of the House, surely can see in the annual report and balance sheets of some of the manufacturing concerns where bonus shares have been issued in many cases during the past couple of years.  The issue of bonus shares is surely convincing evidence that there are more than ordinary profits being earned by the companies concerned.</P>

      <P>I was very surprised to hear the Parliamentary Secretary say that the price control machinery&mdash;I am quoting his words&mdash;has worked reasonably well.  I am certainly not prepared to admit that.  The figures which I have quoted should be accepted as convincing evidence that the price control machinery, if there is any such thing as effective machinery, has failed to operate in the way that I am sure it was originally intended to operate by those responsible for its introduction.  I should like to be told by the Parliamentary Secretary what is the normal procedure adopted by firms who feel they have a case to make for an increased price for essential commodities. For instance, what was the procedure adopted by the people who were able to get authority&mdash;I am assuming they did get authority&mdash;to increase these prices?  Do they submit a written application to the Department?  Are they summoned personally before the officers in charge of the section responsible for dealing with prices?  Is anybody else brought in and consulted in connection with those prices?  For instance, I should like to know whether the wholesalers were brought in and consulted before the manufacturers were allowed to get away with this huge increase in the price of knitting wool and blankets. Was there any other representative body or any body representing the consumers brought in and consulted? If not, it is easy to understand how they were able to get away with this business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cowan referred to the fact that there was a shortage of blankets in certain city business houses and in business houses in other parts of the country during the past few months. I am in the position to state and to prove-this information was given to the Parliamentary Secretary in another way a few weeks ago&mdash;that <Col N="1647" /> one well-known gentleman who runs a family concern in the southern portion of the country could not get authority to sell blankets at the price he thought he was entitled to get, and cancelled the existing contracts.  What did he do then?  He sold the blankets he had on hands manufactured out of raw material purchased at a reasonable price; he sold them to other gentlemen, who went out hawking them around the country.  He got his own whack out of them.  Surely there should be some machinery at the disposal of the Department of Industry and Commerce for dealing with that type of racketeering.  I know another manufacturer; one would expect much more from this particular manufacturer; he claims to be a leading man in Church matters and a model man in other respects; he had a contract for blankets at a certain figure with a certain firm in this city.  When he saw the price go up in Australia he or his advisers had a brainwave and he went in and demanded a considerable increase on the original contract price, and he said he would not complete the contract unless he got this increased price.  Should that be allowed by this or any other Government?  Surely there should be some machinery set up, if it is not in existence at the moment, to stop that kind of racketeering at the expense of the community and particularly of the poorer sections of the community.  I happen to know that what Deputy Cowan said here is a positive fact; the St. Vincent de Paul Society, which looks after the interests of the poorer sections of the people of this city, had contracts with several firms for the supply of blankets at this particular time of the year.  But they could not get a blanket in a house in the city that has 2,518 retail customers in the country.</P>
    <P>I am not making these statements for the first time in this House.  I made them elsewhere and I think it is our duty on both sides of the House to join together and put our heads together to see that this objectionable practice is stopped once and for all. There is no use in Deputies on this <Col N="1648" /> side of the House supporting a policyand I do not believe that we have been supporting such a policy&mdash;of wages chasing prices and wages never catching up on prices.  What we really want is a standstill Order on prices, and that immediately.  Any increases that have occurred in recent times should be reviewed by the body that is going to be established under Section 3 of this Bill.  That is a reasonable proposition.</P>
    <P>If the Deputies on the other side of the House have a better one, we shall be glad to have it.  But your attitude is purely negative and obstructionist on this matter as it has been on other matters of policy during the last three or four months.  There is no use in pretending, as Deputy Childers pretended, with his gentlemanly innocent-looking face, that he did not know anything about these prices.  The exsecretary of the Federation of Irish Manufacturers who, to my knowledge, is in daily touch with almost every section of that federation and is also carrying on a business himself which he is quite entitled to do, is not so innocent as his face would make him appear to be.  If Deputy Lemass and Deputy Briscoe, and Deputy Briscoe knows more about this business than Deputy Lemass, and Deputy Kissane and the other Fianna Fáil Deputies are not prepared to stand up here and admit that this has been going on and has been allowed to go on and cannot be stopped because of the ineffective price control machinery set up by the Fianna Fáil Government and if the Fianna Fáil Deputies cannot see their way to support the proposal contained in this Bill, we are entitled to ask in the name of the workers who gave such a large number of votes to Fianna Fáil Deputies, including Deputy Lemass, in the last general election, what is their alternative to the present Bill?</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin now has the power himself to see that these things are examined.  He and his Party are now in the position that they can dictate to the Government, and insist that these things are properly examined, and that the wholesale profiteering, which he maintains is taking place under this Government, is <Col N="1649" /> brought to an end.  He has admitted that huge scale profiteering has been going on.  He is a supporter of this Government.  He says he speaks on behalf of the workers.  I do not believe he is speaking on behalf of the majority of the workers.</P>

      <P>If you say you did not make it, then I withdraw it.  I am sorry to say that thousands of the workers were foolish enough to vote for this Government and for the Labour Party.  What I cannot understand are the two voices with which Labour speaks: the voice of Labour defending the attitude of this Government and the voice of Labour defending the attitude of the Government towards the cost of living, especially during the past 12 months.  The Labour Party cannot see that this Government did anything wrong at all. But the workers outside can see it, and the workers outside who are organised in their trade unions have compelled their representatives here to change their attitude a bit during the past week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I reminded Deputy Davin on a former occasion, he spoke in this House a few weeks after the congresses of the trade unions had stated that they were giving notice that they intended to break the wage agreement and he said that the cost of living, since this Government took office, was more than counterbalanced by the increase in wages.  I quoted that immediately after he made the statement. It may have been a slip on his part, but he did not deny it.  It was a sharp attack on both trade union congresses when they, after deliberation, decided that they were going to break the wage agreement made in 1948.  He speaks now of the standstill <Col N="1650" /> Order on wages during the emergency. If there was a standstill Order there was at the same time an increase in the cost-of-living bonus to the extent of 16s. per week, something which some Deputies are now inclined to forget. As one Deputy said last night, they are not unmindful of the fact that since this Government came into office they have got an increase of 11/-.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing: Deputy McGrath would never make a statement like that made by the Minister for Agriculture, when devaluation came, that there would be no increase in the price of maize despite devaluation.  Deputy McGrath would not make a stupid statement like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Did not the Minister for Agriculture put a limit on it at that time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have made a stupid statement like that.  The Minister for Finance talked about the excess corporation profits tax and about Fianna Fáil having taken off that tax the year before they went out of office.  We heard a good deal of talk <Col N="1651" /> about that tax from Deputy Davin, Deputy Larkin and Deputy Connolly the first year this Government was in power, but the fact remains that that particular tax has never been reimposed. Why has it not been reimposed? The Government has the power to reimpose it.  It is their fault if profiteering is taking place to the extent they say it is.  The Labour Party has the power to make the Government reimpose that tax or else get out.  But, as the Minister for Agriculture said on one occasion, they are now as quiet as mice.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also spoke of what the Government did for the old age pensioners and the blind pensioners.  It is true that they increased the old age pension by half a crown a week but Fianna Fáil increased the expenditure on all social services from £2,000,000 to £12,000,000.  I can also tell the Deputy what the Government did for the old age pensioners and the blind pensioners in Cork under the cheap fuel scheme this year.  The Government sent a letter to the Cork Corporation telling them that they should use hand-won turf for the scheme as machine-won turf was too dear.  When the corporation invited tenders for machinewon turf and hand-won turf, they told them to use hand-won turf because there was only a limited amount of money in the fund and the use of machine-won turf would run out the funds too quickly.</P>
      <P>They told these people in Cork that they could use the turf that had been exposed to all sorts of weather in Cork Park for the last two or three years. It took a contractor with ten men three and a half hours to pick out sufficient dry sods to make one lorry load of turf.  These are the people who claim that they are doing so much for the old age pensioners and the blind. When Fianna Fáil were in power, even in the worst years, under the cheap fuel scheme the people got machine-won turf.  Why is it that the Government are now trying to confine the poor to hand-won turf?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know anything about the profit in blankets, but if the facts are as quoted by Deputy Davin I am <Col N="1652" /> whole-heartedly behind him in saying that some remedy should be provided. He has much more power than I have now to prevent profiteering, but I did hear the Minister for Industry and Commerce state in this House a short time ago that the farmers were getting more for the wool of a sheep now than they were getting for the whole sheep when Fianna Fáil were in power, so I take it that the price of wool must have gone up in the country.  My idea of the handling of the cost-of-living problem is that the Government treated the whole thing as a joke until the last week or so.  I can tell the House that the replies given here last week had a very serious effect, even amongst supporters of the Government down the country.  People know the effect of the cost of living on their limited purses. They look back to the reply given by the Taoiseach a few months ago in this House when asked by Deputy Cowan to name some of the articles the price of which had been reduced, and to indicate what effective steps the Government had taken to reduce the cost of living.  The Taoiseach then gave a list of commodities of which the price had been reduced and it included such things as laminated springs, concrete pipes, nuts and bolts.  I can assure the House that the people in my part of the country do not eat these things. It might be soon enough to eat them if we had an iron ration.</P>
    <P>The fact is that this Government came into power as a result of promises to reduce the cost of living.  They set up an inquiry into flour milling and the cost of the manufacture of flour and bread two and a half years ago but we have not heard the report of that inquiry yet.  Now, of course, when they see the way things are going, they are getting quite panicky and they know they have to do something. Therefore, they propose to set up another inquiry and I suppose it will be another two and a half years before we hear the result of it.  A number of items have been brought to my notice by workers&mdash;mind you, a few workers support me too&mdash;which add to the cost of living.  One of the first things in which there was an increase&mdash;it might <Col N="1653" /> be a small increase but still it was an increase&mdash;was in the contributions paid by workers to national health insurance and unemployment insurance. Without getting any increased benefits at all, the workers have to hand over an additional 6d. a week.</P>
    <P>The workers in Cork also realise what the increase in bus fares means for themselves and their children. During the time that Fianna Fáil was in office, the children were carried to and from school for 1d. per head each way.  They are now charged 2d. per head for most of the journeys.  It has been calculated that, for a man who has four children attending school, the increase spread over five days of the week amounts to 6/8.  It is costing him 13/4 to send his four children to and from school as owing to the fact that there is a midday break, a double journey is involved for these children. Most of the workers in Cork too have to travel to their work on buses because of the fact that all our Governments believed that housing schemes should be started only in good healthy areas and that the workers should be taken out of the slums where they lived during the British régime here. While we are all in thorough agreement with that, we must realise that the increase in bus fares affected the workers' budget very seriously.  As I have already stated, a man sending four children to school has to expend 13/4 a week on bus fares alone for these children.  Then there are many working in Cork City who have to travel in from Crosshaven, Carrigaline and other outlying districts.  These workers take weekly tickets which they are allowed to use for six days.  Formerly, if a worker fell sick he was allowed for the day on which he did not use the ticket, that is to say, he was not obliged to take the ticket for six days consecutively but, now, if a worker is sick and does not use his ticket on a particular day, he is not allowed for that as the six days user of the ticket must run consecutively. That is another matter that adds to the cost of living for workers who have to travel in from Crosshaven, Carrigaline, Cobh and other places.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there is anybody who has any doubt that the cost of <Col N="1654" /> clothing has practically doubled in the last three years.  The cost of fuel has also gone up and in many cases it is very inferior fuel.  The cost of gas and electricity has also increased considerably. Rents have gone up.  Workers in corporation houses have now to pay rents of from £1 to 25/- per week.  I am not saying that that is the fault of the Government; that is an increase that would have arisen no matter what Government was in power, but efforts are being made to persuade the people that the cost of living has not gone up when, in fact, you have these all-round increases.  We know that the Government got into power on a promise that they would reduce the cost of living. They got votes from people who had formerly supported Fianna Fáil because they said that Fianna Fáil had been extravagant and that, in consequence, the cost of living had gone up.  The facts were that Fianna Fáil had reduced the price of tea from 4/10 per lb. to 2/8 a lb.  They also reduced the price of sugar and of bread.  Despite what Deputy Davin said, in regard to Deputy de Valera's statement about the standstill Order on wages, I think the majority of the people on that side of the House always claimed that Fianna Fáil were put out because they increased the price of the pint of porter.  If Fianna Fáil increased the price of the pint of porter, they did so in order to reduce the price of the loaf and the price of sugar and tea, which the working man had to purchase to maintain his family.  If the same question arose again, I would be in favour of doing the same thing.  The price of whiskey has gone up now.  We were told then that a glass of whiskey a day was necessary for an old man or an invalid.  There is no talk of the increase now.</P>

      <P>2/6.  If Fianna Fáil had been in for the last three years, the old age pensioners would have got more than 2/6.  Fianna Fáil realise that the old age pensioner wants an increase as well as the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter which I regard as being serious and which any <Col N="1655" /> man with a family would regard as serious, that is, the cost of boot repairs.  A man with a young family knows what boot repairs cost.  I have been supplied with figures by the Cork Boot Repairers' Association.  They tell me that in 1947 leather was 3/2 a lb., and that in 1950 it is 5/2 a lb. They had other concessions in 1947 if they bought a bale of leather, which I will not go into now.  It costs 11/- in Cork City to have a pair of boots soled and heeled.  That is a big increase on about 6/6.  I was informed to-day by a member of my own Party that leather and boots are not controlled. That is another fancy method that this Government have.  If they see that a commodity will increase in price, such as bacon and the list of commodities which Deputy Lemass gave, and if they see that they cannot stop that increase taking place, they take off the control.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputy Davin and any other Labour Deputy that the workers are watching things very closely.  They are watching the attitude of the Labour Deputies here in defending the cost of living for the past 12 months.  There has been a slight change within the past week, and I think the local elections had a small say in that matter.</P>

      <P>I have been speaking at length about the cost of living.  I will now give an idea of the cost of dying.  Take the case of a member of a worker's family who goes into hospital now, and see what is the cost of dying or of trying not to die.  The Minister for Health has ordered voluntary hospitals and the local authorities that they must charge £4 4s. a week for a bed in a hospital.  It was £2 2s. That is a very serious thing for a member of a worker's family.</P>

      <P>The pint was cheaper to the people and they thought more of it.  We passed the Bill.  We were told to-day that a certain thing could not be carried out because there were no plans. Apparently, if Fianna Fáil had not planned a thing, it could not be carried out by this Government.  We were told to-day that there were no plans for a new cement factory.  That is the excuse that was given for not setting up a new cement factory.  The workers can thank Fianna Fáil for the cement factories because if there had been no cement factories, there would be very little housing.</P>
      <P>The worker's wife now has to pay, first, for her ration allowance and then she has to estimate how much she will get at the black market price fixed by the Government, and I can tell you that she has not much left then.  Every morning that the worker's wife goes out she has to do a lot more studying than anyone studying stocks and shares.  She has to go from one place to another to find what has gone up and what has gone down.  Every day in the week there is a rise in prices and apparently there is no notice at all taken.</P>
      <P>There is another matter which affects many workers and which was referred to by Deputy Derrig, that is, income-tax. Many workers claim that when they got the 11/- increase in wages they lost money because up to that they had not been liable for income-tax but had to pay income-tax then.  I know tradesmen in the building trades who were working in Dublin and who threw up their jobs because of the amount of income-tax they would have to pay.</P>

I know workers who were better off before they got the 11/- increase than they were afterwards.</P>
      <P>We have Labour Deputies here who defend this Government.  No matter what the Government did, they were right.  We do not hear anything now about the malnutrition that the people in Cork are suffering from.  That used to be a very popular phrase at one time with a certain Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave an instance of how they treated the poor and the blind.  I can assure these Deputies that when the workers get an opportunity they will let them know the effect of their attitude here in defending this cost-of-living business so completely. The effect on the people of the cost of living was completely ignored until last week, when they were forced to do something about it.  The suggestion is that they would get inspectors to go around and survey the budgets of various families and to have a report in 1952.  One would think that Ministers, and Deputies who support them, had not to pay for things in their own households and could not tell the cost of them.  Surely any Minister knows what the cost of living is.  If he does not, his wife knows or somebody in his household knows.  The whole policy in this matter, as in everything that was set up by this Government, is delaying tactics, filling time from day to day. Commissions have been set up on emigration, education and other things and we are kept here from year to year. The Labour people are quite satisfied, but I can assure them that their followers are not satisfied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We have listened to Deputy McGrath voicing the views of the Opposition with regard to this problem of rising prices.  I would like to dismiss Deputy McGrath's speech by saying this, that if the <Col N="1658" /> Deputy thinks he or his Party are ever again going to command the support and the confidence of the workers of Ireland they have another think coming to them.</P>
      <P>In view of the tone of the Opposition in this debate, it is proper that the House should consider the difference in the approach by this Government and by the former Government to this problem of rising prices.  It is a serious problem, a problem which has an impact on every citizen in the country.  The former Government, rightly or wrongly, but presumably from the best of motives, decided, when the problem became acute in the early days of the emergency, that the one way to deal with it was to freeze incomes.  If that had been carried out it might have saved the situation, but the complaint made, particularly by workers here, was that that particular policy was carried out only partially and it was carried out only in relation to the incomes, easily ascertained, of the working people.  There were standstill Orders stabilising wages strictly enforced, so strictly enforced indeed that many employers and companies desiring to increase the wages of their workers were prohibited from doing so.</P>
      <P>At the same time there were&mdash;and there is no secret about this&mdash;large sections of our people who were permitted by the former Government, by their indolence and negligence, to amass considerable profits at a time of shortages and rising prices.  Nevertheless, we hear in this debate Fianna Fáil Deputies prattling about their concern for the workers of this country. I do not claim to be a manual worker, to be a wage earner, but I would back my knowledge of the workers far higher than that of any Deputy on the benches opposite.  They may as well accept this, that they have forfeited for all time the confidence of the small people by reason of their complacent disregard of them and their rights throughout the long years of the emergency. We heard poor young Deputy de Valera, who came here yesterday evening behaving like a hired clown in a circus, talking about rising prices.</P>

      <P>Deputy de Valera talked about food prices.  I think there should be some sense of reality in this House from time to time.  We heard him talk about food prices, the prices which the ordinary person has to pay for the food he eats at each meal.  Deputy de Valera represents a city constituency, but I noticed when he spoke that an uneasy expression came upon the faces of the country Deputies in his Party who have been endeavouring for many months here to convince the farmers that under this Government their <Col N="1660" /> prices were depressed and their industry destroyed.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera talked in a complaining tone about the price of farmers' butter.  As a result of this Government's policy, the price of farmers' butter has increased.  That had to come from a Fianna Fáil Deputy&mdash;an extraodinary admission made in relation to one commodity.  I wonder does Deputy de Valera recollect that Deputy Smith, Deputy Corry and Deputy Donnchadh Ó Briain, who has just left the House, came here time and time again trying to convince the Minister for Agriculture that, by decontrolling farmers' butter, he had brought poverty and hardship to every farmer's wife, that they could not get a reasonable price for their product and that their little trade was destroyed?</P>
      <P>We have been told repeatedly by the Opposition that this little side-line which used to be an economic asset in every farmer's home has been destroyed by this Government and then we hear from Deputy de Valera as regards farmers' butter that those who sell it are enjoying an era of prosperity which they never experienced at any other time.</P>
      <P>That was a noteworthy admission, and I am proud that that is the fact, because I think the sooner we realise that we are not acting in the national interest if we endeavour to cut down on agricultural produce, the better for all of us.  The prices which the farmer gets for the things he sells to people in the cities and elsewhere are in turn shared by people in the towns and cities, and all benefit by an expanding agricultural prosperity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Fianna Fáil criticism of this Government is confined to the price of food alone then I think that their entire case fails because better food prices, guaranteed food prices will mean prosperity in agriculture, and thereby every individual in the nation will benefit.  I do not for a moment think that this problem of rising prices &mdash;I would be the first to concede that it exists&mdash;relates merely to food.  If it did then I think the situation would not be one to cause much anxiety in this House.  There is undoubtedly at the present time a situation beginning <Col N="1661" /> to develop in which this and other countries in Western Europe are going through an economic blizzard.  The ordinary people here do appreciate that while some variations, some exceptions, did exist, generally speaking, up to recent months prices here were more or less stabilised.  Up to recent months the £ which each of us had in our pocket, which each of us earned, was beginning slowly but surely to increase in value.  Up to June or July of this year slowly but surely the real value of the income each of us enjoyed, whether as wage earner or salary earner was slowly but surely beginning to increase in value.  The Government was not responsible entirely for that situation, but it played an important part in achieving it.</P>
    <P>The people generally have been appreciative of the fact that, in the past two and a half years, from February 1948, the monetary income of every person in this country has been increased.  Whether he be the lowliest worker or otherwise, the income of every person has been increased and, at the same time, prices have been stabilised.  Given normal conditions externally, given the degree of peace which we were entitled to expect, given normal international commerce, that situation would have continued to develop until we would have reached a stage in which we might have arrived at parity between real and monetary values.  Unfortunately, a break has come in that developing situation.  As a result of the economic decision taken by the British Treasury last September 12 months to devalue the £, which we have here as our money, and as a result of the international situation which has developed from the Korean war which commenced last June, a situation has been brought about in which we in this country&mdash;and it applies to every other country in Western Europe, too&mdash;must face a period of rising prices.  The delayed effects of devaluation would in themselves have created a serious economic problem for this country.  Naturally, the lowering of the value of our currency must mean that where we buy from hard currency countries we have to pay <Col N="1662" /> more for the same quantity of goods as we got formerly for less money.</P>

Is there going to be any machinery in the mean-time to put a stop to the spivs of commercial and industrial enterprises from fattening like leeches on the consuming and purchasing public?  I quite agree with the Deputy that an increase is going to come but what about the increase that has come?</P>

      <P>I am dealing now with a situation which has contributed&mdash;I do not say it is completely the reason for it&mdash;to rising prices here.  It is true to say, on the question of devaluation, and anyone can recognise that where we, as we had to, devalue our £, and where we have to buy from America, Switzerland and other hard currency countries, we have to pay more in sterling for the same goods and the same quantity of them than we did formerly.  Luckily, by reason of wise administration of this nation's affairs, in September, 1949, we carried a large stock of necessary materials here.  This Government has never fallen into the situation permitted under the former Government where at any particular time, we might be caught short with regard to supplies. Luckily, most of our industries followed the lead of the Government last September 12 months and had large stocks of supplies.  In the course of time and because of the industrial expansion which took place under this Government, a situation has come about where we now have to buy more and more of the things we require&mdash;the sinews of industry&mdash;from hard currency countries.  Naturally, we are paying more for those commodities and those increased costs would, in any event, have been reflected in prices here. Accordingly, even if no other factor were operating, devaluation in itself would have brought about a serious situation at home.  In addition, the decision taken last August by the Government of Britain, the Government <Col N="1663" /> of the United States of America and the Government of France to rearm&mdash;to spend more and more money on munitions and on preparedness in the event of the outbreak of war, inevitably that rearmament programme, prompted by the war in Korea, has meant, as it must, a greater call on supplies and services in the world for war purposes.  As that greater demand has developed, it has shoved up prices on all countries that must share in the pool of supplies and services in Europe.</P>
      <P>We saw what took place in the Australian wool market.  We saw what took place when the American Army was a world buyer&mdash;buying stocks for war, buying woollen goods and necessary materials which they would require for a large rearmament programme.  It has an immediate effect in rocketing the prices of Australian wool to a height never before attained in the world market.  I do not think anyone in this House or outside it will deny that a situation such as that must inevitably have an effect on this country and on the prices of the articles and commodities which we must buy.  Unfortunately, wool is a commodity that we have to import.  Even though we have woollen industries in this country, and in my constituency in particular, nevertheless, Irish wool, while suitable in some respects for our own requirements, falls short in other respects of what is required here.  We are, therefore, a buyer of wool abroad.  We have to compete against the Governments of America, Britain and Soviet Russia in the world market for wool which we require. That situation would, in any event, have had its own effects on domestic prices.  Since I have mentioned wool I may say that I know that there has been widespread anxiety and dissatisfaction at the immediate rocketing in this country of the prices of woollen and fabric goods.  I know that some retailers here in this city availed of the prevailing situation last September, with rising wool prices, to sell their old stock at enhanced prices.  I know that that particular situation is getting the attention of the Government, and trust it will continue to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1664" /> It must be our concern, in relation to this important problem of prices, where we can control and where there is something that we can do at home, to ensure that nobody, no manufacturer, no retailer, and no one engaged in any way selling services and articles to our people, will avail unfairly of an external situation to make a profit for himself.  I regret to say that I think it has happened with regard to woollen goods.  I regret to say that in the ten days or fortnight in which the wool scare first became apparent, certain people, I think, did avail of that situation to make a profit for themselves out of public anxiety and rising prices.  I trust that particular matter will engage the attention of the Minister and that he will take steps to ensure that some retribution be made in that connection.</P>
    <P>Now, while the situation may be to a certain extent a serious one&mdash;it is a serious one for the country, if rearmament continues to grow space, as there may be a situation of appreciating prices and lowering money values&mdash; nevertheless, this country is lucky in the respect that it is economically the strongest country in Europe.  Economically, Ireland to-day in its resources, in its assets, in its increased production, is better equipped than any other country in Western Europe.  It can withstand any chance economic blizzard which external conditions may throw up.  We are lucky in that fact, we can take pride in that fact; but we must appreciate that all of us here at home, if we are to withstand any economic trouble that may come, can only do it by producing more.  We can only do it by continuing to increase our production from the land and the factory.  If that drive for greater production fails in any way, if we do not continue to do what we are doing now, producing more at home, then we will be more and more dependent on a rising market outside, and our people will continue to suffer.</P>
    <P>It is on that point that I would say to the Labour Party, through them to the trade unions, and through the trade unions to the workers generally, that they have a very important contribution <Col N="1665" /> to make to the situation which is developing here.  They have done it before and I am sure they will do it again.  They can play their part by more work per head to increase the rate of production both in the factory and in the field, so that this country may continue by its expanding production to solve its own economic ills and problems.  I do not think that it serves this nation in the slightest to have this cheap political play-acting which we have seen indulged in by the Opposition for the last few days.  I am sure they are gratified to be able to score political points because of the present situation, but they would be serving the country far better if they joined with the Government in ensuring that all sections of our people&mdash; industrialist, farmer, farm worker and the ordinary industrial worker&mdash;together and in harmony, should work harder and produce more, so that this country, by its own efforts, will help to alleviate some of the problems which arise from abroad.</P>
    <P>There is one matter to which I would like to make some reference. The Parliamentary Secretary, in his very able speech in introducing this Bill to the House, discussed the situation with regard to prices and supplies for the last two and a half years and very properly took a legitimate pride in the fact that, up to recent months, while we had produced more at home and increased the incomes of our people, we had been able more or less to maintain stabilisation in prices; but his speech was spot-lighed by the newspapers the following morning as a declaration that prices had not risen. That particular spot-lighting, I think, in two papers that I ordinarily read was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;extremely unfair to the Parliamentary Secretary and to the Government because no one in his ordinary senses could attempt to suggest that the situation which has developed in the last two months has not become a situation in which there is an incipient rise in prices, and it is that very developing situation which has commended the action at present being taken.  It is the very fact that <Col N="1666" /> the tendency for prices to rise is there that has convinced the Government that now is the time to take action. The suggestion to-day in the Press that the Government and the Parliamentary Secretary were so complacent with regard to the entire situation that they denied its existence was, in my opinion, completely unfair.  I think it is right and proper that this step should be taken now.  It would be very wrong for this Government to do as its predecessors did, to allow prices to increase before they took action to control them.  It would be very wrong for this Government in any way to follow the bad example of its predecessors and attempt to control what could not be controlled, an attempt by delayed action, which in many cases was mere window-dressing for the public, to undo a harm already done. If we are to face a world situation of increasing prices we must attempt by our own action here at home to ensure that what can be controlled by the action of the Government will be controlled. As I have said, there are many things about which we cannot do much.  There are many things, many commodities essential to us as a nation in respect of which the price is controlled by shortage conditions or by monopoly conditions outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to those, we are to a certain extent powerless; but we must ensure-this is something in which Deputy Keane is interested&mdash;that here at home no single person selling a service, selling a commodity, engaged in any way in selling things to the ordinary consumer, avails unfairly of the developing international situation to make an unjust profit for himself. It is in that respect that I think the former Government failed; it is in that respect I think that they will be long remembered in this country as the Government associated with rising prices.  It was a situation new to them and we at least have the advantage of seeing some of their mistakes.  We have been able to see while they were in office and a similar situation was developing how in some ways they mishandled things and were mistaken.  I think that the proposal of the Government in this connection is a proper proposal to ensure that the avoidable <Col N="1667" /> effects of rearmament and devaluation will not be visited upon our people.</P>
    <P>I do not think that we or any Deputy in this House could conscientiously say to our people that there will not be a rise in prices.  I do not think we could say that with any sense of conviction because there must be a rise for as long as the prices of many of the things essential to us are controlled outside and are produced in a shortage market in which the price is a scarcity price. So long as that situation exists we will be faced with that increase in price but we can ensure in other respects that the worst effects will not be visited upon us.</P>
    <P>While I do not usually speak at any length in this House there are certain things I intend to say regarding the criticism which has come from the Opposition.  I have heard Deputy de Valera, junior, talking about the price of food.  I mentioned in that connection that if food prices are the symptom of agricultural prosperity then more power to the existing prices and I am quite certain that Deputy de Valera's view would not be re-echoed by a single Fianna Fáil Deputy representing the agricultural community&mdash;but leave that as it may be. Deputy de Valera said that this Government had introduced a black market in essential commodities here. That is unworthy of the Deputy.  It is unworthy of any Deputy in this House to make a suggestion of that kind, but it having been made, I think it should be answered.</P>
    <P>We were told by Deputy de Valera that the Fianna Fáil Government had subsidised tea, bread and butter in the interests of the people and that what this Government had done was to provide an alternative diet of off-the-ration butter, tea and bread at black market prices.  Every one of us knows that the present Government differs materially from the Opposition to the extent that, while they maintained the price of bread, butter and tea at the expense of taxes which the people of this country regard as unfair, this Government has removed those taxes and at the same time has ensured a <Col N="1668" /> fair ration at a fair price of the staple articles of diet to the people of the country.  I think it is proper legislation and if anyone in this country, be he a worker earning £3, £4, or £5 a week or the richest man in the country earning £2,000 a week, wants to buy more than his ration he should justly pay the price.  There is no suggestion even from the Opposition that the ration of butter increased by this Government from two to eight ounces, the ration of bread or the ration of tea is an unfair ration.  There has been no suggestion from them that what is given as a hard iron ration is in any way unjust, but the suggestion is made that because some people want more than their share they should not be asked to pay more than their share. I think that is an absurd contention. I think it is far better to have what we have in this country: the prices of essential commodities and rationed goods to a certain extent guaranteed for the poorest in the land by those who can afford to pay.  If that is black marketing then it is about time there was more of it in the way in which we manage Government affairs. At any rate, there is the change that if to-day a woman running a house has friends coming in or a little bit of a tea party she is assured that she can legitimately go to the grocer round the corner and pay a controlled price for off-the-ration tea and has not to go down Moore Street or other streets in this city and buy on the nod black market tea at £1 or £2 per lb.  There is that difference, and if Fianna Fáil think they can make any political advantage out of that they do not know the ordinary people of this country and they will never know them.  That change is welcomed in the country and it is a perfectly fair change made in strict accordance with justice.</P>
    <P>Other Fianna Fáil speakers took some pride in the fact that the Fianna Fáil Government subsidised these essential commodities.  I would have thought that any Fianna Fáil speaker making that statement would have done so with a blush of shame on his cheeks because, mind you, the Fianna Fáil subsidisation of food came eight years after the world war.  It came in the <Col N="1669" /> autumn of 1947 when Fianna Fáil had lost two out of three by-elections and were on the straight run home for a general election.  It was only when they knew that they must shortly face the voters and opinions of the people that they took panicky action so as to have some goods in the shop windows.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That, in view of the grave danger of a shortage of animal feeding-stuffs in many areas during the coming winter and early spring as a result of the almost complete loss of the hay crop and in order to prevent great suffering to animals and serious loss to farmers, Dáil Éireann requests the Government to take immediate and adequate steps to deal with the situation&mdash;standing in the names of Deputies Oliver J. Flanagan, Patrick Cogan, Patrick O'Reilly, John Flynn, Peadar Cowan and myself.</P>
      <P>We are doing this in the hope of securing a full understanding on the part of the Government of the serious situation arising from bad weather conditions during the harvest which now confronts if not the whole country at least sections of the country.  I probably am not in the position to speak in a general way of the shortage of hay for feeding purposes with that intimate knowledge required to bring home effectively the seriousness of the situation.</P>
      <P>I speak of certain areas of whose condition I am personally aware.  I speak with full sense of responsibility and with intimate knowledge, and I assert that the Department of Agriculture, as the agent of the Government in this respect, have a serious problem to face, a problem which they should tackle in all seriousness, not in any light mood and not treating it merely as a casual happening, but as a serious national problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be quite wrong to assert in a general way that there was such a complete failure of the hay harvest last <Col N="1670" /> summer that the Government would be warranted in making special provision in the way of providing hay for all the cattle in the country at present.  I am satisfied from reports I have got and from my own knowledge that there are many districts where the hay situation, possibly because of more favourable conditions, better husbandry or better family help, is not at all too serious, but there are other districts where, due to climatic conditions and other circumstances, the situation has become really serious and vital.  This situation is not confined to a small number of people.  A comparatively large number are affected, people mainly of the small farming class who are engaged primarily in the foundation of all things agricultural, milk production.  They are suppliers of milk to the creameries and the supply of milk to creameries, as all Governments and all scientists know, is the foundation of our agricultural economy. If we allow these small farmers to suffer, through no fault of their own, a substantial loss in cattle at this juncture, the reaction must be felt not merely this year, but next year and in subsequent years.</P>
    <P>The farmer who produces milk for supply to creameries is a man who receives least of all as reward for his dairying operation.  In many cases, he does it on the poorest of land.  He depends on the separated milk from the creamery for the feeding of his pigs and his fowl, and very often the separated milk returns and forms part of the milk supply of his own children. That may seem a harsh thing to say but it is none the less true.  Such is the economy of the small farmer for whom I am speaking.  His land is poor land and is almost invariably situated in areas where climatic conditions are of the worst, and accordingly, in adverse weather conditions such as those prevailing during the recent harvest, he suffers much more than does the farmer operating in better climatic conditions.</P>
    <P>In addition to the price which he receives for his milk, which is his principal economy, he sells his calves at the age of six to 12 months and, out of the sale of these calves, he pays his <Col N="1671" /> current debts&mdash;shopkeeper, rates, rent, and such incidental debts, which must be paid in cash.  He has been confronted with a situation for the past two or three months in which his cattle are not marketable.  No doubt, one can look at the Dublin Cattle Market returns and see that such high prices were never before recorded, but that does not in the smallest way affect the small farmers with three and four calves of six months of age.  There is no market for their product and when they take them to the fair, there is nobody to buy them.  These are the people who, in the main, supply the graziers in the Midlands and fattening lands with the young stock from which the fat cattle are ultimately produced and which constitute our greatest national exportable asset.</P>
    <P>I will pay the tribute to the Minister and his Department that in recent months they have made the utmost efforts, involving the State in fairly heavy expenditure, I have no doubt, to deal with what has become an endemic catastrophe amongst our cattle population, abortion, which results in the non-production of calves annually.  The Minister has been well in advance of any of his predecessors in so far as he has made available to the affected districts a veterinary service which has done its utmost to eliminate that disease.  The Minister must have felt justified in incurring that expenditure and must have felt that it would render a national service in the long run, but where does his responsibility in the matter of the emergency situation which this present year has produced come in?</P>
    <P>He has a responsibility in the matter of the preservation of the young cattle who have no hay feeding and must ultimately die of starvation to provide hay or other feeding for the cows which will be bearing calves next spring.  If these young cattle are allowed to starve, it will mean that so many more deaths will occur among our foundation stock.  Many of these small farmers have over the years established with great care and attention a foundation stock of cows which are excellent, and <Col N="1672" /> through them, an excellent stock of cattle has been produced.  Let one in three of these die of starvation, even in the limited areas where starvation is confronting them unless provision is made to ameliorate conditions there, and let two out of three of the young stock die, and there is a national loss. What is the sense of spending money, lavishly, but, as I say, rightly, in trying to eliminate this endemic disease of abortion and, at the same time, allowing the produce of these cows to die because an emergency has arisen, due to weather conditions, which must result in serious losses amongst that stock?</P>
    <P>Furthermore, for many years past our Governments here have realised the importance of our cattle industry. They have provided premiums so that bulls of the highest standard would be available for the improvement of our cattle population.  They have made it an offence for a farmer to keep any other type of bull.  In some cases that has been a cause of hardship to farmers, but the point is that it has cost the State a good deal of money. I think it was well spent money.</P>
    <P>In view of that, I suggest that the present emergency, one that probably occurs in ten or 20 years, should receive the immediate attention of the Minister.  Otherwise, a great part of the valuable stock produced in the circumstances I have described will die of starvation.  There is no reason why that should be so because, I think, that if an analysis is made of the quantity of fodder available over the whole of the Republic, sufficient hay will be found to feed the cattle in those districts where there is a scarcity of it.  The districts which need it should have the surplus hay that is available supplied to them.</P>
    <P>There is no use in saying that it is the farmer's job to look after his cattle and to feed them.  It is, of course, his job, but if nature prevents him from doing that, then I suggest it is the duty of the State to do it.  It should also do it from the humane point of view.  If a farmer allows his cattle to starve he is prosecuted and brought to court.  If the State allows cattle to starve without taking due precaution <Col N="1673" /> to prevent such an occurrence, why should it not be brought into court? If a farmer allows his cattle to wander, without making due provision for them, he renders himself liable to a prosecution.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister say under what heading he can refuse to take action at this juncture?  He must know what the position is.  He can confirm what I have said, because he has his agents all over the country.  There are districts at present in which there is not sufficient hay to feed and keep alive hundreds and thousands of cattle.  The individual farmer is not in a position to make necessary provision for feeding them.  May I, by way of illustration, quote for the Minister what the position is across the Border? Generally speaking it is worse in the north than it is in the south.  But there the Government have taken action to deal with the situation, and so have the people there through their creameries and co-operative societies.  They have listed the areas in which a surplus supply of hay is available.  The farmers in need of supplies place their orders for them.  They are aided by the Government, and arrangements have been made for the movement of surplus hay to the districts which need it.</P>
    <P>I understand the Northern Government have gone so far as to arrange for the import of hay from Scotland and Holland.  If that is the position across the Border where conditions are somewhat similar to the districts that I am concerned with, is it not justifiable to ask that some effort should be made by the Dáil to help our people who are without supplies of hay for their cattle? We are supposed to be more in touch with our people than the Government in the Six Counties is with its people. Therefore, why should not some similar effort be made here to deal with this problem and have arrangements made for the transfer of surplus supplies of hay to the districts in need of it?  The Minister has an organisation in every county in the Republic.  Through his officials, he can get particulars from each district where surplus fodder exists, and so have it transferred to the areas where it is needed.</P>
    <P>I was in a district on the western seaboard <Col N="1674" /> six weeks ago, where I saw £20 a ton asked for hay That is an outrageous price.  Even at that price, how could a farmer living 20 or 30 miles away from where it is available get in touch with the person who had it and how could he transport it?  Where would he find the cash to enable him to meet his feeding requirements?  An ordinary cow will consume from two to three tons of hay in the year.  There are very few of those farmers that I speak of who could afford to pay £40 or £60 for the quantity of hay they would require.  In an emergency such as this would the Minister not consider it his duty to fix the price at which hay should be sold, and, further, arrange for its transport so as to make the feeding economical in the case of people in necessitous districts?  To meet the emergency situation that exists some co-ordinated effort will have to be made.</P>
    <P>I do not want to exaggerate the position or to use it politically in the smallest way.  I am speaking seriously on this matter.  I am charging the Minister with responsibility for making such arrangements as will bring fodder into those districts where none exists at the moment, and of having it placed at the disposal of farmers at a reasonable price.  That may require a subsidy. We must remember that cattle, poultry and milk production are being subsidised at the moment.  If we are prepared to subsidise the production of cattle why, in the emergency that now exists, should we allow those cattle to be destroyed by our failure to provide the feeding for them?</P>
    <P>There is no use in the Minister telling me that he can supply all the maize meal, oilcake and other feeding stuffs that farmers may require for the feeding of their cattle.  It would cost 30/- a week for maize meal to feed a cow if she has no other rations.  That is the price of one cwt. of maize meal or its equivalent.  What is that going to cost a farmer for 40 weeks?  Even if a farmer were willing to do that, is he to be asked to ruin himself?  If he has not credit he will not get money to buy the maize meal for the period he would require it.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the situation which <Col N="1675" /> this emergency has created calls for some kind of Government organisation to deal with it, and that is all that I am asking in this motion.  I assert that in no circumstances will the Minister be able to clear himself by any theoretical proposals such as that he has this scheme and that or this and that method available to meet the situation.  The present situation cannot be attributed to what is called the lazy farmer.  It is due to weather conditions over which the farmer has no control.  The position may be localised in this way, that in some districts local conditions are worse than they are in others, but the position, generally speaking, is bad.  If the Minister is prepared to ask this House, as he has asked it, for a big expenditure for developing and improving land, and more power to him for doing it, he is surely short-sighted if he does not at a critical moment like this step in and help to retrieve some of the loss which farmers are bound to sustain owing to weather conditions which have been abnormal and which may not occur again for many years.</P>
    <P>I am not putting this case to the Minister with a view to placing him at a disadvantage.  No one blames the Minister for the weather conditions and the bad harvest results, but it is due to him to save a section of the community from utter ruin in many cases.  If an ordinary small farmer loses three cows and three calves, it is a national loss.  That man will be out of production of milk for the coming season.  He will be out of the production of young store cattle for the coming season.  There will consequently be a smaller supply of milk, butter and store cattle.</P>
    <P>In the spring when the grazier goes to buy store cattle he will realise that there are fewer suitable cattle available for him.  It will put the small farmer in a position where he will be out of business for years.  I assert that it is the duty of the Minister to step in and provide a plan for dealing with this matter.  He is very good at providing plans.  I want a practical one in this case, not a theoretical one.  It is his duty as Minister to deal with a <Col N="1676" /> situation that is of such wide national importance as this one, in which there may be the danger of a shortage of fodder.  I ask him to discharge his duty and tell us what he proposes doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my thanks to the Government for having allowed governmental time for the consideration of this important and urgent motion.  To those who have listened for the past couple of weeks to the rosy picture that has been painted of agricultural conditions, mainly by urban and city Deputies, Deputy Maguire's speech must have acted like a trough of low pressure. However, I do not think he exaggerated the conditions.  In this country we have a very wide variety of soil conditions and of geographical conditions so far as agriculture is concerned. I am not so sure that the climatic conditions vary very much, but I suppose they do to a certain extent.  In every part of this country we usually get more rain than we can do with.  But we have certainly found during the past year that there are a number of areas where the adverse weather conditions caused much greater loss than in others.</P>
      <P>Those areas are mainly the poorer areas where the land is of an inferior type, the hilly areas, and, perhaps even to a greater extent, the low-lying areas, where the land is subject to flooding.  Even when there is no actual flooding, owing to the land being of a low, moist and eroding nature, it is hard to save the hay crop.  In those areas throughout the country we have a position in which the greater part of the hay crop has been seriously damaged and in some cases completely lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are hilly areas in the County Wicklow, particularly in west and south-west Wicklow, where some farmers have been unable to save any portion of their hay.  Some people may suggest that that was due to neglect on their part.  It was not.  On poor, hilly land we usually find that there is not an early growth of grass, with the result that it is late in the year by the time the hay crop is mature for cutting.  Usually hay saving takes place from the middle of <Col N="1677" /> July onwards.  This year it was in the early weeks of the hay harvesting season that we had the best and most satisfactory weather.  Thus it was that in the later districts the greater loss occurred.</P>
    <P>We all know that in intensive tillage areas where you have a considerable amount of first and second crop hay the crop is usually cut early in June and as a result practically all that type of hay was saved this year.  It was in the districts to which Deputy Maguire referred, in the low-lying and hilly areas, that severe loss occurred.  That has been a big loss to those small farmers whose resources are limited.  They have to depend on the creamery to take their milk and very often the return is not so big in those areas.  In a great many parts of the country where there are no creameries the small farmer has to depend on rearing young stock.  Those farmers are very hard hit.  It is true that strong cattle and cattle in forward condition have not reduced in price.  I attended a fair last week-end and I can say that young cattle have depreciated in value very considerably because a lot of farmers are anxious to thin out their stock owing to lack of fodder.</P>
    <P>In putting down this motion, we are determined not to exaggerate the picture. We know that during the coming winter if weather conditions are favourable the farmers and their stock may survive reasonably well.  But, if it should happen that weather conditions are very unfavourable, as they were in the winter of 1946-47, then I can say without exaggeration that unless something is done by the State in co-operation with the farming community, thousands of cattle will die. We all know that in 1946-47 thousands of cattle did die.  That was a tragedy both for the farming community and the State.  There may have been an excuse for the Government then inasmuch as it was an unprecedented occurrence.  The weather during the harvest was abnormally severe, followed by the severest winter in living memory.  But, with that precedent before us, there will be no excuse for the Dáil and the Government if we do not take action to meet such an emergency. <Col N="1678" /> After the fatality of 1946-47 the Government did take action.  They provided a considerable amount of money by way of loans free of interest. In that way they subsidised the farmer in replacing his stock.  That was money well spent to a certain extent, but I do not think it is desirable that we should face a similar position this year.  If we are to spend public money at all, let us spend it, not in replacing stock that have died, but in saving the stock that are still alive.  That is the principle embodied in this motion.</P>
    <P>In some areas the farmers cut their hay and lost it completely.  In other areas farmers were not even able to cut the hay.  In addition to that we know that there was very adverse weather during the harvest and they will not have the feeding stuffs they usually availed of, such as oaten straw which was rendered practically worthless as a feeding stuff. Everybody realises that.  To-day wheaten and oaten straw has very little feeding value owing to the damage done during the harvest.  That means that there is really a serious problem facing the farming community and the Department of Agriculture in keeping our stock alive during this winter if, as I say, weather conditions prove adverse. It may be asked, and the Minister is entitled to ask, what do we suggest the Government should do.  In this matter we are endeavouring to be constructive and to co-operate with the Government to the best of our ability to meet the situation as well as we can.</P>
    <P>As I have pointed out, there are in the country very considerable areas in which the hay crop has been saved and I think it is quite possible&mdash;it cannot be proved except by investigation&mdash;that there is in some areas a surplus of hay which the Department of Agriculture could purchase and hold in reserve to meet the danger of a very severe winter.  The Minister might ask how could that proposition be put into practical effect.  Would the Department of Agriculture purchase hay in certain areas, take it away and store it to meet the emergency?  I do not think that would be necessary.  I think it would be desirable to purchase  <Col N="1679" /> but I do not think it would be necessary to remove it from the premises of the owners until it is required.  If it is not required there could be an agreement with the vendor to retain the hay subject, of course, to the payment of some deposit or fee for the service he has rendered in making his fodder available.  That is one suggestion.</P>
    <P>Then, of course, I think that the Minister has announced that as far as cereals are concerned there will be adequate supplies, but I think he will agree that to use cereals for the preservation of young live stock and cows in particular on any kind of substantial scale or to use cereals as a substitute for hay would be a very expensive process and the average farmer would be unable to finance it.  I think here is where it is necessary for the Minister to consider some scheme by which in relation to the price both of the hay purchased and of the cereal feeding stuffs, which might be available only in small quantities, some arrangement could be made by which the sale of those feeding stuffs to farmers who are really in need of them and who have not the financial resources to pay the high prices which they might fetch, could be subsidised.  I am not going to indicate to what extent that should be done but I think there is a reasonable case for a certain State grant to meet the situation.  Only to-day it has been intimated that the American Government in their generosity has made available 13,000,000 dollars to assist this country economically for the rehabilitation and improvement of the country.  I do not know of any more desirable way in which a small portion of that grant could be used than in saving the lives of young stock and cows when there is a real danger that otherwise the stock might be lost completely. The next question, of course, is that in addition to such cereals which might be made available some type of credit facility would be urgently needed which would enable these farmers to purchase the feeding stuffs or to pay their portion of the price of that feeding stuff.  I think that this is a very urgent and important matter.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied with the reply <Col N="1680" /> which the Minister made when this question was raised by my colleague, Deputy O'Reilly.  The Minister then indicated that adequate credit facilities would be made available to the co-operative societies.  As far as that is concerned it is all right provided the Minister is not going to throw the entire obligation of providing this credit on, perhaps, a small creamery society in a badly affected area.  It might happen that one particular area might be very seriously affected and the creamery society in that area could hardly be expected to have the financial resources to meet that emergency. Just as the farmer is limited as far as his capital assets are concerned, so many of our creameries are also limited.  There are some very wealthy creameries I know, but it might happen that this might not be the creamery area in which this problem would arise in a serious way.  I do not think that the Government should pass this burden on entirely to the shoulders of some local co-operative society.  There should be co-operation and support on the part of the Government for any societies taking part in the scheme. But then again there are quite large areas in the country which would, I think be seriously affected by this problem, and in which there are no co-operative societies whatever.  I think that is true of a considerable portion of the country, and I would like to know what machinery the Minister would set up to deal with that problem.  It is not a matter which can be put on the long finger but one which must be dealt with forthwith, and I can suggest that as far as the farming community and the rural community generally are concerned they will co-operate actively with the Department in any serious effort that is made to solve this problem, but they have got to have the backing and support of the Minister and the Department.  I think, Sir, that this is a problem which we hope will never again arise in this country.  I think that the lesson that has been learned this year in regard to the difficulties of saving the hay will be regarded as a final lesson, and that from now on there will be a rapid advance in the making of ensilage on practically all farms, and particularly <Col N="1681" /> on those farms where hay is very difficult to save, farms where the land is low-lying and wet and on the hilly farms where farmers concentrate on pasture.  In these areas it is hoped an intensive drive will be made and perhaps the Minister might consider wedding any scheme of assistance to the farmers in these areas with a scheme for promoting the making of ensilage.</P>
    <P>Whatever is done, I hope there will be an intensive drive to get away from the making of hay and to get on to the making of ensilage.  In that way we can hope that we are dealing now with a problem which will not arise again in future.  For that reason I think we should ask the Government not to hesitate to expend the relatively small sum of public money which is involved in meeting this problem.  It think it is an expenditure which would be amply justified.  It will not, I think, involve any great expenditure in my own constituency because the number of farmers affected in that constituency would not be very large.  I think, however, that there are substantial areas throughout the country in which serious loss would be incurred which could be avoided by taking the action I have suggested.  I am quite confident that the Minister will accept this motion in the spirit in which it is offered.  He may perhaps have some ideas for meeting this problem other than those suggested by Deputy Ben Maguire or myself.  The Minister did indicate last week that he was in consultation with Mr. O'Reilly, Father Coyne and Dr. Kennedy, and I am quite sure that as a result of these consultations some feasible plan may be evolved.  Whatever is done has got to be done quickly, for the reason that the weather may be very severe in the near future.  It should also be done quickly in order to obviate the necessity of struggling small farmers selling off their stocks at ridiculously low prices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>Any Minister for Agriculture, called on to deal with a motion in these terms, must, if he is conscious of his duty, accept it, of course.  What is the Department of Agriculture for but <Col N="1682" /> perennially to take immediate and adequate steps to deal with any situation relating to the agricultural industry? It is, of course, true that we have had a very inclement summer.  It is, of course, true that great quantities of hay have been lost altogether, but something that may be easily overlooked is that a large part of the hay that has been gathered into barns has very little feeding value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have told the House repeatedly, these considerations have been constantly present to my mind since last September.  The entire inspectorate of my Department has had these matters under review every day of every week since last September and I have already indicated to this House the correspondence that I have had with the Cavan County Committee of Agriculture, going very fully into the dangers that we foresaw as a result of the inclement summer, and emphasising the necessity for the most energetic measures on everybody's part to help in averting unfortunate consequences.  We urged on the Cavan County Committee of Agriculture not to be backward in approaching the Department and calling on it for any help in the matter or in putting forward to me any suggestions they thought advantageous. Deputy Maguire&mdash;I do not think he will mind my mentioning it &mdash;spent some considerable time in my office yesterday discussing this problem, more especially as it affected areas in County Leitrim.  I was very much obliged to him for such advice as he offered in connection with the particular area with which he is familiar on the Cavan-Leitrim border and other districts in that county.  I do not know whether or not I impressed Deputy Maguire with the readiness of my Department to meet every contingency that common prudence would induce one to foresee.  I hope I did; I certainly tried.  I am a little disappointed, though, firstly, to find that such distinguished Deputies should think it necessary to exhort me to further and better efforts.  I thought the principal complaint against me was that I did too much.  But having taken that step I could not refrain from anticipating eagerly Deputy Cogan's <Col N="1683" /> advice as to what I should do.  I sharpened my pencil and I wrote it down. He wants me to buy hay on the instalment plan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, peripatetic hay.  I read with astonished amazement of the authorities in Northern Ireland announcing their intention of moving shiploads of hay across the North Sea. Well, if the farmers above in Grangegorman or down in Ballinasloe announced they were bringing airship loads of hay to this country, I would read of it with sympathy, but how any rational being, desiring in an emergency to provide vitally necessary food to carry live stock over a critical period of scarcity which may not extend beyond three months, should elect to open the hold of a ship and tramp hay into the hold, presumably having filled the keel with ballast in order to prevent the ship turning turtle, is a mystery to me.  But if they want to go daft in Northern Ireland, please God we will not go daft here and we will not lose, please God, a single beast from hunger or distress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cogan then goes on to say that we should subsidise cereals.  Why do we always want to make beggarmen of our own neighbours?  I was reared amongst ten-acre farms.  My grandfather's father was evicted out of his farm and he came into the town of Ballaghaderreen and his wife made-dip candles and hung them in the shop window and out of that they built up the family again and they never looked to anybody for charity.  Neither did their neighbours.  Why do we always want to represent our own people on the land as having their hands out in every contingency to get something for nothing?  I entirely agree that in times of stress and difficulty credit may be necessary to carry people over a difficult time until they can realise <Col N="1684" /> their stock and pay their debt and use the profit to restock their land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Our job as a Government, as I see it, is effectively to provide that no self-respecting farmer in this country will lose a single beast this winter for lack of fodder because he had not the money to pay cash down for it and, so far as this Government is concerned, no single self-respecting farmer in Ireland need see a single beast hungry on his holding this winter for the want of fodder or the want of money, always provided that if he has to undertake a debt he intends to repay it when he can.  But, if there are any chancers in this country who think they can climb up the sleeve of this Government to get something for nothing because it is a difficult time, let them think again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some bleeding hearts in this establishment who are very fond of bleeding over their neighbours with somebody else's blood and they will be up before this night is over to say that they are shocked and grieved to hear such language used about the hard-working farmers in rural Ireland.  There are hard-working farmers in rural Ireland, thanks be to God&mdash;99 per cent. of them.  If they were not, they would have died of starvation long ago. But there are about 1 per cent. of them and they are on the trot wherever there is something to be got for nothing, except work, and the sight of that puts them trotting in the other <Col N="1685" /> direction.  They had better start trotting now.</P>
    <P>So far as I am concerned, they are going to get nothing out of this.  Those who want to work, those who want to support their own families and to hold their heads high, I want them to know that the Minister for Agriculture and every officer in my Department are proud to be their servants.  We want them to tell us how we can serve them now.  We want them to know now the plans we have already made to serve them on their own holdings if they will send for us.  If there is any defect or shortcoming in these plans, we want to know it so that we may repair it in order that we may serve them more effectively.</P>
    <P>What then have we done?  We will be reading of the chairman of the Central Bank having literary fits about the imports that are breaking his heart.  Let him make up his mind to this: so long as our people require it, the wealth of this country will be used to bring imports and, if he does not like it, he can lump it.  That is what wealth is for and we intend to use it.</P>
    <P>The imports this month are £16,000,000 sterling, and we are well able to pay for them.  The imports for the first nine months of this year in respect of cereals are up from 8,000,000 to 13,500,000.  The imports of maize for the month of October are more than five times as great as they were in October last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister talking about value or quantity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Both.  I did not know I had another chairman of the Central Bank on my left hand.  It is the chief accountant I have now.  The total imports of cereals of all kinds for this month are six times as big as they were in the same month last year.  There is enough animal feeding stuff in this country and afloat, at present rates of consumption, to last until 30th May. Double the consumption and they will last till March.  Quadruple it and it will last until February.  We can buy as much more or twice as much more, if they are necessary.  There never were more cereals stored in Ireland since Brian Boro fell on the battlefield of Clontarf.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not on you he fell, in any case.  The only limit to the quantity of cereals at present stored in this country is the storage that those fellows did not build and if there is a grain ship paying demurrage in the Liffey before very long, do not blame me but the gentlemen who were bawling &ldquo;Grow More Wheat&rdquo; for 15 years but did not build anywhere to put it. After this year, please God, we will have storage and drying accommodation in every county in Ireland and when a man grows grain, whatever it is, he will not have to go with his hat in his hand to a miller to beg him to oblige him, for God's sake to dry it for him.  I cannot build storage in ten minutes.  I took over the Royal Dublin Society.  There is grain stored there and everywhere else it can be put.  Was I better employed in filling those stores with grain or with Scandinavian hay?</P>
      <P>There is no use having grain in the Royal Dublin Society or anywhere else if there is no means of bridging the gap between the man who has live stock but no hay and the grain he requires to replace the hay that is lost.  It is not in the last ten minutes or the last week that that problem has concerned me.  There is not a farmer in this country who has not access to all the grain he wants by the machinery now provided, provided because I did not want the tangler to frighten small farmers into bringing out their cattle and throwing them away when I saw the same tangler bringing them up to the Dublin market and making a fat profit on them.  I give the tanglers in cattle the same notice as I gave the tanglers in pigs.  There will be no more tangling in pigs if I am any judge.</P>

      <P>The Deputy ought to know all about it.  Those who purchased them got paid for them and that is what a tangler never meant to do. Tanglers will buy no more cheap cattle in rural Ireland if the people depend on me.  I did as Deputy Cogan says; I <Col N="1687" /> had recourse to the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, to which I had every reason to have recourse with confidence; instead of sitting down and weeping by the waters of Babylon for the small creamery society in the poor district, I sat down with the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society and suggested to them that if the co-operative movement was designed to bring individual farmers together into societies to co-operate, was there anything foreign to that spirit in asking a group of societies to come together to co-operate with one another and, if there was a poor society in a poor district catering for poor people, would not the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society go out and ask 15 or 20 neighbouring societies to join hands with them and say jointly: &ldquo;We will go bail for £10,000 and let these 20 societies give credit where credit is necessary to such of their members as want fodder for their cattle and cannot buy it out of their own resources, and let them pay it back out of their milk cheques in the ensuing year or years.&rdquo;  So far as groups of co-operative societies undertake that task, let them go to the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the sky is the limit.  There is no shortage of credit for honest men in this country, none whatever.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will not wish me to join him in a canter through St. Thomas Aquinas at this hour.  Probably the Deputy knows if we went cantering we would probably go cantering in the same direction.  But, as I said on another occasion, Deputy Hickey and I may have views on credit reform but it is not at the moment that you want to deal with an urgent and awkward situation that you ought to get scrupulous about credit reform.  I use the weapons that are ready to my hands, good, bad or indifferent, and when the job is done Deputy Hickey and I can get to work on that subject and see if I can make it a more flaming sword than it at present is; but, bright or rusty, it is the only sword I have got at the moment and it will be in the next three months I shall have to use it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1688" /> But that is not all.  There are areas in the congested districts where the co-operative movement is not strong. I felt the need for some considerable time, and I am glad to be able on this occasion to make an announcement which I do not deny is pretty near my heart.  I adumbrated twelve months ago a parish plan for reasons on which I need not dwell to-night.  My plans went agley.  The parish plan emerged from the encounter with its head bloody, but unbowed.  I am going to start the parish plan next month in every parish in Leitrim, Donegal, Sligo, Mayo, Galway, Clare, Kerry, and in every area comprised in the congested districts of Western Ireland.</P>

In every three parishes in those counties there will be a parish agent responsible for the welfare, in so far as they invite him to be responsible, of the farmers of approximately 1,000 holdings, a man whose career in the public service and whose esteem in the eyes of his fellowmen will be measured by the success that tends his efforts in helping the neighbours amongst whom he lives to get out of their holding a decent livelihood for themselves and their families, leaving these holdings in autumn a little better than they found them in spring.  Where there is no co-operative movement to bridge the difficulty of finding credit where credit is required, I look to Muintir na Tire to provide a parish council so that neighbours in a parish joined together can by their joint strength carry any weak one amongst them during a period of difficulty or stress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not an impertinence to suggest that we in Oireachtas Éireann should intrude ourselves unbidden between a farmer and his neighbours if the natural social unit of rural Ireland is functioning adequately to meet whatme <Col N="1689" /> ever emergency is abroad?  Is it not natural that, when that natural social unit functions, if its reserves prove inadequate or unequal to the strain, it should look further for assistance for the purpose of doing the work that a natural social pattern charges it to do?  I tell them now, anywhere in Ireland, that a parish council trying to discharge that duty by its people will not look in vain to the Department of Agriculture for help and guidance in undertaking that responsibility.  It is not my job and I do not want to usurp it or to undertake the regulation of the life and circumstances of every individual throughout this country.  It is the job of the Department of Agriculture to be there, ready, waiting and eager and equipped to go to the help of those who send for it&mdash;but it is the job of neighbours to help their neighbours and the less my Department is applied to on behalf of individuals the better it will be for the individuals and the parish to which they belong.  But if there are any individuals who have not got neighbours&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;they are entitled to come, and it is not lessons in Catechism they will get.  It is right and natural, perhaps, in the circumstances of difficulty that they foresee, that Deputies should look for express reassurance that the magnitude of certain of the difficulties of certain districts is fully appreciated in the Department and by the Minister responsible for them.  I am not going to deal in hyperbole on that point but I fancy most of them realise that the measure of these problems is only too well known to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want Deputies in this House to help me in two urgent tasks.  The first is the frustration of tanglers.  The perpetual reiteration that the price of cattle is collapsing can reap havoc amongst the poorest of our people. There is no prospect or remote danger of the price of cattle collapsing.  The price of cattle is steadily strengthening and will continue to do so.  Deputies have speculated in their minds as to <Col N="1690" /> the trend of capital prices.  I have an inspector, drawn from the local people, in every cattle fair in Ireland, reporting to me every day on the prices being paid in every fair, large and small, throughout the country.  I want to give the House comparative figures for the types of cattle about which certain Deputies have expressed apprehension &mdash;particularly Deputy B. Maguire of Leitrim&mdash;the yearling, the store beast from 12 to 15 months.  In September, 1949, they were making £23 in County Roscommon: in September, 1950, they were making £24.  In November, 1949, they were making £21: in November, 1950, they were making £25.  In County Cavan, in September, 1949, they were making £18 and they were making the same money in September, 1950.  In November, 1949, they are returned as making £18 and they made £16 this year.  But the 15 months to two-year-old beast in County Cavan is returned as making £25 in September, 1949, and £25 in September, 1950.  In October, 1949, they were returned as making £22 and they were making the same money in October, 1950.  In November, 1949, they were making £22 and they are reported as making the same money in November, 1950.  Stronger cattle are even a little better.</P>
    <P>I come now to Wicklow.  The 15 months to two-year-old beast was making £25 in September, 1949, and £28 10s. in September, 1950.  In October, 1950, they were making £23 15s., but I have not got a figure for 1949.  In November, 1950, they are making £24 10s., but I have not got a figure for November, 1949.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, Deputy.  Rich as is my statistical material, it does not quite reach that far.  I have an interesting statistic for the Deputy but, before I leave the six to nine months old, let me say a word for Cavan.  In September, 1949, the price was £9 and it was the same for September, 1950.  In November, 1949, the price was £8; in November, 1950, the price was £8 10s.</P>
      <P>I am not concerned to prove that anybody is wrong.  All I am concerned about is to put on record that any fluctuation there is, is in no sense dramatic or indicative of any urgency or any tendency for cattle to be thrown on the market.  I am merely asking Deputies to tell their neighbours not to bring out their cattle and sell them to a tangler.</P>

I would expect to see the stalls of the Dublin market swamped.  Remember it is not the case of old and uneconomic cows being disposed of in the ordinary course of trade.

I am not trying to confound or look down on anybody in the House.  What I am trying to do is to arm all those who share my anxiety, lest hard-working small farmers be bluffed or defrauded into throwing stock away, with statistical material to reassure them that there is not the slightest need, that if they hold them to the normal time the price will be good, the demand will be strong, and there is no possibility of a situation arising in which our cattle will die or even be injured.</P>

Any man that has not credit if his neighbours in the parish or if his fellow suppliers through the co-operative society are not prepared to make the slightest effort, I will succour them and will support them.  But I will not go down and push unwanted interference on the farm.  The natural social unit that ought to help is the organised neighbour, the co-operative society; but I will provide in every area, permanently resident, a parish agent.  We do not want someone to go and knock at his door.</P>

I have been explaining to the House for some time past this parish plan, that the parish agent in every three parishes resident amongst the people, is waiting, eager and anxious for them to come to him and ask him to help.  What more can this or any other Government in its propriety do? There is one thing that, so long as I am Minister for Agriculture, they will not do, that is, go down with a universal hand-out, or something for nothing. In so far as the boys who want something for nothing are concerned, in the poetic words of Deputy Allen, they can sit on their sash.  Any one who wants assistance, it does not matter how poor he is, how humble he is, he has as much claim on me in this Department as the biggest farmer in Ireland.</P>

Deputy Cogan said that we should be warned by the events of the Spring of 1947.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember discussing that with Deputy McGrath's leader on one occasion.  His solution was to take to a horse, but himself and the horse were sunk before they had gone very <Col N="1696" /> far, and they had to send out the Army to dig him out.  Subject to catastrophe of that kind, against which nobody can provide, we must do as we did in 1947, when the local people put their shoulders to the wheel from one end of the snowdrift and the State put its shoulder to the wheel from the other end and they dug both towards the other and they got there.  I cannot stop the snow and I cannot still the wind, and I do not want Deputy Cogan to proclaim hereafter that I undertook to do so, but short of prodigies of that order I have told the House quite frankly what we plan to do.</P>
      <P>If the scheme is defective, if there is any suggestion anyone can make which they think will make it better, I do not think that any Deputy of this House has ever been turned from my door or indeed from the door of any officer of my Department.  We, I and they, will be deeply grateful to any Deputy who can propose any solution which is practicable for any problem which we appear to have overlooked. I like to think that we have overlooked nothing, but I may be wrong.

It seems to me that the very essence of trying to operate on the basis of parish councils is to do your best to make your practice conform to the way they want to do it.  I cannot undertake in advance to accept any proposal they put to me, but provided they put a proposal consistent with prudence and sponsored by rational <Col N="1697" /> reasonable men, not rich men, but reasonable, rational, well-intentioned men, my desire is not to impose on them some cut and dried scheme.

The Deputy may rest assured that none of us in the Department of Agriculture is greatly enamoured of the stately progress of bureaucracy.  In fact we have quite the reputation of being rough and ready ignorant clodhoppers in some of the more Olympian quarters of the Civil Service.  It is a title which coming from that source we cherish.</P>
      <P>I felt it was so important that the House should know how fully the situation was appreciated by myself who am primarily responsible and by the experienced officers of my Department who will in fact have to do the work that I have trespassed perhaps too long upon the House's patience.  If I have I regret it, but I trust that I have given Deputies all the information that they wanted and I trust they are reassured as to the future, and I beg of them individually and collectively to help me to reassure our neighbours and to create a situation all over Ireland calculated to break the tangler's neck.</P>

      <P>Some four or five weeks ago, I received a copy of a resolution passed by the committee of management of a very large co-operative society in my county in connection with this subject.  I believe that the motion we are now discussing largely originated from that resolution.  I replied to that resolution, and my reply was largely on these lines&mdash;that we had had a bad summer and that quite a lot of hay had been lost as a result, and I asked what there was that the Minister or the Department could do about it.  I mentioned, too, the fact that we had a certain area under grain crops, that there was nothing the Minister could do to enlarge the area, and nothing the Minister could do to assist in saving that crop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I well appreciated the position inasmuch as it affected the constituency I represent, a constituency which is amongst the worst in the Twenty-six Counties, and I was really anxious to know what it was the Government, the Minister or the Department could do to assist in solving what anyone looking at it would regard as a very serious problem.  I asked if they would agree to the importation of fodder.  The Minister has referred to the fact that fodder is being imported into the Six Counties, and has seen fit to express his opinion on the wisdom of that policy.  I do not know whether that is a wise or a foolish policy, but I am prepared to admit that our Six County neighbours are fairly shrewd people, and, because I have not got the facts on which their decision to import fodder was based, I am not prepared to go further than saying that, because they had made that decision, they must have some reason for it.  I was, however, anxious to ask the Minister a question that has not yet been asked and with which he did not deal in his rather long speech.  Suppose he is wise in the conclusion at which he has arrived that the importation of fodder is a foolish policy, what has the Minister <Col N="1699" /> to say with regard to the exportation of fodder from this State?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true, except where farmers have land across the Border.  They may then bring hay from one side to the other, but they are not allowed to export for sale.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to dispute the information which has been conveyed across the floor to me, but I want to say that, so far as my information is concerned, it does not seem to tally with the information which I have got.  If the Minister has decided that the policy of importation is foolish, I certainly recommend that he be careful to take steps to ensure that not only will fodder not be exported under licence but that it will not be exported without a licence at all.</P>
      <P>I was anxious to speak before the Minister because, I suppose for the first time.  I wished to indicate to the House that I personally had a good deal of sympathy with the Minister in the position in which he now finds himself. I was Minister in 1947, a year which has been referred to.  I was not very long in office, and most Deputies will remember the sort of year that was.  I was called upon to come forward here and discuss a motion tabled by the then Opposition, which, by the way, happens to be the major element in the present Government, fairly late in the Spring, when very little ploughing had been done and when it was not a question, important as it is, of feeding our live stock but a matter of our capacity in the years that followed to feed human beings.  I could not thaw the snow on the ground, or keep the ploughs going.  Tractors, although we had some, were unprocurable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They were few and far between.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Why they were unprocurable <Col N="1700" /> is understandable.  I was called upon to come forward here and tell the House and the country what were the prospects and what were the plans and so on for dealing with the situation confronting us, and perhaps it is because of my experience on that occasion that I found myself in some difficulty to understand the motion we have before us, just as I found myself in a difficulty in understanding the resolution from the committee of management of the co-operative society in my own county.  The terms of the motion obviously must be accepted by any Government or any Minister with the slightest appreciation of the importance of the matter to which it refers.</P>
      <P>There are some few points which the Minister put forward with which I cannot find myself in agreement.  For example, there may not be any doubt in the minds of many of us that, after three or four months, cattle prices will again gather strength and, to the extent that they have fallen, will recover themselves.  I am not disputing the wisdom or the accuracy of that forecast, but it is the height of nonsense for any man, whether he be a Minister for Agriculture or not, to come to this House, or outside of it, and tell me that in the month of September or October, when the land is drenched with water&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not send the Minister too many cards, especially Christmas ones.  While I sympathise with the difficulties of the present situation, and understand that farmers will have losses against which they cannot be guaranteed by anybody, I have been trying to explain that it is foolish for any man, whether he be a Minister <Col N="1701" /> or otherwise, to tell a farmer who happens to find himself carrying a very heavy stock in the early part of the year&mdash;a man whose land is naturally wet and who has had the experience that we all have had during the wet summer we have passed through, a man who has lost a quantity of his hay&mdash;to hold on to his stock. Undoubtedly, he will try and hold on to as much of his stock as he can. The point that I want to make is that it is the greatest nonsense and the most aggravating thing in the world for a Minister or for a Deputy or anybody else to lecture that man as to the amount of stock he should carry or as to the capacity of his holding to carry stock having regard to the amount of fodder which he has saved.</P>
      <P>It so happens that at the present time, a number of the Minister's personal friends in his own constituency, are engaged in the purchase of very small stock which, in a normal year, would be carried over as stores, and which are being purchased for immediate slaughter at bad prices.  Perhaps the prices that are being paid are as high as the circumstances of the times will allow.  Those men have purchased some stock of that type from myself, and I was very glad to have them as customers.  What is the use then of any man standing up here and starting off by lecturing us as to what we should do in that regard, as to the futility or foolishness of disposing of our stock when we know that we must sell them. Those men are very glad to purchase them, for the particular trade in which they are engaged, even though the cattle are in the condition which I have described.  I am not blaming anyone for that situation, the Minister or the Department of Agriculture.  I do not expect wonders from the Department, the Minister or the Government, but listening to the Minister on this motion I understand when he is talking sense and when he is talking nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had an assurance to-night that money will be made available through a number of sources which were mentioned. Is it not a strange thing, however, that after the winter of 1947, I introduced a scheme, with the consent and approval of the Government, to make available interest free loans <Col N="1702" /> to farmers who had suffered losses as a result of the severe conditions that we all remember during that winter? It was only a fortnight ago that I had a letter from a farmer who had paid all his instalments to date on the £100 which he secured under that scheme. He wrote telling me that he had two, three or four small cattle.  His letter seemed to me to be a very genuine one.  The complaint he made was that he had written to the Department of Agriculture, and was then referred to the Agricultural Credit Corporation. He told me that when he wrote to the latter body he was informed that the scheme was one which had been designed by the Minister, and that the terms of it could only be changed or altered by the Minister.  He seems to me to be a very genuine person, but, convincing and all as his case seemed to be, it would appear as if he were going to be referred from Billy to Jack, and not get the satisfaction to which I think he is entitled.  When that scheme was first introduced, I had in mind genuine people of his type.  They were the people I was anxious to see availing of it.  I felt that they might not be able to pay their instalments punctually because, as we can all understand, they would not be likely to be very flush with cash.  We all know how things will happen to a farmer which, so to speak, will knock him off his path. That can happen to people with the very best intentions.  They have to contend against such things as a bad summer, a bad harvest or a fall in the prices of young stock.  Anything of that kind may make a man feel that he will not be able to meet his instalment in the month of January.  I cannot recall from memory how many farmers took advantage of that scheme.  This is the only case that I have heard of so far.  There may be, or there may not be, others.  I suggest, if money is now going to be made freely available, that in the case of farmers who took advantage of that scheme and have met with difficulties as a result of the bad summer we have had, they should be met in some way and helped out of their difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That his next instalment will be due in the month of January. The reason why I have been so much impressed by the genuineness of this case is that, while the instalment is not due until January, this man wrote to me about it last month.  That would seem to indicate to me that he is very anxious to be able to pay his instalment. He strikes me as being a very fine type of man.  This is the case of a man who, in anticipation of his inability to pay his instalment in January next, was writing to me last month, having failed to induce the Department or the Agricultural Credit Corporation to extend the time limit for repayment under a scheme which was initiated following the disastrous winter and spring of 1947.</P>

No doubt there will be other such cases.</P>

      <P>Having read the correspondence I decided to go to the Credit Corporation.  They put up a proposition which seemed to be reasonable from their point of view but which was not reasonable in one sense.  When the scheme was introduced I expected cases of that type would arise.  During my time in the Department when schemes were introduced for that section of the farming community who could not very well get security, I found that in 99 per cent. of the cases, although they might be late in paying, ultimately they paid.  I do not want to <Col N="1704" /> boast about the class to which most of us belong, but I think it would not be untrue to say that you will get amongst the farming community a great percentage of honesty so far as meeting their liabilities is concerned.</P>
      <P>I understand the point of view expressed by Deputy Flynn.  I am not one of those whose name was attached to this motion.  As I have tried to indicate, I could not see the need for it, because I would have taken it for granted that any Government worth its salt would make an effort to help the farmers in this very trying time. When the farmers of Killeshandra approached Deputy O'Reilly and myself and suggested that the milk producing areas should have a preference, and when I got further correspondence suggesting that a preference should be granted in other cases, I could see the impossibility from the point of the Department of intervening in that regard.  So far as the fodder situation is concerned, a matter about which I feel very keenly is that there are farmers who are disposing of their cattle, in some cases at a bad price, in the hope of receiving for their hay&mdash; those of them who have been fortunate enough to save it very well&mdash;a price that will compensate them for the loss which they have sustained in selling their cattle at what we would regard as a small price, and getting an additional benefit over and above what they would receive if they fed the cattle to the end of the season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That could be sound economics if they had a special buyer for hay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be sound economics, but I would have my doubts about it.  There is a great danger however, especially having regard to my proximity to another area which the Minister knows.  I have a feeling that we should at least watch over what we have.  I am not suggesting that the Minister could but in and buy hay in one area and transfer it to another, but at least we should try to hold what we have saved reasonably well and it will ultimately, I suppose, find a market from one district to another. Let us hope that the situation, which <Col N="1705" /> is certainly bad in some areas, will not have disastrous results.  If the present weather conditions continue the dangers to which farmers felt they were exposed earlier may not arise.</P>
      <P>While there is every reason why the Minister and Deputies should encourage farmers to keep up their hearts, there is no use in our pretending that by the establishment of parish councils or the appointment of parish officers we are going to relieve the farmers of the losses that undoubtedly they will suffer as result of the unfavourable conditions which they have experienced for the last six or eight months.  If we expect to make an impression on the farmers' mind, it would be far better for us to show some appreciation of what is the real position. Whether he has two or three or 10 or 20 cows, the farmer is a fairly shrewd man.  There is no use in our trying to lecture farmers and tell them that they should hold on to stock which they know it will be better for them to sell now even at a bad price when there is some market for them rather than let them wither away on the land, as most of them have a fair idea as to what is the best thing to do in their own interest.  If the Minister can add anything to the knowledge that the farmer has as to how his business should be transacted or add to the amount of material available so that he can successfully maintain the largest number of stock that is possible for him, he will be making a far greater contribution than by talking the sort of nonsense to which we have listened in some parts of the speech just made by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>As I had occasion just a week ago to deal fairly extensively with the conditions which have led to the present motion, I have no need to add to what I said on that occasion.  I tried to put tangible evidence before the Minister and the House of the serious situation that confronts the live stock industry of the country owing to the unfavourable summer.  I did not ask the Minister to accept my own word for it.  I quoted figures as to the reduction in milk supplies to a very extensive creamery <Col N="1706" /> in order to show that already serious consequences were overtaking the country.  I do not appear to have impressed the Minister on that occasion, although he spoke in eloquent terms of his intimate knowledge of the situation and the dangers of it, with the result that other Deputies, being dissatisfied, arranged the motion we are now discussing and asked me if I were prepared to support it, which I did. The reason I was anxious to intervene at all on this discussion was to reply to some points made by the Minister in his reply to me on the Adjournment Debate on this night week.  In portion of his reply on that occasion at column 1033 of Official Report of 16th November, 1950, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The farmers of this country, and I am sure Deputy O'Reilly will agree with me, are not now, and never were beggarmen&mdash;and so long as they are able to earn their living they do not want to live on anyone else.  It is no reflection on any man to require credit facilities, provided he means to pay what is due.  Nobody wants to ask him to pay in a fortnight what he consumed in six months.  Nobody wants to ask him to undertake a burden of repayment which will cripple his domestic finances.  Nobody wants to ask him to undertake any obligation which, in the judgement of the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, would constitute an unreasonable burden on an honest and industrious man. But if any chancer or fraud or potential beggarman thinks that out of the trials of his neighbours he can perceive an opportunity for plundering the public purse, he never made a greater mistake in his life.  The chancers may make up their minds that they will get nothing for nothing: but the hard-working farmers of Cavan, Leitrim, Mayo, Meath, Westmeath and every other county in Ireland may rest assured that no beast need want in Ireland throughout this winter because credit or fodder is available to anyone who is prepared to work and who intends to pay.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Further down, in column 1034, the Minster said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1707" />&ldquo;I have no desire to constitute myself a Pooh Bah in every parish in this country.  I feel confident that the agricultural community of this country will be able to provide the machinery to protect themselves, but if the chancers are hoping to get up my sleeve they may start going down now because they will never get up past my elbow.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To an ordinary individual like myself, the inference to be drawn from that was that Deputies who drew attention to this serious situation on behalf of the people who made representations to them&mdash;that is, to Deputy Maguire and myself&mdash;were the mouthpiece of chancers, beggarmen and frauds.  I wonder if the people who, through no fault of their own, lost their hay and their crops can be described as chancers and potential beggarmen.</P>

If I ever made such a suggestion, I must have been under a hypnotic influence because I have no recollection of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I made a suggestion on the Adjournment Debate on this night week&mdash;the suggestion conveyed <Col N="1708" /> to the Minister and his Department from the chairman of the co-operative society in my area&mdash;that a subsidy for maize be provided to supplement the bad quality hay in my district and in the country so that the cattle would be saved from starvation and that a situation such as obtained in the spring and early summer of 1947 might not recur. I did not do that of my own volition because I have always felt that if the farming community got what I always advocated, the cost of production and a reasonable profit&mdash;let me repeat those words, a reasonable profit&mdash; they would be in a position, without seeking State aid or anything else, to provide for those bad years that are inevitable.  But the fact that during my memory they have not got that and the fact that the figures which I got yesterday in reply to a parliamentary question of the relative increases in the price of agricultural produce, in the price of clothing and in the cost of living bear out what I have always maintained&mdash;that the agricultural producer, in my memory at least, has not got a reasonable share of the national wealth.  Consequently, they are always in the low income group and when they meet a bad season such as 1947 and such as the present season, they are not able to meet the consequences without asking for assistance from some source, let it be a Government source or some other source.  However, as I have said, that suggestion of a subsidy came from the co-operative society and I conveyed it to the House.  If the present motion has awakened everyone in the State to the seriousness of the position should another bad winter come after the bad summer, it will have done a lot of good.</P>

It may not be so very necessary if we have a mild winter, as I hope we shall, but even if the winter is mild, it is a good thing to know that credit will be available. One point I should like to make is that everyone is anxious to give credit to people who, they know, are solvent and in good standing.  The shopkeeper will even force his goods on anyone he knows is well able to pay for it, especially if he sees that that individual is getting on reasonably well and is not likely to be a defaulter.</P>

      <P>The co-operative society in my area made credit available to its members for the past three years by the provision of fertilisers to apply to the grass lands&mdash;not for the purposes of cropping, which is a separate matter, but to be applied to grass lands with a view to increasing the milk supply to the creamery. <Col N="1710" /> Manures were made available in the month of October and spread on the grass lands, and the people who got the benefit of that credit were not asked to make any return until the following July and August, when the milk supply was increased and the farmers were having the benefit of it.  Everyone, as I say, is anxious to give credit when they see that there is a prospect of profitable development on the part of the person to whom the credit is given, but in this particular instance there was not much prospect of such development in the case of people who lost their crops and hay.  They are trying to make up the losses which they suffered, and they will have to repay the money advanced to them in two or three years, whilst the money has been used up in making good the losses they suffered last summer, so that there will be a difficulty in that case.</P>

      <P>How long should the credit be available&mdash;five, ten or 20 years?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOReilly" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it very likely that any individual or co-operative society would be prepared to go into the bank to raise an overdraft, pay interest on that, and make the money available free of interest over a period of ten or 20 years even to its own members.  However, if the motion has awakened the Minister and his Department to the seriousness of the situation, it is so much gained and perhaps, if God sends a mild winter, the position might turn out much better than people fear.</P>
      <P>The Minister made one point in connection with cattle prices when he quoted the reports of his inspectors as to prices at fairs in various counties. He gave special attention to Cavan. I suppose Cavan should be grateful for the distinction.</P>

      <P>I shall give them to you now.  The price for cattle from one to six months old in October, 1949, was £5 15s. Od. and in October, 1950, £5 per head; for cattle from six months to nine months old, the price in October, 1949, was £8 per head and in October, 1950, £8 per head; for cattle 15 months to two years old the price in October, 1949, was £22 per head and in October, 1950, £22 per head; for and for cattle for three years and over the price in October, 1949, was £40 per head and in October, 1950, it was £41 per head.</P>

      <P>I am glad to see that October was not deliberately omitted.  It is not for me to question the accuracy of these figures but, if I have any judgement at all, I fail to see where a calf from six to nine months old could be purchased in 1949 for £5 15s. Od.</P>

      <P>There is no question at all that cattle from two to three years, if they are in any condition, still fetch a good price.  However, if the motion has brought even a promise of credit, it is something achieved. The details, I suppose, will present difficulties, but we must expect that. We cannot expect that just overnight a perfect scheme could be made available. I hope it will run smoothly with helpful support from everyone but, for people who have lost practically half their year's income, I am afraid that credit facilities will not be sufficient.</P>

      <P>We have had an outcry for the past few weeks by Deputies speaking on behalf of workers on the bogs to the effect that their weekly wage on the average was only about 25/- in piece work as a result of the bad weather, so that, even on the bogs, the worker's income was cut down.  Naturally the farmers were also seriously affected by the bad weather, and while credit may help to keep them going, it will not give them any recoupment for the loss of their annual income.</P>

      <P>As one who supported this motion.  I accept the Minister's approach to it.  We tabled the motion, not as a matter of politics, but simply as a matter of urgency.  We fully realise the Minister's difficulties, and we are not asking for the moon.  We are demanding that cognisance be taken of the serious position of the farmers, particularly the small mountainy farmers, of whom there are many in my constituency, and other small farmers throughout the country.  They have sustained heavy losses during the harvest period, and we ask the Minister to devise ways and means whereby a scheme of real practical help can be inaugurated.  I and every Deputy in the House realise the difficulties inherent in this question.  I agree with the Minister's approach to it in so far <Col N="1713" /> as parish councils, credit societies, and other organisations of that kind are concerned, but I do not agree with his inclusion of the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  My experience of these people has been a very sad one.</P>
