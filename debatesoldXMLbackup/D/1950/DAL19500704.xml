      <P>I have received a letter dated the 16th May, 1950, from the Irish Anti-Partition League, Belfast, asking if I would consent to arrange a meeting between the leaders of the Dáil and Seanad and a deputation appointed at the last annual convention of the league, in connection with a decision of the convention to request the Government to admit the elected representatives of the Six Counties to the Dáil and Seanad.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he is prepared to recommend to the Local Appointments Commission that it is undesirable that police inquiries be made in Great Britain and Ireland into the private lives of medical men who have been accepted by the Local Appointments Commission to fill <Col N="408" /> positions in the public service in Ireland, as it causes unnecessary embarrassment and inconvenience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No police inquiries are made into the private lives of candidates for appointments filled through the Local Appointments Commissioners. It is, however, necessary for the commissioners to ascertain, before recommending a person to a local authority for appointment, whether he has come under the notice of the police.  The form requesting this information states specifically: &ldquo;It is not desired that inquiries should be made as a result of this communication. It will be sufficient to state whether anything is on record or is known to the police.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If any such inquiries have been made by police authorities abroad, this will have been done despite the explicit request of the commissioners.</P>
      <P>It will, of course, be unnecessary for me to add that any information thus obtained is treated as absolutely confidential.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, to the police authorities; but it contains the passage that I have cited.  The general purport is to request if there is any police record, if I may put it that way, but the police are requested or directed not to make any inquiries other than what they know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not clear to the Taoiseach that in actual fact the result of that is that police inquiries are likely to be made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not at all clear; quite the contrary is clear.  There may be exceptions, but the general rule is that no such inquiries have in fact been made.</P>

      <P>The particulars requested by the Deputy are not available.  The only information available on the classification by size of all personal incomes (other than from agriculture, forestry, fishing) is that, for the years 1938 and 1943, contained in Table 6 of the White Paper on National Income and Expenditure, 1938-44 (P. No. 7356).  Particulars for incomes assessed to surtax for the years 1939-40 and 1940-41, which include incomes earned in the years 1938-39 and 1939-40 respectively, are available in Table 81 of the 22nd and 23rd annual reports of the Revenue Commissioners.  The data set out therein are subject to variation according as further assessments are made or the existing ones adjusted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state the acreage and price per acre received by the Land Commission for lands let in conacre or on the 11 months' system and if he will state what steps are being taken to acquire lands let in conacre or on the 11 months' system for the relief of congestion in the Counties of Laoighis and Offaly and elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the first part of the question refers to lands let by the Land Commission for tillage.  The latest period for which returns of such lettings are readily available is that ending on 31st October, 1949.  For that period about 1,700 acres were let by the Land Commission in conacre throughout the Twenty-Six Counties at an average rent of £2 13s. 0d. per acre.</P>
      <P>As regards the latter part of the question, one of the main considerations which influence the Land Commission in their decisions as to what lands should be acquired, is whether the lands are being let in conacre or otherwise.  There is no distinction, in this regard, between Laoighis and Offaly and the other counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say offhand what steps the Land Commission has taken in regard to the farms the Deputy has in mind, but one of the principal considerations is the suitability <Col N="413" /> of the land for Land Commission purposes.  There may be plenty of land let in conacre which would not be suitable for Land Commission purposes and the Land Commission would not, therefore, interest itself in it.</P>

The examinations recently held to give certain temporary staff an opportunity to gain establishment were confined to that group, subject to the proviso that candidates must have had at least one year's service and must have been serving on 1st May, 1950.  There was, therefore, no question of such officers being in competition with candidates still at school.  Officers who fail to secure permanent appointments as a result of these examinations will, subject to staffing requirements, be retained on their existing weekly tenure.

      <Col N="426" /> With regard to column (d), the numbers given represent the applications in respect of which inspectors' reports have not yet reached headquarters, but a proportion of these cases have already been inspected on the site.</P>
    <P>As regards (e), it would be impossible to say in how many cases offers were not accepted by the applicants because of their inability to pay the contributions asked for.  The great majority of non-acceptances consist of cases in which the applicants make no reply at all to the offer.</P>
    <P>So far as (f) and (g) of the question are concerned, the revised terms of the scheme are being made retrospective for all applications in which offers had not issued before the date of the announcement of the new terms. These latter were advertised in the daily papers for 3rd June, 1950, and in the provincial Press in all counties, in the week ended 10th June, 1950.  Apart from this, no individual notification of the revised terms has been sent to earlier applicants who had not accepted offers made to them, because:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  of the very large number of cases involved, and the amount of time of the clerical staff which would be required to ascertain the particulars from hundreds of individual files;</P>
    <P>(2)  as pointed out in reply to (e) above, in most cases there is no means of knowing which offers were not accepted owing to the applicants' inability to make the cash contribution asked for;</P>
    <P>(3)  in a large proportion of the cases, the original estimates would now be out of date owing to increases in wages and the probable deterioration of the works since the inspection was made. It is open to the applicants in these cases to submit fresh application forms which will be dealt with as far as possible in the order of their receipt.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is <Col N="431" />&ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I understand that the contractor for the scheme in question expects to have the work completed by the end of next September.  I understand also that he has recently been asked by the local authority to state the reasons for his failure to have the scheme completed within the specified period and that his explanation is awaited.  The contract provides that the penalty for failure to complete within the specified period is £10 per week for every week during which the work remains unfinished, unless an extension of time is granted as provided for in the contract.  The enforcement of the penalty clause in this case is a matter for the Cork County Council, and I am not aware of their intentions in this respect.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he is aware (a) that the hours of duty of the non-nursing personnel of the Thurles District Hospital and Nenagh (St. Joseph's) Hospital, who are members of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, are excessive, being 100 hours per week in respect of the gate porter, and 80 hours in respect of male attendants and the ambulance driver, who is on call for duty day and night; (b) that representations to the county manager over the period since 11th March, 1949, have been ineffective and that a request for a conference on the matter was not granted, and (c) that representations to his Department since 7th July, 1949, have been equally ineffective, and whether, in view of his various pronouncements regarding the serious strain inflicted by unduly long hours on the mental and physical resources of members of such staffs and having regard to his recommendation to public health authorities favouring the introduction of a 96-hour fortnight, he intends to take any steps to alleviate the undue hardship under which those people are working.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a 96-hour fortnight for non-nursing personnel is not in operation in the institutions referred to.</P>
      <P>On the 7th July, 1949, I received representations from the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union in Connection with the hours of duty of the employees referred to in the question.  I requested the observations of the county manager on this matter, and was informed by him that while the hours were long, he considered that they did not represent in any manner the amount of work done. The county manager stated also that if arrangements were made to shorten the duty hours of these employees, similar arrangements would have to be made for every other person holding similar posts, irrespective of the amount of work performed by each employee and whether the amount of work done would be commensurate with the remuneration paid.</P>
      <P>I indicated to the county manager that while I appreciated that in the case of these employees the nominal hours of duty did not represent the amount of work done, I felt nevertheless that it was unreasonable to expect officers to remain technically on duty or to be on call for excessively long hours, even though their work might not be heavy or exacting.  I accordingly suggested to him that, with a view to eliminating hardship, the possibility of appointing a substitute officer who would be able to relieve where necessary officers who by reason of the peculiar nature of their duties are obliged to work unduly long hours might be considered.</P>
      <P>In his reply, the county manager stated that he did not consider that the amount of physical or mental work performed by these employees during their hours of duty was such as to justify the work being measured against the 96-hour fortnight for nurses, mental hospital attendants, etc.</P>
      <P>The officers concerned are in the employment of the local authority, and it is for that body to submit proposals to me to remedy the situation. If I receive such proposals, I will give them sympathetic consideration.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if his intended proposals to voluntary hospitals to curtail seriously certain aspects of hospital administration arising from the expected disappearance of assistance from the Hospitals Trust funds to meet deficiencies, will not seriously militate against the expressed policy, announced by him, to increase hospitalisation and to make hospitalisation more readily available to the general public; and, further, if he will state when depreciation of the capital assets of the Hospitals Trust funds first began, and when he expects his hospital building programme will have entirely exhausted existing assets of the fund, and what steps he proposes to take to ensure that there will be no crisis arising in the administration of each voluntary hospital hitherto benefiting from these funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he will not reconsider the expenditure to exhaustion of Hospitals Trust Fund on capital items, and revert to the previous policy of holding substantial funds for investment to meet deficiencies in existing hospitals, which otherwise will cause extra indirect charges on the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, a Chinn Chomhairle, with your permission, to take Questions Nos. 53 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>There is no foundation whatever for the Deputy's statement that I propose to curtail, seriously or otherwise, certain aspects of hospital administration. Neither is there any truth in his further statement that assistance from the Hospitals Trust Fund to meet hospital deficits is to disappear.  The recent decision to fix at the high figure of £400,000 the amount which will be payable to the participating hospitals by way of recoupment of deficits in respect of each of the years 1950, 1951 and 1952 is sufficient refutation of these statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initiation and energetic execution to date of the seven-year hospital building programme should be sufficient earnest of the announced policy to <Col N="437" /> make hospitalisation readily' available to the general public.</P>
    <P>Depreciation of the capital assets of the Hospitals Trust funds began when the purchasing power, in terms of goods and services, of these assets commenced to decline.  If the cost-of-living index figure may be taken as a criterion, that process commenced in 1933. The rate of decline accelerated considerably since the commencement of the recent war.  Falls in the market value, in terms of money, of the investments contributed further to the decline.</P>
    <P>Owing to the many factors, in regard to time and cost, incapable of correct measurement beforehand involved in the planning and execution of a very extensive programme of construction and the fact that income continues to accrue to the fund from sweepstakes, it is not possible to give any estimate of the precise time at which what is generally regarded as the capital of the fund will have become exhausted; but I regard as a sounder national policy the provision of much-needed hospital accommodation than the building up of an investment reserve, a policy which the experience of the past ten years has shown to be a thoroughly bad one. Had the policy which I am now pressing been pursued energetically in previous years, many of the hospitals which are only now in process of construction or planning would have been available long since to the public, and at a fraction of the cost which is involved in their provision now.  In these circumstances I do not propose to change the present policy.</P>
    <P>The most important of the immediate steps being taken to avert any crisis of the type visualised in the question in the affairs of the participating hospitals have already been notified to those hospitals.  These include: (1) The decision already mentioned to stabilise the deficits in respect of the years 1950, 1951 and 1952, and (2) the decision that public assistance authorities might pay to the voluntary hospitals in respect of patients sent by them to such hospitals a figure for maintenance more closely approximating to the actual cost of maintenance than the present <Col N="438" /> payment, a matter with which I shall deal in more detail in reply to later questions on the Order Paper.  I regard these steps as adequate for the present.</P>
    <P>I propose to provide the Deputy with full information in regard to the stabilisation of the amount of the deficit in introducing the Estimate for my Department in the immediate future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, a Chinn Chomhairle, with your permission, to take Questions Nos. 54, 50 and 51 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no information as to the size of the actual deficits of the participating hospitals in 1951 and 1952.  The only information I have in respect of 1950 is on the basis of estimates submitted by the hospitals to the Hospitals Commission <Col N="439" /> in the latter part of last year. The aggregate of these estimates is £474,000, but that figure necessarily takes no account of the increased income accruing from the decision to authorise an increase of 10/6 per week in the capitation fee paid by local authorities in respect of their patients or of a decision of the Minister for Social Welfare to increase the capitation fee paid for National Health Insurance patients from £2 12s. 6d. to £4 4s. 0d. a week or of other measures recommended to the hospitals as a means of increasing income or of the saving of overdraft interest resulting from much earlier payment of deficit grants (45 per cent. of the estimated 1950 deficit has already been paid and a further 45 per cent. will be paid on 30th September whereas in respect of previous years no payment was made until March and April of the year following) or of economies which hospitals may be able to effect without interfering with the standard of the services provided.</P>
    <P>I wish to make it clear that the increase authorised in the capitation rate payable by local authorities was intended primarily to bring that rate more into line with present-day costs of hospital maintenance and treatment. The ascertained cost of maintenance in some of the Dublin hospitals is considerably in excess of the figure now authorised.</P>
    <P>Public assistance authorities are under a statutory obligation to provide medical care and attention for every person who is eligible therefor in their public assistance districts and to make due provision for that purpose.  In the performance of their statutory duties public assistance authorities send patients for maintenance and treatment to voluntary hospitals, and it was never the intention that the Hospitals Trust Fund should be entitled to subsidise public assistance authorities in the performance of their statutory duties.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the increase in the capitation charge payable by local authorities will amount to £50,000 a year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="440" /> Under the Health (Financial Provisions) Act, 1947, any increase in expenditure by local authorities on recognised health services (including maintenance of their patients in voluntary hospitals) over that incurred by them in the standard year 1947-48 will be met, initially in full and later as to 50 per cent., out of the health grant. The full amount of the increase in respect of the year 1950 will be borne on the Vote for Health for the current year and appropriate provision has been made in the Estimate which will shortly go before the House.  Accordingly no part of the increase will fall on the local rates.  The same position will apply in respect of most, if not all, local authorities, in respect of the two following years.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention to enforce any economies on the voluntary hospitals, but I presume those hospitals, in the interests of efficient management, will have due regard to any suggestions which may be made to them from time to time by the Hospitals Commission.</P>
    <P>To remove a misconception arising from the Deputy's statement that deficits &ldquo;up to the present&rdquo; have been &ldquo;made good from the interest of invested moneys in the hands of the Hospitals Trust Fund&rdquo;, I should, perhaps, say that the income which accrued to the fund from investments has never exceeded £330,500 and that the sum previously notionally set aside in the fund as an endowment for payment of deficits was of the order of £5,720,000, producing income of only £201,413.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to quote the following extract from the circular issued by the Hospitals Commission in connection with the present deficits scheme:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The commission is aware that hospital authorities have been keenly alive to the extreme seriousness of the deficit position and, from time to time, representations have been made by members of hospitals boards that more effective measures of internal control of expenditure might be achieved if hospitals were informed in advance of the amount of the grants they might expect to have paid to them in respect of the following <Col N="441" /> year's deficits.  It was contended that the current system of paying the deficits tended to sap the initiative of boards of management, since under it there did not appear to be the required incentive to economise.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It will be apparent from that extract that hospital authorities themselves were of opinion that the previously existing practice of payment of hospital deficits without limitation was bad and should not continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's rather lengthy answer to what he calls my five statements, might I first of all point out to him that they were not five statements but five questions? Is he aware that these questions were framed by me from the circular to which he referred which was sent to each of the hospitals?  Does he not agree that the whole system is being changed, and that the amount of money that was being built up for the purpose of producing an annual rate of interest to meet the deficits of the hospitals is now disappearing, according to the circular of the Hospitals Commission, and disappearing very rapidly?  Further, is he not aware that certain hospitals in the City of Dublin are apprehensive of what is meant in the circular by the suggestion that there will have to be reductions in cost of administration which, in a number of hospitals, is as low as possible?  Further, is he not aware that hospitals have agreements with, for instance, the Transport Workers' Union, whereunder they take in members of the families of union members at two guineas a week and that they will now have to break that agreement and to charge the union members four guineas for treating members of their families?  I should like the Minister to understand that it would be impossible for me to deal adequately with his answer at the present moment, and I will wait for the Estimate for the Minister's Department, when I will be in a position to deal with this matter in more detail.</P>

      <P>On the last day when the House met I was dealing with the question of pigs and bacon.  I had almost concluded that particular item, but there was a difference of opinion about the words of the Minister in relation to a reduction of the price. I have the reference now which will make it clear.  In column 2172 of Volume 121 Deputy McQuillan's speech on the Agriculture Estimate is reported. He asked the Minister to look into the question of reducing the price of bacon.  The Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;And perfectly right; 260/- is an excessive price and it must come down.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The report proceeds:&mdash;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;If that does not succeed the resources of civilisation are not exhausted.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I presume that to mean that if it did not come down in the way the Minister hoped, he would have to deal with the matter further.  That indicates the Minister's hope that the price of bacon would be reduced.</P>

      <P>A few days afterwards, <Col N="444" /> and during the same debate, when Deputy Childers was speaking&mdash; Volume 122, column 184&mdash;he asked the Minister how far he had got with his proposal to have the price of bacon reduced, and the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;10/- a cwt. and another 10/- I hope next Monday.</P>
      <P>Mr. Childrens: So far as I know, in one town in Ireland, at any rate, the price of bacon has gone up.</P>
      <P>Mr. Dillon: The curers brought it down by 10/- a cwt. and any grocer who has not taken down the price of bacon proportionately is a rogue.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We are, of course, accustomed to the Minister's habit of calling people rogues and racketeers if they do not fall in with him, or if for one reason or another, they make it impossible for him to carry out his wishes, whether they be pious or otherwise.  He refers to the grocers in this case as rogues if they did not bring down the price of bacon.  All of us have seen a number of communications since then in the daily papers from the organisation which claims to have among its members most of the grocers in this country &mdash;R.G.D.A.T.A.  They claim that the price of bacon did not come down.  In fact, they have said that only one factory reduced the price of bacon, and that the other factories did not, and that it would be impossible, therefore, for the grocers to reduce the price of bacon, at any rate for the reason which the Minister gave.  Well, very naturally, they resented the accusation made by the Minister that their members were all rogues.  I think it is very unfortunate, indeed, that the Minister should indulge in that type of slander so often in this House by calling members of various organisations who do not seem to fall in with his wishes racketeers and rogues.  I think it is only fair that the Minister, when winding up this debate which, I presume, will take place very soon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As far as I am concerned I will not detain him very long, but, as I say, I hope that, when winding up the debate, he will make amends to those people.  There are other organisations which I hope to refer to before I finish, and I hope that, in their case also, he will make amends to them, and to quite a number of groups of people in his winding up speech.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go back on what I said last week about pigs and bacon, or on the various pronouncements that have been made by the Minister on this bacon question, to the changes that he had made in these pronouncements, and to his vacillating from one side to the other.  In view of all that, it is very difficult for farmers to know how they stand at the moment.  There was admittedly a tendency for increased production of pigs for some time, but it looks now as if production is going back again.  It is no wonder because farmers do not know where they stand in regard to the price of feeding or as to what will be paid for pigs, and also because the Minister threatens the curers at one time that he will open new factories or export pigs, while at other times he appeals to them to bring down the price of bacon which, of course, means that the curers must being down the price of pigs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, coming to the question of milk and butter, it is rather a strange thing that there has been very little variation in the number of cows in this country over the last 50 years. The percentage change is not very high.  The number goes up at certain times and it comes down at certain times, but there is not that very big variation that we have in the case of pigs and of other animals.  The yield from cows may vary.  It may vary according to the feeding or according to weather conditions.  Of course, weather conditions will affect feeding, too.  One has a rather complicated calculation to make, and a complicated number of factors to keep in mind every year when discussing the milk yield of cows.  Deputies on all sides of the House will admit, I think, that the dairying industry is the basic <Col N="446" /> industry of agriculture, and that if it were to fail not only would we have less milk and butter, but we would have less cattle and less feeding in the way of skim milk for poultry, pigs and other animals.  Therefore, it is really a basic industry, and so we should do everything in our power to see that the dairying industry is maintained, and in fact to do everything in our power to increase the number of cows.</P>
    <P>The first act of the Minister, when he came into power, was to withdraw the subsidy on farmers' butter.  The Minister will give his own reasons for doing that.  I think he was wrong in doing it, because up to that time almost half the cows of the country were owned by farmers who made farmers' butter.  The other half, or a bit more than half, of the cows were owned by farmers who supplied milk to the creameries.  In doing away with the subsidy on farmers' butter, the Minister was dealing a very severe blow to the dairying industry.  When I say that half the cows of the country were owned by farmers who did not deal with the creameries, I am not giving, perhaps, a true picture of the real situation if you take into account the fact that a far bigger number than half the farmers of the country are interested in farmers' butter rather than creamery butter because of the big areas where there are no creameries, and where you have small farmers who are interested only in farmers' butter. In that way, a greater number of farmers of the country were affected by the withdrawal of this subsidy. Not every farmer, of course, who makes farmers' butter is interested in the sale of butter because, in many cases, a small farmer has only enough milk and butter for his own family needs, and he has none for sale.</P>
    <P>Therefore, he does not mind what the price of farmers' butter is; but, making allowance for all these considerations, there was at that time a large number of farmers interested in the sale of farmers' butter, and the subsidy was withdrawn.  Now, up to that time, whether a farmer made farmers' butter or supplied his milk to the creamery, he got roughly the same <Col N="447" /> return for it, and that was the idea behind the subsidy for farmers' butter. That subsidy was withdrawn.  In the first place, I think it was unjust to do that, because it was discriminating against a certain class of farmer. These farmers receive no subsidy any longer for their butter because they make farmers' butter, but, like other taxpayers, they have to contribute to taxation, part of which goes in the subsidy to the creameries.  The farmers, therefore, who made farmers' butter were put in a very invidious position. They had to pay taxes, part of which went, not exactly to their neighbours, but to another group of farmers who were creamery farmers while they got no advantage themselves.</P>
    <P>As I said here before, on more than one occasion, in my opinion the farmers who made farmers' butter were, on the whole, a more industrious class than those who sent their milk to the creameries.  After all, I think it is only common-sense to say that the farmer and his wife who not only milk their cows, but also separate the milk and make butter from the separated cream, are more industrious than the farmer and his wife who milk their cows, put the milk in a can, put the can on a cart and send it to the creamery, or, if not, put the can of milk at the gate where it is collected by a lorry which takes it to the creamery.  We were, therefore, in withdrawing this subsidy on farmers' butter hitting an industrious class of farmers, and hitting what we admire as a rule in people, the initiative to go out and try to make a living for themselves.</P>
    <P>Now, undoubtedly, the tendency of such a step would be to lessen the number of cows.  It is all very fine for any Deputy to say to me, &ldquo;Why does not the farmer bring his milk to the creamery?&rdquo; Well, there is no creamery available in a lot of these districts.  It may be possible to organise creameries in part of an area which, up to this, was producing farmers' butter, but it will never be possible to organise creameries all over.  Therefore, there is no redress for the farmer who makes farmers' butter.  I would say that, in most cases, there is no redress, and so if he then <Col N="448" /> finds it is not paying him to carry on, he is tempted to get rid of some of his cows.</P>
    <P>At the present time these farmers are bringing their butter to market and receiving from 1/6 to 1/9 per lb. At least, that is what they received during the months of May and June. It is possible that, as the year goes on, they will get more, but they will only get more when they have a lesser quantity of butter to sell.  Then the butter will have a scarcity value.  Now, while butter is in fairly plentiful supply, they are only getting ? to 1/9.  That means that they can expect to get only about 7d. per gallon for their milk, while the other group of farmers supplying milk to the creameries are getting ½ per gallon. I do not say that ½ is too much; I shall deal with that figure later on.  It is not fair, in my opinion, as between one group of farmers and another, that one should get 7d. per gallon and the other ½ per gallon.  The man who gets 7d. is actually contributing in taxation to ensure that ½ to the creamery supplier because part of his milk is subsidised from taxation.</P>
    <P>As far as the creamery suppliers are concerned, more than half the farmers are now sending their milk to the creameries.  Since early in 1947 they have been getting ½ per gallon during the summer months and ¼ per gallon during the winter months.  When that price was fixed by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1947, there were certain Deputies sitting on the Opposition Benches at that time who were dissatisfied with that price and thought it was not enough.  They agitated for an increase in that price. The extraordinary thing is that those same Deputies are now sitting on the Government Benches and appear to be perfectly satisfied with ½.  Despite the fact that costs have since gone up, particularly in relation to wages, rates and so on, they now appear to be quite content with the price; in fact, they are fighting what one might describe as a rearguard action in an effort to maintain the present price.</P>
    <P>On the 18th March, 1950, the Minister for Agriculture went down to Dungarvan <Col N="449" /> and addressed the county committee of agriculture there and, through the Waterford county committee, the rest of the farmers throughout the country.  He told them in his opinion the price could not be maintained and he advised those farmers supplying milk to the creameries to accept 1/- per gallon.  He said that he would give them a guarantee to maintain that price for five years if they would accept it.  I must say that at that time I found it very difficult to understand how the Minister could possibly expect the farmers to take a lesser price than they were getting in 1947-48 since costs have increased considerably. I still find it difficult to understand that.  The Minister for Agriculture has the direction of policy. Evidently it is his opinion that it would be better to have the price brought down to 1/- per gallon.  He must have felt very strongly about the matter when he went to address the county committee of agriculture at Dungarvan. In a well-prepared speech, which he subsequently printed and circulated, he put forward this proposal, not to the county committee but to the farmers of Ireland.  I take it that at that time he considered this was the proper policy.  I do not suppose any Minister for Agriculture would address a meeting of that kind and make a serious proposal of that nature, which, I am quite sure, he realised would not be very popular, unless he believed that it was the best policy for the farmers. If he did believe that, why did he not go on with it?  Presumably the Minister, having learned the reactions to his proposal not alone from the farmers but from the members of the Coalition Parties, felt that he must soft-pedal.  I think it is a serious matter that we should have a Minister who is convinced that a certain course of action is right, but because some back benchers whose votes are necessary to the maintenance of the Government object, immediately falls back on the beautiful democratic principle of consulting the farmers themselves.  Of course that was really laughable.  It was absurd to ask the farmers whether they would prefer to have 1/- or 1/2, but the Minister fell back on that <Col N="450" /> democratic principle because, as we all know, the Government was in danger.</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary to point out again all the instances we have had.  It will suffice if I mention one.  About the same time the Minister thought he would save the Exchequer a certain amount of subsidy if he cut the ration of creamery butter to which the farmer was entitled.  There are Deputies on the Government Benches who do not know a great deal about these matters and it is our duty to ensure that we do not leave them in doubt.  Since rationing was introduced the supplier of milk to the creamery was entitled to a much bigger ration than the ordinary householder. The ration worked out at 12 ounces for every member of the farmer's household.  The Minister apparently thought that was unfair to the Exchequer and he decided to reduce it to eight ounces, thereby saving the subsidy on the four ounces per week to every member of the farmer's household. The farmers objected.  Here, the Minister did not adopt the democratic system of putting the matter to a plebiscite of the farmers; he pursued his policy because the members of the Coalition Parties did not object.  That is the important point.  They did not say that they would vote against the Government on this particular proposition and the Minister was, therefore, able to pursue his particular policy in that respect.  It may be pointed out here that the Minister, apparently, can vary his democratic principles from day to day.  Sometimes when he has to fall back on the democratic principle he is democratic; and sometimes he is not.</P>
    <P>He dropped his proposition with regard to the price of milk to the creameries although I am quite certain he felt it was the proper line to pursue.  He was convinced it was the proper line.  We shall never get anywhere so long as we have a vacillating and pusillanimous Minister for Agriculture, such as we have at the moment.  It would be better for the country that we should have a man of principle&mdash;even if we have to sacrifice the present Minister for Agriculture&mdash;who is prepared to put his proposition through even though he falls on it.  We may be able to get on <Col N="451" /> without him, but we cannot get on so long as we have Ministers who have no principle and do not know their own minds from day to day.</P>
    <P>Another matter arises out of the creamery industry.  When I commenced speaking here the other night, I quoted three or four different passages in which the Minister told us in 1948 that, on account of the Agreement made between this Government and the British Government in 1948, we had a remunerative market for four years certain and, he hoped, for longer for everything that the land of Ireland could produce.  Butter was mentioned on the Minister's list. If we had a remunerative market for butter in Britain, this proposition made to the county committee of agriculture in Waterford would never have been necessary.  The reason why this proposition was made was that the Minister foresaw that we might have a surplus of butter and that, when we would come to sell that surplus, we would get only a certain price on the British market, not a remunerative price, not a price that would enable the creameries to pay ½ a gallon for milk.  I am sure &mdash; as a matter of fact the Minister's plebiscite proves it &mdash; that the farmers of this country do not consider anything less than ½ a gallon a remunerative price.  I am not sure if they are contented with even ½, but they were not satisfied to take less than ½.  That is just the minimum that might be called a remunerative price. If we have a surplus on home consumption, and if we go to look for a market for that surplus, there is no market to be found that will take butter on that basis, therefore we have not a remunerative market for it.  The Minister has again been proved wrong when he said we had a remunerative market for all the produce of the land of this country for four years certain, and for perhaps longer.  The British market so far as that is concerned is not remunerative.</P>
    <P>We could, perhaps, turn our hands to something else.  You can get more from milk than butter.  You could, for instance, make cream and send it to <Col N="452" /> England but they will not take it.  At least up to this they would not take it at all, so there is no remunerative market for cream in Britain.  Therefore, what the Minister said in 1948, that there was a remunerative price for all our surplus produce, is again proved wrong.  The Minister again suggests that we might turn to cheese.  We shall have to wait and see how it gets on but it is a very bad thing to base your farming on a system of trial and error.</P>
    <P>I want to go back to the British market for a moment in regard to the question of farmers' butter.  There was a surplus of farmers' butter last year. I do not know yet how we stand this year, but last year there was a surplus. We sold that surplus in Britain and the price obtained for it regulated the price our farmers received here at home.  I should like any Deputy opposite to go to any farmer who is making farmer's butter in this country and ask him is he getting a remunerative price for his butter on the market.  I think I can guess what the answer will be, that he is not satisfied at all that it is a remunerative price, so the British market failed there again so far as farmers' butter is concerned.  At any rate, you would imagine that the Minister would do his best in the British market, but at a time when he was negotiating for its sale or selling this butter on the British market on May 24th, 1949, as reported in column 1839, Volume 115, the Minister told us what the farmers' butter was like that he was going to sell outside:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any scheme which, at the end of 12 months, leaves your successor with 2,000 cwts. of butter surrounded by a <i>cordon sanitaire</i> at the port of Dublin and which requires almost the fire brigade in gas masks to get it on board ship for export to a processing factory is scarcely one which can aptly be described as `perhaps not perfect', and not assumed to have reached the stage where Deputy Smith would describe it as having failed.  The butter would blow the roof off the cold store.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan then put in:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Or would have walked off the quays.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="453" /> To that the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It very nearly did, but we headed it off before we shipped it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister, who is supposed to be a responsible man and supposed to do his best for the farmers of this country, is much more interested in making a joke here in this House than in getting a good price for the farmers' butter. I think it was a scandalous thing for any man, whether a Minister or anybody else, if he wants to sell an article and says in public what he thinks about it, to describe it in that way. That is, as I say, the Minister's humour, but it is not humour that is putting a lot of money into the pockets of farmers who produce farmers' butter.</P>
    <P>We shall now see what we have to say about eggs.  When the Minister was talking about this agreement in 1948, as reported in column 2245, Volume 112, he said, in regard to the egg agreement, that he would give credit where credit was due, that the egg agreement was negotiated by Deputy Smith: &ldquo;For its merits thank him.&rdquo;  That was a noble tribute.  The agreement was made by Deputy Smith when he was Minister for Agriculture, round about October, 1947.  As a result of that agreement, the producer in this country was getting 3/- a dozen.  We have not yet reached the stage in this country where we can rear, or at least hatch out, pullets only. Half of them when they come out are cocks.  In order to help out the producers of poultry, cockerels received a very good price during the early months of the year.  On the 19th March, 1948, the Government Information Bureau announced that the Minister for Agriculture had sanctioned the maintenance of the then price of 3/- per dozen for eggs.  Deputies will remember that a month or two later the Minister went across to Great Britain to discuss the marketing of agricultural produce with the British Minister of Food and he threatened the British that he would drown them with eggs.</P>
    <P>In order to trace the Minister's actions from that time I may say that he wrote a foreword to a publication called P.E.P., which circulates amongst poultry producers in this <Col N="454" /> country, in the May issue of 1948, in which he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It used to be the rule that when egg supplies increased the price went down.  That is no longer true. We have made an agreement with the British Ministry of Food that the more eggs we send to the British market the more they will pay for our eggs.  It is as a result of this agreement that shippers can afford to pay 3/- per dozen for eggs to the producer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>For that we carried on at 3/- per dozen.  I find, however, that the Minister in addressing the Donegal Committee of Agriculture on 14th March, 1949, announced that as a result of his recent discussions with the British Government the new price would be 2/6 per dozen, not 3/-.  He went on to try to persuade the members of the committee that 2/6 would be as good to them as the 3/-.  On May 19th, he told Deputy Commons in the Dáil that he tried to persuade the British Minister to accept duck eggs, but failed.  Again, I should like to remind Deputies opposite that there again we failed to have a remunerative market in Great Britain for everything that the land of Ireland could produce.  Duck eggs were now crossed out.  As might be expected, with a vacillating policy of that kind the exports of eggs for the first three or four months of this year have been down compared with last year.</P>
    <P>Now the Minister has announced that for 1951 the price of eggs will be 2/- per dozen and 3/6 from 1st September, 1951, to 31st January, 1952. The uninitiated might be inclined to say that the mean price between 2/6 and 3/- would appear to be 2/9, but it depends on quantity.  As a matter of fact, I looked up the exports for the last 12 months, and I find that during the period when the high price will be payable, namely, from September to January, we export 7 per cent. of our eggs during those five months, and 93 per cent. during the period when we will get 2/- per dozen. That would appear to me to work out on an average at 2/1 per dozen.  Just as we thought that it was not the time <Col N="455" /> to reduce the price of milk to the creameries, neither can anybody argue that this is the time to reduce the price of eggs, because the price of feeding stuffs has gone up in the meantime, and that is the big factor in both cases.  If the price of feeding stuffs goes up, there should be a corresponding increase in the price of eggs and not a decrease such as we have got.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Smith, as Minister for Agriculture, made this agreement with the British Minister of Food and, as a result, was able to offer 3/- per dozen to the producers of eggs all the year round, that is, for the 93 per cent. as well as the 7 per cent., he was also able to announce a very attractive price for cockerels when they would be available for the market.  But cockerels are not getting anything like the same price now.  In fact, I heard complaints down the country that for three or four weeks up to the beginning of this week it was impossible to sell chickens or fowl at all.  Therefore, the promise of the Minister to the producers of eggs which he gave in that foreword to P.E.P. in May, 1948, that &ldquo;the more you produce the more you will get&rdquo; does not appear to have materialised. The opposite appears to be the case. The promise that he gave in the Dáil, when he came back in 1948 after the agreement was made with Great Britain, as to a remunerative market for everything the land of Ireland would produce also appears to have miscarried.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of my speech the Minister asked me to deal in detail with the various things mentioned.  I think I have dealt with everything on the live-stock side.  I want to deal now with the tillage side.  When we speak about tillage, we usually begin by talking about the fertility of the soil.  The Minister is keen on making a witty statement whether it is true or not.  As reported in Volume 111, column 2589, of the Official Reports, the Minister on 9th July, 1948, said in the Dáil:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... the fertility of the land in this country has reached a degree of degradation lower than has been known for 100 years past and we have <Col N="456" /> endemic in many parts of the country a condition known as aphosphorosis in which live stock consume the herbage of the soil and yet die of starvation because the soil contains no phosphates...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister evidently thought that he had hit on a fairly good thing there because he enlarged on it later and told his audiences in some parts of the country that he had seen cattle lying down and dying.  I suppose that was a rather frightening thing for the farmers who were afraid that they might see their cattle just lie down and die although they were getting plenty to eat.  Naturally we expected the Minister to make everything right.  He said he would and, I think, as a matter of fact, that he has claimed that he has made everything right.  &ldquo;The fertility of the soil is all right now.&rdquo;  We have heard nothing this year about aphosphorosis because the soil is all right owing to the beneficent smile of the Minister for Agriculture.  It was the Fianna Fáil régime that brought it and it was the Coalition régime that did away with it by Couéism and nothing else.  The cure for aphosphorosis is phosphate and I looked up the consumption of phosphate.  It comes into the country as raw phosphate or manufactured phosphate.  I found that in 1947 when Fianna Fáil were in power the imports of rock phosphate were 73,000 tons; of basic slag, 12,000 tons, and of superphosphate, 3,000 tons. There was a considerable increase in 1948-49.  The further we get away from the war the easier it should be to get phosphates.  The imports of rock phosphate were 113,000 tons in 1948 and 128,000 tons in 1949; the imports of basic slag went up to 22,000 tons in 1948 and 27,000 tons in 1949; the imports of superphosphates were 20,000 tons in 1948 and 34,000 tons in 1949.</P>
    <P>I do not expect Deputies opposite to have jotted down the figures and made calculations for themselves, but when I sat down to look at those figures I had the time to do so.  What interested me was whether the present Minister had conquered aphosphorosis or not.  No Deputy will deny that land suffering from aphosphorosis would take at least 4 cwt. to the acre, <Col N="457" /> in fact more.  That is a small dressing of phosphate for land suffering from aphosphorosis.  You will get pasture which is slightly deficient in phosphate and they tell you to put on 4 cwt. to the acre, but land where the Minister saw cows lying down to die should get more.  Even on the basis of 4 cwt., what quantity of land has the Minister succeeded in curing?  270,000 acres in 1948 and 400,000 acres in 1949, that is 670,000 in two years.  It will take the Minister, if he lives long enough and if he is Minister long enough, 50 years to do the job, and in the meantime the cows will be lying down to die &mdash; and the Minister will be looking at them &mdash; although they are getting enough to eat as they did under Fianna Fáil when he saw them lying down to die.  He has not done much in two years, but he has gone on to talk about something else.  He has forgotten about aphosphorosis and maybe it is just as well, because there was not a lot in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting everything mildly.  When the Minister took over the Department of Agriculture he issued advertisements in the spring of 1948 and appealed to farmers to produce more, but he never even mentioned wheat.  He said that oats, potatoes and barley should be grown and as far as the ordinary person in the country reading the advertisements was concerned, there was never a mention of wheat as if wheat could not be grown in this country.  He said nothing about it then but, according to column 2593, Volume 111, of the Dáil debates, he told us:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I hold precisely the same views now as I have always held about growing wheat on Irish land in times of peace when supplies are available from other sources.  In my judgment it is a `cod' and a waste of land.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He coined a phrase many years ago <Col N="458" /> when he said that wheat growing was a &ldquo;cod,&rdquo; and he has stuck to it fairly consistently; I would say more consistently than he has been about anything else, although he has not been altogether consistent.</P>
    <P>On the 5th May, 1948, he was talking at the Irish Ploughing Association dinner at Clery's.  They were all tillage farmers interested in tillage, and the Minister said &ldquo;wheat growing in peace time is all a `cod.&rdquo;' He sticks to that.  The Minister got a bad time, however, in the autumn of 1948.  After his advocacy of more potatoes and oats the farmers said to him &ldquo;what are we going to do with them?&rdquo; and they got cash for their wheat.  So the Minister learned something&mdash;it was an expensive education &mdash; during 1948, and issued an advertisement on the 19th March, 1949, to the farmers of Ireland, and said &ldquo;farmers who want a cash crop should grow wheat or malting barley.&rdquo; There was no such thing as wheat in the Minister's imagination in 1948, but he learned a lesson at the expense of the farmers of the country. On August 22nd, 1949, he was veering that way when he went down to speak to Muintir na Tíre at Limerick.  He appealed to the parish councils to encourage farmers to grow more wheat next year.  He had become almost a wheat convert during 1949, but something happened to the Minister.  I suppose he was not altogether convinced that he was on the right road. It was a new departure for the Irish farmer to grow wheat.  On February 8th, 1950, he told the Cooley farmers &ldquo;every barrel of wheat that is grown represents a heavy burden on the Exchequer.  I would prefer to see barley and oats.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder would any Deputy opposite be able to tell me from these quotations how the Minister stands with regard to wheat.  He says that wheat is all a &ldquo;cod,&rdquo; and at the same time he says that the farmers should grow wheat.  He tells the parish councils of Muintir na Tíre to get all the farmers to grow wheat next year.  He wants to make them all &ldquo;cods.&rdquo;  Then he goes to Cooley and tells the farmers that he would rather barley and oats.  It is very <Col N="459" /> hard to know how the Minister stands and I suppose that we will not get a clear cut pronouncement on policy when he is winding up.  He will probably indulge in one of his wild statements.</P>

      <P>The Deputy behind him says that he will give us the works. We know that, of course.  It was said by some Deputy the other day that he would not be there if he did not give us the &ldquo;works,&rdquo; because that is the only quality he has.  He must give us the &ldquo;works&rdquo; or he will lose his job.</P>
      <P>There was evidently a little dispute during the debate as to who it was fixed the present price of 62/6 per barrel for wheat.  If any Deputy is industrious enough and anxious enough to find out the truth, although I do not accuse Deputies opposite of that, to look up any of the morning papers of Saturday, 11th October, 1947&mdash;I do not see any Deputy opposite taking out his pencil to make a note of it &mdash; he will find that an official statement was issued by the Government Information Bureau &mdash; Fianna Fáil were the Government at the time and Deputy Smith was Minister for Agriculture &mdash; which set out the intentions of the Government for the following year with regard to tillage.  It stated that the Government would make a tillage Order and set out the percentages and then went on, under the heading &ldquo;Price of Wheat&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Government have furthermore decided, in the case of growers of wheat of the 1948 crop, to guarantee a price of 62/6 a barrel of 20 stones for wheat of the first grade.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want any Deputy to make one of these debating points that it was only an announcement and was not an Order.  The announcements with regard to tillage and prices were made every year in September or October.  I am glad I have made the Minister laugh, because I nearly made him cry last week.  They were always announced in September or October and the Orders were then prepared and issued, <Col N="460" /> so that there is not much to be made out of that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister came in here and fixed a five years' guarantee and we were all very glad he did so, although a few days after he described it as all &ldquo;cod&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister talks about getting in more wheat from a lesser acreage. Quite possibly, that was so in 1949, but any farmer will tell you that that year was the most favourable year for wheat since 1933.  I hope it will continue, but factors like these must be taken into consideration before we come to conclusions. For instance, last year the yield of oats was lower than in 1948, but we are still not going to say that on account of aphosphorosis we will never get oats grown again.  It was due to the fact that the weather did not suit the oats crop, and in all probability the yield will be up again this year, or if not, next year.  We are not going to lose heart and say: &ldquo;You must not sow any more oats because the yield was down last year.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As we are on the subject of oats I want to say that on February 28th, 1948, the Minister issued an advertisement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Grow more oats.  Every farmer should increase his acreage of oats this year.  Oats not required on the farm commands a remunerative price.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Has any Deputy opposite any doubt about what that means, because the Minister will try to create a doubt as to what it means?  When the Minister said in that advertisement: &ldquo;Any oats not required on the farm will command a remunerative price,&rdquo; would any farmer not read into that that if it is not required on the farm he could sell it and get a remunerative price?  The Minister will try to bamboozle Deputies about that and to say that he meant them to walk it off the farm, but I think it was plain enough.  On 20th March he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Sow from one to five extra acres of oats or barley,&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>and he issued the famous advertisement <Col N="461" /> to which I have often referred&mdash; a most offensive advertisement, a most political and partisan advertisement issued by the Minister and paid for by the taxpayers&mdash;in which he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Let's show them.  Let us show them; let us, the Minister and his friends, show what we are going to do&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash; and we had to pay for it.  He did not do that since.  I suppose he was sorry for it, and we will leave it at that.</P>
    <P>The year went on and the farmers sowed their oats on the guarantee that they would get a remunerative market, if they did not require the oats for poultry, cattle and so on.  The oats was an excellent crop and farmers had oats to spare.  They thought they would have no trouble whatever &mdash; there was a remunerative market in Great Britain for everything they could produce &mdash; but they found to their great consternation that nobody would buy oats and naturally they began suggesting things to the Minister, suggesting that he should take the oats off their hands and should make some provision for this surplus oats.  On 17th September the Minister, at Waterford Agricultural Show, said he would not advise the Government to fix a minimum price for oats.  Why?  Because the remunerative market was not there.  On 15th October, he told a deputation of the grain growers' committee of the beet growers' association that he would not have a price fixed for oats.  He was very determined that he would do nothing about fixing the price of oats, but something occurred which the Minister did not expect &mdash; a by-election in East Donegal.  Oats is a very important consideration in East Donegal.</P>
    <P>The Minister went to America and the Minister for Defence was acting for him, and on 11th November the Minister for Defence said here that, though reluctant, he hoped to arrange &ldquo;that oats will be bought in quantity at a reasonable price&rdquo;.  On 26th November he told the Dáil that oats would be purchased through Messrs.  Grain Importers, Limited, at 28/- per barrel in good sound condition, bushelling 40.</P>
    <P>The farmers got their market, but I <Col N="462" /> wonder did any of them call it a remunerative market.  I wonder did any farmer then recollect what the Minister said when he came back from England, that we had a remunerative market in England for everything the land of Ireland could produce for four years certainly and maybe for more. As I said, when the Minister came to issue his advertisement in the spring of 1949, he said: &ldquo;If you want a cash crop, grow wheat or malting barley&rdquo;. He no longer said that there would be a remunerative price for oats if it was not wanted on the farm. He had learned his lesson and he had learned it at the expense of the farmers.  He said in that advertisement that there would be no control whatever on the prices of oats or barley of the 1949 crop.  He made it very clear in 1949 that he was not going to be responsible for the price of oats.  There was no &ldquo;let's show them&rdquo; that time. There was no talk of a remunerative market for any oats that would be to spare.</P>
    <P>On 26th March, in Scotstown, the Minister made this very wise statement to farmers, that there was no Government in the world that could guarantee its farmers an immediate cash market for their entire crop.  He was coming to learn things.  The result was, of course, that the acreage of oats went down by 200,000 acres in 1949, due entirely to the optimistic promises of the Minister, optimistic promises that were made in a political way, in the spirit of &ldquo;Let's show them&rdquo;, &ldquo;Let's show them that the farmers of this country would prefer to grow barley or oats than to grow wheat&rdquo;.  Then, when he did show them, the farmers could not sell the oats and the acreage of oats went down.  What was the result?  With the acreage down, the yield was also down.  It was a bad year for oats.  The result was that, during this last winter, the Minister had to search the world and had to go as far as the Argentine to get oats.  It was an extraordinary thing that a Minister for Agriculture in this country should have to look around the world for oats.  That was the result of his policy.</P>
    <P>In the advertisement which I have <Col N="463" /> mentioned, in 1948, the Minister appealed to farmers to grow more potatoes.  When he came back from England, having signed an agreement with the British Government, I think the only criticism he offered of the agreement was that it did not give us a very attractive price for potatoes. When he mentioned the price for potatoes, he said, &ldquo;None of us would grow rich on that&rdquo;.  Even though it was not attractive, he said there was an unlimited market at a remunerative price.  In any event, it had the same history, practically, as oats.  Farmers did grow more potatoes in 1948.  It was a very favourable year.  We had an extraordinarily good crop of potatoes and then the farmers found that they could not sell them.  They could not see how the Minister could justify his promise to them that there would be a remunerative price for anything they did not use on the farm. The Minister, when he came back from England in 1948, was exuberant about the great agreement he had made and the big money we would get for all our produce and said that £10 13s. 6d. a ton was nothing to boast about for potatoes but, when the potatoes could not be sold, during the winter of 1948-49, on the 23rd February, 1949, he spoke about the price of potatoes being satisfactory.  Deputy Aiken asked, &ldquo;What is the satisfactory price which the Minister has now promised to the farmers if they hold on to their potatoes?&rdquo; He was advising them to hold on to them a little longer.  The Minister replied that farmers had been getting 6/- to 8/- a cwt. for them.  It was a boast that they were getting 6/-to 8/- a cwt., although, in his exuberant mood on his return from England having signed the agreement with the British Government, he said that £10 13s. 6d. was not going to make anybody rich.</P>

      <P>It was held out to the farmers in 1948 as a price for potatoes. There was nothing about f.o.b. Now it is f.o.b.  In 1949 the acreage of potatoes, just like the acreage of oats, went down.  What else could the farmers do?  Again, just as in the case of oats, the Minister had to search around the world for potatoes. He had to search for 50,000 tons for Great Britain.  The result, of course, was a scarcity of potatoes at home.  The Minister had undertaken to give 50,000 tons of potatoes to Great Britain.  We are told now that it was f.o.b.  He had considerable difficulty in getting them.</P>
      <P>The first reference that I see to the filling of this contract was in the Dáil at Question Time on 25th April, 1950. The Minister was absent for some reason, and the Parliamentary Secretary, Mr. Corish, answered the question. After a long answer, Deputy Aiken asked a supplementary question:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Will the Parliamentary Secretary say on what date must the contract be completed?</P>
      <P>Mr. Corish: The 15th May.</P>
      <P>Mr. Aiken: Will he also answer the point in the question about what steps have been taken to secure supplies from outside sources?</P>
      <P>Mr. Corish: I think the Minister on another occassion some two or three weeks ago indicated that efforts had been made to get potatoes from other countries to fulfil this contract.</P>
      <P>Mr. Aiken: Where will they get them?</P>
      <P>Mr. Corish: On the Continent.</P>

      <P>Mr. Smith: What are the prospects?</P>
      <P>Mr. Dillon: There is no prospect. There is a certainty.</P>
      <P>Mr. Smith: From what sources will the contract be completed?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister said he would prefer if the Deputy would not bring forward that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It was too delicate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister pointed out <Col N="466" /> that he could not say at that stage, before he fixed the price.  What I want to stress is that when he was asked about the prospects of completion he said: &ldquo;There is a certainty&rdquo;.  It is one of the Minister's certainties.</P>
      <P>He issued a White Paper to give us information before this debate started and he told us that 24,000 tons had gone to Great Britain, not 50,000 tons. Perhaps the Minister will reconcile that when he is concluding and say what he meant by a certainty, as it does not appear to me to fit in with the facts given.  In this searching around for potatoes to fill the contract to Great Britain, as might be expected, there was a scarcity created here at home and the price of potatoes for some time went up very high on the consumer, higher than has been known here for many a long day.  When the Minister was asked about this, what he was doing about the consumer, he gave a typical Coalition Government reply:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Dillon: My information is that consumers can secure supplies of potatoes at 2/6 pretty generally.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Not every Deputy in the House can agree with that.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Dillon: It is not my duty to command housewives in this city where they are to buy their potatoes...  My duty was to see that there would be at least one centre where potatoes would be available at a price which was reasonable and which was within the housewives' capacity to pay.  I think that has been achieved.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is given in column 7, Volume 121, No. 1, of the Official Debates.  I think that is a typical Coalition reply.  It is the type of reply which says: &ldquo;Well, if you have not got bacon, eat pig's cheek, which is cheap&rdquo;&mdash; as if we were going to breed pigs with all heads and nothing else.  He means: &ldquo;If you want cheap potatoes, go to one certain market in the City of Dublin and you will get them&rdquo;.  That is just the greatest camouflage.  It is nonsense to think that the people of this city can go to one market and that because the Minister was able to get the potatoes supplied to a certain group of people and they were able to sell a certain <Col N="467" /> quantity at a certain price he had done his job.  I can leave it at that by saying that it is a typical Coalition Government way of doing things.</P>
    <P>The Minister said, in his talk of this agreement, that in the first year the British were to take 50,000 tons.  I am stating what happended in the second year, 1949, when they took 24,000 tons out of 50,000 tons.  He said that after the first year they would take as much potatos as we liked to contract for. How much have we contracted for and is it intended that we should try to increase our acreage in order to supply more potatoes to Great Britain?  We would also need to search this f.o.b. business.  The unlimited market at unlimited prices has so far failed that one is inclined to ask whether it still holds. We may come to that when we go through all the items.</P>
    <P>When dealing with the question of root seeds, the Minister said it was in the hands of racketeers.  What he meant to convey, as far as I can see, was that the merchants who were getting the farmers to grow these seeds were racketeers.  As I said at the beginning, when the Minister was not here&mdash;I would like to say it to him openly, as I do not like to say things behind his back that I would not say to his face&mdash;he should be more careful about calling people racketeers and rogues, unless he is more sure of his facts, as he is sure to be found out in the end.  Regarding these root seeds grown in Ireland, it would appear&mdash;and the Minister has never attempted to contradict these figure as, of course, he could not&mdash;that the merchants who organised these things were not racketeers, by any means.  Take 1948 and 1949.  I dealt before in this House at the end of the last session, last summer, with the position up to that time and do not want to repeat it.  The position is much the same.  The English grower was getting 120/- a cwt.  for turnip seeds and Swede seeds.  The Irish grower was getting 150/- in 1948 and 160/- in 1949, but as far as the retail prices are concerned in this country they were both sold for the same price, both Irish seed and English seed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>3/3.  Here you have a position where seed was sold for 3/3 by the retailer, the man who sells the seed in the country shop to the farmer The English grower only got 1/1, the Irish grower got 1/4 or 1/5&mdash;it depends on the year&mdash;so that, at any rate, the racketeers, the people between the grower and sower, got less out of Irish seed than out of English seed.  I am inclined to think that the racketeers, that is, the importers of seeds, the wholeselers and retailers, who are racketeers, would more naturally try to get English seed than Irish seed. The Minister should not come here and talk about racketeers unless he knows the facts&mdash;or if he does know the facts he should stick to them and not talk about racketeers to get out of it in that way.  That was a nice little bit of business for the grower of seed.</P>

In may, 1949, he notified the companies who were operating this home-grown seed that he was opening the ports from December, 1949.  The redult is that the Irish growers this year are offered 120/- and 116/- per cwt.  The only result of what the Minister has done is that for the future the Irish grower will get 4d.  a lb. less for his seed than he got last year.</P>

      <P>The farmer will be paying the same, but the retailer who his selling over the counter to the farmer will get the difference of 4d. and the sower of the seed will get the same.  Therefore, the Minister's action amounts to this: he his going to take 4d. a lb. off every lb. grawn by a farmer in this country and put it into the pocket of a wholesaler or a retailer.</P>

Therefore, there is nothing but absolute prejudice behind this thing.  The Minister promised, the last time we were talking about this matter, a scheme for the growing of pedigree Swede seed.

      <P>I do not know.  The Miniter says sometimes&mdash;in his saner moments&mdash;that there should be no sudden or violent change in agricultural policy.  He is right.  Sudden or violent changes in agricultural policy have very disturbing effects on people whho engage in a certain line of agriculture and who have put their money into it.  Further, they have very discouring effects on any group of farmers who might be inclined to try a new line of agriculture in order to make money.  However, although the Minister sometimes lays down these very good principles that <Col N="470" /> there should be no sudden or violent changes in agricultural policy he does not always abide by them.  If I am not mistaken, he said on practically the first day he became the Minister for Agriculture that he was going to do away with the Gaeltacht glsshouse scheme. Than the trouble started.  Some of the Deputies setting behind him did not like the idea so he changed his mind. He yielded, as he usually does, to pressure of that kind and the Gaeltacht glasshouse scheme was allowed to proceed. The Minister, in connection with the tomato industry, talked about racketeers in this country.  The tomato growers say that find it very difficult to understand why it is that Dutch tomatoes can be landed in this country at about 1/2½ per lb. and be sold at 1/4 per lb. while Irish tomatoes which are sold on the market&mdash;as they were sold in the early part of last week &mdash;at 1/6 to 1/9 a lb. are retailed in the shops at 2/6 a lb.  The Dutch tomatoes were 1/2½ a lb. at the port and the Irish tomatoes were 1/6 to 1/9 a lb. on the market.  It does not appear to me to be an unfair difference considering the quality of Irish tomatoes compared with that of imported tomatoes.  It would appear, however, that the selling margin, and so forth, is very much higher in respect of Irish tomatoes compared with that of tomatoes imported from the continent.  Would it not be well for for the Minister to bring his attention to bear on that aspect of the matter and find out who the racketeers are?</P>

At Portumna in September, 1949, and at Mountbellew a week later, the Minnister said that there would be no increase in the price of maize.  I ask the members of this House to keep that statement by the Minister in mind.  He said: &ldquo;I am the Minister in charge of maize.  I can tell you that the price of maize will not advance by one farthing in foreseeable time.&rdquo;  The Minister has a language of his own.  I do not know what he meant by &ldquo;foreseeable time&rdquo;.  If the Minister was not able to foresee the few months that elapsed between the time he made that statement and the time of the increase in the price of maize then he is not a man of great foresight and he is hardly a suitable man to be in charge of the Department of Agriculture.</P>

      <P>I want to take it quite clear to Deputy Cowan that I said, when speaking, that it was a very difficult matter and that my criticism of the Minister was that he said he had found it.  I know that it is a difficult matter.  At column 2607 of the Official Report, 9th July, 1948, the Minister is reported as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am in a position to say to the farmers of this country that there is an unlimited market at remunerative prices for cattle, sheep, pigs, butter, cream, cheese, bacon potatoes, bareley and oats, and that the more of them they produce the better we hope prices to be.  There is no reservation and no qualification about that.  I do not think any Minister for Agriculture in this country has ever been in a position to say that before, or to say to the farmers of this country that will be irrevocably true for at least four years and we hope it may be for a much longer term to come.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I will sum up by saying that, first of all, the Minister did not find a remunerative market and, secondly, the Minister does not know his own mind.  He is always changing his mind.  At one moment he will say oats is a cash crop and the next moment he will tell you there is no one in the world who could fix a price for oats.  One day wheat is a cod and the next day he tells the farmers to grow it.  How are the unfortunate farmers to know what they are to do?  They do not know what the programme is; so <Col N="474" /> far as they can ascertain there is no programme.</P>
      <P>He mentioned ten items&mdash;cattle, sheep, pigs, butter, cream, cheese, bacon, potatoes, barley and oats.  These are the ten items the Minister told us in 1948 we had a remunerative and an unlimited market for.  He may be right in three out of the ten, but he is wrong in seven.  That represents a 70 per cent. error, and it is not too bad. Looking at the Minister's achievements, I wonder if there was ever a public pronouncement made by any Minister in any Parliment that has proved in two years to be so utterly falsified?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that since Joan of Arc was put on trial and condemned to be burned at the stake there was never such a ghoulish exhibition as we witnessed here this evening in this particular debate.  I wonder what is our concern here?  Are we concerned with driving Deputy Dillon out of public life, or are we concerned with the Department of Agriculture?  Listening to Deputy Ryan, who has repeated what was said by Deputy Smith, Deputy Corry and quite a number of other Deputies, the concern seems to be, not for the farmers or agriculture, but to score some type of petty political victory over Deputy Dillon.</P>
      <P>This debate, because of the way in which it has been conducted over the past four weeks, is not of much value to the nation.  In a period of difficulty such has this, and with world affairs in the way they are, we should be concerned with the future of our agriculture, with agricultural prices, agricultural production and agricultural surpluses.  We ought to be concerned with the relationship that exists between the prices our farmers are getting for their produce and what consumers of agricultural produce have to pay for it.  But all that is forgotten we have, instead, a rehash of everything that Deputy Dillon, as Minister for Agriculture, has said over a period of two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one reads the statements of statesmen anywhere in the world over the past couple of years, one finds very significant changes in what they say. The world is moving rapidly and things <Col N="475" /> which may appear right to-day may be entirely wrong to-morrow.  If one had time to go back 22 years&mdash;and quote the to go back 22 years&mdash;and quote the thing said by Deputy Ryan, Deputy Smith and other Deputies in those periods, one would find tremendous contradictions.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a realistic approach to this very serious problem.  If a miracle occurred to-morrow, and if Fianna Fáil were to come back here as the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The farmers of the country are responsible people but they are held up here in this debate as being entirely irresponsible, as people who must be led by the nose in regard to everything, who have no minds of their own and who cannot think for themselves.  That is how the farmers are being held up to us in this debate.  I think the farmer is the shrewdest, the most sensible and the most solid person in the whole comnnity. What we ought to be doing here is to concern ourselves with the future that is facing the farmer.  It sounds ludicrous and ridiculous to have Deputy Dr. Ryan talking about potato surpluses, and asking why we were not able to fulfil a contract when it is well known that America had such a surplus of potatoes last year and this year that she was giving them away free. The Candian Government had to step in and prevent free potatoes being sent into Canada by the United States of America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general opinion all over the world seems to be that we are facing a time of serious agricultural surpluses in many commodities, particularly in butter and in cheese.  If we are going to have surpluses in these commodities, what is the position of our farmers going to be?  Are they still going <Col N="476" /> to get their high prices abroad, or are they to face the crash in a world crisis? I think that is a serious aspect of this problem that might get the consideration of this House for a little time. That is far more inpertant than what the Minister said two years ago, what he said a year ago, or what he has said recently.  The Fianna Fáil Party have always been considered to be a Party of astute politicians.  Perhaps they are playing a good political card in this, but is it fair to our farmers to play that type of political card while the farmers are facing this very serions situation?  Fianna Fáil speakers have been peddling petty Party politics all over this House.  In the concluding stages of this debate, I would ask Deputies to get back to the realities and to the dangers that face us, and to face up to those problem.  Let each and every one of us do his best to deal with the serions crisis that may be upon us in the very near future.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say.  I am thoroughly ashamed of the way in which pubilc time has been wasted during four weeks on this particular Estaimate, bringing us right into the month of July while there is still months of work waiting to be done.  Everything that has been stated on the far side, or that could have been said by way of criticism of the Minister's Estimate, was said in six hours by Deputy Smith. I suggest, in the intersts of the nation, that criticism of the Minister might have been left to that speech.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cowan has talked of the way in which speakers on this side of the House have spoken.  He said they had indieated that they regarded farmers as irresponsible people. I think that, if all the speeches made from this side of the House and quite a number of those made from the other side of the House are analysed, it will be found that the irresponsible talk was not attributed to the farmers but to the man who now occupies the position of Minister for Agriculture.  It is due to the good sense of the farming communnity that we are in the position in which we find ourselves at the moment.  If the farmers had taken the statements of the Minister, since he came into office, at their face value, where would we find ourselves to-day? <Col N="477" /> If they had taken his statements down through the difficult years of the war, and the statements he has made since attaining office in regard, say, to the growing of wheat, at their face value, would we have any wheat grown in the country at this moment?</P>
      <P>It is true that the acreage under wheat has decreased to a very great extent during his time in office.  In 1948, there were 518,383 acres of wheat grown in the country; in 1949, that acreage had decreased to 362,805, a decrease of 155,578 acres.  If we take the latest available figure, namely that for 1949, we find that the acreage in that year is a litle over half the acreage grown in 1945.  Surely, it is evident to everybody, and should be very evident to the Minister, that the international situation at the moment is such&mdash;it has been so for the past few years&mdash;that, instead of having a decreased acreage under wheat, we should be going all out, while there is time, to increase the acreage, and so leave ourselves in the best possible position in the event of war.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in 1939, in circumstances somewhat similar to those in which we find ourselves to-day, had this to say in relation to wheat:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We speak of wheat.  The Taoiseach seemed to justify the expenditure of £2,500,000 on the production of wheat on the ground that it provided a guarantee for us against starvation in time of war.  Our problem in time of war will be to get food out of the country, even if you ram food down their stomachs with a ramrod? We shall be smothered, stifled and buried in a rotting heap of foodstuffs in the event of war.  That is the deadly blow that the enemies of Ireland can deliver against us&mdash;to suspend our outgoing traffic.  We shall be buying shovels and shovelling food into the sea.  With that vast, immense, unconsumable accumulation of food, we are to pay £2,500,000 to protect ourselves against a scarcity of wheat.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He goes on to say: &ldquo;I lived on oaten bread in my schooldays.  I never got <Col N="478" /> wheaten bread from one end of the year to the other and I weigh 14 stone to-day.&rdquo; That was in 1939; possibly he has gone up in weight since then.  At any rate, with the oaten bread and his fondness for pig's cheek&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy give the reference to the quotation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is from Volume 76, columns 2241 and 2242 of the Official Report.  In relation to his living on oaten bread, it would be interesting to know whether or not he still eats only oaten bread.  Does his menu consist solely of oaten bread and pig's cheek which he tells us he likes so much? There may be a very good reason for his lauding the qualities of pig's cheek in the light of something that occurred a few months ago.  The urban council in Youghal complained that too many pig's cheeks were being included in the diet of the patients in the mental hospital. That was on the 20th March, 1950.  In relation to the complaint made at that meeting of the urban council, we had subsequently a statement from Dr. Honan, the resident medical superintendent of Cork Mental Hospital; he stated that pig's cheeks had a peculiarly sooting and curative effect on mental patients.  If that is true, then the more pig's cheek the Minister eats the better it will be.  To come back to wheat and the policy adopted by the Minister, as far back as 1939, when the war clouds were looming on the horizon, the present Minister did everything he could do discourage wheat growing.  Even then he despised wheat growing and thought it was foolish it spend money on the production of that crop.  To-day we are faced with a position somewhat similar to that which obtained in 1939.  Instead of the Minister encouraging the growing of wheat, we have his contradictory statements, some of which were quoted here this afternoon by a Deputy Dr. Ryan.  We have his statement that wheat growing is all cod.  We have his statement, when he is anxious to get himself out of a perticular dilemma, that if the farmers want a cash crop they should grow more wheat.  In what position will the farmers find themselves <Col N="479" /> with all these contradictory statements?  What will the position of the country be if the war develops as it may develop?  We will find ourselves in the position in which the present Minister would have liked us to be during the last war, when he advocated that we should join in the war on the side of Britain.  If the war spreads, we will join it, not voluntarily but because we shall be forced to join in order to procure enough food to keep ourselves alive.</P>

      <P>As a result of the present wheat policy, we may find ourselves, should the present war develop in the position of the having to procure food from somewhere.  If we are to get that food we know very well the price we shall have to pay for it: the price will be that we shall enter the <Col N="480" /> war on the side of those who will provide that food and we shall pay for it in the blood of our young people.  That is the position we are facing.  That is the position in which the present Minister would have liked us to be in the last war.  Fortunately, because of the foresight of the Government at that time, we did not have to go begging for food and pay for that food with our manhood.  It is only because of the common sense of the farming community that we have to-day even the amount of wheat that is grown.  If we were to take the Minister's statements at their face value we would go out of wheat and every other tillage crop.</P>
      <P>We all remember the Minister's statements in 1948 with regard to oats and potatoes.  We all remember the advertisements ending with the phrase &ldquo;Let us show them.&rdquo;  We all remember the promise made that if more oats and potatoes were grown there would be both a market and a good price from them.  We all remember the result when the harvest had been gathered.  We had a high yield of oats and potatoes and we had a surplus for sale.  When it come to selling that surplus there was no market.  The Minister scuttled off to America to tell the world and all concerned how they should run their affairs leaving the farming community to get itself out of the muddle in which he had left it. In regard to oats we had eventually a Government purchase scheme.  That scheme was a last resort in order to try to stem the tide in regard to votes at the then forthcoming East Donegal by-election.  That scheme failed both in regard to the purchase of oats and in regard to the stemming of the tide in that perticular election.  The Minister himself gave us the figure of the total tonnage bought under that scheme.  Of approximately 794,000 tons of oats in that 1948 crop only about 19,000 tons were purchased under this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During that election campaign I and a few others advised the farmers to sell as soon as they possibly could because we saw that scheme merely as an election stunt and nothing more.  Those who were lucky enough to take our advice sold.  Those who did not take our advice were unable to sell after the <Col N="481" /> election.  Following on that, the Minister came along and accused Deputy Davern and myself of sabotage.  If anyone is guilty of sabotage, it is the Minister for Agriculture.  We can remember this strutting Minister's praposals; we can remember the behaviour of this purse-proud saboteur during the war years when he tried to act the quisling and involve us in that war.</P>

I have waited for this opportunity to see of this policy would progress as a result of my keeping quiet.  It has not progressed, as we all know, and I take this opportunity of refuting his allegation and of proving that these allegations are untrue.  In regard to sabotage, if the use of that world by the Minister is to be allowed in this House, then I accuse the Minister of sabotage and if everything had been, as it should have been, and if the Finna Fáil Government had not been so soft-hearted in regard to then Deputy Dillion's statements during the war, they would have put him behind bars&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As the result of the Minister's endeavour, as I say, out of 794,000 tons of oats grown in 1948, only 19,000 tons were bought under the Government purchasing scheme.  With the exeption of these 19,000 tons, no market was available here or elsewere; right through 1948 and as late as September, 1949, some of the oats were still in storage in this country. As a result of that flop in the oat maket of 1948, it was natural that a decrease should take place in the acreage in 1949.  In 1949, there was a reduction of 45,000 acres in the area under oats.  Allied to that, we had conditions that were not favourable for that crop and the result was that it became apparent, as the harvest approached, that we would have a very great scarcity of oats during the following season.  That was evident to anybody and everybody who wanted to see those thing as early as August, 1949, but the very person who should have seen that situation did not see it and the surplus oats of 1948, which were still in storage in September, 1949, instead of being kept in the country were then shipped out at a loss, to some foreign country.  These same oats in storage were bought at approximately £16 per ton and the last lot of them, that I know which left this country, were exported at a price of £15 1s. 6d. f.o.b.  They were exported as a late as September, 1949, when it was evident to everybody concerned that there was going to be a scarcity of oats during the following winter of 1949-50.  Of course, the Minister carried on in his usual irresponsible manner; he left us with a great shortage of oats after selling the balance of the crop of the previous year when it should have been apparent to him that he should have kept them at home.  Then he came along and told us that he was not responsible for the shortage of oats, that Deputy Davern and myself were responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of potatoes, just as in the case of oats, in 1948 we were encouraged to grow all the potatoes we <Col N="483" /> possibly could but, at the end of 1948, when we should have been getting rid of these potatoes, we found that the market promised was not available nor was the price promised available either.  Again, we get the Minister coming along telling us later that somebody else was to blame for that situation.  After he encouraged the farmers to grow potatoes in the spring of 1948, promising them a market at a remunerative price, we found, when the time for marketing them came around, that the price or the market was not available and the Minister blames somebody else.  Can anybody say that that is the record of responsible man?  Can we take it as the record of a man with a properly balanced mind or are these statements issued periodically by the Minister to be regarded as the eruptions of an unbalanced mind? That is what I think the farmers generally down the country take the Minister's statements to be.  It is in that light they regard these statements and it is just as well for the people of the country that the farmers themselves have that sense which the Minister lacks.</P>
    <P>We had, as I say, a decrease in the acreage under potatoes due to the slump in the market, the mismanagement by the Minister and the wrong advice he gave erlier on.  In 1949 there was a decrease in the area under potatoes of approximately 35,644 acres with the result that in the winter of 1949, and up to the late spring of 1950, there was a very great scarcity of potatoes in the home market.  That home market scarcity was not entirely due to the decrease in acreage.  It was due to the decrease in acreage primarily but, allied to that, was the fact that the Minister had contracted to sell 50,000 tons of potatoes to Britain, which quantity according to the latest information I have been able to secure, was never sent.  The latest figures I have got show that 24,000 tons out of that 50,000 were shipped to Britain. Those 24,000 tons were being sent out of this country up to the 15th May. Long before the 15th May it should have been evident that there was going to be a scarcity of potatoes, having regard to the decrease in acreage I <Col N="484" /> have mentioned but the Minister took no congnisance of that fact.  He wanted to fill that contract with Britain and any means which he could take to fill it were, he felt, justified.  Whether or not we were faced with a scarcity or famine for potatoes in the early spring, apparently that was no concern of the Minister.  He wanted to send them to Britain, to send them to his old friend John Bull, the only market and the only people to whom he want to sell any Irish produce.  If we had a scarcity as we had here in this country, if the people of the cities had to pay famine prices for potatoes a few months ago, you can lay the blame for that state of affairs on the Minister. He is to blame directly for his action in exporting potatoes to Britain when he knew that these same potatoes would be required at home.  In the light of that and of his recored all along the line, can we wonder if tillage as a whole is decreasing year by years since he came into office?  It is hard to expect the farmers to till the land and to put in certain specific crops when they have no idea in the world, and no guidance upon which they can rely, as to what they are to do with these crops when they are harvested.  Taking these things as they are the position would be bad enough, but the Minister is not satisfied with letting the farmers down in regard to prices and in regard to his promises.</P>
    <P>He goes further and actually adds insult to injury when he states publicly that the farmers&mdash;the small farmers really are the people to whom he referred&mdash;who grow crops for cash are people who should not be farmers at all.  It is the small farmers as a whole who are the backbone of the agricultural industry and the Minister knows that.  Despite all that, he has no regrets, apparently, for anything he may have done to these people.  He has no regrets that they may have been at very great loss, due to his ill-advice in 1948 in regard to oats and potatoes. Neither has he any regrets for or apologies to make in regard to his policy in relation to wheat.</P>
    <P>In regard to flax, if that crop could be killed, if anybody could kill it or try to kill it, it is the present Minister for Agriculture.  On the one hand, we find <Col N="485" /> him going to Britain, where, no doubt, he is a source of great amusement to the people.  He is taken as a very good joke there, but, unfortunately, his antics, his actions, and his irresponsible statementes over there, while they may amuse the people in England and abroad and be a good joke for them, are unfortunately a very bad joke for us.  In regared to tillage produce, we find that the farmers have been badly let down by the Minister.  As to potatoes, so far as the Minister could go, he has given them the hammer.  He has also given the growing of oats as a cash crop the hammer.  In regard to flax, he told the only buyers we had available to go to blazes.  That is the type of Minister one would expect not to get on with very well.  The Department of such a Minister could not be expected to progress.</P>
    <P>If there is a suggestion made by some people, who like to here themselves talking, that Fianna Fáil is obstructing the work of this House by spending time uselessly talking so long on this Estimate, I would say that, even if that were true, which it is not, it might be no harm if we spent the next six month talking on the Estimate as we know we would not be retarding the progress of the Department of Agriculture or the progress of the Government as a whole, because there is no progress.  It would be a good thing if we could retard what we might call the retrogression in the Department of Agriculture and in the policy of the Government generally.  As I say, if we were trying to waste time, I think it would be a good job if we kept them here for another six months. But that is not our purpose in talking and repeating the arguments put forward by Deputies on this side of the House.  We must of necessity repeat these things, and we repeat them in the hope that, having been repeated often enough, the Minister may take cognisance of the complaients which we have put before him during the past few weeks.</P>
    <P>There is one perticular item which I want to touchh upon in more detail and that is the question of potatoes.  We have dealt with the 1948 crop and the crash in the marcket after a time.  Then <Col N="486" /> we had the decrease in 1949 and the scarcity in the Dublin markets as the result of over-selling to Britain.  That is in relation to ware potatoes only For some years past we have had also a very lucrative market in the export of certified seed potatoes.  Some few months ago I asked the Minister for Agriculture what quantity of certified seed potatoes was exported as ware potatoes this year.  Whether he quibbled at the words I used in the question I am not in a position to say, but &ldquo;none&rdquo; was the answer given to the question: in order words, no seed potatoes were exported as ware.  As I say, the Minister may have been quibbling with the words when he stated that no certified seed potatoes were exported as were potatoes.  If we take that statement on its face value, that no potatoes certified as pure seed potatoes were sold as ware potatoes, then I tell him that that is nature and I am prepared to stand over that.</P>
    <P>The seed potato market in my county has been stifled by the Minister.  If the industry of exporting certified seed potatoes is done away with and killed completely, than we can lay the blame justy at the door of the Minister.  This year we had the rare experience of having a shortage of potatoes in the country.  We have seen these potatoes being shipped to Britain, and among the potatoes shipped to Britain were the best of certified varieties going as ware and being paid for at ware prices; while, at the same time, as I pointed out on 16th December last, there was a market available for certain varieties and for a certain specified quantity last November.  The reason why that quantity was not sold was because the Minister, his Department, and this newly established marketing board, as it is now kown, refused an export licence for the potatoes when requested by the intending exporter.  I brought that matter to the notice of the House on the 16th December but no notice was taken of it.  There was, however, no denial of the fact that I gave.  I had proof in this House at that time in the shape of correspondence between the potato exporter, the Department and the Potato Marketing Association and it was clearly evident that 2,500 tons <Col N="487" /> of seed potatoes would have been bought in the Donegal area at a very good price, a price that we regarded as very lucrative.</P>
    <P>I brought to the notice of the Minister that that request for an export licence for 2,500 tons was refused.  I did not then get any reason why it was refused.  All we found was that the first attempt to export these potatoes was made by way of a letter to the Department.  The Department passed the baby along and referred the intending exporter to the Potato Marketing Association.  They did not reply for many weeks and then the reply was that the licence would not be granted.</P>
    <P>The potatoes for which this export licence was requested included 1,000 tons of Home Guard certified seed potatoes and the price indicated in the correspondence to the Minister's Department was £12 3s. 4d. per ton. That licence was not granted nor did we ever hear again during the past season, any question of anybody giving £12 3s. 4d. for certified Home Guard seed.</P>

      <Col N="488" /> We had a statement from the Minister in 1947.  I think he was talking about bacon but it does not matter what he was talking about.  What matters is the statement he made when he said: &ldquo;Do not become obsessed with price.  Price does not matter a row of pins.&rdquo;</P>

Where can we find the profit of which the Minister talks?  Is it not obvious again that the price did not matter then and does not matter now as far as the Minister is concerned?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The price of eggs has been reduced from 3/- when the Minister took office by 6d. and according to a recent announcement as and from 1951 it will be still further reduced to 2/-.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not worry.  I am going to continue.  I will not leave out the 3/6 part.  Later on, in September, we find that we will get 3/6.  The Minister suggests that if we are to take the best advantage of the higher price in those months of the winter of next year we must change the laying season of the hens.  The Minister has produced some rare birds in his time and I have no doubt that if we gave him time he would produce one that would lay at a completely different season from the others, but until then I cannot see much point in his trotting out the 3/6 price during a period when we will have little or no eggs to export.  We have had a reduction in the price of eggs and they will be further reduced to 2/in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>We have, at the same time, the Minister saying in Volume 106, column 2048 of the Official Debates:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This much is plain to see, we sell our agricultural surplus on the British market or we do not sell it at all.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Both these things the Minister has proved to be true since he came into office.  We either sell to Britain or we do not sell at all, and, from my experience, it is mainly the latter that affects most of our people&mdash;we do not sell at all.  We let our potatoes and oats go to loss and we feed rats throughout the country, all descriptions of rats, with this surplus produce of the land, this produce for which, the Minister would tell us, we could have an unlimited market with his good friends in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there was ever a Minister who has been made a &ldquo;cod&rdquo; of, surely it is our present Minister, in his negotiations with these people.  It is really lamentable to see how our Minister <Col N="493" /> bears himself when he goes across to Britain to deal with business people and, as he thinks himself, in a businesslike way.  He goes across and utters such statements as the statement about drowning them in eggs.  He was almost tempted into telling them recently that we were going to bury them in bacon. Other businesslike statements of his include: &ldquo;We want to sell to Britain. We are not going to charge them a scarcity price.  We would rather sell to them than to anybody else, even though we have less for our produce.&rdquo; That, surely, is the proper lead up to any negotiations with another country when we are endeavouring to sell our produce&mdash;telling them that we want to sell to them and do not want to sell to anybody else, and that their money is better to us than anybody else's.  Is it any wonder, then, that the markets and prices the Minister talks of are not available?  Is it any wonder that we find, as we have found during the past few years, every farmer, and particularly the small farmers, who depend on the cash crops, oats, potatoes and flax, brought to their knees by this Minister's policy?  Yet, as I have said, the Minister wants to put the blame on the shoulders of someone else.  He describes in very eloquent terms at different times how Deputy Davern and I have sabotaged the agricultural policy of the country, but he forgets his own sabotage during his term of office and during the last war, when he wanted us to go in on the side of Britain.</P>

      <P>To come back to the question of sabotage in more recent times than seven years ago, we remember that the Minister is the only person responsible for sabotage either at present or during the past few years. It is by his policy, or his lack of policy, his contradictory statements, encouragements and advertisements that he is sabotaging the country.  He is sabotaging it to such an extent that we have a reduction in the acreage of tillage all round.  We have a reduction in the acreage under oats and under potatoes, and, more important, we have a vast reduction in the acreage under wheat.  Flax has gone off the market completely.  The sabotage is on the Minister's part and it is surely something in respect of which the Minister, who regards himself a big man, should not stoop to endeavouring to push the blame over for the failure of this crop or the failure of the market for that crop on to somebody else, when he and everybody concerned know that he is the man responsible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The only reason I refer again to the Minister's sabotage of seven years ago is that he was not here when I referred to it first.  I ask the pardon of the Chair for bringing it up again, but I wanted the Minister to hear it personally.  He scuttled out <Col N="495" /> of the House as soon as I rose, because I suppose he knew what was coming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should have a look at himself in a mirror once in a while and he would not turn his back if he saw me coming along.  I would be a relief to him.  There is another place in the city where he could see something like himself and I will not tell him where it is.</P>
      <P>There was on the Minister's side of the House one Deputy, Deputy P. D. Lehane, who took a stand on behalf of Deputy Davern and myself and I thank him for doing so, when he said: &ldquo;I do not agree with the Minister in blaming Deputy Davern and Deputy Blaney about the shortage of potatoes and oats.  I think the Minister has a certain responsibility in that regard himself.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Lehane for that and the Minister should take to heart the fact that Deputy Lehane thinks the Minister has some responsibility.  All the criticism is not coming from this side of the House.  One might excuse the Minister for the wanderings of his mind, but we then had the spectacle of that brainless colossus from West Cork getting up to back up the Minister, as if the Minister was not able to look after himself.  At column 2177 of Volume 121 of the Official Debates, we find Deputy Seán Collins saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have heard denunciations of certain foreign purchases made during last year, but it is time Fianna Fáil realised that every constructive effort made by the Minister to encourage the growth of cereals was sabotaged by them.  My memory is not so short as to forget the East Donegal by-election when the yowl and howl went through the country about oats, and some of the farmers who adhered to the advice of that strutting little Deputy from East Donegal, and listened to the loudvoiced condemnations of Deputy Davern, were very glad to get back their oats at an increased price.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So much for the contribution of our <Col N="496" /> flower exhibitor from West Cork.  It is a contribution he should be proud of. In the first instance, he does not know what he is talking about, apparently, but takes his line from the Front Bench Minister.  He goes on to talk about oats and the farmers, after selling them, on my advice, buying them back at an enhanced price.  He does not know what he is talking about.  With that, we will leave him to try to find a way to get around it later on.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, I have to leave that face down.  The general summing up of the people in the country, particularly of the farmers in the Twenty-Six Counties, and also in the Six Counties, is that this Minister is a complete catastrophe.  These people, who are not really interested from day to day in our politics, but who are interested in the welfare of our country, which is their country also, <Col N="497" /> can see in the Minister's policy something which is leading the country to destruction and, as they suggest, if the Minister is left long enough in office, he will completely destroy the country as a whole.  He will destroy anything and everything that is worth having in this country and we will go back to the state, which I have no doubt will be a pleasant state to the Minister, of being the garden for Great Britain and for feeding the people of Great Britain, where we will grow grass, long and short, feed cattle for John Bull, and export the cattle with our young men and women.</P>

That is a total of 30,000 in those two years, and God knows how many have left since last December.  The record is that 30,000 have left the country over the past two years.  Do not forget to compare that figure with the incoming balance in the last year of Fianna Fáil, 1947, when 11,000 more came in than went out.  In the two years up to December last, 30,000 went out.  I want to re-educate the Minister on those figures which were issued by a Government Department.</P>

      <P>I would sum up by saying that, in present circumstances, it is unfortunate for this country that we should have such an irresponsible man in the office of Minister for Agriculture as Mr. Dillon.  We are faced with the possibility of a world war and I think it is true to say that of all people in this country the least suited to the position of Minister for Agriculture at the present time, or at any time, but more especially in time of war, is the present occupant of that position.  It is really a catastrophe that we should have the present Minister in the position he now holds but it would be a greater catastrophe should the war develop.  It is all very well for the Minister to make all sorts of promises and to break them.  That might be got over in peace time and farmers might use their own common sense in substitution for the ill-advice and nonsensical statements made by the Minister in relation to what they should or should not grow but, in time of war or emergency, we should have in the Department of Agriculture, above all other Departments, a responsible, sane, sound and balanced individual as Minister.  We have not got that and that is something to be deplored.</P>
      <P>Down the country to-day one will find people, even those most bitterly opposed to us, who will agree on one thing, if they will not agree on any other, that the Minister is a calamity and a catastrophe and that the sooner we get rid of him the better for all concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would apply to this Minister his own words when he was speaking on the Estimate for Agriculture in 1947. They could not be applied more truly than to the Minister who uttered them when he was Deputy Dillon.  He said, in concluding his speech: &ldquo;I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture on nothing.  I think he and his Party are a catastrophe.  I think that so long as he is there we will get nowhere.&rdquo;  These are the Minister's own words in 1947. Never were they more true than they are to-day of himself.  He is a catastrophe and so long as he remains there not only will we get nowhere but the <Col N="499" /> chances are that we will go backwards instead of forwards.  We have this Minister who, in his young days, lived on oaten bread and never eat wheaten bread.  He may have had reason then, as now, for not eating wheaten bread. In 1947&mdash;Volume 106, column 2050 of the Dáil Debates&mdash;referring to bread and Irish wheat, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Before you ate it you had to hold it out in your hands, squeeze the water out of it, then tease it out and make up your mind whether it was a handful of boot polish or a handful of bread.  If it was boot polish, you put it on your boots or shoes and if it was bread, you tried to masticate it if you were fit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Such were the rumblings of this irresponsible Minister in 1947.  Deputies know the rumblings in 1939, in 1948 and 1949.  Unfortunately, we are still listening to them in 1950.  Possibly he may have become unsettled with this white flour that he himself imported and, if he has been using this white flour, it might be advisable for him to leave the white flour and the 3/6 butter, popularly known as Dillon's Delight, and go back to the oaten bread of his younger days and the pig's cheek of which he is so fond, the benefits of which are so great, according to good authority.</P>

I am sure the members are tired of hearing about the milk supply in Cork City, but I can assure the Minister that the people in Cork are very tired of what they are getting. Up to the outbreak of war, we had a twice daily supply of milk in Cork, which we are now unable to secure. There was the excuse during the war that they could not do it, that they had not petrol and other things.  Since the war ceased, it appears that we will never get again a twice daily delivery. I understand that the Minister is talking about pasteurised milk for Cork and I would like to know what the position is about that.  Could he give us any definite date as to when we would be supplied with this pasteurised milk?</P>

      <P>&ldquo;We were informed that the Minister for Agriculture is convinced that pasteurisation must come into effect in the interests of public health.  He has been so advised by the Minister for Health.  He considers that the formation of a local producers' association to carry out the necessary process would be a very good way of putting it into effect.  If this plan fails to materialise, the Minister may consider the advisability of transferring the project to some other public body.</P>
      <P>Under the projected scheme producers of highest grade milk will not be required to pasteurise.  In this connection we suggested to the departmental representatives that producers of standard milk be given a period of grace in order to qualify for highest grade certificates.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There was another matter brought to my notice by a constituent in Cork, about the new price of eggs.  This person informs me that from February 1st, 1951 to September 1st, 1951 when eight out of every ten cases of eggs <Col N="502" /> are exported to Britain the farmer gets only 2/- per dozen, or 6d. per dozen less than in the same months this year. Then in the winter season, from September 1st, 1951 to February 1st, 1952, when eight out of every ten cases are consumed at home, the farmer gets 3/6 per dozen.  Therefore, the consumer here will pay from 4/- to 4/6 for his eggs for 21 weeks from September 1st to February 1st, in order to give the farmer what Britain refused to give him.  For the past ten years the consumer paid inflated prices for only four or five weeks before Christmas, whereas now he will have to pay inflated prices for 21 weeks.  That is a matter which has a bearing on the cost of living, when the public have to pay increased prices for 21 weeks instead of five, the reason being that during that period when eggs are scarce they would be offered 3/6 to send them to England.  I do not know if it is because, as the Minister has said, the people in England are the only people in the world acquainted with hunger, that he is so anxious to give them these cheap commodities to-day.  In reply to a question some months ago, he said that the curers of bacon here had to pay 40/- a cwt. more for Wiltshire sides than for those sent to England.  I probably know as little about agriculture as Deputy Cowan, but I would like the Minister to pay attention to the few points I have made.</P>

      <P>Hatred is a very ugly vice.  Deputy Blaney is a young man and before he grows much older he ought to awaken to the fact that hatred corrupts the person who hates and not the person hated.  It is corrupting him. I suppose as we grow older we lose our capacity to hate.  I am not a good hater; it takes too much trouble; but young people would be well advised to avoid the temptation of indulging in the vice.  The Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;God knows, it is not young, but hoary and experienced as it is in every vice and corruption associated with public life, it should eschew the baseness, the revolting baseness, of personal hatred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to dispose of a couple of trivial matters before turning to the major questions.  Out of an estimated <Col N="503" /> crop of 750,000 tons of oats in 1948, 20,000 tons or less were purchased under the oats purchase scheme.  A great part of those oats was sold by Deputy Blaney's neighbours at no great price and those same people were short of oats the following autumn. When Deputy Blaney had scraped together the votes to scramble into this House he was willing then to forget what he had indiscreetly revealed. Deputy Blaney forgets that he spoke at Killygordon and he said: &ldquo;There is also the question of a market for oats&rdquo;&mdash;I am quoting from a report that appeared in that detached and unprejudiced publication, the <i>Derry Journal</i>, 4th March, 1949:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is also the question of a market for oats.  We had the promise almost a year ago of members of the Coalition Government of a good market and a good price.  That promise was implemented before the by-election began for a short time of buying oats at 2/- a stone.  I warned anyone who had oats to sell to sell them before polling day or they would not get them sold at all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Can you imagine anyone, however degraded, who, in the poorest part of Donegal, would go amongst his own neighbours and exhort them all to rush in with their modest store to Letterkenny, Raphoe, Carndonagh, so that their simultaneous arrival would deliver them into the hands of the oat merchant, that they might get less for their oats than they otherwise would and that, in their resentment for that, or out of it, Deputy Blaney might collect a few paltry votes to scramble into this House where he does not belong?</P>

      <P>I want to refer to an incident which has since, I understand, become the subject of a letter to the papers.  It was rather an alarming incident. The Leader of the Opposition went to Louth some weeks ago and told us that he noted, more in sorrow than in anger, that 55,000 people had left the land.  The Leader of the Opposition has a constitutional distaste for making speeches in this House because he does not like being answered.  He <Col N="505" /> twice intervened in the debate on this Estimate but on neither occasion in Leinster House&mdash;once in Drogheda and once in Cork.  When he had wept over the 55,000 who had left the land, the next time he presented himself here I directed his attention to the fact that the 55,000 had left the land in the last six years of his administration.  That shook him a bit and the same source that prepared all the little notes for the Fianna Fáil T.D.s in this debate hustled round, and then we began to hear passing references to the 47,000 that had left the land in the last two years.  Deputy Childers referred to it last Wednesday in the House and, quite unconscious of any chicanery, I said to Deputy Childers: &ldquo;Would the Deputy be kind enough to give me the reference?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;I have not got it.  It was in answer to a parliamentary question.&rdquo;  Shortly afterwards, Deputy Major de Valera came into the House and very politely gave me the reference &mdash;and then there did a strange tale unfold. We have figures every year relating to the number of male persons employed upon the land.</P>
      <P>Now, when the statistics are in the process of preparation, male persons employed on the land are segregated into two categories, male persons between the ages of 14 and 18 and male persons of 18 and upwards.  The figure for the male persons employed on the land which the Leader of the Opposition used in Drogheda or Dundalk related to the total number of male persons employed on the land and were: for 1943, 554,000, for 1944, 526,000, for 1945, 521,000, for 1946, 519,000, for 1947, 507,000 and for 1948, 499,000.  It was urgently necessary to rebut the fact that six years of Fianna Fáil had cleared 55,000 off the land.  Therefore, the ever-resourceful Deputy Killilea took the field and Deputy Killilea put down a parliamentary question, to ask the Taoiseach if he would state the number of male agricultural workers employed on farms during 1949.  However, before the question was put upon the Order Paper for reply, Deputy Killilea got wind of the word that he was not going to get the answer he hoped for.  Did this exhaust the resources of Deputy Killilea?  It did not. He withdrew the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="506" /> Another very interesting thing happened. Deputy Lynch of Cork sharpened his pencil, but he phrased the question a little differently.  He wished to know if the Taoiseach would tell him the number of male agricultural workers over 18 employed on farms during 1949.  So, the Taoiseach told him and that figure was 452,500.  That was the figure Deputy Childers quoted for me.  It was just 30,000 wrong.</P>

      <P>Is it not a queer, twisted mind that wants to get up and dree its weird about lamentations, misfortunes and misery and wretcheduess? You can go to any chapel gate in Ireland and ask the question &ldquo;Were you every better off than you are to-day?&rdquo; and, thanks be to God, the answer is &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;  But Deputies on that side of the House know that.  Do they think our people are fools?  Do they imagine our people, knowing their own circumstances, will fail to realise that it is nothing but this bestial hatred of me that makes Fianna Fáil waste three weeks of public time bawling about ghosts and shadows that are not there?  They talk about emigration and tell us that the country is bleeding to death, the implication, of course, being that the inter-Party Government opened the arteries.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition had a word to say on this subject in July, 1947.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The most important question was that of emigration, but when they had done the best they could the drift from the land to the towns or abroad would continue.  There was no other way for it.  There has been that steady trend since the famine, and perhaps it was a tendency they could not stop.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was quoted by the Minister for Finance in the Seanad Official Debates, Volume 38, column 495.  What is all this hullabaloo about the population of Ireland melting away?  It astonishes me how people can talk themselves into believing almost anything.  The population of this country reached its nadir in recent times in 1939, when it was 2,934,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was after the first ten years of Fianna Fáil disaster and, God knows, you would not blame them to go and have one look at Hitler and another look at the then Prime Minister, Mr. de Valera.  After some vacillation they chose de Valera in preference to Hitler and they began to come back.  In 1940, the figure was 2,958,000; in 1941, 2,961,000.  Then the population began to go down.  There was emigration to England.  In 1944, the figure was 2,444,000.  Since 1944 the population has gone steadily up.  In 1945, it was <Col N="508" /> 2,954,000; in 1946, 2,963,000; in 1947, 2,972,000; in 1948, 2,978,000, and in 1949, 2,991,000.  I will be disappointed if it is not over 3,000,000 for this year. Does any Deputy realise that, instead of the population of Ireland going down, it is going up?  I think we have all talked ourselves into the belief that the Irish people were evaporating. They are not.  They are going strong, and we are going strong because our people are based on a sound philosophical foundation and, bad and all as this country is, walk the world and see if you will find a better one.  I have been all over Europe recently, and I cannot see any better.  I have talked to a lot of people who have come to visit this country, and I think they will tell you that there is a great deal worse than Ireland.</P>
    <P>Sometimes, when I hear some of my friends and colleagues talk about the wealthy plutocrats who are coming in and buying up the land of Ireland, I say to myself: &ldquo;People do not make money in the troubled world we are living in, without a good deal of hard, calculated common sense behind them&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We can settle whether we want their permanent residence here or not but, to me, it is a very eloquent comment on the stability and happiness of this country, because it appears to them, after they have surveyed the world, that Ireland is a country where the bulk of the people feel they are equitably dealt with and <Col N="509" /> fairly treated, a country where there are settled stable institutions, because in it there is not fertile soil for the doctrines of disruption and hatred, and because injustice and inequality are not acceptable to any substantial section of the Irish people.</P>
      <P>Now, I have considerable sympathy with people who consider that the members of the agricultural industry long for stability and for guaranteed prices, but, before I turn to that, I want to acknowledge, in the presence of Deputy Smith, that he takes valid issue with me when he says that when I had a matter of grave consequence to settle for the farmers of this country, I thought it in no way unbecoming to consult them.  Deputy Dr. Ryan, speaking here to-day, said that was a laughable thing&mdash;to consult the farmers about the price of milk.  I wrote down his words: &ldquo;That was a laughable thing, to consult the farmers as to whether they preferred 1/- or ½ for milk.&rdquo;  What did he expect them to say?  Well, I did not think it was laughable, and I do not think it is laughable now.  If I had to do it again, I would do exactly what I did.  I want to put it in contrast with Deputy Smith's approach to this matter.  He also feels that a firm tone is necessary for an honest Minister for Agriculture. When speaking of the farmers, Deputy Smith &mdash; speaking at column 2239, Volume 106, of the Official Debates&mdash; said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I shall tell you that I had them safely tucked in the back of my mind when I was talking in Navan and if it had not been for the kind of season that Providence decided to send us, I would not have had them tucked in the back of my mind; I would have had inspectors tucked after them, and I would have tucked them out into fresh land, and I would compel them to break fresh land, and if they did not do it I would tuck in the tractors through the ditches and through the gates and tuck out the land for them ... If the Lord Almighty provides us with good weather that will enable us to make a start, and if there should be a necessity next season to be as rigid as heretofore&mdash;and there may be&mdash;I am going to tell them here <Col N="510" /> and now that I will recruit the full of ten fields of inspectors, and I will spend plenty of money in paying them travelling expenses and everything else, and I will hire all the tractors and machinery I can get and I will go down and pick every one of the `cods' out and I will say: `Take down that piece of wire and put it around the other corner, and just break it up until we see will you get more than four barrels or four and a half barrels' ... When I do that you can call me a thug or a clod or a driver, whatever you like, I do not care.  If I am here in the position of Minister, so sure as I have the Almighty to face some day or other, I will end this nonsense.  That is my attitude to this question of production. I have heard more of this word `production' since this debate started than I have heard for as long as I can remember.  My back is nearly broken listening to it.  Maybe I should not say much more.  We were talking earlier in the debate about Guinness, but Guinness is never about at the right time.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have often spoken in this House, in comment, on the desire of Deputies to have guaranteed prices for all the produce produced in Ireland.  I pointed out, again and again, that to give such guarantees is possible for a wealthy industrial State in which agricultural production represents a relatively minor part of their national income. Even there it creates a great difficulty. But in a country, 90 per cent. of whose wealth is derived from agriculture, it is just not physically possible.  Deputies will ask me why?  I will give them the picture of what has transpired in the United States of America consequent on the attempt of the Secretary of Agriculture of the United States Government, Mr. Brannan, to provide guaranteed prices for his own domestic producers.  To keep the Commodity Credit Corporation going, the United <Col N="511" /> States Congress last week agreed to add another two million dollars to the 4,700 million dollars it already has. Already the Commodity Credit Corporation has stored up enough wheat and corn to fill a freight train stretching 11,679 miles, half-way around the world at the Equator.  It has stored enough cotton to make 90,000,000 bed sheets. It has 880,000,000 eggs in store.  It has 99,000,000 lbs. of butter in store and it has enough powdered milk, 316,000,000 lbs., to irrigate the wheaties of all New York City schoolchildren for several years to come.  There are also mountains of cheese, soya beans, tobacco, dried fruit and peas, rosin, cotton seeds, meal and other products which no one would buy and which the Government could hardly give away.</P>

      <P>The magazine <i>Time</i>, of June 19th, 1950.  Two questions present themselves.  What will ultimately become of these stocks of food?  And, secondly, supposing Ireland guarantees her farmers, as America has guarantteed her farmers, a remunerative price for any given commodity such as butter, whether or not it can be sold abroad, and she is subsequently unable to sell, what will she do if her store of butter collides with the 99,000,000 lbs. of butter that America has stored in the Caves of Acheson?  It is not such a bad thing to have a buyer bespoken, albeit not always at the price that one would like to get, at whatever price one can afford to take when one knows that there are 99,000,000 lbs. of butter, 880,000,000 lbs. of dried eggs and 516,242,531 bushels of wheat and corn in the Caves of Acheson, which may be sold to-morrow morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only six weeks ago the Government of the United States of America was offering potatoes at one cent per bushel in a bag that cost the United <Col N="512" /> States Government 15 cents.  Deputy Blaney is displeased with 8/- per cwt. for the modest product of County Donegal. I wonder how he would have felt if the cold blast of competition of the one cent per bushel potatoes in bags that cost 15 cents had been felt in Donegal?  Let this House reflect with some satisfaction on the fact that till the 1st of February, 1952, every egg produced here will be sold, and is sold now, for 2d. or 3½d. despite the fact that there are 880,000,000 of them awaiting consumption in the Caves of Acheson.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise again that this House has suffered itself to be sold by Fianna Fáil the fraudulent proposition that the cost of food has raised the cost of living in this country.  That is not true.  The facts are that the cost of food in this country has absorbed the increase in the cost of living occasioned by the rise in the price of clothing, boots, rent and rates.  It is only in the immediately recent past that the reduction in the cost of food has failed completely to cover up the impact of these other charges.  So long as I am Minister for Agriculture there will be no successful conspiracy to beat down the prices of our people's products on the ground that they are an occasion of a rise in the cost of living towards which, in fact, they have substantially contributed in order to bring about a reduction.</P>
    <P>I am struck by the campaign of Fianna Fáil to frighten our people into a belief that we are on the verge of war and unprepared.  Fianna Fáil are willing to would but afraid to strike. They want to make a case that the present Government, because it refuses to subscribe to every panic-mongering carouse that Fianna Fáil encourages, is indifferent to the dangers that exist. This Government has never been under any illusion about the dangers that exist or the precautions requisite to provide against them.  If anyone in this country is so foolish as to imagine that the situation in the Korea brings war a day nearer or puts it a day further away, they had better think again.  The Cominform will go to war without any Christian excuses, out of no loyalty to friends or satellites, when it is good and ready to go to war.  It <Col N="513" /> might go to war to-morrow, it might go to war this day 12 months or this day three years but no fortuitous event, no coincidental occurrence is going to shake its decision as to the time it wants to go to war.</P>
    <P>Living in the world we live in, so as long as there are mad beasts of that kind on the prowl, every prudent Government has that present to its mind and acts accordingly but it does not cripple the economy of its own country in terror-stricken panic every time anyone fires a shot.  It carries on calmly with its job.  What is its job?  To insulate our people as fully as possible against any shortage or deprivation that might otherwise come suddenly upon them, in so far as the Department of Agriculture is concerned.  What is the first requisite effectively to provide for that?  Storage.  And what was the position when this Government came into office?  Not one square foot of storage for grain had been constructed in this country for 15 years but since this Government came into office, there is increased storage in Limerick, there is 20,000 tons of increased storage building in Cork, there is 16,000 extra tons building in Dublin and 60,000 tons of extra storage is being planned.  It cannot be built overnight, but it will all be built and it will be built, not where the grain merchants or millers require; it will be built where our people require.</P>
    <P>There is another good place to store food, a good place to store fertilisers and that is the land.  There have been more fertilisers and more food <i>in potentia</i> stored in the land of Ireland in the last two years than was stored in the whole 16 disastrous years of Fianna Fáil.  Now, the poor creatures, in their desire to find fault, contradict themselves.  At one moment the Minister for Agriculture has obliterated wheat and at the next moment the Minister for Agriculture has changed his policy and he loves wheat. I have not changed my mind of one hair's breadth but when we came into office&mdash; I have told this to the House before and I make no apology for telling Deputies again&mdash;I took counsel with my colleagues and we were all agreed that the true test of democracy is not <Col N="514" /> the size of the Government's majority but the measure of its solicitude for the legitimate desires of the Opposition.  I knew that it had become something of a <i>mystique</i> with Fianna Fáil to grow wheat and that judging me by themselves, they expected that when I got into office I would enjoy insulting and affronting them.  I said to the Taoiseach that I invited his approval and that of my colleagues for taking a measure right from the beginning to carry conviction to their minds that we had no desire to affront them and that we wanted all of them to know that this Government was their servant, as it was the servant of every citizen of the State, solemnly charged with the responsibility for protecting their legitimate desires as it was to protect the legitimate desires of any other section of the community.</P>
    <P>We, therefore, guaranteed a price of 62/6 for wheat for the next five years with this remarkable result.  I have read out to the House Deputy Smith's method of persuading the farmers of Ireland to grow wheat and Deputies know the result but last year, on 150,000 acres less land, we got very nearly as much wheat as was threshed after the 1948 harvest.  There are not 100,000 barrels between the 350,000 acres sown in wheat last year and the 500,000 acres that were sown in the last year of compulsory tillage.  Fianna Fáil's Complaint is that the acreage has shrunk.  Is it undesirable to get more wheat out of less land?  If it is Fianna Fáil's policy to get less wheat out of more land, I set against that policy our policy to get more wheat out of less land.</P>
    <P>I have this strange tale to tell the House.  No farmer in Ireland to-day experiences the slightest sense of coercion, yet there will be very nearly 400,000 acres of wheat and there will be very nearly 3,000,000 barrels of wheat.  For the first time in recorded history, our people will have grown nearly their total requirements of wheat.  Fifteen years of Deputy Smith's inspectors and privateers produced less wheat from more land.  Two years of the revolutionary method of treating Irish farmers as though they were intelligent human beings has produced more of that unfortunate cereal <Col N="515" /> than the whole 15 of Deputy Smith's Government.</P>
    <P>What gratifies me is this, that not only will there be that remarkable result, which must distress the anxious soul who foresaw our people starving for want of bread, but there will be more cereals grown in this country I hope this year than we have had for many a long day, and I am in a position to face with relative equanimity the prospect, if it must be faced, that we will have no maize at all next year. If we have not, we can get along without it.  We will have oats, we will have barley and we will have potatoes I think in sufficient quantity.  Should circumstances allow, my aim will be to convert all that into exportable merchandise and then bring in as much more and convert that also.  If it is legitimate to import raw materials for any factory in a town or city from the other end of the earth, process them and glory in their export, is it not legitimate for the 500,000 factories represented by the small farmers of Ireland to bring in maize from the Argentine or the United State, process it in the Irish factories and send it out as bacon or pigs or live stock or milk or butter or cheese or chocolate crumb?  Need we hang our heads in shame if we exhaust the capacity of our own soil to produce raw materials and multiply our wealth by bringing more to hand, the better to let our people live?  I do not believe that our people on the land were destined by God for ever to be poor.  They will never be rich, but they have as much right to the amenities of life as any other section of our community, and, if I am to remain Minister for Agriculture, I will see that they will get it.</P>
    <P>It never was possible to shake ourselves free of dependence on Indian meal in the past and the reason is simple.  We had no cereal to put in its place.  You cannot use oats as you use maize and the barley we grew in Ireland, bushel for bushel, was so much dearer than imported maize that our farmers could not have lived if they had access to nothing but Spratt Archer barley and then had to complete in foreign markets where their competitors have access to maize.  But we have <Col N="516" /> got new varieties of barley now in Ymer, in Kenya and in Freja.  Cautious scientists will forbear from optimistic predicition.  I am neither cautions nor a scientist&mdash;God forbid I should be either.  Therefore, I suggest that we have in these&mdash;and I speak from experience, which is very often the master of caution and science&mdash;varieties of barley which, on our own land, can produce 50 cwts. to the statute acre and which have produced 62 cwts.  Do not take me to say that I anticipate there will be an average all over Ireland of the order of 62 cwts., but I say that there will be an average yield from Ymer and other foods, where land is well cultivated, of between 40 and 50 cwts., and it used to be, with Spratt Archer, 15 to 18 cwts.  That is why I say now that we stand on the threshold of a day when, if we have no maize at all, we can contemplate the future with equanimity.  But, when we have used all the cereals and all the feeding stuffs we are capable of growing here, I make no apology for saying that I glory in the opportunity of bringing in as much more as money can buy and our people can handle, so that by steadily increasing production we can contribute to the food supply of the world and to the wealth of our own people.</P>
    <P>I want to comment in passing on Deputy Boland.  I quote from the <i>Roscommon Herald</i> of Saturday, June 17th, which reports Deputy Boland as speaking at Strokestown and, becomingly enough, he founded his oration on the <i>Irish Times.</i>  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;During the war we were at least in a position to ensure a fair sized ration of bread from our own wheat and also sugar, and, as a result of the Fianna Fáil Government, we were able to overcome most of our fuel difficulties.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Shades of the Phoenix Park.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Now, however, thanks to the activities of Mr. James Dillon, we are almost totally dependent on outside sources for our bread and our animal feeding stuffs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If you are going to tell one there is nothing like telling a whopper, because at no previous stage in the history of Ireland was there ever more wheat in <Col N="517" /> store and growing than there is on this particular day.</P>

I have been sitting here now for close on 48 hours and short of reading the Koran they have read almost everything else.  I am going to read a piece, quite an interesting piece, too.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was Deputy Dr. Ryan. He was being very philosophical here to-day.  Deputy Dr. Ryan spoke on milk.  I am quoting the official minute of the County Committees of Agriculture meeting for Minister Counties, <Col N="518" /> held in Limerick on the 16th January, 1946:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dr. Ryan in dealing with points raised in relation to the dairying industry said that prices would be revised for a period of 12 months as from 1st April each year and on the basis of prices of feeding stuffs in the previous calendar year.  He had no doubt that a cow would have to be fed better than was indicated in the White Paper but most of our milk is produced off grass and we could not fix prices on the basis that all cows are winter producers.  Only 7 per cent. of our milk is produced in winter.  Farmers have been content with prices for some time past and their big fear is that there may be a slump.  The Department has tried to guarantee them against this.  The prices in the White Paper were those submitted to the Government and they had been agreed to without alteration.  He added that up to 15 years ago dairy farmers here could compete against the world but then butter prices slumped so low that something had to be done but it was never intended that the subsidy should be a permanent feature.  With regard to the present proposals, however, he would like to point out that we may have butter for export later and, if so, and if the export price is lower than the home price, the cost will fall on the State. Continuing, the Minister said that if farmers had now to compete against other countries the price of milk might be as low as 6d.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The report goes on:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If we were to import butter we might have it at ? per lb.  The milk prices suggested by some of the delegates would correspond to a price of 3/- per lb. for butter.  He thought that if the facts were placed before the consumers there might be many who would prefer to let the dairying industry go and have butter at ?. Briefly, the position was that the Department was telling farmers that they were not in such a bad position <Col N="519" /> at present and that they were going to try to keep them there.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Read one for me now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the file on which that is recorded took fire in the Registry and burnt&mdash;spontaneous combustion.</P>
      <P>I went, as Deputies know, to Dungarvan, and greatly shocked Deputy Smith by telling the farmers the situation as I saw it.  In discussing milk prices to date I have always laboured under a certain difficulty, because I was sharply challenged on more than one occasion, and from more parts of the House than one, to produce costings. I knew the costings had been prepared and I had seen them but I had never had leave to quote them. Deputy Corry, however, a fortnight ago, produced them.  He showed them to the House and said: &ldquo;These are Professor Murphy's costings and I am going to quote them.&rdquo;  And he did. He did not know that I had them on the desk in front of me, too.  I said to the Deputy: &ldquo;When you quote them you accord me leave to quote them, too.&rdquo;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  I thanked him and now I am going to quote them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will remember that Deputy Ryan wisely said that creamery milk, if it is to compete on the markets of the world, must be produced from grass.  Quite different is the case of people supplying liquid milk to the city or town where people drink the same quantity of milk every morning with their tea, and you must have a stable supply in December, January, April, May and June.  It is quite practicable so to arrange your operations that the bulk of your cattle calve in spring. The bulk of your milk goes to the creamery while the grass is growing and is converted into butter, the cold storage of which presents no formidable problem.  Now, with the development of silage, cattle can be carried through the winter without the provision of any purchased feeding stuffs at all for well-made silage now is superior in many cases to oil cake or concentrated compounds.  It is certainly true that if Irish dairying is to be a competitor with the rest of the world <Col N="520" /> it must be based on growing grass and silage, for that is what its competitors use.  Therefore, it is summer milk that goes to make creamery butter, and when Professor Murphy fell to make his calculations on the cost of producing milk he established that the cost of producing milk in the summer months was 8.82 pence per gallon, if you allow £1 as the value of the calf. If the average yield is 500 gallons and you get £10 for a calf, you get £9 more than Professor Murphy foresaw.  Nine times 240 is 2,100 pennies.  Five hundred divided into 2,100 is 4d. per gallon.</P>
    <P>Allowing an increase in the costs of production of 2d. per gallon&mdash;it is excessive but let us allow it&mdash;since Dr. Murphy made these costings, and apply the extra 4d., it only costs 6½d. per gallon to produce milk from grass to-day. But let us concede that to strike an average for the whole dairy area of the country of £10 per calf is unduly liberal, and this, I think, can be claimed beyond a shadow of doubt, that the surplus over 8d. in the cost of producing a gallon of milk is so small as to be negligible.  It was possible to say to the dairy industry four months ago that, if they would take a minimum price of 290/- for butter, the saving to their own Treasury would in this year be such that, according to every criterion of prudence, it would have been possible to guarantee that that price would be maintained for five years, whatever surplus accrued, because there was no possibility of an annual surplus arising in the course of those five years which could involve an outlay on export subsidy which would charge the Treasury with a sum greater than the subsidy due to be paid this year.</P>
    <P>I desperately want to secure for the dairy farmer that degree of insurance. I know of the millions of pounds of butter stored in the United States of America.  I know that Germany is exporting butter at certain periods of the year.  I know that Holland and Denmark are returning to the export market, and that Switzerland will, as well as New Zealand and Australia, and, as that growing ocean of butter comes upon the markets of the world, the security of our dairy farmers will <Col N="521" /> become more doubtful every day, and the only way we can prevent a situation arising in this country such as I have described as having arisen in the United States of America, is to eliminate the problem of surplus or else limit production.  I said in Dungarvan: &ldquo;If you do not take a long view, all experience teaches that no enterprise ever stands still.  It goes forward or it goes back,&rdquo; and I say now that the day our Government fixes a rigid limit of production beyond which the dairy industry may not go, we take our first step on the road that leads to the ultimate ruin of the whole dairy industry. Either the dairy industry goes forward to increased prosperity and productions, expanding production and expanding sale, or it goes back&mdash;it cannot stand still.</P>
    <P>Will any Deputy say to me that I would be equal to my responsibilities if, faced with the fact that this year's output of the dairy industry will cost the Treasury £3,000,000, and, if it expands as I want to see it expand next year, it will cost £4,000,000 or £5,000,000, I deluded the dairy farmers into believing that a Government can be found who will find £5,000,000 to subsidise them?  I know they will not and I tell them now that they will not.  The only difference between me and the frauds who tried to avail of their dilemma is that, just as Deputy Blaney was willing to purchase the votes of the people in East Donegal with the property of his own neighbours, so they would hope to clamber back into office by pledging their souls to maintain a price for milk out of the public revenue which they knew in their hearts neither they nor anybody else could do.</P>
    <P>We heard Deputy Smith in his opening speech saying: &ldquo;I will not complain about promises.  We all make them and none of us keeps them.&rdquo;</P>

No other market is of any value to the dairy industry of this country. We have that for the taking if we take it.

Is it not theirs to make or mar and is it not the duty of a Minister for Agriculture to tell them frankly what he can do to help them to make it and how little he can do to prevent them marring it if they want to mar it themselves?  I see no indignity.  I see no shame in telling the owners of that industry that quite plainly.  I disclaim the duty to be their slave-driver.  I disclaim the duty to command them.  I think it is unbecomeing in a servant to command his master.  Deputy Smith might remember that simple precept and his appearance would be more attractive.  I believe that with the market, which is expanding, for cheese, chocolate crumb, dried milk, there is a great future for the dairy industry of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Allen and Deputy Ryan made great play to-day about farmers' butter. Of course, it is a subject about which many Deputies are not much concerned and into which they have not inquired. I wish Deputies knew the facts.  There are certain areas in Ireland, notably Wexford, North Clare, South Galway, in which the mixed farming traditionally practised there left a surplus of milk but never sufficient to maintain a creamery industry.  That has been the case certainly for the last 20 years.  The best contribution Fianna Fáil could make to its solution was to propound a subsidiary scheme, the net result of which was that the dealers in butter made more than they ever made before and Deputy Smith's successor had left to him a cargo of rubbish on the North Wall and, as I told the House before, it took a fire brigade to get next or near it.  If Deputy Smith thinks that by putting on a gas mask and travelling <Col N="524" /> to London sitting on top of that butter, he could fool the British butter buyer into believing that that was the evening breeze that was coming up the Thames, he is a greater fool than I think he is. The only hope was to put on Dutch raiment and wooden shoes and pretend it was Lieder Krentz cheese.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Of that junk?  I would not export that as butter to Liberia or to my worst enemy.  It would poison a dog.  We have no reason to apologise for Irish butter.  It is the best butter in the world.  Let me tell you its history.  Why should we disgrace the name of the Irish industry by sending out foul smelling rubbish of that kind and claiming for it the treatment and respect due to good Irish butter? I would not feed that stuff to a dog.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I sent it out under protest to a factory.  It was used for lubrication or conversion into a jawbreaker toffee.  You can put this stuff through a process of treatment which removes the foul smell.  That was not farmers' butter as Deputies know it. The farmers' butter that we know of is the farmers' butter made by 95 per cent. of the women who make farmers' butter and who have a queue of customers from their own neighbourhood standing at their door waiting for the butter to come off the churn.  But there is in every community a couple of women who think they can make butter.  I know them well.  They are decent respectable women but, whenever I see a bit of butter-muslin trailing out of their basket, I fly like the wind because if I will not buy the butter from them I will insult them and if I do buy the butter I will not be able to live in the house with it. They are decent women but they do not know how to make butter and everyone they go to runs out because they see the butter muslin before they see the women.  The woman eventually goes to a grocer's shop in the town and gives her order for tea, sugar, meat and whatever else she wants. The grocer makes up his bill.  Up <Col N="525" /> comes the butter and he either buys it from her or she leaves him with the parcel of goods and, of course, he buys the butter.  Then the firkin is produced and the butter is buried as near the bottom of the firkin as he can put it in the optimistic hope that he will buy some good butter later in the day.</P>
      <P>Long experience has taught us that, as the market for farm butter has tended to dwindle, local demand consumes almost all the well-made farm butter.  The only farm butter that gets into the Cork butter trade now is second rate stuff.</P>

      <P>A good deal of that can be used for confectionery purposes but when you come to the tail end of the second-grade farmers' butter the only thing it can be used for is to provide Deputy Patrick Smith with something to put into cold storage and, unfortunately, me with something to take out of cold store.  What is the use of working oneself into a passion, trying to persuade oneself that that product is a desirable product, and economic or a creditable product?  It is neither one nor the other, and it is no discredit to anybody, it is simply that the people making it do not know how.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Instead of blabbing and barging at one another across the House as to why, all I know is that the stuff has a smell that is as foul as the devil.  I am not interested in wrangling or blathering with Deputy Cogan as to how and why and when.  My concern is to provide these women with a profitable place to sell their butter. I am told by Deputy Allen, Deputy Smith and Deputy Cogan that all they can get for the butter is ? a lb.  Very well, I am going to provide them with the means to get 2/6 and if the product produces more they will get it and they will have no need to make any more home butter except that which they want in their own house and which their neighbours ask them to make for them.  So far as Wexford is concerned, we will try it out, buying that <Col N="526" /> milk from them, not in the regular quantity that would justify a butter creamery but for the manufacture of cheese.  In North Clare and South Galway, I am glad to be able to tell the House that we can resolve the problem in another way.  By doing a little campaigning and organisation, we have increased the milk supply from North Clare and South Galway to a point which justifies establishing creameries there, and that we are at present in process of doing.</P>
      <P>Now, a matter that has been touched upon here&mdash;Deputy Davin and Deputy Cogan touched upon it&mdash;was credit for farmers.  I have tried to inform Deputies very fully of the facilities available to farmers for credit.  I am a great believer, however, that if you can meet the wishes of Oireachtas Éireann in consonance with the fundamental policy of the Government, the wishes of Oireachtas Éireann should be met.  The view does seem to be held that our farmers live on land which is relatively good but which lacks fertility and that nothing stands between those farmers and the recurrent cycle of prosperous performance but the means to prime the pump. Very well; I am prepared to test that out and under the land project if any farmer in Ireland believes that his land lacks nothing but fertilisers to make it fructify and if he will apply to the Department of Agriculture&mdash; the scheme will have to be prepared in detail, but I offer the Dáil the outline of it now&mdash;enclosing a fee of 1/- per acre&mdash;if he is a ten-acre man, 10/-; if he is a 1,000-acre man, £50&mdash;we will test the soil of every field upon his holding and we will undertake to provide, deliver and spread the lime, the phosphates and the potash the land may require.  He will be informed of the total cost and, subject to his paying any fraction of that cost, the balance can be funded as an annuity to be consolidated with his land annuity&mdash;subject to the provision that second recourse may not be had to that scheme unless and until the annuity in respect of its first application has been redeemed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is now within the reach of every farmer in this country the means <Col N="527" /> to rehabilitate his land, the means to fertilise it on credit, paying every penny back that is lent to him, the means to buy stock, to buy implements, the means to erect new buildings, the means to have everything requisite for useful users of the land&mdash;except hard work.  There is no one who could provide that but the farmer himself. Every farmer who is prepared to provide that has the road open to him.  I want to make that demonstrably clear.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith found fault with me for saying that the 1948 Agreement made available to our people a remunerative market for everything produced upon the land of Ireland.  I want most deliberately to reiterate that statement now.  I want to call in evidence that in 1949 the agricultural exports of this country earned a greater money income for our people than on any previous occasion in recorded time.  I say that there is available to our people to-day a profitable market for cattle, sheep, milk products and eggs, for all the live stock and live-stock products our land is capable of producing, and for every cwt. of cereals our land is capable of growing.  But I want to say again and with emphasis that there is no Minister for Agriculture who can ever take his stand here and honestly say to our people that there shall be a cash market for every crop he grows upon his land.  If he makes the attempt so to guarantee, he embarks upon the road taken by Mr. Brennan, the American Secretary for Agriculture.  The industrial wealth of the United States of America may permit of that in America, but in Ireland everybody lives out of the land and if they do not live out of the land they do not live at all.  The land cannot support the land: the land in this country has to support everything else.  And the land does it, not out of price primarily, but out of profit, the difference between the cost of production and the price for which you sell.</P>
    <P>As I told the British Minister of Food, our people want no excess profit, but they will not work for a loss and there is no use suggesting that you can buy Irish produce at an uneconomic <Col N="528" /> price, for the only result of fixing such a price is that you will get no produce at all.  I have no doubt I will be told hereafter that that was arrogant and flamboyant, but I glory in the fact of our people's capacity, should circumstances require it, to go back, as they have gone back before, to subsistence level and to resolve that the day will never dawn when they will work for anybody for nothing.  God keep them so for ever.  On that basis I want to sell, and I believe we are going to sell, increasing quantities of foodstuffs to the British people, and I am glad to sell them to them at a fair price, fixed by consent between a willing buyer and a willing seller.  I know what can be done will be done by my friends on the Opposition Benches to prevent that coming to pass, but despite their best endeavour I think it will.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith or Deputy Blaney wanted to know if there was a sale for potatoes this year.  Yes&mdash;50,000 tons. I believe there will be sale for all the pigs and bacon we can produce&mdash;but I cannot prove that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Did you complete the contract for potatoes last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh now, that was a piece of mischief-making I want to refer to. Let me tell that story&mdash;and I will tell it all.  Two years ago, when I came into office, there was a contract for 50,000 tons of potatoes&mdash;and it was a year of great abundance.  It became early obvious that the British themselves had far more potatoes than they themselves could dispose of.  I would not have thought it was in any degree unreasonable for the British to say: &ldquo;We are smothered out in potatoes and can ye dispose of them anywhere else without compelling us to take them?&rdquo; Nothing could exceed the scrupulous rectitude <Col N="529" /> with which the British Ministry of Food proceeded&mdash;and it is right that I should say that.  They are tough, hard, ruthless bargainers&mdash;and they are right to make the best bargain they can for their own people&mdash;but once they put their hand to a bargain they keep it. They insisted on taking delivery of every stone they purchased and they paid us £10 and more for it, according to the season.  They had to deliver them to factories for processing and they took the loss without a word and, in respect of one consignment which I knew had been turned to industrial purposes, they returned to say that they paid for this consignment as were but it was delivered on foot of a contract for seed and they accordingly enclosed a cheque for the difference. Very well.  This year, a similar contract for 50,000 tons had been made&mdash; and then Deputy Davern and Deputy Blaney came on the rampage.  Early in the year the Department accumulates a reserve of potatoes for the protection of the Dublin City market.  In addition to that, this year we had bought potatoes for delivery under the contract to Great Britain.  When we proceeded to test the Dublin City reserve, the classic symptom emerged that farmers had in many cases sold the potatoes which they had already sold to us to somebody else who came along with a lorry and bid them a higher price.  That is so typical a symptom that we knew at once that we were going to be faced with a shortage. Our first duty was to make safe the domestic consumer from scarcity. When we had done that it was clear that our total delivery on foot of the contract for 50,000 tons of potatoes could be no more than 24,000 tons from domestic sources.  I looked for potatoes on the Continent but I failed to get them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not every type of potato that can be delivered under a ware potato contract to Great Britain.  They specify certain types of potatoes they are prepared to accept.  Those varities are not easily come by in the United States &mdash;in fact, they are not available at all. But there is an area of Prince Edward Island in Canada where types of potatoes acceptable to the British <Col N="530" /> market are available.  We located there 26,000 tons of potatoes or the option of them.  I sought authority from our Government to spend dollars belonging to our earnings&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>And you charged me with lying when I told that story here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to tell that story but I did not use the word &ldquo;lying&rdquo;.  I used the term &ldquo;prevarication of mischievous kind&rdquo;.  We were very careful that they should be our dollars.  We were very careful that they should constitute no charge whatever on the sterling pool.  A high officer of my Department went specially to London to see the head of the Potato Division of the Ministry of Food and to explain that there was no need to have any delicacy on the subject of dollars because we had the dollars; that there was no question of impinging on the resources of the dollar pool because these were dollars which we had available outside the dollar pool, and that they must dismiss from their mind any question of the expense to which we might be put because we acknowledged that in the previous year they had cheerfully met heavy expense and we would not wish to see them short of a hundred-weight of potatoes on account of our failure to perform our contract as they had performed theirs.  The reply of the British Ministry of Food was: &ldquo;We think we can get through.  Do not spend your good dollars if it is not necessary.  We will let you know if we are caught short and we will reckon on that 26,000 tons as being available if we want them.&rdquo;  When the last day of the contract time came, they notified us that they just squeezed through and that they were obliged to us for our solicitude to offer them performance in circumstances such as that.  Every blooming mischief that Deputy Smith could make he made in this House because, of course, the responsible Minister in London had to take the risk of being sharply chastened in his own Parliament if, in his desire to act equitably, he should have run into&mdash; and he very nearly did&mdash;a shortage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They had a large reserve of potatoes in Northern Ireland which they foresaw <Col N="531" /> would be surplus to their entire requirements and suddenly the whole thing was swept into the market and they just squeezed through.  But my helpful colleague was here baa-ing every week to give them all the details of this story.  I knew perfectly well that if I got up to tell that story <i>ex parte</i> while the contract was still current there would be plenty of his prototypes in the British House of Commons to say baa to the Minister of Food.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that there was a charge on the sterling pool for these potatoes.  The whole point of our approach to the British Ministry of Food was to show that we had the means of fulfilling our contracts in Canada without making any demand on them.  It would have been a very poor gesture to go to London and say: &ldquo;We will get you potatoes if you pay for them&rdquo;.  The whole object was that we put ourselves in a position without imposing any charge on the British to fulfil what we had undertaken to fulfil, and they very decently said: &ldquo;If we cannot get on without them, we will ask you to do it, but otherwise we will not.&rdquo;  I will try to get the Deputy the column in which he made that statement.

      <P>I will get the column for you later on.  I have tried to cover most of the matters that were raised here, but one could talk for ever if one were to try to deal with everything. There are, however, one or two things I want to conclude with.  One is the land project.  The land project was designed for farmers in every category, but it was primarily designed for small farmers.  I am sometimes a little troubled that small farmers seem to think that it is so vast that it must be intended only for the big farmers and that these great machines have no place on a small holding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be remembered that it is just as difficult to shift a double ditch topped with hawthorn that has been growing there for years on a ten-acre holding as it would be to shift a similar obstacle on a 1,000-acre holding.  I know of nothing better than a bulldozer to do that shifting, unless you are to put a gang of men on the work for a month.  It is on the eight, the <Col N="533" /> ten, and the 12-acre holding that we want to see this machinery doing the work that otherwise could never be done and it was for the owners of such holdings primarily that this project was put in hands.  I hope Deputies will help me to persuade the small farmers to avail of it.  I will now quote from column 1946:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The fact that it was a prince's island did not seem to make any difference, republicans and all that we were.  Finally, we entered into a contract to buy potatoes in Prince Edward Island.  Then, of course, they would only take hard currency and that hard currency could only be obtained from the dollar pool.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy Aiken has strolled in within the past few minutes <Col N="534" /> and apparently he is bucked with himself. If he will subside we will be finished in a moment.  I want to call attention to one phenomenon and that is the Fianna Fáil ramp about unemployment. To me, if there is one man in this country who wants an opportunity to earn his bread and has the strength wherewith to do it, and he is unable to find a job, every hour of his existence is a standing rebuke to the Government of the day.  But that Government's task is a thousand times complicated if there is a fictitious claim made that a vast number of people are unemployed who are no more unemployed than I am.  It is the Fianna Fáil purpose to affirm that there are hundreds of hungry, unemployed men walking the roads of rural Ireland unable to find work wherewith to maintain their families.  Now, that pretence is creating a situation in rural Ireland where the genuine seekers for work are getting smothered up by the individuals who are not looking for work and who will not take work if it is offered to them.</P>
      <P>There are as many drawing the dole in rural Sligo as there are in any other county in Ireland.  There is a report of the Sligo County Council where the county engineer said that they cannot put the Local Authorities (Works) Act grants into use because there is no man available to accept employment.  Where there is delay in connection with the land project, in 50 per cent. of the cases, whether the work is done by the farmer himself or whether we are charged to do it, the delay is due to the fact that we cannot get men.  There are not any men available for employment. That is something about which we should rejoice instead of flapping around the country moaning and groaning about the millions of unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I got a letter recently from a man in Gibraltar.  He said he gets the <i>Weekly Independent</i> and they are perplexed to see on one page Mr. Dillon saying there was work for any man in rural Ireland who wanted it and on another page a record of 62,000 on unemployment assistance going to the labour exchange.  He asks: &ldquo;How do you reconcile these things?&rdquo;<Col N="535" /> I want to face this problem, and I think there is an explanation of it.  I think, when you get to the stage of dealing with farmers in this country whose valuation is below £2, you are not dealing with the problem of unemployment at all.  You are dealing with the problem of inadequate means of subsistence; you are dealing with men whose homesteads are not capable of yielding a reasonable living to the men of the house and who, therefore, have to have accessible to them in the immediate vicinity of their own homes some supplementary source of income. But they are not unemployed in the sense that they are available for work, because they cannot leave their homes and take a job away.  If they were to do so, their seven or eight acres of land would go wild, and they would lose more, due to the want of supervision at home, than they would earn in employment away.  That is a problem which my colleague, the Minister for Lands, is doing his part to solve, and which I, in the Department of Fisheries, am doing my part to solve.  Each of us is lending a hand to solve it, but it is not the problem of unemployment.  The great danger is that, misled by that description, we will go on applying remedies appropriate to unemployment and will fail to get results because we are losing sight of the wood for the trees.</P>
    <P>The tragedy is that there may be quite a considerable number of perfectly genuine working men mixed up in a miscellaneous bag of small farmers and the like, some of whom are genuinely unemployed and some of whom are not, but they are all called unemployed.  The man who has not got a little farm of seven or eight acres may be denied the chance of getting a job because, while he may go down to a labour exchange where there are ten or 20 men looking for a job, when you go there and find 3,090 looking for jobs, you throw up your hat in despair.  Nothing that I can do is going promptly to mop them up. There are too many whose circumstances are manifestly such that we <Col N="536" /> cannot force them into the area where they live, and get sufficient work to occupy them all.</P>
    <P>You cannot tackle a problem like that with the same resolve to clean it up that you would do if it were a real problem of working men looking for work in circumstances in which it would be worth their while to take it.</P>
    <P>I see at the present time&mdash;I foresaw it some time ago&mdash;that one of the great difficulties that is going to confront us at a very early date is the scarcity of genuinely available labour.  Unless we are very careful to marshal our resources, urgent and important work may be held up because we will not have the hands to employ to get it done.  I would ask Deputies to lend me their aid in persuading our people in rural Ireland to avail promptly of the water supply scheme, and, in dairying areas especially, of the credit scheme for the supplying of milking machines.  There is no dairy farmer who should contemplate continuing in the dairying industry unless he installs a milking machine.  It is imposing on his family a degree of drudgery which should not constitute an essential part of the dairy farmer's life.  Means are available to him now to install a milking machine to-morrow morning and to pay for it out of his creamery cheque month by month, as the manager draws it.  If he has not got the heart to do that, he ought to get out of the business altogether because it is not fair or right to expect young people to go on striving with equipment and under conditions that would be more suitable to their grandfather's time than they are to the present day.  It is all very well to be sentimental about marching along a grand headland with a lovely Dobbin, but if you have to tramp behind Dobbin with a stone of clay on each boot and then, when you bring him in, you have to take the harness off and feed him before you wash your own hands, it is not quite so romantic, whereas if a young fellow can sit up on a tractor, drive into a field and realise that he is not killing the horse in the work he is doing, and if he can drive home in the evening with the plough cocked up behind him, and put his tractor into a garage the same as <Col N="537" /> the dispensary doctor or the curate can do, then I can tell you farming takes on a very different appearance.</P>
    <P>In saying that, I am following the good example which our President's distinguished lady set when she said that the time had passed when we should look down on agriculture as an occupation in this country.  She went a little further than I do, and described the rest of the population as parasites on the farmer.  I say that agriculture supports the rest of the country.  They are a welcome charge, always provided that farmers are given the means effectively to support it.</P>
    <P>There is one problem that I cannot solve and that the manure manufacturers and the importers cannot solve. Only one person can solve it and that is the farmer.  There is not storage in this country for all the phosphates that we should put out on the land.  You cannot build up greater stocks than your storage will allow.  If everyone is going to put out phosphates between February and June, the total output of our manufacturers, together with our capacity to import supplies and with the limited storage at our disposal, will not be sufficient to meet the demand. On grass land, it is even better to put out phosphates between September and January than it is to put them out in spring.  The farmers could help by putting phosphates and potash on grass land in such quantities as circumstances will permit between September and January.  If they would do that we could double the possibility of the user of fertilisers in this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan derided me this evening about aphosphorosis and said that it must now have disappeared. Little he knows.  There is a big advertisement going to appear in the Press next month giving the name for aphosphorosis as it is known in the Institute of Folklore in every county in Ireland. It has a different name in nearly every county, such names as &ldquo;Boglame&rdquo;, &ldquo;Bockamona&rdquo;, &ldquo;Luanagh&rdquo; and others.  They have six or eight local names in some places.  I have to advise the people to realise that unless this disease is blotted out of the people's memory there is going to be a loss of <Col N="538" /> from 20 to 30 per cent. profit so far as the live-stock industry is concerned. One of the most effective means of wiping that condition out in Ireland would be to persuade the farmers to put out phosphates between October and January.  I do not think I am making an excessive demand on my colleagues in this House if I bespeak their influence to that end.</P>
    <P>With regard to the land project, we shall shortly be producing, I hope, all the pipes we require here But I want to sound this note of warning: in respect of concrete drainage pipes, I do not think that in their own interest there ought to be many more entrants to that trade.  I think the manufacturing capacity for concrete pipes is now nearly commensurate with our requirements, which may be from 10,000,000 to 20,000,000 a year.  In respect of earthenware pipes, production is still far short of our requirements.  I am prepared to buy the entire output of any unit&mdash;and I asked Deputy J.J. Collins, I think, to think over this&mdash;established anywhere in Ireland for the length of the life of the kiln which is manufacturing from clay in a kiln fired by turf.  There is ample scope for further enterprises in that connection.</P>
    <P>That is the story.  God knows, it has been a long one.  But in the light of the many chapters that were contributed by my disinterested, open-minded and benevolent critics on the far side of the House, I do not think I have unduly trespassed on their patience in finishing the last chapter.  I want to end as I began.  I want to exhort Fianna Fáil to exorcise in themselves and their Party the disgusting vice of hate.  It is twisting their minds.  It is disgracing the proceedings of this Parliament and, valuable as I may be, I am not worth hating all that much. Do not damn your souls and the country's institutions just hating me.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £133,160 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1951, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Sea and Inland Fisheries, including a Grantin-Aid.</P>
      <P>In connection with this Vote, it is well that the House should know at once that a situation of considerable gravity has arisen in the world market for fish.  Deputies will probably have observed that the price of fish was recently decontrolled in Great Britain. There was a short period during which prices dramatically appreciated and that was followed by a catastrophic collapse which has resulted already in a very substantial part of the entire British trawler fleet being laid up. The British Government is at this time considering relief measures whereunder the Treasury will be expected to come to the assistance of the industry.  That situation has been further complicated by developments in Iceland.  Prior to the war, Iceland disposed of the greater part of its catch on the Continent of Europe.  That market was completely dislocated by the world war but soon after peace was declared, Iceland established a satisfactory trade, from her point of view, with Soviet Russia.  Iceland then adhered to the Atlantic Pact and the Cominform, acting in accordance with its usual realistic approach to such matters, promptly cancelled its contract for fish whereupon it transpired that the whole economy of Iceland was imperilled.  I understand that the matter is now engaging the attention of the United States Government to devise remedial steps.  From the impact of these developments outside, this country has been insulated by the declared policy of the Government.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to appreciate clearly and fully what that declared policy is. It is the fixed policy of this Government, communicated by me to this House in the summer of 1948, to reserve the domestic fish market for the exclusive enjoyment of the inshore fishermen along our coasts.</P>
      <P>Now I am deliberately asking fish consumers in this country to pay an uneconomic price for fish as compared with the price at which they could buy fish had they access freely to the world market, and the consideration for that concession on the part of the consumer is that thereby is created employment for 8,000 part-time workers in the inshore fishing industry and 2,000 permanent workers, who, if they were denied that employment to-morrow, would overnight be converted from a body of independent, hard-working individuals into a very formidable social problem which our community would have to find a means of resolving. I emphasise that very deliberately for this reason, that I made that clear in this House in 1948 and I stated quite emphatically then that it was right that all should know that the Government would not allow the interests of the inshore fishermen to be prejudiced by any vested interest, foreign or domestic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have since been engaged on the drafting of the necessary legislation to give effect to those purposes and the only excuse I can offer the House for my failure to submit that legislation sooner is that legislation in connection with the consolidation of the fishery laws for inland fisheries was in hands and was a gigantic task.  However, that Bill to reconstitute the Sea Fisheries Association will be introduced before the end of this session <Col N="543" /> and, if Oireachtas Éireann approves of it, the only persons who will be allowed by law to land fish in Ireland for sale to the consuming public will be the Sea Fisheries Association acting as a statutory co-operative of and for the inshore fishermen.</P>
    <P>Now the protection of the Irish market has, of course, created a position in which fish caught by fishing units with the maximum efficiency is offered at a profit.  I do not want to be taken now as criticising the <i>entrepreneurs</i> who availed of that.  All that I am doing is telling Dáil Éireann that I regard those perfectly law-abiding and enterprising men as fixed with full and ample notice that it is no charge on our Exchequer to buy them out, they having come in since 1948.  If they want to dispose of their boats and their gear, they can sell them to the Sea Fisheries Association or they can sell them to trawler companies elsewhere, but they can have no claim, in justice or in equity, to demand of the Government that, in clearing the field for the inshore fishermen, they will be fully compensated by independent arbitration for such interests as they conceive they have as the result of setting up since the policy was declared in July, 1948.</P>
    <P>There have been enterprising individuals here who bought 60, 70 and 80-foot boats, hired Scotch crews and fished to good purpose, and I am bound to say that the example presented by their crews and their ships is one which I have no hesitation in commending earnestly to our own fishermen.  The boats were admirable, the crews beyond praise, and the efficiency shown in prosection of the industry an example for any fisherman in the world.  I am happy to say that most of those who entered the trade since 1948, with the boats they provided and the facilities and the equipment thereon for the convenience of the fishermen, showed a standard of excellence to which the Sea Fisheries Association aspires and towards which I am happy to think it is rapidly approaching.</P>
    <P>I want to say this quite deliberately. I suppose everybody has his own King Charles's head in this world.  I know <Col N="544" /> that I shall bring down on my head a tornado of fury by declaring the truth in respect of certain matters.  Muintir na Mara is a body which represents itself as speaking for the fishermen, which it does not.  It may speak for some, but certainly not for them all. I must assume that its spokesmen act in good faith.  But, where they get their information or how they come to the conclusions to which they do come is a complete mystery to me, because of all that is published by word of mouth and in writing by Muintir na Mara and those who speak for it more than 70 per cent. has no more relation to the truth than it has to an Icelandic saga. It is a very difficult thing to know where to begin in correcting the misapprehensions that exist in regard to the circumstances with which we have to contend with in Ireland if the whole of a case is contorted and distorted, in good faith or in bad faith.  Driven by that emergency, I have had recourse, not this time to a White Paper, but to a map.  Well-intentioned critics point to Norway and they will say: &ldquo;Why can the Norwegians fish so prosperously while our fishermen always seem to be pulling the devil by the tail?&rdquo; That is one problem we have. Here is another problem.  Must not the shores of Ireland be teeming with fish if trawlers come from Spain, France, Great Britain and from the ends of the earth to shoot their trawls?  That is another fatal illusion.  Why do we not sell herrings and mackerel?  Look at the exports.  What has become of the trade?  The assumption is that the mackerel take a summer holiday on the coast everywhere as regularly as the clock and that you can go down and scoop them out on the appointed day. That is another point.</P>
    <P>Let me deal with these three.  I propose to make available for Deputies a map of the North Atlantic, indicating upon it the incidence of cod and demersal fish of all varieties.  Let us not pretend to deal in mystification. Demersal fish are sole, whiting, plaice, turbot and the like; pelagic fish means herring and mackerel and, with shell-fish, these are the broad divisions. When Deputies see the marine map of the North Atlantic, they will see that the whole coast of Norway, from the <Col N="545" /> extreme north to the southernmost tip, constitutes the edge of a submarine plateau which is the most densely populated fishing bed in the Atlantic Ocean. There is adjacent to the Lofoten Islands one of the richest cod fisheries in the Atlantic, and I think it all lies within the territorial jurisdiction of the Kingdom of Norway.  Around the coast of Ireland there are not now, and there never have been, fishing beds comparable, in the same category at all, with the Norwegian fishing beds, and the nearest point to Ireland at which such banks occur are the fishing banks 150 miles south of the County Kerry.  There is a certain amount of fish around the shore of almost any island with a shelving shore, but it is in very much more fundamental geographic structures submarine that you get fishing beds such as occur in the Lofoten Islands and in Norway and which you may really describe as liquid gold mines because the Norwegians, without going outside their territorial waters, have access to every variety of pelagic fish that swims in a temperate sea in addition to vast quantities of cod.</P>
    <P>The presence of these banks some 150 miles south of Ireland is the cause of the illusion that our shores teem with fish because trawlers deem it worth while to come from afar to fish.  No trawler ever comes from afar to fish, but they do come to the banks 150 miles south of this country.  When they are trawling there and receive a wireless message that there is a gale in mid-Atlantic moving eastwards, they shoot as fast as they can for the safety of our shore, and there is not a doubt that some of them do shoot a trawl within our territorial waters, which they ought not to do. When we catch them at it we arrest them and confiscate their gear, but of the trawlers that lie off our coasts and are the subject of scandal to our friends in Galway, Donegal and Kerry, seven in ten are taking shelter and have no more intention of fishing than I have.</P>
    <P>As against that, you will get French trawlers coming for crayfish.  In the last Fisheries (Amendment) Act, I asked Oireachtas Éireann to place a mandatory injunction on district justices that if a man was convicted of <Col N="546" /> fishing within the three-mile limit they had to confiscate his gear.  Very shortly afterwards I nailed a gentleman in Kerry and he was convicted and his gear was confiscated.  The parish priest, the curate, the doctor and every individual in that parish sent a round robin addressed to me stating that this was a persecuted Breton who had been trampled underfoot by the <i>communards</i> and that having struggled through for his Faith, this persecuted man had scraped together the price of his gear, and that if I took it from him he would sink into the dereliction he had so heroically resisted under the persecuting harrow of the Cominform. I am afraid I heartlessly replied that he should have thought of all that before he broke out; let him go back whence he came and scrape up enough to buy another gear.  I am afraid that they took it badly.  My Catholicity was in doubt.  I was impudent, hardhearted and unsympathetic.</P>
    <P>The following Tuesday fortnight, I nailed the gentleman off Downings in Donegal.  He had another equipment and he was as busy as a bee.  I took the gear again and I have not a doubt that he will turn up wherever he can poke his nose in.</P>
    <P>What I want to emphasise to the House is that the Minister for Fisheries, whoever he may be, myself, my predecessor or his predecessor, is sternly rebuked, for not taking more effective measures to protect our fishermen from marauding trawlers, but when you do nail them, the whole parish turns up to petition you to let them go again.  That gentleman had crayfish in his hold worth over £500 and I was the worst in the world when I said: &ldquo;If you have to bury it, do not let him take one claw back to Brittany.&rdquo;  The poor, down-trodden Christian comes back fresh as a bee a fortnight later.  It is as well to make it perfectly clear that any foreign trawler found trawling in our territorial waters will be arrested, and if we can prosecute him to a conviction, his catch will be confiscated and his gear will be confiscated.  We will send him back whence he came with the very minimum equipment which will get him back over the waves of the sea whether he is Catholic, Presbyterian, Communist or reactionary. <Col N="547" /> So much, then, for the belief that foreign trawlers are allowed to cruise at their leisure through our territorial waters.  They are not, but we are not going to break every canon of decent behaviour by driving trawlers out of our inlets into the open sea when the weather is of a kind to jeopardise their safety.  I beg of Deputies and influential persons to lend a hand and help us to get people to discriminate between the trawler which seeks and receives legitimate shelter and the trawler which is here on illegal business.  We can all put our shoulder to the wheel to help to nail him but it would be a disgrace to us to acquire the reputation internationally that refuge might not be sought here without running the risk of insult.</P>
    <P>A good many Deputies on both sides yearn for the establishment of deep sea trawling.  I never yearned for it, but I understand what is in their minds. They have this kind of feeling that, if we had some deep sea trawlers which would bring in a bulk of fish, it would mean a constant steadfast supply and we could integrate that with the inshore fish and the whole thing would go ahead like a bell.  That is a complete illusion.  Few Deputies as far as I can see, know that we do not eat in this country the kind of fish which the British get from trawlers.  Very little trawler fish ever reaches the consumers' table in Great Britain within three weeks of being caught.  A deep sea trawler is half full when it gets to the end of its trip and that fish goes on the shelves in ice.  Its subsequent catch goes into the hold in bulk in ice, but, when it comes back to port, part of its catch is nearly six weeks old and the best of it is a fortnight old.  If that fish were generally offered on the market here, it would get a very poor reception, because the fish that comes on to the Dublin market and the Cork market is fish caught to-day and sold to-morrow or the day after, because the fellows do not go great distances from shore and would rarely be more than a night out.</P>
    <P>If a fleet of trawlers were based on this country not more than 40 per cent. <Col N="548" /> of its catch would be available for the prime fish trade, and, if you did not get a market for another 40 per cent. in the fish and chip shops, you simply could not operate trawlers at all.  We know that to our cost for we did operate them and lost £50,000 on them about 1935.  The fish trawling business is based on the fish and chip business in Great Britain and it is the fact that they can sell the &ldquo;quare&rdquo; looking fish, at which the ordinary domestic consumer would take fright if he saw them, to the fish and chip shops who fillet and fry it&mdash;it is perfectly good fish but not the kind of fish that is normally known to the ordinary housewife&mdash;and get the market price in normal times for the prime fish in Billingsgate, disposing of the trimmings and the rubbish for 2/- or 3/- a stone to the fish meal makers, is what makes the trawler industry pay.</P>
    <P>But note what that means.  If you are going to operate a fleet of deep sea trawlers with that kind of capacity from our shores, far from integrating the inshore fishermen with it, you simply wipe out the inshore fisherman because his services will not be required, because the only people who would work the trawlers is the Sea Fisheries Association and the reason it can only be the Sea Fisheries Association is that if we are to keep the inshore fishermen going, we have to maintain a price for fish that nobody could defend in Parliament, if it was being maintained for the benefit of a commercial enterprise.  Unless there is an adequate <i>quid pro quo</i> for asking the consumers to pay that price, no sane legislator could make the request upon them.</P>
    <P>I want to go on record as correcting some of the wild allegations made from time to time by Muintir na Mara.  I wonder have Deputies any preconceived idea as to what the condition of the fishing industry from the inshore fisherman's point of view is to-day and what the numbers are compared with the past.  I think the impression is spread abroad that the inshore fisherman is in a state closely approximating to dereliction, that the industry threatens to disappear and is steadily declining.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="549" /> The fact is that the inshore fisherman landed more demersal fish this year in Ireland than he has ever done before; the fact is that there are, I think, more inshore fishermen fishing at present than have fished for very many years; the fact is that they are able to pay for their boats and gear more promptly now than they have ever been able to pay for them in the past; the fact is that the new sea fisheries legislation, the deep freeze equipment at Killybegs and the boat building going on at Meevagh, Killybegs, Dingle&mdash;and I hope that shortly there will be boat building at Baltimore&mdash;mean that there will be more activity in the sea fisheries industry in this country than there has been in the past quarter of a century.</P>
    <P>Would anyone reading the observations of Muintir na Mara believe that that approximated to the truth?  I want to make this clear, that, when you study the record, you find that that is not a development of last year or the year before.  It is part of a trend which began about 1935 and which has shown a steady upward course, and I think it is largely due to the unselfish and disinterested exertions of the officers of my Department and of the Sea Fisheries Association who are more devoted to the promotion of the work committed to their care than probably any other body of public servants in this country.</P>
    <P>Why people should imagine that the Minister for Fisheries or the officers charged with responsibility for that industry should be engaged in a dark conspiracy to destroy the fisheries is a mystery to me.  The presumption is that, if you are Minister for Fisheries, you want to produce the best results you can, if not for the sake of the fishermen, for your own sake.  Why Muintir na Mara should imagine that there is this kind of dark and hideous conspiracy to impoverish the fishermen, to destroy the whole organisation and to deliver them over into the hands of every exploiting villain in the world is a mystery to me.  Of course, when the question is put to the test at the annual meetings of the Sea Fisheries Association, the fellows who come in to bawl and roar, to make speeches and <Col N="550" /> to hand in written statements, when a poll is taken, are beaten ten to one. While they command only one vote in ten of the ordinary fishermen&mdash;for it is the fishermen who constitute the voting numbers of the association&mdash; they make as much noise, each one of them, as 100 legitimate fishermen.</P>
    <P>For instance, there was great hullabaloo about the fall in the catch of pelagic fish last year.  It was remarkable but what can you do about it? You cannot go out and chase the mackerel in, and, to the best of our knowledge and belief, the steady southeasterly wind that blew off Dingle during last year blew the plankton out to sea and the mackerel did not show.  If there is anybody here or elsewhere who will develop some kind of whistle or bugle that will persuade the mackerel to turn round and come in, we shall be very glad to station him down at Dingle to whistle them in when the plankton are travelling in the opposite direction; but universal knowledge to date suggests that if the plankton does not come ashore the mackerel will not come ashore.</P>
    <P>I do not think the shoaling of herring is a subject fully understood.  Last year herring fishing began off the Wexford coast.  It looked as if it was going to be a smasher.  It suddenly teamed away in three weeks and it never developed on any other shore at all to its usual extent.  The boats were ready, the men were ready, the market was ready.  Here again, within certain limits you can pursue herrings but no limits would make a substantial difference.  If herring do not shoal, they do not shoal.  When you are dealing with demersal fish, you can, with the assistance of echo sounders and modern apparatus of that kind, with which we are equipping the boats, very often follow them out of certain well-known fishing beds into rocky bottoms where heretofore fishermen had not ventured to let down their nets, and actually locate the fish swimming in the sea and see them on radar screens and drop your net down and practically scoop them up.  When you are dealing with shoaling herring or mackerel that is not the case unless you are using steam trawlers in the relatively deep <Col N="551" /> waters of the North Sea but, for inshore fishermen, equipped with a 50 foot boat, capable of going up to 20 miles, the hope of chasing shoaling fish is not one worthy of serious pursuit.</P>
    <P>There is this consoling feature about it, that as the landings declined in quantity, their value in money rose and, although the volume of the pelagic fish landed dropped from 149,500 cwt.&mdash;the volume actually landed dropped to that because the landings declined from 385,000 to 234,000&mdash;the value declined by a very much smaller sum which was to the advantage of the fishermen.  The demersal landings, that is, prime fish, decreased by 1,000 cwts. but, when you come to examine that, you discover that the landings by inshore fishermen increased by 4,000 cwts.  It was the trawler company that was down by 5,000 cwts.  So, it was the despised inshore fishermen who increased their catch.  I need hardly say that that fact was not made very clear by the apostles of Muintir na Mara.</P>
    <P>I could continue to pursue that business almost indefinitely because I deprecate most strongly the reckless, irresponsible and utterly illusory language of Muintir na Mara which, in my opinion, does nothing to help the fishermen by such conduct and only foments misunderstandings and ill will, where neither should exist.  The only purpose for existing that the Sea Fisheries Association has is to serve the interests of the fishermen themselves. It is true that the fishermen on the east coast do not stand so urgently in need of the Sea Fisheries Association as do the fishermen of the west coast, who have not the ready access to markets that the north shore and east shore fishermen have, but, so long as the fishermen of the west, north-west and south-west require the services of the Sea Fisheries Association they shall have it and Muintir na Mara had better make up its mind finally to this.  Any legitimate ground for complaint, we are eager in the Department of Fisheries to know of it at the earliest possible moment, but yelling and whooping and acting irresponsibly contains no hope that those who so yell, whoop and act will be invited <Col N="552" /> to silence by offering them membership of the Sea Fisheries Association or any other body associated with the administration of the fishermen's affairs.</P>
    <P>There was a passionate protest about the increases in our imports of fish which, when tracked down, referred to canned salmon.  What relation imports of canned salmon have to the market demand for herrings, mackerel and haddock is a mystery to me.</P>
    <P>I would like the House to know that, taking the years from 1944 to 1949, going back to 1936, 1937 and 1938 and taking an average, the number of inshore fishermen exclusively employed in fishing was about 1,584.  It is to-day 1,913.  The number of men partially employed was 5,866 in 1936, 1937 and 1938.  It is to-day 8,150.  The number of motor boats solely engaged in fishing in 1936, 1937 and 1938 was 344.  It is to-day 578.  The number of unengined boats solely engaged was 1,357 and it is now 2,260.  The number of boats partially engaged was 884 and it is now 446.  I would wish to see the number of unengined boats steadily declining to the point of disappearance as we are able to furnish fishermen with properly engined boats which afford them very much better opportunity of getting a decent livelihood from the sea.</P>
    <P>Does it not strike the House as queer, when you have been listening to all the caterwauling that has been going on, to discover that far from the inshore fishing industry disappearing it is 20 per cent. more numerous in its numbers and 50 per cent. stronger in its boats and equipment than it was 15 years ago?  Certainly, if I believed all I read in the newspapers the impression I would get is the direct opposite of what is in fact the situation and if the Bill which I propose to lay before the House passes, I know the view is held that the inshore fishermen will never work seriously enough fully to supply the domestic market.  I do not accept that view and this is certain&mdash; we are now going to give them the opportunity.  We will give them the opportunity, the boats and the equipment to do so and if they do not succeed&mdash;I believe they will&mdash;we will be sure of this, that their failure will not <Col N="553" /> be for the want of any facility with which they might have succeeded had they not been denied it.  I would like the House to know that and if they think I am wrong in that to say so now. There will be those who think that it is extravagant and foolish to buy the best at our present stage.  My purpose is to equip our inshore fishermen with the best and most modern boats and equipment that money can buy and to take one serious last whirl at putting them permanently and prosperously on a firm foundation, so that if we fail we will not have it to say that perhaps we spoiled the ship for a ha'porth of tar, that if we had given them this little extra thing it might have done the trick.  Nothing that will help to make them efficient and to get them a decent living out of it will be withheld.  If they are prepared to work, they need not apprehend that any difficulty that we can overcome will be allowed to harass them.</P>
    <P>So much, then, for the sea fisheries, except perhaps that I should tell the House this.  Last year, I spoke optimistically of finding boats for our men this year.  I am glad to be able to give a reasonably satisfactory report.  We were able to provide and issue six new 50-foot boats, one new 35-foot and two boats under 35-foot; six unengined craft and eight new engined; we have seven 50-foot boats abuilding, two 38-foot and one 35-foot.  We hope before the end of this financial year to issue 12 50-foot boats to purchasers and four 38-foot.  The 50-foot boats cost about £4,800; the 38-foot, £3,000 to £3,500 and the others from £500 to £1,500.  In addition to that, the men have to get gear.  We do not use the Asdic equipment, as I am informed that the Hughes type echo sounding equipment is the most suitable for our men's conditions and accordingly that is the apparatus being provided on the boats.</P>
    <P>There was a great hullabaloo about the decline in the quantity of fish handled by the association in the last year.  It did decline, from 82,000 cwts. to 78,000 cwts.  But when you come to investigate what the decline was, you discover it was mussels.  Muintir na Mara never bothered to mention that. Sometimes when talking of &ldquo;fish&rdquo; they <Col N="554" /> mean herrings and another time they mean everything that comes out of the sea.  The decline in the total quantity of fish landed was due to a decline in the quantity of mussels and that had its origin in a row going on in Cromane, about which Deputy John Flynn and myself know a good deal.  The fellows who pick the mussels at Cromane thought Cromane was not acting squarely and some of them got at loggerheads.  That has been squared up, and now that the fellows trust one another again, we will get on.  The wet fish was the highest on record.  The Sea Fisheries Association handled 70,530 cwts. of wet fish last year, compared with 68,981 cwts. in 1948.  That, so far as I know, is the largest quantity of wet fish ever handled since the association was established.  However, at the annual general meeting of the Sea Fisheries Association, although the landings were the highest we have ever handled on behalf of the inshore fishermen since it was founded, if we read the headlines and the report of the proceedings of the Sea Fisheries Association meeting on the point, we could not but look upon the reduction as being the result of inefficiency, dishonesty and general roguery of the officers charged to carry it on.</P>
    <P>Would Deputies believe that there were chronic crises in this country in the landings of fish?  I arranged to institute careful inquiries as to how many times there was a shortage in any settled consumption of fish in any 12 months and let me have a memorandum on each separate occasion as to why there was a shortage of fish, what shortage was there, how long it lasted and whether it is likely to recur. Of course then you begin to get prudent.  There is rarely, if ever a shortage of fish but there can be a particular kind of fish that a particular person wants to buy.  You may not be able to get black Dover sole but you can get a herring and the day you cannot get a herring you may be able to get plaice or halibut or some other thing.  There is notably in Cork City on Monday not infrequently a shortage of fish and there always will be, for the simple reason that our people do not like stale fish and the fellows do not go out fishing on Sunday; and it is extremely <Col N="555" /> difficult to say there will be a supply of fish on Monday morning early unless the fishmongers have had too much fish on Saturday and carry some over on ice until Monday and there is nothing I or anyone else can do about it except to ensure that there will always be a deposit of stale fish from Grimsby on Friday night so that some energetic lady&mdash;all honour to her&mdash; making off to the fishmonger on Monday morning before the man has his apron on and who wants a pound of filleted sole, if he has some from Friday night he can supply it but he will not be able to supply it from fishermen's boats.  Does the Dáil think that a grave reflection on the inshore fishermen? If they do, we will buy some stale fish and store it in Cork every Saturday night, but I think it would be a gross mistake and unless the Dáil expresses a grave wish I am not going to do it.  It does happen that you will get a fog round our coast&mdash;now, that is very rare&mdash;and there is no fish; but we can always get fish from Grimsby if necessity arises.  There may be a day's scarcity, but you cannot tell when fog is going to roll in.</P>
    <P>We do not pretend that the inshore fishermen have the resources of the Grimsby fleet and we do not pretend that we are in a position to maintain the same kind of supply as the trawling industry in England.  And we do not contend that we can do anything further to maintain the reputation in asking a monopoly from Dáil Éireann that that position will continue.  We say we will endeavour to supply the entire demand with our own boats and give an undertaking that whenever a lacuna arises we will get fish and fill it from Grimsby or elsewhere.  We have to get it.  We do not want to do that but we acknowledge freely that our primary duty is to supply the demand.  We would like to supply it with fresh fish landed by ourselves but we acknowledge the duty to supply it wherever it may be drawn.  There were some shortages in the Spring of 1949.  The weeks chiefly affected were the 3rd and 4th weeks of February, the 3rd week of March and the 3rd and 4th weeks of April.  Do any one of you remember what the weather was like <Col N="556" /> in that year, then?  In April, 1949, I had occasion to travel on an aeroplane. When I went to Collinstown I nearly came home again&mdash;it nearly took the roof off the place.  There was a period during that time when the men did not go out&mdash;and they were perfectly right.  I would very much sooner have some of the dowagers in Cork inconvenienced in regard to the bit of fish they wanted with their tea than get the crew washed up drowned. But we cannot provide against that, and if the House thinks they cannot get on without that kind of thing there is no use looking to the inshore fishermen for it.  They are not equipped to meet every hazard of the weather and we do not intend so to equip them.  If, on account of bad weather, there is a simultaneous shortage in Great Britain, we may have to do without fish for a couple of days&mdash;but it very rarely happens.</P>
    <P>Here is what is going to shock you and I want you to listen to it, because I want you to understand how inconceivable it is that these prices could for a moment be defended if they were designed to preserve the prosperity of commercial enterprises.  The present price of cod in Aberdeen is from 6/- to 7/- a stone; the present price of cod per stone in Dublin is 16/4.  Codling is 4/6 a stone in Aberdeen; in Dublin it is 9/- a stone.  Whiting is 3/3 a stone in Aberdeen; in Dublin it is from 7/- to 9/4 a stone.  Haddock, 10/- a stone in Aberdeen; in Dublin it is 16/4 a stone.  Plaice is from 12/- to 14/- a stone in Aberdeen; it is from 17/6 to 23/4 a stone in Dublin.  Did you ever think that was the case when you read the observations of Muintir na Mara in which the depressed Irish fishermen were asked to accept prices lower than anyone would dare to offer to fishermen in England?  Our prices are from 50 per cent. to 100 per cent. higher than the prices obtaining in Great Britain, and I will justify that so long as we protect the inshore fishermen and so long as we aim at steadily narrowing the gap by improved efficiency and improved methods between the world's price and the price we must charge for fish in order to preserve for the inshore fishermen a reasonably modest standard of living.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="557" /> To be quite frank, I am too tired to go deeply into the whole question as regards inland fisheries.  Substantially what I propose to do is this.  We have increased the number of ova available from hatcheries.  I am going to set up what is called a public trustee and ask any groups of farmers or persons who between them own stretches of riparian rights if the local fishery association can organise them and, as a group, they can transfer the riparian rights to fish to the public trustee, in consideration of which each transferor will have the right to fish from his own bank.  These are the fisheries which are not protected largely at present and which are good trout fisheries, and so forth.  We propose to carry out improvements where, for instance, the river is getting dirty. The public trustee will take these rivers into keeping and preserve them for our own people, whereupon the doctor, the postman, the noble earl and the shop assistant, by paying an annual sum, the same as for a gun licence, will be entitled to fish on those preserved waters.  Any tourist taking out a game licence can fish in these waters.</P>
    <P>We can clean the bed of the rivers if it should be necessary to do so: we can put up fences where they are required: we can look after ditches and dykes so that men's drains will not be damaged by people standing on one side of them and shoving the earth down into them: we can cut bushes, protect spawning beds, increase the stocks of the rivers by the transfer of ova from other rivers and carry out any other maintenance work calculated to improve the rivers as an amenity for our own people and for such tourists as may care to avail of them.</P>
    <P>I am sure there are a number of other aspects of the Fisheries Department on which I have not touched.  I can assure Deputies that I am willing and anxious to give any additional information they may require before the Vote is passed.</P>

      <P>The Minister's statement to-night is an improvement on the statement he made last year and, <Col N="558" /> in respect of those parts of it which sound better than his remarks on the same subject last year, we are glad. His promise to provide the best possible facilities for the inshore fishermen is to be welcomed.  I observe from some of the particulars he gave about boats that he has more or less modified the view he expressed last year that he was going to watch very closely the size of the boats lest the inshore fisherman, as he has been understood up to the present, would be interfered with.  On the west coast the standard type of boat of 36 feet overall was never regarded as being suitable for that coast.  I remember when I was a member of the committee on advice and consultation with the fishermen that I put their views on that matter forward.  It took the committee a long time to fall into line chiefly for the reason that the average applicant for boats on the west coast was not able to compete with fishermen on other parts of the coast in the matter of putting down deposits and that, therefore, his case was allowed to wait.</P>
      <P>In that regard I should like to refer to the Minister's statement about the increase in the number of people engaged in the industry.  He has given the figures&mdash;8,000 part-time men and 2,000 full-time men&mdash;and has indicated that that is an increase of some hundreds over recent years.  That is a statement to be welcomed but unfortunately I am afraid that the increase has not taken place on that part of the coast where the Minister has said the Sea Fisheries Association assistance is most urgently needed, the west coast. I pointed out here on this Estimate last year, as a result of a reply given to me by the Minister, that we had a very large membership on the west coast. We have a western region there, taking in the three counties of Clare, Galway and Mayo.  The figures the Minister gave me indicated that about one-third of the membership of the association was located in that region&mdash;but when it came to the distribution of the facilities about which he has been speaking, particularly in respect of the power boats, I think our share was only about 2 or 3 per cent.</P>
