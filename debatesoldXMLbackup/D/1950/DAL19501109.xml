    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he is aware that the home assistance officer for Mitchelstown dispensary area is residing in Ballykenley which is approximately 12 miles from the outer limit of his district, and that this is not conducive to good administration, especially in view of the fact that the town of Mitchelstown with a population of 2,300 people is approximately six miles from the officer's house, and whether he is further aware that within the past month, at least three applicants for home assistance were not able to contact the officer for <Col N="509" /> immediate benefit, and finally, if he will state what action he proposes to take in the circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Keyes) (for the Minister for Social Welfare)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the place of residence of an assistance officer is primarily a matter for the appropriate public assistance authority.  The county manager has been asked for a report on the points raised in the question and when his reply is received I will have the Deputy informed of the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he is aware that during the emergency, school hours were altered to permit school children to partake of a mid-day meal at their homes, that during inclement weather since this alteration many children have frequently returned to their respective schools in wet clothes which is bound to have a very serious effect on their health, and that there is a strong public opinion in favour of a return to the original school hours, and if he will consider the desirability of obtaining the views of parents on the question by way of plebiscite or otherwise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="Minister for Education (General Mulcahy) Richard (General) Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangement of timetables in national schools is a matter for the local managers subject to the requirements of the rules and regulations. It is open to the manager of a school to arrange the time-table so that the school day shall consist of one meeting with an interval for recreation of half an hour or longer but not, as a rule, exceeding one hour; or he may arrange to have a school day of two meetings with an interval of more than an hour between the meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard that many parents prefer the dual-day arrangement as it affords the children an opportunity of having a hot mid-day meal at home. Others favour the one-meeting school day with a short interval for recreation. It would obviously not be possible to devise any arrangement which would be acceptable to all concerned, and in <Col N="510" /> the circumstances I do not see that it would serve any useful purpose to have the views of parents generally on this question obtained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will state the number of (i) daily newspapers and (ii) other newspapers and periodicals, distinguishing between newspapers and periodicals published in (a) Ireland, (b) United States of America and (c) elsewhere, which have entered into contracts for the regular supply of news by the Irish News Agency on the basis of a periodic fee, and the aggregate fees payable under such contracts; and also the number of news items supplied by the Irish News Agency to newspapers, otherwise than under contract, which have been published and paid for by newspapers in (a) Ireland, (b) United States of America and (c) elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. MacBride) Seán MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. MacBride)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is that the Irish News Agency has not, as yet, entered into any contracts for the regular supply of news on the basis of a periodic fee.  The answer to the second part of the Deputy's question is as follows:</P>
      <P>The number of items published and already paid for in Ireland is 179; in the United States of America, 2; elsewhere, 13.  In addition, the following items have been published and invoices have been sent out in respect of them, but they have not yet been paid for: Ireland, 133; United States of America, 58; elsewhere, 15.  The total published on a commercial basis is, therefore, Ireland, 312; United States of America, 60; elsewhere, 28.  These items range from two or three line paragraphs to reports or features of 2,000 words or more.  The total number of words of Irish News Agency material published commercially is approximately 220,000, but returns for the last month are necessarily incomplete. The agency began its operations at the end of July; its outgoing services will not be in full operation before next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not indicated whether these lands are to be inspected at an early date or not. In view of the fact that the lands have been offered for sale recently and that there has been no purchaser, will the Minister consider an early inspection of the land with a view to its acquisition and division amongst deserving local applicants?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that officials of the Land Commission are likely to be in Laoighis-Offaly for a long time, would the Minister request the Land Commission to instruct their officials to inspect this farm when they are inspecting other farms in the area, so as to prevent a long wait when the inspectors leave the area and have to go back again to carry out the inspection?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether he is aware that the radio-telephone between Owey island and the mainland is obsolete, and continually out of order, and if he will take steps to have up-to-date apparatus installed and have the mainland location of the apparatus transferred from Bunbeg to Kincasslagh.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Everett) Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Everett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Everett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that communication with Owey Island has been interrupted for periods from time to time, mainly during the winter when the engineering workmen often have difficulty in reaching the island to clear faults in the apparatus.  The equipment provided for communication with Owey and with a number of other islands around the coast gives the most up-to-date form of radio link available up to the present, having regard to the non-availability of electric power supply in these remote places.  With the hope of improving that position, however, the Department is keeping in close touch with experiments that are taking place in the development of a more effective type of radio equipment for short-distance communication.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state whether it is correct that compound feeding stuff manufacturers are charged £26 per ton for maize and milo, which are imported at an average c.i.f. cost of £23 15s. Od. per ton; and, if so, how the balance of £2 5s. Od. per ton is appropriated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is correct that compound feeding stuff manufacturers are charged £26 per ton for maize and milo maize.  The difference between this price and the c.i.f. cost represents (a) discharging, storing and distributing costs; (b) inland transport charges, and (c) the discounts allowed on 100-ton and 500-ton purchases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="513" /> While the c.i.f. costs which I supplied to the Deputy on 25th October averaged £23 15s. 0d. per ton, more recent offers have been approximately £1 a ton higher.  The current selling price of £26 a ton represents the average cost of maize and milo delivered at purchasers' nearest stations and is the lowest price which could be maintained for any reasonable period.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In reply to the second part of the question, I should like to point out to the Deputy that arterial drainage is not a function of the Department of Agriculture.  In fact the Moy is scheduled for attention by the Office of Public Works under the arterial drainage programme.  I should like, however, to inform the Deputy that I am arranging with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance that certain works on the main channels of a number of principal rivers will be undertaken by his office on behalf of my Department with the object of facilitating drainage operations under the land project.  I should emphasise that these works will be distinct from, and will in no way interfere with, the arterial drainage programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="515" /> They will, of course, be designed to have the effect of facilitating subsequent operations under that programme.</P>

      <P>The provisions under which the Donegal County Council were empowered to appoint two directors to the board of the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company are contained in statutory Orders made in 1898.  The powers of the director nominees of the county council were conferred in consideration of a guarantee by the county council as successors of the grand jury, in respect of interest payments on an issue of £10,000 of 4 per cent. stock and were confined by the Orders to matters affecting the Buncrana-Carndonagh and Letterkenny - Burtonport baronially guaranteed lines.  I am advised that the county council was never at any time called upon to fulfil its guarantee. The 4 per cent. guaranteed stock was extinguished in 1945 by agreement with the holders, who received in exchange an equivalent nominal amount of 4 per cent. debenture stock of the company. These lines are no longer in use and so far as I am aware there are no functions exercisable by nominees of the council in relation to the management of the company.</P>

      <P>The terms &ldquo;factories&rdquo; and &ldquo;industries&rdquo; are very broad.  Excluding very small units, which could technically be described as factories, the number on record as having been started during the period 18th February, 1948, to 31st October, 1950, is 156.  Of these, nine are in Connaught, there being five in County Galway, two in County Sligo, two in County Mayo, and none in Counties Roscommon and Leitrim.</P>
      <P>Employment is a variable quantity and it is not possible to give up-to-date employment figures without making a special inquiry in each case.  At an estimate, the figure represented by the 156 factories in question might be put at approximately 4,000 of which about 150 would be attributable to the Connaught concerns.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state (1) the circumstances which led to the <Col N="549" /> decision to increase the price of unrationed sugar by 1d. per lb. from 3rd October, 1950; (2) the circumstances which led to the decision to reduce the price by ½d. per lb. from 1st November; (3) the current prices quoted for imported sugar for immediate delivery on 1st October, 1949, 1st May, 1950, and 1st October, 1950; (4) the current prices quoted for imported sugar for 1951 delivery; (5) the arrangements made with wholesale sugar merchants holding sugar stocks or with commitments to their customers when each change in price was effected; (6) whether there was any prior consultation with wholesale sugar merchants; (7) the profit which the Irish Sugar Company made on the sale of unrationed sugar during its latest completed accounting year, and (8) the profit anticipated from such sales in the present accounting year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The increase of 1d. per lb in the price of unrationed sugar was authorised as from the 3rd October, 1950, because of an advance in the world price of sugar.</P>
      <P>(2)  The price of unrationed sugar was reduced by ½d. per lb. as from the 1st November, 1950, as a result of a more favourable trend in the world prices of sugar.</P>
      <P>(3)  The current prices quoted for imported sugar for immediate delivery on the dates in question were as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1/10/1949:&mdash; Cuban raw sugar 4.25 cents. per lb. f.a.s. Cuba.</P>
      <P>1/5/1950:&mdash; Cuban raw sugar 4.40 cents. per lb. f.a.s. Cuba.</P>
      <P>1/10/1950:&mdash; Cuban raw sugar 5.95 cents. per lb. f.a.s. Cuba.</P>
      <P>(4)  The current prices quoted on 4th November,. 1950, for imported sugar for 1951 delivery are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>For January, 1951, delivery:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Cuban raw sugar 5.46 cents. per lb. f.a.s. Cuba.</P>
      <P>For March/September, 1951, delivery:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Cuban raw sugar 4.73 cents. per lb. f.a.s. Cuba.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(5)  and (6).  It was not considered necessary to make any arrangement with wholesale sugar merchants regarding stocks or commitments or to consult these merchants prior to the price <Col N="550" /> changes.  In this connection, I might say that it is my view that wholesale merchants generally have not been placed at any disadvantage taking both price changes into account.</P>
    <P>(7) and (8).  The Irish Sugar Company is a commercial concern and in the case of such a concern it is not the practice to disclose particulars of the kind for which the Deputy asks in these parts of his question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the last part of the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, surely it is reasonable to ask, where a company such as this is permitted to charge a price for sugar far in excess of the economic price, in order to subsidise the price of other sugar sold by it and to relieve the Exchequer, that we should know how much money it is making out of this uneconomic price or how much it is expected it will make over a future period when the Government instructs it to increase that price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, when the accounts of this company are published, the information the Deputy asks for will be available, but it has not been the practice in the past to disclose information of this nature regarding an individual commercial concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>But this is not an individual commercial concern.  This is a Government concern, controlled by the Government, selling sugar at an uneconomic price because the Government ordered it to do so.  Is not it reasonable for the Dáil to expect to be supplied with information as to the financial results of that policy imposed on that concern by the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether it is reasonable to expect a semi-State concern like the sugar company to publish details in advance of their normal accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that, as a result of the instructions given it by the Government to sell sugar at an uneconomic price, this company made a profit from such sales of £1,000,000 last year?  Is it anticipated that the increased price now sanctioned by the <Col N="551" /> Minister will further increase that profit in this year?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>No; it will be substantially lower.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Variations in the price of sugar will affect that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask one further supplementary question?  I understood the Parliamentary Secretary to say that there was no consultation with wholesale sugar merchants.  Surely it is unfair to traders in that position, carrying stocks and selling sugar in advance of deliveries to their customers, to be presented with serious fluctuations of price, such as occurred during the past month, without having any opportunity of consultation with the Department of Industry and Commerce for the purpose of bringing to the attention of the Department the loss and inconvenience which these changes may occasion.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary agree now to consult with wholesale sugar merchants as to the effect which these changes had upon their business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the points which the Deputy puts, but it is difficult enough to regulate the price of sugar in a changing market without having to consult at every variation in price a whole body of persons, wholesalers and others.  These factors are taken into account, but, in view of the very rapid changes, the most equitable way to do it is to make the Order as quickly as opportunity offers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first occasion these wholesale merchants were presented with an uncovenanted profit of ld. per lb.  Surely the Parliamentary Secretary should be concerned to ensure that the profit did not accrue for the benefit of the individuals and to see that by adjustment of price by the sugar company or by adjustment of the sale price of sugar the uncovenanted profit would be recovered? When the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="552" /> reduced the price there was an uncovenanted loss imposed on these merchants.  As a result of the two changes the position of the merchants may not have been affected, but I suggest it is desirable that when changes are in contemplation some action should be taken, on the one hand, to prevent an undue profit, or, on the other hand, an undue loss being imposed on the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the suggestion that there was an undue profit.  I did not change my mind.  The price had to be revised.  The price dropped and when it dropped it was revised.  In these circumstances, there was a sudden fluctuation in a comparatively short space of time.  I suggest the action taken was the most satisfactory action that could be taken in the circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>Various causes have contributed to the growing shortage of scrap lead and, so far as I am aware, the principal factors are the gradual substitution of copper and other metals for lead which has been going on for many years in the building industry, and the scarcity of pig lead from which this country, in common with most others, has suffered for the past ten or 12 years.  The incidence of the shortage in any particular area will obviously be governed by the extent to which the demolition of old buildings&mdash;the main source of scrap lead&mdash; has taken place in the area.</P>

      <P>The information asked for at parts (1), (2) and (3) of the question is not available in my Department, and I doubt if the local authorities would be in a position to provide it.  In any event I would not feel justified in asking local authorities to have it specially compiled.  In regard to part (4) of the question, overdrafts on the capital accounts of local authorities arise mainly through the commencement of capital works before loan mortgages are completed.  The regulation of such matters is in the hands of the local authorities themselves.  Overdrafts on the revenue accounts of local authorities arise mainly from expenditure getting ahead of the collection of the rates.  They are normally heaviest in the June and September quarters in each year and decline according as the <Col N="557" /> rates are collected.  In some cases State grants are based on expenditure incurred by local authorities on particular services and cannot be fully paid until the expenditure is incurred.  In the case of the agricultural grant a considerable proportion of it is paid in regular instalments from the month of May onwards.  I can assure the Deputy that there is no avoidable delay in the payments of any State grants.</P>

      <P>This scheme was proceeding on the basis of making some alterations to the modern section of this institution and the renovation of the very old block.  On more detailed examination of the proposal, it became clear that it would be very difficult and disproportionately expensive to provide accommodation up to modern standards in the very old block.  As the purpose of the proposed works is to make it possible to deal with all fever cases in the county at one centre, it is essential that the standard of <Col N="566" /> accommodation at that centre should be satisfactory.  For that reason it was proposed to the local authority that the very old block should be demolished and the accommodation additional to that available in the modern block provided by way of a new building.</P>
      <P>A scheme on these lines has been drawn up and is being examined in my Department.  On receipt of some further information on points which have arisen as a result of preliminary examination, I hope to be in a position to inform the local authority that they may proceed with the further planning along the general lines of this scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I said practically all I wished to say last night with regard to this proposal.  We are all agreed that an offence under Section 30 of the Road Traffic Act, 1933, is a serious offence, not so much from the point of view of the criminal content of the offence itself, as from the <Col N="569" /> point of view of the effects the offence may have on other ordinary peaceful users of the roads.  That being so, it is only right that the offence should be treated in a special way by the Oireachtas.  There are two ways in which it can be so treated.  One way, and I think it is the better way, is by giving power to a justice or judge to impose a heavy sentence.  I think that is both a reasonable and proper way of dealing with an offence under that section and of marking our view of its seriousness.  The other way is that adopted in the existing section of the Road Traffic Act of giving to a justice power to impose a comparatively light sentence, but providing also that that conviction shall bring about the automatic suspension of the offender's permission to drive a motor vehicle.</P>
      <P>In the amendment proposed by Deputy Boland we are faced with the proposition that the Minister's powers of mitigating a sentence should, under no circumstances, apply to a disqualification imposed under Section 30 of the Road Traffic Act, 1933.  I think that proposal goes too far.  I think it is merely proceeding further in what I regard to be the wrong direction in the original section.  While that section remains, and we are not dealing with it in any way under this measure, I think that Deputy Boland's proposal should be confined to the minimum statutory disqualification set out in Section 30 of the Road Traffic Act and that we should provide in this amendment that the Minister should have no power to interfere with the 12 months' disqualification, but that he should, as Minister for Justice, equitably exercising his prerogative of mercy, have full power to reduce in a proper case any disqualification imposed to the statutory minimum of 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have all had experience of what I shall describe as &ldquo;hard luck&rdquo; cases, where a man's entire livelihood has been taken away from him by a disqualification imposed under Section 30. There may be some who will say that the offender deserves his punishment. Possibly, in many cases, he does deserve it.  But one cannot test the rights or wrongs of a matter of this <Col N="570" /> kind by the application of a general rule.  The matter must be tested on the merits of the case.  Undoubtedly, there are deserving cases.  Deputy Cowan mentioned one last evening where, in his young and salad days, a man had his licence taken away from him for life; in later years he changed his mode of life and settled down.  Surely it is unreasonable that we should deprive the Minister for Justice of power to give that man back the State's permission to drive a mechanically-propelled vehicle.  While there is a good deal to be said for the amendment, I think the amendment as it stands goes too far.  I think it would be sufficient if it provided merely for no interference with the statutory minimum disqualification under Section 30.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, I stand by what I have suggested.  With regard to petitions, before I left the Department of Justice the thing was getting almost automatic.  There was scarcely a case dealt with in the courts following which there was not some sort of a petition. Speaking from recollection, there were 1,700 petition cases coming annually before the Department before I left there.  I may be wrong as regards the figure, but the Minister can correct me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>What was really happening was that there was scarcely a case decided by the courts in which there was not a petition made.  The result was that we had to set up a special section in the Department.  As far as I remember, we had junior officials&mdash;not the higher officials&mdash; making recommendations to the Minister contrary to what had been done by the courts.  If the House is now going to add another type of petition, to add something that was never done in my time or, as far as I know, since the State was set up, I do not know what the position will be.  These petitions were not made in respect of disqualification under the Road Traffic Act.  My advice always was that, apart altogether from the statutory disqualification, <Col N="571" /> the Minister had no authority to remit any disqualification. As I said yesterday, it was only the other day that there was another legal opinion on the lines suggested by Deputy O'Higgins, that there was a discretion after the minimum disqualification had been served.</P>
      <P>I think that the door ought not to be opened in this case.  Apart from everything else, I think that the justification for this amendment is evident. It is in a special class.  As I reminded the House yesterday, not only are we getting faster cars but we have far more cars on the road now than we had when the 1933 Act was passed. Therefore, the danger is very real.  The roads are also becoming faster.  It is all very well to talk about people losing their livelihood.  But other people have to be considered.  If a person in charge of a car gets on the road in a drunken condition, then he is putting the lives of other users of the road in danger.  The loss of their lives has to be put against the loss of his livelihood.  People of that kind will have to find some other means of a livelihood if they will not behave themselves when using the roads.  If the section goes through as it is we are going to have a big increase in the number of petitions.  I always felt myself that this matter of petitions was a bad practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill was in preparation before I left office.  There was an intention to include civil cases.  I know that if the responsibility was mine, I would think seriously and would hesitate before bringing a section dealing with remissions before the House in this form.  I certainly would ask the Government about it.  I regard this as a dangerous thing.  What this means is that you are advertising now to all and sundry that they can come along as the Minister will have full power to remit.  The courts may do what they like, but it will be said: &ldquo;All you have to do is to get on to someone, to some person in the constituency or in a Party.&rdquo;  I know that in my time I had people of all Parties coming to my office.  It was packed with people from every Party to put the <Col N="572" /> screw on the Minister.  If this power is now given by the Oireachtas, people will say: &ldquo;All we have to do is to put on sufficient pressure and it will be all right, and the courts can do what they damn well like.&rdquo;  For these reasons, I would hesitate to bring in the section.  I certainly would never have stood for giving the Minister further power, the power to remove a disqualification which he never had before.  I warned the Minister at the time that it was a very foolish power to look for.  I intend to press the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure the House that this is a power that no Minister for Justice wants to have. At least I, personally, do not require it, and I am sure that no Minister for Justice would be anxious to have it. At the same time, I want to say that no Minister for Justice would exercise it in the circumstances that Deputy Boland has stated.  This section gives the power of remission in a case where a person has been convicted of an offence of which he is innocent.  Its purpose is to stop even one injustice. There must be power somewhere to remit in a case where an injustice has taken place, where a person has been wrongly convicted, or where there is sufficient evidence to show that the penalty should not have been imposed. Remember, this disqualification is in the nature of a penalty and the power to remit the penalty is not being taken. It is being legalised fully in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the power of remission should be inherent somewhere. The House yesterday, in its wisdom, decided that the power of remission should be delegated by the Government to the Minister for Justice. That being so I think the House should leave it at that.  If it does not, I, personally, will not be sorry.  At the same time, I do not think that the Minister and the Government can run away from their responsibilities.  This is a power that they must and should exercise if and when the necessity arises.  I would remind Deputies that it must be a very dire necessity.  It must be a case in which a conviction has taken place and a penalty imposed <Col N="573" /> in which it should not have been.  I say that is the only ground and the only reason why this power should be in the section at all.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Boland that I have been advised, as he was advised, that the Minister for Justice had not the power to remit this penalty.  But there was a worse situation.  It was legally argued that the Minister for Justice could submit to the Government a proposal to remit, and that the Government could advise the President to remit it in the same way as any other statutory punishment, such as the death penalty in the case of murder. That applies to much more serious offences than this, that there is the power of remission in certain circumstances. Therefore, I put it to Deputy Boland and to the members of the Opposition that they should not withhold this power from the Minister.  I am only the custodian at the moment of whatever powers the Minister for Justice should have.  If I were speaking just for myself I would throw it overboard, but in asking for this power I am speaking not for myself but for future Ministers for Justice.  It will be there until the law is changed again.  I think the House would not be acting wisely if it were to withhold this power from the Minister for Justice.  I feel so strongly on it that I propose to leave this to a free vote of the House.  I am doing that because I think everyone should take responsibility for this. I do not want it to be argued that I am running away from my responsibility. I am not.  I do not think the Government want it either, but at the same time I am a custodian and I have my responsibilities and nothing can relieve me of them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland yesterday evening made a charge and said there was a fellow driving a car in the Counties of Roscommon and Longford and that it was a public scandal.  I told him it was the first I had heard of it and it was. I think that, on consideration, Deputy Boland will realise that the charge he made was against the Guards in not doing their duty.  I want to assure him and the House that no instruction of any description has been issued from the Department, or from any section of <Col N="574" /> the Government that I know of, to the effect that the Guards should disregard somebody or something in that particular case.  I should like to draw the Deputy's notice to the last phrase in the statement of the judge when he imposed this disability&mdash;that not only could this man not drive a car for five years but that if a Civic Guard finds him taking one drink he serves the term of imprisonment which was remitted. Therefore, I have no responsibility in that matter.  The charge that Deputy Boland makes is that the Guards for some reasons are not carrying out their duties.</P>

It is a very serious charge to make in this House against the Guards and I think it should not be made lightly.  I am assuming that Deputy Boland is fully aware of the circumstances of the whole case.  I think he is because from information I have received, I think he knows as much about it as anybody else.  I can assure the Deputy that so far as the remission was concerned, the Minister for Justice had no responsibility in that case.  It was a case tried by the district justice and the Circuit Court judge.</P>

      <P>The Minister has answered Deputy Boland's argument on general issues but Deputy Boland's amendment relates to a specific offence and a specific penalty.  The Minister has referred to miscarriages of justice generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister referred to a miscarriage of justice where a man was wrongfully convicted. The Minister did not say of what offence.  The reasons I understood that he generalised were that the possibilities of wrongful conviction in this respect are very limited indeed. Nobody will deny that in criminal cases generally there are possibilities of wrongful convictions because of mistaken identity or something like that. In this particular case, the evidence as produced in the first instance leaves no doubt as to the identity of the person involved.  In the second place, as a general rule, the evidence consists primarily of a medical officer's testimony that he had examined the accused person within the matter of an hour or at the very outside two hours, after the offence was committed, with the result that the person's condition at that stage could in no way be in doubt.  Apart from that, the State has on its side the evidence of trained members of the Gardaí. Therefore, on the one hand, there can be no mistake as to the identity of the accused person and on the other hand, I think there can be very little doubt as to the condition of the accused person in such cases, with the result, I submit to the Minister, that this is <Col N="576" /> one class of criminal prosecution in which the chances of wrongful conviction are practically negligible.  I will admit that circumstances might arise later which would give an altered picture of the circumstances of the individual involved, but nevertheless, the matter is so serious generally and, as Deputy Boland has pointed out, is becoming more serious every day from the point of view of the increasing number of cars and the increasing speed, that a strong stand must be taken in these cases.</P>
      <P>If the Minister wants to retain his powers in reference to other criminal offences, nobody will object, but public feeling is so strong with regard to a person in a drunken state driving mechanically propelled vehicles that the Minister would be very unwise to interfere at all.  I say this as against my own argument that Section 30 of the Road Traffic Act is very wide, but I presume that when that section was put on the Statute Book due consideration was given to the seriousness of the offence.  So far as I can recollect, the section reads something like this, that if a person, as a result of the consumption of intoxicating liquor, becomes incapable of exercising reasonable control over a mechanically propelled vehicle, he shall be liable to conviction.  I agree that it is a very wide section.  I was not a member of the Oireachtas or anything near it at the time it was passed, but I must admit that the people who inserted that section in the Act must have done it deliberately after due consideration.</P>

      <P>An idea has occurred to me in connection with this matter. I think there is a good deal of merit and a tremendous amount of sincerity in the argument which Deputy Boland has advanced in regard to this particular offence and I think we could arrive at an effective compromise if the Minister was agreeable.  There is possibly a lot in Deputy Lynch's argument that there is no very great probability of a miscarriage of justice arising under this particular section, but as long as there is any possibility of its arising I think it necessary that the Minister should take power for such remissions. The compromise I suggest is on the lines of the Minister's own answer to Deputy Boland's argument, that he would limit the power of remission in these particular offences to cases where there is evidence adduced to the satisfaction of the Minister that the primary conviction was wrong.</P>

      <P>Once the petition comes up to the Minister for examination, if evidence of certain circumstances is adduced that was not adduced in court, which satisfies the Minister that there was a miscarriage of justice, I think everybody in this House would be glad to see the Minister with power to right that particular wrong.  That is the finest limitation we can put in the section.  I think that between this and the Report Stage it might be possible to find an effective compromise on that basis so that this power would exist for cases that might arise but which might never arise.  If such a case should arise, however, the prerogative would be there to cover that individual case.  I think that that would meet very fairly all the worries that Deputy Boland has.  It is something that could not be done except in one specific circumstance but it would at least ensure that the Government of this country had the full prerogative of mercy so that it could deal with the problem in that peculiar circumstance which might never arise&mdash;though the possibility of its arising exists.  If a compromise like that could be made we would have met the wishes of this Assembly fully and we would have met <Col N="578" /> the wishes of Deputy Boland fully, I think, also.</P>

      <P>I find it difficult to argue with any great conviction either for or against Deputy Boland's amendment.  It might be more truthful to put it that it would be possible to argue with equal conviction both for and against the amendment.  I think that there is a lot to be said for the point of view expressed by Deputy Boland and Deputy Vivion de Valera here yesterday evening.  I believe that there are arguments against giving the Minister power to remit disqualifications imposed under Section 30 of the Road Traffic Act but I think that the arguments which Deputy Boland used are arguments which should not be accepted and which, I think, would not be accepted by Deputy Boland if he were Minister for Justice any more than they were accepted this afternoon by the present Minister for Justice.  I do not think it is reasonable to argue on an amendment like this that the amendment should be accepted because if it is not accepted there is going to be more trouble for the Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but in Deputy Boland's contribution here this evening it was what he pressed as the most important side of it.  I took the trouble of reading Deputy Boland's Second Reading speech and he was perfectly consistent.  That was the point he stressed and hammered home to the House on the Second Reading: that the Minister for Justice has a diffcult task already with the number of petitions which come before him and that if the amendment is rejected his task will become increasingly difficult and that the Minister should accept representations made not only by one Party but by Deputies of all the Parties in the combination.  I do not think that that is a valid argument. The position is that there are so many roads leading to disaster if you have a weak and corrupt Minister for Justice that one more or less will not make any difference.  I think it will be accepted <Col N="579" /> that the position occupied by the Minister for Justice is a very special one and one which requires a good man to fill it properly.  I would not be at all afraid of giving this power on the grounds that the Minister for Justice would not be able to carry it, and that is the net argument put up by Deputy Boland which I do not think is solid.</P>
      <P>On the other hand I agree with everything which Deputy Boland and the other speakers say regarding the necessity to mark the seriousness of this particular offence in some way and I believe that the Legislature had that in mind when it enacted Section 30 of the Road Traffic Act, 1933.  I agree that that necessity exists and the idea which most appealed to me in the speeches made on this section was the possibility of framing our legislation so that there would be a minimum disqualification as at present existing in Section 30 of the Road Traffic Act which could not be interfered with by the Minister but that the Minister should be absolutely free in the exercise of his general prerogative of mercy to remit disqualifications over and above the minimum period of 12 months which at present exists.  I do not know whether it would be possible for the Minister to give some further consideration to the section with a view to introducing proposals of that sort.</P>
      <P>If it comes to a decision between the amendment as it stands at the moment in Deputy Boland's name and the section as it stands at the moment I would have no hesitation in voting for the section.  If it comes to a choice of the Minister having these powers to be used in the manner in which the Minister himself indicated this afternoon only in very exceptional circumstances, I believe that the Minister is quite right in saying that if it is only to prevent one injustice, possibly one injustice in a decade or in a century, then it is necessary for the Minister to have that power in order to prevent that injustice rather than that his hands should be tied as they would be tied if Deputy Boland's amendment were carried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that Deputy Boland <Col N="580" /> has been at all unreasonable in the view he expressed and I think it quite unnecessary that a certain amount of heat should have been introduced in discussing an amendment of this sort. When one comes up against an example such as that given by Deputy Peadar Cowan yesterday I think that every Deputy will appreciate that it is necessary that something should be done to remedy the situation.  I did not hear of the case until Deputy Cowan mentioned it here yesterday and I know nothing about it.  Obviously, it is a very extreme case and is probably the only case of its kind in existence, but it does at least indicate to the House that the law, as it stands at present&mdash;or rather the interpretation as it stands at present, because Deputy Boland indicated that there were two legal opinions on the matter&mdash;does not seem to be quite right and requires some amendment or modification.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister is very wise and has shown his usual wisdom and broadmindedness in leaving this matter to a free vote of the House.  In legislation of this sort, which should be non-controversial and certainly nonpolitical, it is only right that the House should try to discuss it without anything in the nature of a line-up on one side or the other.  I would rather find myself in the position of being able to support this amendment but I quite sincerely and honestly believe if the choice is between the section and the amendment that the section should be supported.</P>

There are cases where a free pardon must not necessarily arise, where there should be an examination and where the penalty should be removed. That, I think, can only happen very rarely, but the powers should be there and I suggest to the House that it is in the interests of everybody that that power should be inherent and exercisable in that particular way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>This House, in its wisdom, when passing the Road Traffic Act, decided that where a driver was convicted of being incapable of driving by reason of drink, certain penalties automatically should follow.  Amongst those penalties was the suspension of his driving licence for a minimum period, for a first offence, of 12 months. There were also penalties of three months' imprisonment or a fine of £50. Such convicted person has the right to appeal to the Circuit Court, and, if the Circuit Court affirms the conviction, the penalties in respect of driving cannot be altered.  The Circuit Court, however, can quash the whole conviction and no penalty whatever in respect of future driving or otherwise is then applicable.  In other words, the person goes free.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Medical evidence and counter medical evidence is brought forward and it is very difficult for the <Col N="582" /> State to get a conviction.  Even if a conviction is got, there is provision in the Road Traffic Act for an appeal to the Circuit Court.  That means that a second officer of the State, a circuit judge, will try the case, hear the evidence in respect of drunkenness and and all the other factors involved.  If he decides that the conviction shall stand, the penalty in respect of suspension of the licence for 12 months must stand, but he can, if he wishes, remove the fine and sentence of imprisonment.</P>
      <P>I remember when this Act was going through the House.  If the records are looked up, it will be found that amendments were put down by the Labour Party or the then Opposition to have a statutory penalty of imprisonment which could not be removed by any judge.  There were even proposals before the House on that occasion to have statutory penalties of imprisonment on a man convicted of driving a vehicle while drunk.  I think it only right that it should be so. You might as well say that if a man who has a licence to have a revolver murders anyone, the Minister could, if he wished, remove any sentence imposed upon him.  We know the Government have that power in respect of such sentences, but, if the public at large were consulted, it would be found that the consensus of opinion is that the penalties at the moment are not severe enough in the case of drunken motorists, and nothing we do here to-day should indicate in any way to potential drunken motorists of the future that there is a way out for them.  There should be no way out.  There should be a minimum penalty with no way out and no Minister in any Government should have the power to remit a minimum penalty in the case of a drunken motorist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be remembered that he gets into his drunken condition voluntarily and then enters a vehicle of destruction, a vehicle of murder, if you like, to drive along the roads.  We have an increasing number of motor vehicles in this country and we have narrow corkscrew roads, and the death rate is bound to increase.  It will increase fast enough without having drunken <Col N="583" /> men sitting behind the wheels of motor cars.  There will be deaths from ordinary accidents where the greatest possible care is taken, without these lethal weapons being placed in the hands of drunken men or men incapable of driving.  I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment and to indicate to the public that this Oireachtas is concerned for the safety of human beings on the roads and to protect them from the drunken motorist in the future.  No Minister should have this power, and I am not concerned with the name of the Minister or the Government which is in office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that this whole problem is being approached in an entirely wrong way.  The Oireachtas has provided penalties not only in regard to offences under the Road Traffic Act but offences under many other Acts.  Offences have been created and penalties set out.  With regard to charges of being drunk while in charge of a motor vehicle, I think it goes somewhat further than driving a motor car.  I have not got the section in front of me, but I think the disqualification applies to much more than driving a motor vehicle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The law has been settled in regard to that.  There are punishments which may be imposed by the court and certain disabilities follow as a matter of course&mdash;the suspension of the driving licence for a minimum period of 12 months.  That is what the law says.  When a person is convicted of being drunk in charge, or of attempting to drive while drunk, undoubtedly he has a right of appeal.  The case is heard by the Circuit Court and when the Circuit Court has dealt with it, that is the end of it from the legal point of view.  That is the final court of appeal, so far as the law is concerned. It may very well be that the Circuit Court may approach the matter, as I have seen Circuit Court judges approaching it, on the basis of saying: &ldquo;This was done by the very learned district justice and I am not going to interfere with his decision.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been in court and have heard <Col N="584" /> circuit judges making that declaration which was highly improper and wrong, because they were bound to hear the evidence, to make up their own minds and come to their own conclusions, and it should not matter two hoots what the learned district justice did.  That is an aspect of appeal that one comes across, although not very often.  The younger judges, I think, have no doubts whatever about it, and, in the generality of cases, there is completely new hearing.  The circuit judge comes to his own conclusion, irrespective of what was done in the District Court, but there are cases where an appeal has not been heard in the way it ought to be and where there was a conviction because the learned district justice did something which was not going to be disturbed.  There are cases&mdash;and Deputy Lynch and other lawyer Deputies will know that there are such cases&mdash;which are not dealt with satisfactorily by the courts.  Any person who has any practical experience of operating in the courts knows that for one reason or another&mdash;now and again, not very often&mdash;things occur that are not entirely satisfactory.  It is always well in these cases that there should be some authority to whom an appeal can be made by way of petition or otherwise setting out the facts that ought to have been considered and that in an ordinary merciful way ought to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I would have the greatest confidence in any person who becomes Minister for Justice in this country that whatever powers are given to him&mdash;certainly we are giving in this section the very widest of powers to a Minister for Justice&mdash;would be exercised in a very fair way and that whatever decision he came to would be properly arrived at.</P>
    <P>Listening to some of the discussions I hear in this House from time to time, some of the appeals for penalties that cannot be touched, I think it is a great thing that Providence, the Almighty Himself, does not run things in that way.  There would be no hope for anybody; there would be no mercy.  You could never look forward to mercy. Fortunately, our whole Christian concept is mercy.  Cannot we have the same concept here?  A person may be <Col N="585" /> guilty of a very serious offence.  That person may be punished.  That person may regret very much that he or she was guilty of that offence and may come to a resolution never to break or infringe the law again.  I say that that person is in a different category from a person who does not give two hoots whether he or she breaks the law again and there ought to be some difference.  That can only be dealt with by some independent authority like the Minister for Justice or the Government who may consider all these factors and all new factors that may arise.  For that reason, and in accordance with certain general principles I have in regard to mercy, I think that the Minister ought to be given the power by this House and that we should give it to him with confidence knowing that in accordance with the tradition of Irish Ministers and Irish Governments, these powers will not be abused.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>There can be two views on this question of the application of mercy to this matter.  After all, it does depend on the point of view from which you look at it as to how you will apply the mercy.  It is all very well to say that somebody who kills or injures somebody else with a motor car will be very sorry afterwards.  He would be a most abnormal person if he were not. We have to deal with the normal people, I take it, in our legislation.  I think that there is a duty on us to see that we exercise the mercy in the first instance on behalf of the generality of the people, particularly those who are the victims of this very peculiar type of offence.  I say it is a very peculiar type of offence, because it seems to me from the number of applications which have gone into the Department of Justice, as Deputy Boland pointed out, and the very special arrangements which we are now making, that there is, apparently, a viewpoint growing up and which has been accepted that there is something different in this type of crime from our conception of crime generally.  If that is so and if the Minister accepts that, and he seems to be accepting that by reason of the powers which he wishes to take, I do not think that the matter is suitable <Col N="586" /> to be dealt with under the general principles of criminal justice.  I think he should have done the obvious thing if he wanted to deal with the matter at all and dealt with it by an amendment of the Road Traffic Act.  After all, it is essentially a matter that has to do with road traffic and I think the issue has been confused by bringing it into a Bill dealing with criminal justice.</P>
      <P>With regard to dealing with these petitions from a position of independence, I think that the judges who are specially privileged&mdash;more so even than Ministers&mdash;can lay claim to a fairer and more independent dealing with a matter of this kind than even the best-intentioned Minister for Justice we might have.  The Minister indicated that he would only exercise this power where new evidence and new facts had come to his notice.  If that is the position, I say to the Minister that he ought to leave these new facts and that new evidence to the tribunals that are set up for dealing with them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

      <P>As this is essentially a traffic offence, will the Minister not consider altering the Road Traffic Act and providing whatever elasticity would be required to bring these cases back again, on the emergence of the new evidence, to the tribunals which are best fitted to deal with them?  It is quite obvious that we have put this particular type of offence into a special category of crime.  I do not think it is suitable to be dealt with by the application of the ordinary principles of criminal justice and it ought to be removed entirely from this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself on practically all occasions opposed to the idea of conferring on the Executive, particularly on an individual member of the Executive, powers to override decisions of the courts.  There are safeguards to justice in having independent courts.  We have many times prided ourselves on the fact that our courts are independent of the Executive, on having independent courts and having hearings in public.  Both of these principles are affected when we <Col N="587" /> give to a member of the Executive power to override the decisions of the courts.  He is a member of the Executive. Therefore, the separation of the powers upon which we pride ourselves so much is affected by it.  In addition to that, the case, so far as the public are concerned, is heard in private.  I think these are two considerations which should always be borne in mind whenever there is a suggestion of giving powers to the Executive for the remission of court penalties.</P>
      <P>I must admit that the power of mercy ought to lie somewhere and be available in case of absolute necessity.  The fact is, as Deputy Cowan mentioned, that if the Almighty were not so merciful most of us would find ourselves in a very difficult position indeed.  But the Almighty is able to read the hearts of men and is all-knowing and all-wise. We have not these advantages here in human affairs.  We have to provide in our institutions for our own weaknesses in that respect.  Consequently, this idea of the prerogative of mercy was a prerogative which was to be exercised only in a very limited class of cases and with safeguards. The prerogative of mercy is provided for in cases of capital sentences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two reasons, I take it, for that.  The first is that if there should, by any chance, be a miscarriage of justice there was no way of undoing the wrong at any time: it was final in its character.  The second is that the taking of human life under any circumstances is the greatest power over an individual which the State can take to itself.  In cases of that sort it is quite obvious that it is desirable that, if any particular fact should emerge which might make it appear that there was the slightest doubt, the Executive should have power, in these extreme cases, to change the punishment.  But even there, as I know, the whole process is very unsatisfactory.  As far as we were concerned, we were always guided, as far as I remember, by the advice which was given by the judges. It is very unsatisfactory because you have not, as the judge has, the opportunity of seeing the individual or <Col N="588" /> individuals who may be accused of the crime and you have not the opportunity of seeing the witnesses.  We are assuming that our judges are not put into responsible positions without being qualified for them.  The Executive has not the opportunity that the judges have of seeing the case in full.  But there is, at least, the safeguard of a number of people deciding and not an individual who sometimes can have extraordinary views.  Consequently, you have some sort of safeguard that the prerogative will not be used in a case where it should not be used.  You have also the publicity which comes in a case of that kind.  You have, in addition, the formal reference to the President.  All these things are safeguards. These safeguards are completely done away with when a Minister receives petitions amounting to the numbers which we have now been told.  He is not, as a rule, able to examine them in detail.  He has to refer a great part of the examination to members of his staff.  The result is that the work which the courts are supposed to do in public is being undone in private.</P>
    <P>We ought to be very cautious about any extension of the powers of any individual Minister, in circumstances like these, to remit penalties imposed in the open court by judges or by a judge.  I am for the greatest amount of safeguard it is possible to have.  I believe in the right of appeal.  If there is anything lacking in the way of providing adequate appeal in open court I should be altogether in favour of strengthening our machinery in that regard, but I think it is quite wrong to turn the Executive or a member of the Executive into a secret court of appeal.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I think the Minister is wrong in taking to himself the power of overriding what is a statute&mdash; because that is what he is doing.  As I understand it, a statute has been passed by this House under which certain penalties are automatically imposed when a decision has been arrived at by the judge on the facts. Now we give the Minister the power in secret to override that statute.  I think it is altogether wrong.  Personally, I would support, as far as I <Col N="589" /> could, having appeals under which these matters could be tried&mdash;and any appeals could be heard in public and by some independent authority.  It is a wrong way of doing things to give the power to a Minister.</P>
    <P>I may also say that I believe that the Government and the Minister are not doing their duty by the House in allowing matters of this magnitude to be decided by a free vote.  How many Deputies are here at present considering this matter?  How many Deputies have we in the House at this moment listening to the arguments, <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>?  We have not many. That happens very often.  The Government is bound to consider in advance serious matters of this sort and to arrive at a decision upon them. Having come to a decision, they should try to press that decision, if they believe it right, with all their might upon the members of the House.  The Government has more experience of these things than the average Deputy has and the members of the Government ought to take their responsibility seriously and give a headline to the House and stand by it.  They should not simply say: &ldquo;We have no responsibility in the matter.  We leave it to a free vote.&rdquo;  If the Minister believes he is right and we are wrong, he should press for his view.</P>

In other words, it is going to be decided by people who are now outside this House, by people who are not here at the moment, and who have not given sufficient consideration to the matter at all. At least, we ought to have an assurance that the members of the Government, as a whole, have considered this matter.  We ought to have an assurance that the members of the Government have had a discussion among themselves, and have arrived at a decision upon the matter.  If a Party has to take a point of view, the matter will have to be discussed and a decision arrived at by the Party.  In that way there is some opportunity of getting the matter dealt with properly.  This <Col N="590" /> habit&mdash;which has come because of the exigencies of the Coalition&mdash;of evading responsibility in regard to anything that causes any difference of opinion at all and saying: &ldquo;We will leave it to a free vote of the House&rdquo; is a shirking by the Government of its responsibility to the House and to the country.</P>

      <P>I have to cite it because this Bill is brought into this House under the Constitution.  Under Article 13 (6) of the Constitution we read:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The right of pardon and the power to commute or remit punishment imposed by any court exercising criminal jurisdiction are hereby vested in the President, but such power of commutation or remission may, except in capital cases, also be <Col N="591" /> conferred by law on other authorities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is what this is doing.  It is making that beyond yea or nay.  When the Leader of the Opposition comes in now and says that he looks with horror at some Minister or somebody being set up to examine or review decisions of the court, I think he is not fair to himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope we all have as much manners as Deputy Allen.  That would not be much.  We will not go into that.  I submit, and I put it to the House, that when this power is being given and when it already exists it should be legalised and put on a proper footing, to make sure that where a set of circumstances arises there must be power somewhere, without all the formality that the Leader of the Opposition puts up.  I think the House should take it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section is a considered Government decision and it is not a free vote but on the question of this, in a sense, minor amendment, I decided to leave it to a free vote because it affects every single Deputy.  It is your responsibility. It is a responsibility that I as Minister do not want but, as I said before, I have a responsibility to put it to the House to give this power not <Col N="592" /> only to the present Minister for Justice but to any future Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>Let me in conclusion say that the petition section at the moment is as I got it but with this alteration that no decision is now taken by a junior official; it must come to an assistant secretary at least.  All the usual routine is followed.  Therefore, no decision of an important nature can take place in a light-hearted fashion.</P>

I think that no Minister for Justice in this country will ever do it any other way.  Therefore, I think the power that you have given in the section should be maintained right through and that the power of remission of any penalty, except capital punishment, should be vested in the Minister in this case as well as in the other one.</P>

      <P>One matter has struck me in regard to the reduction of sentences.  When a sentence is imposed in the court trying the case, that sentence is published for general information, particularly if it occurs in the country, in the local newspapers.  If there is an appeal, that also gets publicity in rural areas.  When the Government or the Minister exercises this right of review on petition and comes to a conclusion that the sentence should be commuted, mitigated or altered, there ought to be some publication of that fact.  I suggest that on the next stage the Minister might introduce a short amendment, that any decision under this section would be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  Undoubtedly, this is the exercise of a very important function in a judicial manner.  The decision affects an individual and, to some extent, the public. In the public interest, there should be some publication somewhere of that decision, and the only place I think it could be done is <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  Therefore, I make that suggestion for the Minister's consideration.</P>

      <P>When this Bill was brought in first, I welcomed it and thought it a good Bill and from the general tone of the debate I thought we would have some chance of amending that particular section.  Section 21, however, has made it a very bad Bill. I would ask the Minister to explain about sub-section (2), as to what other disqualifications and forfeitures are involved.  I do not think the Dáil should be asked to pass the Bill, without having as much information as we can get from the Minister as to the particular things we are going to do. I mentioned one as I thought it was the outstanding case, that is, the Road Traffic Act case.  What others are there?  Will there be licensed vintners' licences&mdash;if these are endorsed, is the endorsement to be wiped out?&mdash;or things of that kind? The House and the public should know the extent to which the law is being changed.  I have no fixed notion as to what will be done, but that is one that occurs to me.  Deputy Vivion de Valera mentioned it last night.  In discussing a matter of this importance, <Col N="596" /> the Minister should be explicit and tell us what he has in mind and what disqualifications and forfeitures may be restored or reviewed under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like the Minister to intimate what particular matters he or his Department have in mind under sub-section (2), what particular forfeitures may be reviewed. There has been criticism about these powers being vested in the Minister at all.  It means general power to interfere with the decisions of trial judges or of the courts.  It might be a better procedure if there were some other body to exercise these functions, particularly the prerogative of mercy, the reducing of sentences or fines.  It is a matter that might be better handled, as evidently was originally intended, by the President's Office or by some section which would be specifically set up there to deal with these matters.  Certainly, if these matters were to be dealt with in the President's Office, the chances are that so much pressure could not be brought to bear by public men and others interested, as is bound to occur under this as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one point I would like to see written into this Bill, if the Minister would do it on Report Stage. There is no provision in it to ensure that, where a petition does come along to the Minister, it will be sent for the report of the trial judge or the district justice.  If this Bill leaves the House in its present form, the position of the law will be unsatisfactory.  I do not say the Minister will do this or depart from the practice that has been built up, but there is no provision at law to stop the Minister, completely of his own volition, getting a petition or representations from some Deputy about some case and, there and then, completely wiping out the sentence or fine imposed by the court.  I do not think it will be necessary for me to impress on this House the effect that such a practice would have generally on the administration of justice.  We know that if it became known to the public that decisions made in open court by judges could be interfered with in that way, it would have a disastrous effect <Col N="597" /> on those carrying out the administration of the law and on the administration of the law generally.  I would like the Minister on the Report Stage to introduce an amendment so as to enshrine in the legislation passed by this House the practice that has been carried out already when petitions have been sent to the Minister, that is, that these petitions invariably were referred to the trial judge or the district justice and I think also referred to the Guards for their comments before the Minister exercised his power.</P>
    <P>The Minister said a few moments ago that sometimes a number of these petitions are decided by some civil servant in his office without his seeing the petitions at all.  If that is so, it is a wrong practice and a disastrous one.  If one of these petitions were allowed by some civil servant, it would be putting that man in the position of overriding the judge, who had all the facts before him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not say that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit to the House that the least safeguard, now that the Government is being given this power, that should be inserted is that the petition in every case should be sent for the comments of the trial judge or the presiding justice who decided the particular case.  I do not mean to suggest that, notwithstanding what the trial judge or the justice might say, the Minister would not still have power to override that; but I do think we should have the position at law that if any particular Minister for Justice is about to exercise these powers, he should know when he starts that he is open to be pilloried in this House if he does so from any motive other than a proper one.  If we have this amendment in the Bill, he will know that if, notwithstanding the recommendation of the trial judge or the justice, he is going to override all that, there must be certain circumstances he can stand over when his Estimate comes before this House for discussion.  I am asking the Minister to have this amendment <Col N="598" /> inserted, so that no matter what Minister for Justice is in office he will know that he is answerable to the House and when he is about to exercise any of these powers he will be doing so at his peril and will have to stand over the particular circumstances in the case before he overrides a decision given in open court.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank goodness I am not bound to read all the futile petitions that will come in.  No civil servant decides a case but they do reject; and what I said was that I hoped they would continue to reject without my having to deal with the lot of them.  There is no question, therefore, of any civil servant overriding anybody.  I want that to be quite clear. Before the petition comes to me a civil servant will have a look at it to see whether it is a fit and proper case to come before the Minister.  I do not know whether or not the Deputy realises it but, believe it or not, Governments may come and Governments may go but civil servants go on forever.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not make it more involved than it is.  It was simple and decent the way it was. Yesterday you had great confidence in the Minister for Justice.  Leave it at that.  Have that confidence and trust that the correct thing will always be done.  Nothing is being done except what already existed.  What disqualifications and forfeitures are being touched?  There are very few: an off-licence that is endorsed twice, automatically there was qualification. A person offending under the Electoral Act is disqualified from ever voting <Col N="599" /> again, but I am informed that I have no power under the Electoral Act. Nothing more is being done than is already in existence.  As I said, it was to give effect to that particular section of the Constitution that this proposal is made, and I think it is the correct thing to do.  Deputy Boland has told you that a good deal of this Bill was already in being before he left office. If he were in my place to-day he would take the same line that I am taking, and I hope that I will get the same support from the Opposition that they would have given to him.  There is no reason why, because we change government, these important changes should not be made.</P>

      <P>Where was the power of remission?  Perhaps I had better not argue that.  The section I submit is a good one.  On the Report Stage I shall examine the question of publicity.  One does not publish that a particular person went to confession and, when the prerogative of mercy is extended, I think it is better to leave it so.  It may be necessary to issue a statement periodically as to the number of remissions and possibly publish the names, though I do not think it would be altogether wise.  However, I shall examine the matter.  It does strike me that there may be something in it.  I shall not make any promises but I will examine it to see how far we can go to meet the particular point.</P>

I cannot see what point he is making about the Constitution and there being any inconsistency in my attitude and what is laid down in the Constitution.  It is, under the Constitution, possible to make provision by law for remission of penalties.  Here we are making the law; and when it is a question of making law and making provision it is the right of the Oireachtas to decide whether or not it will do a certain thing.</P>

      <P>I have been arguing against the extension of powers. Deputy Boland, former Minister for Justice, believes that this is now a bad Bill by virtue of the rejection of the amendment.  If there was a possibility of meeting the suggestion as to publicity in relation to the cases and the remissions that might conform somewhat better to what was the practice when the prerogative was exercised mainly in capital cases, but the exercise is being widely extended now.  I do not say the public interest entitles us at any time to be unjust to an individual, but we must consider whether the public should be endangered by any individual who takes control of a vehicle when under the influence of drink.  However, we on this side have made our protest to the best of our ability and we are against the section.</P>

There is very little left in the District Court against which one cannot appeal. Whether the few that survive against which there is no appeal survive by accident or not I do not know.  The section is removing doubts as to whether an appeal lies from an order of the District Court committing a person to a certified school.  The section proposes to remove the doubts that exist and to declare that there is such an appeal.  There are a few other matters in which the Circuit Court has held that there is no right of appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the Minister to consider the position between this and the Report Stage in order to clear up all doubts and leave, as I think everybody agrees there should be, an appeal to the Circuit Court in regard to every order. I think there was one particular case where an order of forfeiture was made under the Police Property Act.  There was an appeal from the District Court to the Circuit Court.  It was argued at considerable length that there was an appeal and it was argued more successfully at the same length that there was no appeal.  I think we should avail of <Col N="602" /> this opportunity to remove all the existing doubts.</P>

      <P>It is.  I had never come across it before.  The case was argued exceptionally well by a young counsel.  Here, when a person is bound to the peace in the District Court, you have this cumbersome method of bringing the case to the Circuit Court by notice served.  There were two parties involved.  The notice was, apparently, served on the Guards, and the State Solicitor felt that he should not come in on the thing at all.  The case was not presented in the Circuit Court in the way in which it was presented in the District Court.  The Circuit Court judge had before him simply the evidence of two people and of such witnesses as they liked to call.  In the end, he decided, properly I think on the evidence before him, that he should remove this binding to the peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that, where the Guards have come in in the first instance, they should be represented in the Circuit Court by the State Solicitor to represent, as it were, the district justice or the Garda authorities.  I feel that, even in a binding to the peace case, it would be much better for everybody if there was an honest to God direct <Col N="603" /> appeal to the Circuit Court, and have the matter heard in the way it was heard in the District Court.  The present procedure seems to me to be very cumbersome.  The matter was brought before the court in an ingenious way, and justice may not have been done in the long run.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 23.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephTimoney" hpid="Mr. Timoney Mr. Timoney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 43:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 23 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 10 of the Criminal Justice Administration Act, 1914, is hereby amended by the deletion of the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; and the substitution therefor of the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; in Section 10 (1) (b) of the said Act; and by the deletion of all words from and including the word &ldquo;prison&rdquo; to the end of Section 10 (1) of the said Act and substituting therefor &ldquo;a Borstal institution for a period of not less than two years and not more than three years.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to simplify the procedure which has to be followed in certain cases where, in the opinion of a district justice, a young offender, as stated in the Act, would be sent to Borstal rather than to prison.  The machinery which I am suggesting is that Section 10 of the Criminal Justice Administration Act, 1914, be amended.  The position, as created by that section, seems to me to be somewhat curious.  It first of all deals with a very limited class of offenders.  First of all, the person must be summarily convicted.  Under the section, the offence must be one in which the court has power to impose a sentence of imprisonment for one month or upwards without the option of a fine.  Therefore, it follows that it must be a serious offence.  Then <Col N="604" /> the court must be satisfied that the offender is not less than 16 years old and not more than 21.  It must be proved that &ldquo;the offender has previously been convicted of an offence, or that, having been previously discharged on probation, he failed to observe a condition of his recognizance.&rdquo; A further condition is that if:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;it appears to the court that by reason of the offender's criminal habits or tendencies, or association with persons of bad character, it is expedient that he should be subject to detention for such term and under such instruction and discipline as appears most conducive to his reformation and the repression of crime.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, with all these conditions present, where the justice convicts, he must send the young man or girl, as the case may be, to prison, even though he feels it is not the right thing to do, and that removal to a Borstal institution would be the proper thing.  Under the section the justice must send the young person to prison direct, and must send him forward to the Circuit Court in custody.  What the section says is this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It shall be lawful for the court, in lieu of passing sentence, to commit the offender to prison until the next quarter sessions, and the court of quarter sessions shall inquire into the circumstances of the case, and, if it appears to the court that the offender is of such age as aforesaid and that for any such reason as aforesaid it is expedient that the offender should be subject to such detention as aforesaid, shall pass such sentence of detention in a Borstal institution as is authorised by Part I of the Prevention of Crime Act, 1908, as amended by this Act; otherwise the court shall deal with the case in any way in which the court of summary jurisdiction might have dealt with it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The position is this, that the district justice may, if he wishes, send the offender to prison, or he may send him forward to the Circuit Court so that the Circuit Court judge may, if he thinks fit, send him to a Borstal institution <Col N="605" /> or to prison.  Now, I think it will be generally agreed that a sentence of imprisonment is a more serious matter than committal to Borstal.  I do not quite understand why the option was given to the Petty Sessions Court of that time in the manner in which it was given.</P>
    <P>It would appear to me that a more sensible way of putting it would be to let the justice send the young offender to Borstal if he thought fit, or, if the justice thought the case was one that merited imprisonment, that then he would send him to the Circuit Court judge and get two judicial views on the case.  At present, the justice cannot send the offender to Borstal.  He must send him forward to the Circuit Court. In the meantime, the accused has to stay in prison.  That is open to a number of objections.</P>
    <P>What comes to one's mind is this, that, particularly in the country, there is in the summer time quite a long delay between a sitting of the District Court and the next sitting of the Circuit Court, a delay sometimes running into four months.  You have the position, therefore, that the district justice, knowing that the next sitting of the Circuit Court will not take place until, say, four months hence, thinks that it would be a great hardship, obviously, on this young offender to be lodged in prison until the circuit judge comes around. Accordingly, although he may think it would be a proper case for Borstal, he adopts the expedient of sending him to prison for six months.</P>
    <P>What happens then, I understand, is that the Minister for Justice comes into the picture and, if he thinks fit, transfers this person suffering a sentence of imprisonment to a Borstal institution.  That is a way of getting around Section 10 of the Criminal Justice Administration Act but, in itself, it is not a satisfactory way.  I think the principal objection to that solution is that even where the Minister, by Order, has the convicted person transferred to Borstal, the convicted person is still entitled to his ordinary remission as if he were left there to suffer the term of imprisonment imposed.  His going to Borstal then means that he can claim this <Col N="606" /> remission and that he cannot be detained there for a sufficient length of time to give him a useful trade which is one of the principal objects of treatment in a Borstal institution. That is one objection.  Of course, the other objection is that you have in this young person a person sentenced to imprisonment rather than to a Borstal institution.  We are giving in this Bill considerably increased jurisdiction in criminal matters to the District Court and I cannot see that any good case can be made against giving the district justice the direct power of sending a person, who comes within Section 10 of the Criminal Justice Administration Act, 1914, to Borstal rather than to prison.  I think that is a very reasonable suggestion to make and that it is one that should appeal to the Minister and to the House.  There is no necessity to elaborate on it any further.  Anybody who has read the suggested amendment and who has looked into the matter, as I have looked into it, will I think be coerced into accepting it on account of its reasonableness alone.</P>
    <P>I said already that I did not quite understand why the option was given in the way it has been given under Section 10 of the 1914 Act.  I cannot still understand it.  I do not know what the circumstances prevailing then were so far as the Petty Sessions Court was concerned but I do know that the magistrates then were not trained lawyers.  We all recognise that the district justices as a body have set a very high standard in the administration of justice in this country and that the District Court, taking it as a whole, has served the country extremely well.  It may have been that in 1914, when you had trained lawyers as judges of Quarter Sessions and untrained people in the Petty Sessions Court, the Legislature thought that this sending to Borstal should be subject to review by a trained lawyer. That may have been in the mind of the Legislature but still I cannot see why they did this.  I cannot see any reasonable explanation for having made the law as it has been now since 1914, and I do think there is no reasonable ground for suffering its continuance because of the undesirable consetraine <Col N="607" /> quences which follow from it and because, so to speak, it coerces the district justice into imposing a sentence of imprisonment when he feels that it is a proper case for committing the accused person to Borstal.</P>
    <P>There is a further slight amendment suggested in the section and the purpose is to remove some of the conditions which I have already read out. I see from the way the amendment has been worded that I should have dealt with that first but I shall deal with it now.  It suggests the deletion at the end of paragraph (b)  of sub-section (1) of Section 10 of the Act of the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; and the substitution of the word &ldquo;or&rdquo;.  That would leave a wider scope to the district justice in selecting cases for Borstal rather than for imprisonment.</P>
    <P>As I say, my chief purpose in putting down this amendment is to avoid, as far as possible, sending a person to prison where there is an alternative method.  By making the section disjunctive in this way, you will go a far distance towards achieving that particular object.  The term of the sentence to Borstal, as laid down in the Criminal Justice Administration Act of 1914 and as amended by subsequent statutes, is for a period of not less than two years and not more than three years, so that the sense of the position would be, if this amendment is accepted, that it would be lawful for the District Court, in lieu of passing a sentence of imprisonment to commit an offender to a Borstal institution for not less than two years and not more than three years. The net effect of the acceptance of the amendment would be that it would cut out the undesirable wait in prison until the Circuit Court judge came round, and then the unnecessary review by the Circuit Court judge.  For that reason I ask the Minister to accept the amendment as framed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot accept the amendment.  I do not know how the Deputy lightheartedly says that the difference between imprisonment and Borstal is very great.  It is because imprisonment <Col N="608" /> may be for a week, a fortnight, two months or six months, but imprisonment for from two to three years is no easy matter, and even though a boy is only 16 years of age, Borstal is for all intents and purposes a curtailment of liberty.  I would not like lightly to give the power to a district justice to put a person in for Borstal treatment for from two to three years without a fair and good examination.  That is what happens when it is returned to the Circuit Court judge.  This provision has been in existence for a great number of years, and no complaint has so far been made about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, and a Parliament has been in existence for a long time and questions could have been raised if there was anything wrong with it.  Remember that before a person can be committed for Borstal treatment he must have done something. There are conditions before he can be committed for Borstal treatment.  On the Deputy's amendment, a first offender can be committed by a district justice.  While I have absolute confidence in the majority of district justices, I would not like if a person could, for a first offence, be run in for two or three years without any further examination. I do not think it would be wise.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is on a good point and I admit that there is a good deal in what he has said.  I admit that it is not a good thing to have a person in prison for a period of two or three months.  That is the most it can be, because the Circuit Court sits four times a year and therefore it cannot be six months.  At the most, it may be three.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>It could happen that it would be four.  While the person is so remanded, the Minister has no power to send him to Borstal and he is in with the old lags.  I am perturbed about that end of it as he may be for a period in prison meeting associates he would be better without.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that taking away a youngster's <Col N="609" /> liberty from the age of 16 to 21 years is a very serious step and should not be left just to the immediate whim of the district justice.  As they have the power under certain circumstances to commit a person for Borstal treatment it might be argued &ldquo;Why not give them this?&rdquo;  but I feel that it would be better to leave it to the Circuit Court judge to decide whether a person should have that long-term confinement&mdash;because it is confinement although under excellent conditions, although the gates are practically open and although we believe and trust that it will be regarded in the future as a fairly high-class school instead of a prison.  At the same time there is that taking away of the freedom of the individual. I think in the long run that the best way is to allow the case to be returned by the district justice to the Circuit Court judge so that there may be time to realise the gravity of the thing which is about to happen.</P>
    <P>Although the thing is a long time on hands, I will have the matter examined again, if the Deputy would leave it at that, to see what we could do on the Report Stage, but I do not know how I can give way on it.</P>

      <P>Section 10 says that it must be proved <i>inter alia</i> that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the offender has previously been convicted of any offence or, that having been previously discharged on probation, he failed to observe a condition of his recognisance.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In paragraph (c)  of sub-section (1)  it lays down a further condition:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;it appears to the court that, by reason of the offender's criminal habits or tendencies, or association with persons of bad character, it is expedient that he should be subject <Col N="610" /> to detention for such term and under such instruction and discipline as appears most conducive to his reformation and the repression of crime.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That is so.  I apologise to the Minister in that respect.  The substitution of &ldquo;or&rdquo; for &ldquo;and&rdquo; would certainly have that effect.  I would be prepared to forgo that part of the amendment and leave &ldquo;and&rdquo; there, but I do think that the Minister should give this very sympathetic consideration.  Further than that I do not intend to press him, of course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is going to re-examine this matter with a view to introducing an amendment on the Report Stage I would like him to consider this aspect of it: what is wrong with giving this power to the district justice in view of the fact that the aggrieved party will have an appeal presumably after the sentence is passed?  If you give the district justice power to commit a person to Borstal for a period of not less than two years and if there is some danger and if the Minister has some doubts <Col N="611" /> about giving him that power, remember that the district justice is one man examining the position while the Circuit Court judge is just another man examining the position.  I do not see any good reason why the district justice should not have this power provided you have the safeguard of appeal.  On appeal, you often find that one individual takes one view while another individual takes another. I do not see any sensible reason for continuing the law as it is under the 1914 Act because after all, it is the district justice who invariably deals with all children's offences throughout the length and breadth of the land and if a youngster has offended more than once or is guilty of the matters set out in the 1914 Act, then I think that the district justice is primarily the individual who should deal with it. You would not have the very objectionable practice which exists especially in the country of a long remand where a young person is associated with hardened criminals for a period of from three to four months. The principle of that is wrong.  There should be some other place for them and I see no reason why the Minister should not accept the principle of this amendment.  I think it can be fitted quite properly into the Bill and he should re-examine it from that point of view before Report.</P>

      <P>I certainly am somewhat worried by the disclosures made by Deputy Timoney.  In the city here, we are not subject to these infrequent sittings of the Circuit Court and we are probably inclined to lose sight of a situation such as he has referred to.  Where a youthful defendant is sent from the Dublin District Court to such an institution, he has been dealt with by a very experienced justice, having available to him a very good machinery&mdash;probationer officers, inquiries, and so on&mdash;and where he sends the case forward, it can be brought before the Circuit Court quickly.  The proofs required in the Circuit Court are often inclined to be just the formal proofs.  The individual is dealt with, in other words, as a piece or flotsam or jetsam, and if certain <Col N="612" /> formal proofs are put forward, off he goes to Borstal.  By the way, I do not like that word &ldquo;Borstal&rdquo; at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will do something to get rid of it.  I see the difficulty the Minister would have in trying to get an amendment into the Bill to meet that case, because I think it is somewhat bigger than just giving jurisdiction to the District Court.  If jurisdiction is given to the District Court, it is a special jurisdiction which should be exercised not in the hurry of a day's work, as is often the case.  Cases of offences committed by children are often left to the end of the day and dealt with in a short period.  I agree with the Minister's view that the sending away of any person for a long period is a very serious matter which should be inquired into very deeply.  I do not think that a court is the right place to do it even though it may be done by a judge or justice.  It should be done in an informal kind of way with quite a lot of investigation and consideration and ought to be done, in the long run, for the boy's benefit.  If it is done simply for the purpose of getting him out of the way, of sending him off, I do not think it is the correct approach and he should only be sent there if the justice or judge inquiring into the case is reasonably satisfied that he is to benefit from that form of treatment.</P>
      <P>I see the difficulty of getting it into this Bill and I see the desirability of having a lot of consideration given to it but, at the same time, I think it entirely wrong that a person should be kept in prison for three or four months, or maybe longer, awaiting the decision of the circuit judge.  We are inclined to get into a routine with regard to the circuit judge coming around so many times to a particular place.  These Borstal cases do not occur very frequently. They do not occur very frequently in the area of a particular circuit judge.  Is there no machinery whereby the circuit judge could go down and deal with the particular case itself?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have, as I say, got into a kind of <Col N="613" /> routine with regard to the circuit judge arriving at a certain time and members of the Garda turning out to salute him, and so on.  I do not like these things, but it could be got over if, in such an important matter as this, where the matter was reserved to the circuit judge, the circuit judge for the circuit or, if he is not available, a circuit judge nominated by the President of the Circuit Court, could be sent down to inquire into it, taking a day or two or whatever time was necessary to go into it fully.  Probably in that way you could retain the machinery of having the matter, as it were, looked into by two persons exercising judicial functions and, at the same time, eliminate this waiting period in prison which is very undesirable.</P>

      <P>Might I explain that the Minister has power, where he is likely to be committed, to transfer him to the Borstal institution or to give him Borstal treatment while waiting. Sub-section (3)  of Section 10 of the Criminal Justice (Administration) Act, 1914, says:&mdash;</P>

The Governor of St. Patrick's&mdash;I will stop using the word &ldquo;Borstal&rdquo;&mdash;does not like fellows coming in and going out, and does not want what he calls fly-bynight prisoners.  If they go in there, he wants to give them the treatment they are to get.  There is a modified treatment in Mountjoy for these prisoners who are likely to be committed, but I will examine the matter to see if I cannot get over the difficulty in some more satisfactory way.  There <Col N="614" /> is a lot to be said for the amendment, except perhaps that it is rather too sweeping.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been pointed out by many speakers, the main difference between this Bill and the County Management Act is the appointment of committees, a general executive committee and a health committee.  There are two opinions amongst people with experience of local government as to the effect of the setting up of two such committees.  Personally, I think, because of the powers of delegation which the Bill gives, that the committees in course of time will delegate their functions back to the manager under his new guise of county officer. In any event, as I pointed out on the last occasion, if the functions of the committee are important, it seems to me that a better arrangement would be a committee of the whole council.  I think that this thing of turning important functions over to a section of the council is unwise.  All the members of the council should be given a chance to administer these functions.  I think <Col N="616" /> that was the drawback under the arrangement whereby boards of health were given very considerable functions. I know that a committee of the whole council would be calculated to put up the travelling expenses, but I do not think that a consideration of that sort ought to be allowed to operate against the successful function of the committees if they are worth while at all.</P>
      <P>The County Management Act, in my opinion, really implemented the desires of those members of county councils who had long experience of the working of local government in pre-managerial days.  It is only necessary to refer to the very inadequate control of staff, particularly in regard to the remuneration of the staff.  My experience as a member of a county council is that if a clerk got married and wanted to get an increase of pay he had to approach a councillor to put down a notice of motion before he could get it.  That was a most unsatisfactory way of regulating the remuneration of the staff.  As well as that, the recruitment of the staff was a matter in which the members of the council had a very effective say.  I do not think that any member of a council wanted those powers because they were a great embarrassment and put an intolerable burden on an applicant for an increase of remuneration or for an appointment.  The system substituted for that has been a very marked improvement.</P>
      <P>Another matter that was implemented by the County Management Act was in connection with the signing of large payments weekly by the chairman of the finance committee. Very often these payments amounted to thousands of pounds.  The chairman turned up, with any members of the council who chose to attend, put his name on the dotted line, and accepted the county secretary's or accountant's word that the accounts were in order.  By his signature he vouched for their accuracy in the name of the council.  That procedure was abolished under the County Management Act, and the people who drew up these accounts and produced these figures were made responsible for them. That was a very common-sense change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could enumerate a good many <Col N="617" /> changes of that sort which were brought about by the County Management Act, and one can hardly say that they pointed in any way to the setting up of any form of local dictatorship. They really implemented the changes which were found by experience to be desirable and suitable. I referred, I think, to the appointment of temporary officers.  I think it is important that these temporary appointments, pending the permanent filling of the vacancies by the Local Appointments Commission, should be in the hands of the elected body, and not in the hands of the County Manager.  Also, if it were possible to change the arrangement whereby the Minister will appoint a county officer in a temporary capacity&mdash;if that also could be turned over to the council&mdash;I think it would be a wise change.  However, I think the appointment of executive officers of the council might with advantage be given to the council for the reason that the Manager would see to it that he took the necessary steps to have a permanent appointment filled as soon as possible. The reverse tendency has been in evidence because the temporary appointee is the choice of the manager himself. One can see the obvious objection to that arrangement.</P>
    <P>The eventual merging of the two positions of county secretary and county officer should bring about an economy and to that extent it is very welcome.  It is to be hoped that the Minister will not unnecessarily exercise his power of appointing assistant county officers to offset the possibility of economy which the Bill contains.  On that question I should like to ask the Minister about a matter on which I am not very clear.  When the amalgamation of functions takes place, when the county officer becomes county secretary and the new title of county secretary now applies to him although he will still exercise the same functions, can the appointment known as assistant county officer be made for that county under Section 34?  You will have abolished the name of county officer when the county officer has become county secretary.  Does the power of appointing an assistant county officer <Col N="618" /> disappear when the county officer has changed his status and become county secretary?</P>
    <P>On the question of the change of name, a great deal was made of the fact that he will now be known as county officer and that it is a more acceptable designation than county manager.  I do not think that one really ought to make a big point of that.  It is quite obvious that the county officer will manage a great many functions which have been managed heretofore by the manager.  He will manage the tenancy functions; he will manage a number of health functions and he will manage a number of employment functions. It does not matter what title you give him, the powers are still the same.  We hope that the system of controlling and administering the executive functions of a county council, as implemented in the County Management Act of 1940, will now be looked on more kindly and that, with the concession which a great many people seem to think they have got in the present Bill, they will now give their hearty co-operation which was lacking on the part of a great many political Parties, in any event, up to the present.</P>
    <P>There is a matter which I think might be mentioned on this Bill but which one comes up against in almost every Bill that comes before the House.  It is the question of amending other Acts of Parliament.  It has often struck me that a change ought to be effected for the sake of convenience. Take, for instance in this particular Act, the amendments of the Local Government Acts of 1925 and of 1946; also an amendment of a certain function of the Local Appointments Commission in relation to this present Act. Would it not be just as convenient, where amendments of this sort are deemed necessary, to carry them out as separate Acts?  After all, it is only a case of an extra sheet of paper and these amendments could be grouped in the appropriate places.  One would not, then, have to go through such a multiplicity of Acts to get the various amendments which a particular branch of the law has had inflicted on us.  It seems to me that if the Acts of 1925 and 1946 were each amended by a <Col N="619" /> separate Act of Parliament&mdash;as I have said, it would only be a sheet of paper &mdash;you could put your finger immediately on the development of each of these Acts and it would greatly convenience reference.  This particular Act does not sin any more than other Acts of Parliament in that respect.</P>
    <P>I think the Managerial Act had a very inauspicious start inasmuch as it came into operation at a time of emergency. There was legislation by decree and there was a great deal of delegation of duties in contemplation of war developments.  Commissioners of various sorts were appointed&mdash;county commissioners and regional commissioners. A system of parish councils was set up for the purpose of becoming miniature governments in case of invasion. You had all that paraphernalia of war organisation being gradually built up in the country in 1940.  It was in that atmosphere that this Managerial Act came into operation.  In my opinion, this notion of dictatorship, arising out of the war emergency, contaminated the Managerial Act in the eyes of a very large section of the public.  I think that if it had got a start in more propitious circumstances and times of peace it would very possibly have got a fairer and more dispassionate judgment.  Now, however, the obvious benefits of it have been seen and the errors and flaws in it have not been as plentiful as a great many people in this Party to which I belong thought at the time.</P>
    <P>It had a great many critics in this Party, although this was the Party that implemented it for the county councils. All these critics have been reassured on a great many matters about which they had misgivings.  We have now practically nation-wide unanimity as to the value of some system of management, some system whereby minor day to day matters will be taken out of the hands of the elected representatives and will be administered under the general supervision of the elected body by people who are on the spot from day to day.  That principle is generally accepted and with the co-operation and the support generally that is given by all sides of the House and all Parties in the country it should put local <Col N="620" /> government a step further and make the local government code a much more manageable and understandable system than it has been.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House have no criticisms to offer of this Bill other than whatever criticisms we had of the County Management Act.  As I pointed out on the last occasion I was speaking, there is just the one objection that I personally have, that is, the matter of temporary appointments to executive positions.  I think the Minister ought to consider that matter and allow that to be in the hands of the county councils until such time as arrangements can be made for permanent appointments.  If that is done, the Bill will be as near perfection as I can conceive.</P>

      <P>In my opinion the outstanding feature of the debate on this Bill is the lack of enthusiasm that has been shown by members of the Dáil, especially by some of the members opposite.  The Minister, when introducing the Bill, did not seem to be quite happy about it, judging by the way in which he skimmed over the various sections.  While Deputy Bartley has said that he has no great criticism to offer of this measure, I am not so enamoured of it.  It seems to me that it is nothing more than a device to cover up statements that were made throughout the country by some of the Deputies opposite in condemnation of the county management system.  They described it as a dictatorial system of local government, and they kept on threatening that as soon as they would get the opportunity they would do away with it.  Can anybody say that the county management system is being done away with by this measure? I, for one, do not think so.  Titular changes and changes of name in the Bill do not convince me that any radical change is being made in the local government system, but so much has been said about that, that I do not propose to follow the same line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said about the alleged restoration of democracy to local authorities, but everybody can see that as far as the powers, duties and rights of local authorities are concerned no fundamental change is being made by this measure.  There is provision in the <Col N="621" /> Bill, as Deputies have pointed out, for the setting up of committees but what has there been to prevent any local authority from setting up those committees? Two committees are mentioned&mdash;the general committee and the health committee.  I know that several local authorities set up a committee called the general purposes committee, whose business it was to examine all the problems of local administration and in due course to present their views to the general body.  That has been the practice in some places.  I am not in a position to say whether it has been adopted in many places or not.  I am merely pointing out that there was nothing to prevent any local authority from setting up whatever committee or committees they wanted to set up.</P>
    <P>I have referred to democratic control by local authorities.  While the Minister and some of the few Deputies opposite who have spoken on this measure may pretend that they are giving a new democratic slant to local government by this measure, I shall point out one way in which I think the tendency is in the other direction.  If we turn to Section 9 (4)  of the Bill, we see that the Minister reserves to himself the power to remove a county officer from office.  The county officer would be acting in the same capacity as the county manager has acted hitherto.  As many Deputies have pointed out, there is just a change of name.  I want to draw the attention of the House to this section where the Minister is giving himself power to remove from office at any time a county officer in any county.  Hitherto, in the County Management Act of 1940, that power was vested in the local authority, the county council.  They had the power, by a two-third's majority, to remove the county manager from office, but with this great difference, that before they could remove him they would have to debate, in public, the reasons why they were doing so.</P>
    <P>Under Section 9 of this Bill the Minister, by means of an order from the Custom House, can remove any county officer without even stating the reason.  It is usual that when people are appointed to high posts in the land there are certain safeguards inserted in the conditions of their appointment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="622" /> There are safeguards for each officer and, as a rule, nobody can be removed from office unless for misbehaviour, misconduct or some other grave reason. Section 9 (4) reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister may, by order under this sub-section, remove a person appointed under sub-section (3)  of this section and, for the purposes of that sub-section, there shall thereupon be a vacancy in the office of county officer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So that, after going to the trouble of having this officer appointed by the Appointments Commission in the usual way, the Minister, with one stroke of the pen, can terminate that appointment any time without even stating the reason.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>The section can be adverted to on the Committee Stage. I notice there has not been very enthusiastic support in the House for this measure.  The members of the Minister's Party have not shown any great interest in it; in fact I think only one member of that Party spoke in favour of it.  The same applies to some of the other Parties in the House. Since it is claimed that this measure has been brought in to remove what has been described by certain political speakers as a dictatorship from local affairs, one would think there would have been a display of enthusiasm here more than would be in evidence in connection with many other measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was listening to Deputy O'Higgins and other Deputies when they were speaking on this Bill.  They were trying to convey the impression that people had begun to take less and less interest in local government.  While they said that, nobody, so far as I could hear, adduced any evidence to prove it.  Before the last local elections the Minister and other spokesmen of the Coalition Government assured the electorate that they would do away with the county management system.  One would think then that if they were going to bring about anything like a revolution in local government <Col N="623" /> more people would have gone to the polls than, say, in the local elections in 1945 when there was no talk at all about changing the county management system.  In point of fact there was a heavier poll in 1945 in spite of the knowledge that the people had in the last local election that the county management system would be done away with and in spite of the promise that it would be abolished and and that what was described as democratic control would be restored to local councils.  The fact of the matter, of course, is that people have been taking as much interest in local government over the past ten years since the County Management Act was passed as they have ever taken.</P>
    <P>I am not one of those who would hold that the County Management Act of 1940 should not be amended.  There were certain desirable ways in which I thought it was necessary that that Act should be amended, but it is one thing to amend an Act and quite another thing to pretend that you are repealing an Act.  I hold that this is only a pretence at repealing the County Management Act.  I hold that it is nothing short of a deception and a delusion on the Irish people.  Much has been said about the taking away of some of the powers from the county officer.  From my reading of the Bill, I am inclined to think that it is largely a change in name and that instead of the &ldquo;reserved functions&rdquo; we will now call them the &ldquo;scheduled functions.&rdquo; Very few of the powers the county manager has at present are being taken away.  Even those that will be taken can be given back again by delegation.</P>
    <P>There is one power that is being given to the members of the local authority that I consider is very undesirable they should have.  It is not that I would be inclined to lean to the view that the members of our local bodies are not worthy of the position they occupy; but knowing human nature as we do, it is very wrong to leave the decision as to who should or who should not get home assistance, to the members of the council.  The system hitherto has been to have the <Col N="624" /> matter of home assistance examined by the appropriate officer, the home assistance officer, specially appointed for that job.  It is his duty to go round and find out exactly what the necessitous cases are and report accordingly to the county manager and, of course, to the county council. I presume that it must have been largely on the reports submitted to him that decisions were arrived at, as regards the payment of home assistance.  I wonder what the position will be now.  It has not been explained fully to us.  We are told that this question of home assistance will be decided by the members of the local authority.  Will they be in a position to ignore the reports of the home assistance officer any time they like?</P>
    <P>That would be a very bad position, especially when we look at another section where it is provided that, in the absence of a quorum at a meeting of an executive committee, the chairman or a member of the county council can decide a matter like this on his own, on the grounds of urgency.  What could flow from that is that one member could make it his business to be there and adjudicate on cases that may have come in from his own locality. That is a system which, in my opinion, could give rise to terrible abuse.  I am not saying that it will, but it could. We should, of course, do our utmost to safeguard the position against any possible contingencies.  It is a Bill that can be amended on committee stage, and there are certain sections and subsections to which we will have to put down amendments.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to refer again to the power the Minister has taken to remove a county officer from office.  I believe that, instead of being a step towards democracy, that section is a step away from democracy.  The county officer is entitled to his rights and safeguards as well as anybody else. Anyone, to be an effective officer, must have some guarantee that his position is unassailable, unless he himself gives cause for the position being otherwise. Here we have a provision whereby the Minister can remove a county officer without even stating a reason.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>The one thing I like about this Bill is the manner in which it is being discussed.  Practically every Deputy who has spoken has given an honest opinion as to how it will work and what good it will do.  Very little political heat has been dragged into it and it is my intention to act in the same way.  I will praise the measure where I think it worthy of praise and condemn it where I think it should be condemned.</P>
      <P>The managerial system, we all know, was never a desirable one.  I think that when it was first introduced, its object was to cut out any possibility of bribery or suchlike taking place with elected county councillors, but in doing this in the name of the Managerial Act we had vested in the county manager too much authority. No matter what anyone else may say, I maintain, as a member of a county council, that the interests of people in going forward to be county councillors was definitely knocked on the head. They realised that the county manager, having practically all the functions of the council under his control, could veto any decision of theirs whenever he liked.  For that reason, they did not present themselves for election in the way they should.  There may be a certain amount of good in the county managerial system, but it is certain that we cannot have it both ways.  We must have either a managerial system claiming wholly and entirely to have the authority vested in one single individual, or we must have a system whereby the elected representatives of the people will have the final determination in the matters that are essential and necessary with regard to county council affairs and the administration of the local council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion this Bill does not sufficiently clear up these matters.  That is one of the faults I have to find with it. In this measure there are certain functions vested in the county manager and there are certain functions vested in the elected representatives of the people.  The existence of these two sets of functions makes local government, in my opinion, more difficult. However, I will say that a certain amount of good will be done as a result <Col N="626" /> of this measure.  I think that like the Managerial Act passed some years ago this Bill is in reality an experiment on the part of the Minister and the Government for the purpose of finding out if a more progressive system can be introduced into county councils.  It may be an absolute failure because of the possibility of some degree of antagonism as between the powers held by the county manager on the one hand and by the county councils on the other. There may be delays in relation to matters that are both urgent and important. Possibly good progress will be made.  Possibly greater progress will be made than would be possible if all the powers were vested in the county council.  Possibly, there will be a greater degree of contentment amongst county councillors when they appreciate the fact that they have certain functions which they feel they can competently fulfil.</P>
    <P>We must admit that there is not a complete repeal of the county managerial system, and it is no use anyone saying that there is.  In the opinion of those of us who are members of local authorities, there are sufficient powers vested in the elected representatives to allow those representatives to carry out their duties successfully and make as rapid progress as possible.  We know that on county councils as a whole there are members who regard the county council chamber as some place in which to pass a few hours away.  We know there are members who never make any useful or constructive suggestions as to what should be done to alter the situation for the better.  We know that there are others who despite their divergent political affiliations, go there determined to work in the interests of the people who sent them there.  These members are definitely an asset to any body.</P>
    <P>It has been said on many occasions that representatives should be elected on their merits rather than because of their political affiliations.  But we know it is quite impossible to achieve that.  There are certain political Parties who are strong enough to get any man they want elected to a county council even though he may be no good in the council chamber.  That has <Col N="627" /> always happened and it will continue to happen.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in Sections 16 to 22 of this measure dealing with the formation of executive committees. We know that such committees can do very useful work.  I sincerely hope that when these committees come to be formed, no effort will be made by those political Parties which happen to be strong to squeeze out those who belong to Parties which are not quite so strong.  I sincerely hope that all sections of political opinion will be represented on these committees in the same way as they are represented on the county councils. Assuming we have an executive committee of one-third of the elected members of the council and a health committee of one-third of the elected members, that will give us two-thirds of all the elected members as members of the committees.  I think it is the duty of the members of the council to select those men who will give the best service on these committees.  When these members are graded out on each of the committees, there will then be one-third left.  As I said earlier, that one-third will consist of those who have very little interest in local affairs and who merely appear at meetings in order to see their names in the papers. Unfortunately, local papers sometimes give splash headlines to these particular members rather than to those who make concrete and constructive proposals at county council meetings.</P>
    <P>The success of the managerial system depended to a large extent on close co-operation between the county manager and the county council.  So far as my county is concerned, we never had any ground for complaint with regard to our county managers. The first county manager was a native of Mayo.  For years he had been secretary of the county council.  He was most co-operative and did his utmost to make the work successful, from the point of view of the county as a whole.  We have at the present time a county manager who includes even the most trivial items on the agenda so that the county council may have an opportunity of fully debating every matter and he leaves it almost entirely to the county council to decide. <Col N="628" /> Where there was co-operation between the county managers and the county councils the system was not as bad as it has been painted.  In those counties where co-operation did not exist, things admittedly did not run so smoothly.  I think it is not proper that local administration should hang on such a flimsy thread of democracy that it rests solely on the good will and personality of the county manager to make things pleasant for the county councils.  That was perhaps the biggest defect in the managerial system.  But in many counties county managers have proved themselves even more careful than was the county council in the matter of expenditure and the curtailing of extravagance.  We know that when councillors are elected for the first time they are full of enthusiasm and a whole series of questions appears on the agenda at every meeting.  If these demands were to be agreed to it would mean that an impossible burden would be placed on the local ratepayers and, from the financial point of view, the county would be put out of existence. But, as the councillors come to realise that there must be careful and cautious administration that kind of thing eases off.  We know that, in many cases, the county managers have advised and helped out local councils by opposing things which councillors themselves had looked for.  In other cases, county managers have definitely forced things on the county councils. That is something which the members of local bodies do not want and do not wish to have.</P>
    <P>I welcome the move under this Bill for the formation of executive committees which can instruct and cooperate with the county officer.  I became a member of the county council five years ago.  Even before that, I believed that men elected to local bodies by the votes of the people needed, in the matter of local administration, advice, instruction and help in many ways.  I believe they needed to be led gently along the lines which were best for efficiency and progress. I became a member of the county council in 1945 under the managerial system.  I found that while it had its good points, the system certainly had its bad points.  I felt that the thread <Col N="629" /> which held democracy was certainly too thin to be respected by anybody who had been elected to a local body by the votes of the people.  What we are to have now under this Bill is only an experiment.  The administration which we are to have in the future may be something which will give very little success.  From my knowledge and experience as a county councillor, I am of opinion that the formation of executive committees and health committees will definitely cut out a big amount of the talk that we used to have at every county council meeting. It will enable the agenda to be disposed of in a much shorter space of time.  Every county council has certain standing orders.  Under our standing orders in Mayo a county councillor has the right to speak for ten minutes on any item on the agenda.  If 30 members of a county council decided to exercise their right to speak for ten minutes on every item on the agenda, and, in addition, to speak in between on points of order, one can well realise that it would be impossible to deal with more than three or four items on the agenda. Therefore, I think the formation of these committees is a very good idea.</P>
    <P>With regard to the functions which are being given to the county officer, such as the selection of tenants, the making of lettings, the recovery of possession, the making of advances and the recovery of instalments of annuities in the case of mortgage payments, the revision and recovery of rent, the disposal of cottages and other dwellings, there are some of these functions which definitely should be taken out of the hands of county councillors and, if not vested in the county officer, should be vested in the county secretary.  I suppose that, in the course of time, the county officer will find himself in the position of county secretary.  Some other of these functions, however, should, in my opinion, be given into the hands of the elected representatives or of the executive committees. The selection of tenants is one.  That should be a function of the county councillors.  I admit that there is a certain amount of right in the system which now prevails whereby the county <Col N="630" /> medical officer of health inspects and makes a report on the conditions under which applicants for county council houses are living.  His first recommendation is given to a married man with a family living in a condemned house.  Then there is a grading down of the other applicants.  Perhaps there is a certain amount of right in giving into the hands of such an officer the power to make recommendations. But there is also a certain amount of wrong in it, because any single individual officer can and will make mistakes. Such officers have been known to do so.  From time to time we have seen applicants who were successful in getting cottages although they were in no way entitled to them.  The county council could not question that in the past.  Seemingly, it cannot question it in the future because the selection of tenants under Section 25, Part IV. of this Bill, is a reserved function of the county officer.  I think that is wrong.  I think that the local councillors should have some say in that.  They know the local conditions; they know all the applicants for houses perhaps even better than the county officer or the county medical officer of health.  They should have some say as to who should or should not be the tenant of a cottage, because there are many things to be looked into with regard to the tenancy of houses.</P>
    <P>A tenant might be selected because the house he was living in was in a very bad condition, but side by side with him there might be another man who had an equally good claim to a cottage and who did not succeed in getting it.  There may be a vast difference in the character of these two people.  One may be an individual who will take care of the county council house, who will respect the local authority which built the house for him, who will see that the house is kept clean, neat, tidy and in good repair, and who will make every possible effort to pay his rent and rates at the time demanded.  The county councillor for the area will definitely know the best type of tenant for a house.  The county officer or the county medical officer of health will not.  In the case of two applicants for <Col N="631" /> a house they will take them at their face value.  Therefore, I say that the county councillor for the locality will know the best and most suitable individual for a house.  For these reasons I think that the selection of tenants for cottages should be given back into the hands of the county councillors.  They are the elected representatives of the people, and are at least entitled to that concession, now that the county managerial system is being amended.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see Section 42 in the Bill which deals with the financial affairs of the county councils.  Before any financial proposal is passed finally, the elected members will have an opportunity of debating the merits or demerits of it.  The councillors will have a say in the amount of money that is to be provided.  If the county officer presents an estimate which the councillors think is too extravagant or too costly, then both the executive committee and the council as a whole can veto it or turn it down.  They can see that a more reasonable estimate will be submitted, one which the county council and the ratepayers as a whole can meet, and so ensure that unreasonable rate demands will not be made on them.</P>
    <P>There is one other section which I think requires some tightening up.  Sub-section (3) of Section 36 states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where a draft of an executive order is submitted under sub-section (2) of this section, the executive authority may either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  make the order in the terms of the draft, or</P>
    <P>(b)  amend the draft and make the order in the terms of the draft as amended, or</P>
    <P>(c) reject the draft.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again I am hoping that there will be co-operation between the county officer and the county councillors who are the executive authority but would it not be much easier, if something could be done to arrive at some sort of understanding between the county officer and the members of the executive authority before the draft was presented?  What <Col N="632" /> is the use of wasting days of the time of the county officer and his staff in making a series of orders and presenting them to the executive authority who can either accept the orders, amend them or reject the whole lot, if they might never need to do that?  If, perhaps, the chairman or the vice-chairman of the executive authority concerned could be brought along when the orders were being prepared so that he could discuss them with the county officer, it would be much easier to present a suitable set of orders to the executive authority and it might obviate a serious loss of time as there would be no necessity in that case for the executive authority to amend the orders in any way or reject them.</P>
    <P>The only further comment which I have to make on this Bill is that it definitely does not provide for the complete abolition of the county managerial system.  We are all old enough to realise that the Bill presented to us is just an amending piece of legislation. I suppose had I not been a member of a county council for some years, and had I not some experience of the delay in disposing of a county council agenda, even when a meeting lasts throughout the whole day, I might be inclined to say that the county managerial system, and everything pertaining to it, should be rooted out lock, stock and barrel and that every function of local government should be entrusted to the county councils&mdash;employment, the selection of tenants, and every duty that would normally come within the scope of a local authority.  In all fairness, it must be realised by all those who have had any experience as members of a local authority that if these matters were again all thrown on the county councils agendas, you would have overloaded agendas and the county council business would fall into such arrears that it would take practically three days out of every week to conclude the business.  It may be argued that from 1898 onwards, until we got the County Management Act in 1943, it was easy to dispose of this business within a reasonable time, but whether it is because of the growing interest in politics, or that there are more social services to be administered or perhaps because of the <Col N="633" /> fact that a much greater amount of money is now being spent by county councils than in former years, the agendas are now so overloaded that it takes councils a long time to get through them.</P>
    <P>While I would say that, to my mind, this Bill is just an experiment, I shall not say that it is the best piece of legislation or even the worst piece of legislation that could be introduced into this House.  At most, it will provide us with trial of the new system or the amended system.  It is up to the county councils to try to make it a success by electing to the executive committees the cream of the county councillors so that there will be a businesslike consideration of the more important business and an avoidance of obstructive tactics.  If the county officer will cooperate with intelligent county councillors, I have no doubt that we shall have efficient local administration which, in many cases, is just as important as the administration that is directed from this House.  If that co-operation is not forthcoming and if intelligence rather than mere talk and noise is not the guiding principle in discussions, you will have all kinds of delays.  You will have men arguing the whole day with regard to the name, perhaps, of a certain line of cottages or houses, or as to whether a £10 note should be spent on a certain waterworks or sewerage scheme while, at the same time they forget that it costs perhaps £100 to summon a meeting of the council.  If, however, common sense prevails and it is recognised that this is a go-between Bill, which may satisfy the wishes not alone of the county council officials but of the county councillors, if it is worked satisfactorily, I think that if we do not have quite perfect administration, we shall at least have satisfactory administration.  At least the Bill is worth a trial until we see if anything better can be done in the years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I read this Bill in the first instance I was more than surprised at its contents, particularly in view of the attitude taken up by certain members of the Opposition, not alone in the general election of 1948, but for years as <Col N="634" /> members of county councils since the County Management Act first came into operation.  I never had the privilege of being a member of a public body prior to the introduction of the managerial system.</P>
      <P>At the time I became a member of a public body the managerial system had been in operation for some years and because of that I think I could see in better perspective the value of that system than the members who had been members of former boards of health or boards of guardians for 20 or 25 years previously.  Since I became a member I invariably found that any and every opportunity was taken by certain representatives to belittle the system and speak sarcastically of it. I do not believe for a moment that they expressed themselves so because of the effect the system had on local administration.  I believe that they were influenced solely by the fact that since the system came into operation they were shorn of certain responsibilities and shorn of a certain halo which surrounded them in the area they represented for 25 or 30 years previously.  I am always prepared to make allowance for the fact that they were not really honest when they made adverse comments on the County Management Act and that they were simply suffering from the loss of that halo which had surrounded them for so many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the managerial system is a very good system.  In my experience there has always been co-operation from the county manager.  The last speaker referred to the outstanding co-operation which obtains in his own county between the county manager and the members of the county council and I can say the same for the county in which I am a member of a local authority.  If there is non-co-operation in any shape or form&mdash;and I do not suggest that there is&mdash;it certainly does not come from the county manager. In fact, the individual concerned is inclined, in my opinion, to go a little too far to shed himself of certain responsibilities which he should shoulder and to leave it to the members of the council to decide matters which are his functions.  Because of an overanxiety to meet the wishes of the <Col N="635" /> council he is prepared to do those things.  I do not agree with that shedding of his functions and I have told him that.  However, I only mention that matter to show that there is co-operation there.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposed change of the name of the manager to county officer or eventually to county secretary surely the Minister does not expect that the people will take that seriously or think that it will make any financial or material difference in the work or responsibility of that individual. I think it was the Parliamentary Secretary who said that the word &ldquo;manager&rdquo; smacked of dictatorship. I do not think that is correct.  The word is in the English dictionary for as long as I can read or write and is used in businesses and industries of every type and I think that that argument will not affect the public.  However, something had to be done.  Some change had to be made to justify the attitude taken up by certain members of boards of health, particularly by members of the Labour Party, the Minister's own Party.</P>
    <P>I am not quite clear about the amalgamation of the two positions of county officer and county secretary presuming that position becomes vacant although I tried to read the Bill as best I could.  One point struck me: at the moment the county manager holds a certain responsibility.  It is a one-man job and a job which entails quite a large amount of that man's time.  It is a job which varies in different counties.  In my own county he has to deal with three urban councils while in some adjoining county he may have to deal with as many and at the same time deal with a mental hospital.  That is enough responsibility for any individual to have on his shoulders but now it is proposed that when the county secretaryship becomes vacant he will take over the position either as county officer or county secretary&mdash;the change cannot take place without his permission.  There we have a man being saddled with two very responsible positions and how in the name of God is it expected that that man will carry out the work which <Col N="636" /> two men did heretofore?  I agree that the Bill states that he may appoint an assistant county secretary or some such officer but what will be the difference financially so far as the ratepayers are concerned between having a county officer and a county secretary and having a county officer responsible for the work in connection with those jobs who must employ an assistant? Surely there is nothing to be gained in that from the point of view of the ratepaying community.  The only thing I see in it is that added responsibility will be placed on the shoulders of the county officer or county secretary whichever he may be.</P>
    <P>It is proposed also to appoint an executive committee and a health committee from the members of the county council, both of which committees will have certain functions.  So far as the proposed executive committee is concerned, it will deal with certain matters appertaining to council affairs, but some of the matters with which it might deal are matters which are not going to make any material difference. So far as the health committee is concerned, the matter of home assistance will naturally arise in that connection. It is at present in the hands of the county manager, but, in our council, the members of a particular electoral area are occasionally called together to meet the county assistance officers, the local home assistance officer and, at times, the county manager, and at these meetings the list of people in receipt of home assistance is gone through, so that each councillor, if representations have been made to him, can make his case for a particular individual. The manager or county assistance officer may or may not agree, but the very fact that these members are called together is proof that the manager is interested in giving a certain power to the members of the council representing that electoral area to express their views on the question of who should get so much and who should not.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the provision with regard to transferring powers from the county manager to the members of the council.  I think that is wrong.  As I have explained, in my county, we are occasionally called together and every <Col N="637" /> opportunity is given to the members from a particular electoral area to make a case for or against an individual application for an increase.  In some cases, I can say that the revision which has taken place has been in the form of a decrease, due perhaps to representations made by the local assistance officer.  It is altogether wrong to give that power to the council.  The manager should have the last say in that matter, because the average councillor is inclined to be tenderhearted and anxious to make as good a case as he can for the particular applicant.  The manager, on the other hand, has so much money at his disposal to meet the council commitments for the year and he must ensure that nothing over and above what would be fair will be granted to any particular individual.</P>
    <P>I think these powers should not be given to the council, but that the present position&mdash;I am speaking for County Wicklow&mdash;whereby home assistance is revised from time to time at meetings of the councillors for the particular area with the county manager and county assistance officer should be allowed to remain.  It will certainly tend towards a better understanding and will also prevent anything in the nature of abuse taking place, as will be possible if the provisions of the Bill are implemented.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly again to the two committees.  I believe these committees are a mistake and my first reason for saying that is that the system of election on which these committees will be elected is the system of proportional representation.  It is quite possible that the same seven members could be elected&mdash;there is nothing in the Bill to say that they could not&mdash;to the executive committee and the health committee.  I will go further and say that, even if a council decided to elect 14 of its members&mdash; seven on each committee&mdash;it would be wrong.  What are we to do with the other seven members?  Are they to be looked upon as seven individuals who are unworthy of election to a committee to help to administer the affairs of the county, a function for which a section of the electors elected them? <Col N="638" /> That is all wrong, and, if we are to have two committees, some system should be devised whereby every member of a council would be a member of one or other committee.  Even if things were done in an equitable way and if 14 members of the council are appointed to the two committees, it would be a grievous mistake to defranchise not alone the remaining seven members personally but the electors who sent them there to represent them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Commons referred to the powers still retained by the county officer with reference to the allocation of cottages.  I do not agree with Deputy Commons's view at all.  I believe that the present system obtaining in some counties should still obtain.  In my county, when a cottage becomes vacant or new cottages have to be allocated, even though a certain individual may have made an application to have a cottage built and have got a site voluntarily from a farmer because he was a decent sort of individual who would not abuse the privilege of having a site on the land or interfere with the farmer's land or fences, when the cottages are advertised the represenatives of the electoral area are called together to meet the chief officer in charge of housing.  We go into the different applications.  We have a list showing the county medical officer's views from the point of view of priority and we support the views of the county medical officer except when some councillor may have some information that may not have been brought to the notice of the county medical officer when he made his survey.  Except when such a point can be raised by such a councillor, we invariably support the county medical officer so far as the tenancy of the house is concerned.  We make a recommendation in the matter and I can say that the county manager, so far as I know, has never yet turned down a single recommendation in regard to the allocation of cottages made by the councillors concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Commons said that councillors would know more about the position of the applicants than the county medical officer or any other officer.  The county medical officer is <Col N="639" /> supposed to examine the living and other conditions of the applicants.  I am sure that not alone does he examine the living conditions of the applicants but that he also makes inquiries into the health of the family, if there is a family.  When it comes to a question of who should know whether a particular individual is entitled to a cottage or to be placed No. 1 on the list, I am sure the county medical officer is the best judge.</P>
    <P>As to the question of the striking of the rate under this Bill, the county officer, having prepared his estimate, will place it before the executive committee and the health committee.  It is quite possible that the executive committee may revise the estimate so far as it applies to their functions.  It may happen also that the health committee may revise it in connection with the functions they have to deal with. I can visualise that estimate being brought before both committees and before the council seven or eight times before the council finally are in a position to strike the rate.  If I am correct in visualising such a position, surely that will not make for efficiency and quick arrival at the actual figure necessary to carry out the local services in the county.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, there is very little of a controversial nature in the estimates. There are salaries and wages, the repayment of loans, and other things that are a fixture for which money must be produced.  The area within which a discussion can take place with regard to the cutting down of the estimate or otherwise is very limited.  Nevertheless, it can take quite a long time, and there is a possibility that under this arrangement it may take seven or eight meetings before the council are finally called upon to determine the rate.  In County Wicklow we have an estimates meeting and the council generally appoints a sub-committee to go into the details of the estimate to see whether or not it can be reduced.  The sub-committee make their recommendations to the council and, as a rule, it only takes one meeting to arrive at a decision whereby the rate can be struck, or three meetings in all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="640" /> In conclusion, I say that this Bill makes no great change.  The change of name means nothing, and certainly the public are not going to be affected by it.  I do not believe that the proposed amalgamation of offices, when such an amalgamation can take place, will be effective in making any financial saving for the ratepayers.  Surely, coming from a Labour Minister&mdash;particularly as the Labour Party were the greatest offenders so far as the county managerial system is concerned&mdash;they have nothing to boast of in the few changes they have made in this Bill.  I think that the general public, when they come to understand the changes that have been made, will place a true value on the condemnation, sarcasm, and other methods adopted by critics of the managerial system, and particularly by the Labour Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member not long in public life, but as one who has had experience in the county council of the working of the County Management Act&mdash;of course, I have had no experience of the system which was in operation previous to that Act&mdash;I am willing to face this problem to-night in a realistic and open-minded manner. Apparently those members of this House who are now in Opposition fail to realise that the action taken by the Labour Party is one which we believe will help to bring about a more satisfactory method of Government, local and national, in this country.  I believe that, after roughly eight years' experience of the working of the County Management Act, the action of the Labour Party and the statements made by the members of the Labour Party on the introduction of that Act, and since then, have been fully justified. Those of us in the Party of which I am a member did not say that the old system was a thoroughly satisfactory system, but that did not mean that we should agree whole-heartedly with another system, a system which we believed contained many flaws.  In as brief a way as possible I propose to show Deputy Brennan and other Deputies in this House points which have justified the condemnation of at least part of the system of county management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="641" /> To commence with, I should like to say that I abhor some of the statements made by a county Cork man, Deputy Corry.  He spoke about the disappointment which some of the new members elected to the county councils will experience when they find out that they are not going to get their share of the thousands of pounds&mdash;as mentioned by him&mdash;that doctors and others will be giving for local appointments and such various appointments.  It ill-becomes any member&mdash;I do not wish to speak in the Deputy's absence&mdash;to talk about something which I believe to be false in its entirety.  Thanks be to God we have not come to the Tammany Hall stage in this country.  We can be honest with ourselves.  We admit that in the past there may have been transgressors. There may have been people who acted contrary to the standards of the majority, but who can say that that has not applied in all the countries of the world?  Who can say that anyone in this country, even the worst, is or ever was as corrupt as some of the worst in other countries? Therefore, our approach to this Bill must be open.  We must speak openly of the things which we believe require to be remedied, and at the same time ensure that any provisions which in the past have proved themselves to be successful will be embodied in this measure.</P>
    <P>The ex-Minister for Local Government, Deputy MacEntee, dealt with the original Act and it is only natural that he should do so.  I do not know whether he would now, if he were in a position to do so&mdash;having realised some of the shortcomings of the Act which he introduced in this House&mdash;agree to have it amended in certain respects. Perhaps he would, but there is no point in our dealing with that matter now. I believe we can prove without any hesitation that the improvements in some sections of this present Bill are such that they are well worth considering and supporting to the full.</P>
    <P>I took a note of some of the statements the Minister made when he moved the Second Reading.  He said, among other things, that it was considered that the present system needed to be abolished and replaced by a new system of administration, and he used <Col N="642" /> the words: &ldquo;to restore democratic control and at the same time maintain efficiency.&rdquo;  When the Minister mentioned the abolition of the present system and its replacement by a new system, that did not mean that we were to scrap in its entirety the old system. Surely, if we believe in progress we must admit that many of the various measures in the past have in themselves justified our inclusion of them in any Bill brought before us.</P>
    <P>One point stands out above all others in connection with the County Management Act.  That Act might have been a better Act if the managers had been appointed as managers to the council instead of being made managers of the council.  That in itself makes an extraordinary difference.  It gave the managers in the various county councils a different outlook on their duties and responsibilities both towards local administration and towards the Minister of State who put them in their positions.  Like many other Deputies, I am glad to be able to say that in County Cork the man who was appointed county manager proved to be excellent in his position because he had vast experience of local Government work, which is so essential to the good running of local institutions and local county councils. However, we can realise the great difficulty in which a county manager must, at times, find himself.  If a local county council unanimously recommend a certain course to a manager that manager may be willing to adopt their recommendation and it may be his firm conviction that the course recommended is wise.  Yet we must be very frank and admit that that county manager has as his boss a Minister who is in charge of a Government Department.  Human nature being what it is, we must admit that if we ourselves were in the position of the county manager we would have to face the problem whether it would be easier for us or safer for us, as human beings, to offend the local councillors or to offend our boss in Dublin.  That is one of the fundamental points governing the introduction of the position of county manager.  Some of the Opposition Deputies may say that there is no difference whether he is called a <Col N="643" /> county manager or a county officer. There is the old saying, what is in a name?  I believe it is immaterial by what name he is called.  It is not in the individual or the name, but it is in the system under which he is operating that we must be interested. It is ridiculous to waste time arguing as to the name by which this official should be called.</P>
    <P>I can recall an occasion when the Cork county manager, at the express wish of the county council, sent a recommendation to the Minister for Local Government in connection with the permanent appointment of an official who had given the best years of his life in a certain position in the county council since 1917.  There was never anything held against that man.  The county manager was at all times particular to see that any recommendation sent up would be a genuine one.  What happened?  I do not wish to be sarcastic or vindictive because that does not get us very far.  The plain truth is that, because the man who was recommended did not suit the Minister in charge or the views he held, he was refused permanancy.  I am proud to say that one of the first actions taken by the late Minister for Local Government, Mr. T. J. Murphy, was to make sure that he would carry out the express wishes of the members of the Cork County Council and the county manager by appointing that man to the permanent position to which he was entitled.  Deputies may ask why I lay such stress on this matter.  It is because I want Deputies clearly to understand the false position a manager could be in at times simply because he was appointed manager of the council instead of manager to the council.</P>
    <P>During the debate on this Bill, Deputies referred to some of the matters that are embodied in the County Management Act.  Deputy MacEntee said that circulars were sent out in his time as Minister to members of local authorities dealing with their particular duties and the importance of their discharging them.  That sounds well.  I give him credit for sending them out although, for the last year or so, some members have been objecting to all the circulars that were sent out.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="644" /> Deputy MacEntee's references to circulars recalled to my mind a certain circular that was sent out to county managers by their boss in the Custom House which had to be transmitted to every servant of the local authority, even to caretakers of local graveyards who, in some cases were in receipt of £4 a year for carrying out that work. The circular was to the effect that they were forbidden, by the express order of the Minister, under the County Management Act, to approach a local councillor in connection with their work or remuneration.  That was bringing the local authority, through the county manager, into the network of espionage, more or less, so far as the work of local authorities is concerned, namely, the Custom House.  Surely Deputy MacEntee should never have agreed to such a circular being sent out.  He should realise that the men elected to the county council should be in a position to deal with men employed locally in very small jobs. Deputy Brennan and others may disagree with me but I believe that that is one point in connection with which the County Management Act must be condemned.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee mentioned another matter which Deputy Corry answered in his own way.  Deputy Corry said that the Cork County Council were fairly well advanced.  We do not always get credit for that.  He said that we had not waited for the introduction of this Bill to appoint sub-committees in Cork.  It is quite true for Deputy Corry to say that under the County Management Act we had sub-committees in Cork.  Unfortunately, when Deputy Corry painted the rosy picture, showing how we were able to surmount such difficulties, he forgot to mention one fact.  It is well for members who seem to rejoice in speaking in derogatory tones about the Labour Minister who is introducing this Bill and the members of the Labour Party to remember that it was Labour members, and Labour members only, who, in the Cork County Council, proved completely and conclusively that they had the right to form sub-committees. That is going on the record of the House and can be proved at any time. <Col N="645" /> It took a while before the county manager&mdash;a man who was anxious to co-operate with them&mdash;was able to find out definitely that his boss in the Custom House could give him that power.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee said, in the course of this debate, that if county councils did not elect sub-committees, it was their own fault.  Deputy MacEntee may never have been a member of a local authority, but some of us who are members of local authorities must admit that, as laymen, we cannot peruse every Bill that comes before us and scan every point in it.  It takes a certain period of training to enable a person to interpret legislation.  If Deputy MacEntee was anxious to ensure that county councils would form sub-committees, he would have acted as the present Minister is acting; he would have instructed them and told them of their obligation to form these executive committees.  Deputy Brennan, on the one hand, tells us that it is waste of time to have executive committees.  He says there is a danger of meetings being held one after the other without any conclusion being arrived at.  On the other hand, Deputy Corry admits that in Cork County Council we proved our right to form executive committees, and he indicated the advantage of them.  There must have been an advantage because, after the last local election, sub-committees were again appointed.</P>
    <P>If Deputies are sincere in their approach to this Bill, their criticism should be constructive.  We all know that this will not be the end of local government legislation.  This in itself may be just a sort of passing measure and in years to come whoever may be then in power may see certain advantages in picking from this legislation certain sections and including them in whatever proposals they may see fit to present in their time.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee mentioned the failure of certain county councils to appoint committees.  Perhaps it is too late in the day to deal with that now, but when the County Management Act was introduced he could have sent <Col N="646" /> circulars&mdash;and he sent enough of them to members in his time&mdash; to the managers that he employed in connection with the various councils pointing out to them that such committees should be formed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan and other Deputies spoke in a tone which in itself was good.  They were able to point out the advantages that could be derived under their own managers, but it is not for us to say that because there is a good manager in one county we should condemn the councils in another county who might not have quite as good managers.</P>
    <P>The question of home assistance was referred to by Deputy Brennan.  I do not wish to dwell too much on the new powers that are proposed.  There is no need for me to do so, because so many Deputies have already discussed that point.  I will say to Deputy Brennan that if his manager did discuss home assistance with some members of the council, that sort of thing did not apply in all the Twenty-Six Counties.  If he and the members of his council had that advantage, is there any reason why they should oppose a system whereby the members of every council in the Twenty-Six Counties would have the same right?  That is, again, one of the points that, if we are honest in our contribution towards this measure, we will have to admit; we must admit that the present system does need remedying, and very much so.</P>
    <P>Again, as regards the powers of members of county councils and the functions reserved to the county manager, while I am at all times anxious to leave out personalities I will have to speak honestly and I will rely on my own experience. Deputies here have told us of the ideal system whereby cottages were let.  We have heard Deputies telling us of the terrible corruption in the past in regard to the letting of cottages. I know men who were members of county councils in the past.  I have heard Deputies tell of the huge fortunes that were supposed to have been made in the past.  I cannot make out why some of these men, after giving the best years of their lives serving on local councils, are not a hell of a lot <Col N="647" /> better off to-day.  The majority of these men are entitled to this much credit, that they gave their time honestly and conscientiously and they acted in a decent manner.</P>
    <P>As regards the letting of cottages, I can recall at least three cases where, to be quite honest, the system of giving a certain applicant the right of tenancy to a cottage was, to speak easily about it, at least shady.  We know that these things happened in the past.  We know that the county medical officer of health, while meaning to do his best and trying to do his best, was deluded in certain cases and certain information was given by applicants which was false.  On one occasion I gave definite proof in that respect to our assistant manager.  In Cork, as well as a manager we have assistant managers. I remember putting my proof on the table before the assistant manager at one meeting and I showed that the information given to the county medical officer of health was not correct.</P>
    <P>I asked for one thing, and that was that the doctor should be given the power to go out again and check up on the information that was given by me. What happened?  The truth is that because the assistant manager had made his decision, had signed his name to an order&mdash;an order which he had full right to make&mdash;the majority of the members agreed with him.  They were afraid to oppose the action of the assistant manager, just as he would be afraid to offend his boss in Dublin. The majority of the members at the meeting found it suitable to keep in with the assistant manager and they supported the false claims of applicants for cottages.</P>
    <P>It is true that there have been different cases of corruption under the old system and I say there were also cases of grave mistakes in relation to the letting of cottages.  I believe those things in themselves should be sufficient to make Deputies think deeply when they are dealing with the County Management Act.</P>
    <P>An important point in connection with this Bill is whether the members will or will not have the right to see the doctor's report at an ordinary meeting of the board of health before <Col N="648" /> the manager lets a cottage.  I believe the system whereby a doctor makes a report and the manager makes the orders is a good one, but there is this point to be considered, that at the present time the manager, after getting the doctor's report, can make his order and sign, seal and deliver the cottage to a certain applicant.  I do not altogether agree with that procedure. I believe the proper system would be that the doctor's report should be placed before the members at the board of health meeting and, if there are any members who can show reason to doubt the accuracy of the report, then that report should be sent back to the doctor by the manager so that the circumstances can again be investigated.  If that type of system were to prevail, it would be a definite improvement, and on that point alone there would be justification for repealing the County Management Act.</P>
    <P>On the question of county officers, Deputy Allen seemed somewhat worried.  I am sorry that he allowed himself to worry so much about it.  In his view this Bill is likely to interfere with the status of county managers. There is one point I see in the present Bill, that financially it does not interfere with the county managers.  If we are honest in our expression of views, we must admit that the salary of the county manager is not interfered with.</P>
    <P>There are faults in the Act and also, perhaps, in this Bill before the House, but the county officers should realise&mdash;and they can only realise it by the Minister letting them understand clearly&mdash;the necessity for full co-operation in bringing at all times to a final conclusion matters of local administration in their own areas, without having to send to Dublin to have every tittle-tattle sanctioned by a Minister.  Naturally, matters of policy and appointments to posts which come under the Commission must go up, and that is clearly understood.  I am anxious that the Minister give us a clear indication now, or on the Committee Stage, that the time has come to finish with a lot of red tape in sending up to Dublin for permission for every little thing that comes before the council.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="649" /> A question was mentioned by Deputy Corry about the various functions. Whether it was convenient or not for the Opposition I do not know, but they did wish to gloss over any advantages that may be handed back to the council.  I see one function under the executive functions which is an advantage, the question of cottage repairs. This is important to members who may not be members of local authorities. Under the County Management Act, what happened over cottage repairs? We just saw the manager's order signed, giving the contract for certain repairs to a certain contractor.  I remember on occasions inquiring about it and was told that this to some degree was a reserved function.  While he was carrying it out, we spent money very often in a bad and inefficient manner.  Contractors who got work on repairs of various cottages undercut others, capable men, and actually the final position was that these houses were never repaired properly. The money was squandered in inefficient and incomplete repairs, and then the county manager was able to leave on the shoulders of the members of the local authority the responsibility which he was able to avoid.  When we went around the country, we had to face the complaints, the fully justified complaints, of cottiers&mdash;who often brought us to their homes and pointed out the necessity of repairs and often showed us truly the incompleted repairs and places where houses which had been repaired were actually as bad as if they had never been repaired.  We members of the local authority had then to accept defeat, as it were, under that old system.</P>
    <P>Surely, members of the Opposition, intelligent men, are honest in their outlook from the local authority viewpoint. After all, down the country, though we may differ politically on various questions&mdash;and we are entitled to take our own political Party line&mdash; at least the majority arrive at a conclusion which is an honest, fair and genuine judgment on what is needed. Here in this House, however, those opposite are adopting a system that reminds me of that great ventriloquist, with that great little dummy of his, Charlie McCarthy in America.  Deputy <Col N="650" /> MacEntee is the man who introduced this important County Management Act of theirs, and as he sits in their midst, and because their leader calls the tune and says: &ldquo;Boys, we must stand by our system,&rdquo; they are put unfortunately in the false position of having to belie much of what they say down the country.  They are put in the false position of having to say here very often in connection with the County Management Act the reverse of what they have said down the country. That is a difficulty we are in in our approach to this Bill.  It would certainly be worth while for members in opposition here as well as those in favour to realise that it is only by getting the genuinely concentrated views of all members that we can approach a proper system of local government.  However, as long as this miserable Party outlook continues in dealing with local administration and the everyday life of people down the country, so long will people be false to the genuine ideals of suitable local administration for this country.</P>
    <P>I might mention, as regards advantages in executive functions, the number of houses to be erected and, finally, the approval for sanitary services, water supply schemes, sewerage schemes, etc.  First, regarding the number of houses to be erected, what is the position under the County Management Act?  I know it, as Deputy Corry knows it full well, perhaps better than I do, and as every member of a local authority knows it.  For the last couple of years we have been trotting around the county down in Cork trying to build new houses and new cottages for our people.  Though we at times can prove the genuine number of applicants for houses, we are tied to a written report by a local dispensary doctor or county medical officer, who may state that the number requiring houses is much less than we say.  Local members have local knowledge, as has been admitted here.</P>
    <P>We had an extraordinary instance in recent years, where our late Minister gave us the right to build for newlyweds and enabled us to extend our activities as regards the number of houses to be built.  But the County Management Act provided that the <Col N="651" /> doctor's report came in before him and it was given very often more consideration than the views of local members. Most of the county officers and dispensary doctors have done their duty, but I know a case where a local dispensary doctor did not even call to inspect a supposedly condemned house. Therefore, the provision which gives to the members the right to decide the number of houses to be erected, under the executive functions, is an advantage. Is that not at least one step forward in amending the County Management Act?  Deputy Corry, being chairman of a local board of health, was always anxious as I was, to see the full number of houses allocated and built, but we were very often tied up by an unsatisfactory report from a local doctor.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is the question of approval of sanitary services, water supply schemes, sewerage schemes, etc.  I have an idea that Deputy Corry may say: &ldquo;Ah, we are doing that at present; are we not doing it in Cork?&rdquo; It is true that we are.  Month after month we have motions down asking or improved water supplies and additional sanitary, sewerage and other services.  These motions are nothing more than a recommendation to our assistant county manager asking him if he will agree to the provision of these supplies.  The members of the local authority, who are there at the express wish of the people, must go cap in hand to this paid official and ask him: &ldquo;Sir, dear Sir, will you please give us a water supply.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is at least satisfactory to know that once this Bill becomes law members of local authorities will be in a stronger position to implement the expressed wishes and desires of those who put them on that council in a more genuinely democratic manner than has been the fashion in the past. There are shortcomings in every Act of Parliament.  This Bill is in itself an advance on the County Management Act.  Certain Deputies have spoken very glibly about a Labour Party Minister introducing this Bill and they have spoken very glibly about the failure of the Labour Party to face <Col N="652" /> up to its responsibilities.  If those Deputies would approach these matters in the conscientious way that the members of the Labour Party approach them, they would have no need to worry about their political future.  They would never again have to swallow their pride and their words, as one of their Party had to do on one occasion when, having expressly supported a certain motion and made it quite clear that he intended to do so and that his vote would be cast on this side of the House subsequently, when his leader came in, cast his vote on that side of the House.</P>
    <P>It is my duty as a representative of the people in my constituency to point out the advantages which will result from this measure.  Under this measure local representatives will have a final say.  Deputy Smith stated that he had never heard any complaints about the County Management Act.  I do not intend to damn any political party; nor shall I say that it was because of the failure of the County Management Act that the last Government suffered defeat.  The time will always come when every government must suffer its first, and perhaps its last, defeat.  It is the people who decide.  When the people decided against the County Management Act it was then the responsibility of both the Government and the Opposition to face up to the position and to introduce legislation to bring about any improvements the people thought desirable or necessary.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat worried about Section 22 where it is stated&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;a decision which relates to home assistance in a particular case forms all or part of the business to be transacted at the meeting ... the chairman of the authority, if he is present, shall by himself alone, constitute a quorum,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>or, if he is not there, the county officer may act.  I believe that that section will require some amendment between this and the Committee Stage.  I do not think any chairman of a subcommittee or any county officer should be entitled to the powers which may be <Col N="653" /> conferred on him under that section. It might be that the majority of the council members might be engaged on public business elsewhere, and the chairman could arrange to have a meeting during their absence.  If the section dealt only with home assistance the position might be safeguarded, but it specifically says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;a decision which relates to home assistance in a particular case forms all or part of the business.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will look into that matter between this and the Report Stage.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I have taken up so much time, but I have tried to place constructive views before the House without any political rancour.  I think that we should give the Minister the fullest co-operation we can on this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Keyes) Michael Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Keyes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to a great number of speeches on the Second Reading of this measure.  Luckily that sense of humour with which Deputy MacEntee credited me in the early stages of the debate prepared me for the charges which were hurled at me by the Opposition&mdash; nepotism, bluff, chicanery and graft. All the adjectives in the dictionary were exhausted in accusing both myself and the Government of the frauds we are alleged to be inflicting upon the House in asking it to pass this measure.  Right through the debate there was very little constructive criticism.  There was, on the other hand, a constant spate of accusation that the Bill was unworthy of being introduced; that it was not what it was cracked up to be; that it was introduced under false pretences, and that it neither removed nor repealed the County Management Act.  It was said that the Bill should have amended the County Management Act but that it did not in fact do so.  Again, it was said that it went too far.  There has thus been a series of contradictory criticisms.  The bulk of the contributions to the debate gave tangible evidence of the fact that those who spoke had not even read the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="654" /> As the previous speaker had said, this is a measure of prime importance to the life of the country.  In my opinion it is one of the most important that could be introduced dealing with local administration, and it is certainly worthy of very serious consideration by every Deputy, and every Deputy should approach it in a reasonable and calm fashion.</P>
    <P>If my proposals do not meet with the approval of members of the House they are entitled to criticise them, but I suggest they should criticise them constructively.  While I have taken part in many discussions in this House, I have never indulged in political barrage and so I think I have reason to object to the titles that have been applied to me and to my Government of corruption, graft, chicanery and deceit.  For the number of years I have been in public life, for a period of more than a quarter of a century, I have myself taken an active interest in local government.  I have been a member of the oldest Corporation in the country and was mayor of the city before we had any managerial system. One of the things which, I think, we can pride ourselves on is the wonderful advance that has been made by the Irish people in self-government.  In view of the fact that for a period of nearly a century and a quarter we were deprived of the right of native government, we can, I think, pride ourselves on the wonderful and successful approach which has been made to national government by our own people.  I consider that, linked with successful national government, is local government which so intimately affects the everyday life of the people.</P>
    <P>I participated in local government before the Management Act was passed and also under the managerial system, and neither in this House nor outside of it, have I ever made a personal attack upon any manager.  I have never said a word against the individuals who took office as managers under the system, but I did object to the principle of that Act.  I think that these gentlemen have given very good service and are capable of giving <Col N="655" /> very good service under the new conditions. But, because I have introduced a Bill which is not in accordance with the expectations of the Opposition, it is denounced as being a deceitful and fraudulent Bill.  Some Deputies would seem to expect that in order to effect a successful repeal of the management system you must extirpate, liquidate or bump off the managers. I have no intention of introducing anything of such a revolutionary highly colourful nature.  My intention is simply to try and improve local government legislation, as I know it, and to make it an effective and efficient machine, while at the same time ensuring that there will be a certain amount of democratic control exercised by the elected representatives of the people.  I do not want to do anything of a spectacular nature, and I am not repealing this Act in any spirit of vindictiveness.</P>
    <P>Charges have been made that this Bill does not warrant or justify the title of repeal, and by putting side by side with it utterances made by myself and members of the Government prior to its introduction, it has been said that it is a falsification of our previous statements.  I say that is absolutely untrue.  The Bill that is before the House was published on the 27th June of this year with an explanatory memorandum.  The elections were held on the 20th September.  Deputy Corry congratulated me upon my duplicity, so to speak, in hiding the Bill until the elections were over, and in his most eloquent parliamentary language said that all those who went forward at the elections did so because of the graft and corruption they were going to get out of it.  He did not refer, of course, to the old brigade.  When he said that he was referring to the new men who went forward at the elections and, of course, he was not referring to the seagreen incorruptibles of his own Party. But the charge he made against the new candidates who went forward at the elections was that their one purpose was the graft and the corruption that they were going to get out of the Bill.  The Bill was in the hands of the people on the 27th June so that if <Col N="656" /> Deputy Corry's charge was true, not alone were those people corrupt but they must have been stupid as well. Deputy Cowan drew attention to the fact that it was deplorable that such charges should be made against the people and citizens of this country. Deputy Corry is incorrigible.  The misinterpretations of the Bill that ran right through the debate from the opposite side were not confined to Deputy Corry.  I would not be inclined to worry so much about his lurid language in dealing with the various sections of the Bill, but we had even the ex-Minister for Local Government, Deputy MacEntee, wilfully or otherwise, misinterpreting sections of the Bill time after time.</P>
    <P>We claim that we are repealing the County Management Act in this Bill. The Opposition say that there is no change except in name, changing the label on the bottle.  May I remind the House that when moving the Second Reading of the Bill, I made a very long statement setting out the new powers that are being vested in the county councils as distinct from the powers which they have held up to now.  In view of all the attempts that have been made by the Deputies on the Opposition Benches to contravert what I said then, I find myself compelled to read again for the House a list of the powers that are being transferred from the county manager to the elected representatives under this Bill.  They are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Approval of loans under the Seeds and Fertilisers Supply Acts.  Approval of regulations and issue of licences under the Milk and Dairies Act, 1935, and the institution of proceedings for breaches thereof.</P>
    <P>Issue of licences under the Slaughter of Animals Act and the institution of proceedings thereunder.</P>
    <P>Purchase of office equipment and furniture and repair and maintenance of office buildings.</P>
    <P>Selection and purchase of library books and equipment.</P>
    <P>Letting of rooms in town halls and branch libraries for social purposes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="657" /> Naming of new streets.</P>
    <P>Selection and submission of schemes to qualify for grants under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949.</P>
    <P>Allowances under the Blind Welfare Scheme.</P>
    <P>Contracts arising out of School Meals Schemes.</P>
    <P>The consideration, approval and general supervision of the annual Roads Maintenance and Improvement programme.</P>
    <P>Approval of plans for road works and bridges.</P>
    <P>Acceptance of tenders and making of contracts for road works, bridges, and purchase of road equipment and materials.</P>
    <P>The making of applications to the Minister for orders closing roads.</P>
    <P>The making of an application to the Minister for an Order under section 33 of the Local Government Act, 1925, prohibiting the erection of or directing the removal of buildings obstructing the view on roads.</P>
    <P>Acquisition of land for road works.</P>
    <P>Consideration of annual sanitary service programmes and determination of the works to be carried out.</P>
    <P>Approval of plans for water supply schemes, sewerage schemes, sanitary conveniences, burial grounds, public baths and public lighting.</P>
    <P>Acceptance of tenders for sanitary service schemes and for equipment needed therefor.</P>
    <P>Institution of prosecutions for breaches of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Acts.</P>
    <P>Acquisition of land for burial grounds and sanitary service schemes.</P>
    <P>Decision on the grant of home and medical assistance.</P>
    <P>Planning of and acceptance of tenders for public assistance hospitals, county homes, etc.</P>
    <P>Decisions to provide hospitals or clinics, and approval of plans and acceptance of tenders for such institutions. Adoption of health schemes including arrangements with extern institutions, establishment of clinics, <Col N="658" /> adoption of new immunisation schemes, etc.</P>
    <P>Contracts for supplies of all requirements for health services, e.g., food, hospital equipment, spectacles, clothing, beds and bedding.  Institution of proceeding for offences under the Health Acts, 1947 and the regulations made thereunder.</P>
    <P>Planning and execution of housing schemes including acquisition of land, the acceptance of contracts.</P>
    <P>Supervision of general finances of each scheme including schemes of rents, whether fixed, graded, or differential.</P>
    <P>Demolition and repair of unfit houses.</P>
    <P>Maintenance and repair of local authority houses.</P>
    <P>Provision of sites for private builders.</P>
    <P>Granting or refusal of permissions for development proposals under the Town and Regional Planning Acts, e.g. whether particular private building may or may not proceed, where factories and similar concerns are to be located, the lines of new roads, etc.</P>
    <P>That is a fairly exhaustive list of the powers that are being transferred from the control of the county managers, as they exist to-day, to the elected representatives.  These functions which, up to now, have been exercised by the county managers are being transferred to the county councils to be delegated to the new executive committees.  Some Deputies have made the objection that, by delegating these powers to the committees, we will not get efficiency.</P>
    <P>I suggest that if the county council were to be compelled to carry out all the functions now to be vested in them as a council, it would take a practically whole-time council to do that work.  For the sake of efficiency, we suggest that two executive committees be appointed and these executive committees are to be drawn from the elected representatives themselves.  I have suggested in the Bill that 33 per cent. of the council should be appointed to each of these committees.  Somebody said that every member of the <Col N="659" /> council should be on the committees but I think that anybody who desires the council to do any useful work at all, will agree than an arrangement whereby one-third of the membership of the council acts on the health committees and another third on the general purposes committees is a useful workable suggestion.  They will be elected every year and they will be elected by proportional representation. Deputy Brennan thinks that there should be a committee of the whole 21 members of the council.  I trust that is not an indication of the standard of intelligence to be found amongst the councils generally which have been elected.  I think it would be an impossible arrangement and that to appoint one-third of the council on each of the two committees to carry out the functions that I have read out is a very reasonable and workable proposition.  They will have to report back to the general council on everything they do and the final word rests with the council.  Certain work is to be delegated to them for the sake of efficiency and speed.  There still remains one-third of the members of the council who will not be on either of these committees.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies asked what they will be doing.  They will have plenty to occupy their time in the general work of the council, and they may become members of the various other committees which have to be appointed by the council.  These include the mental hospital committees, library committees, agricultural committees and vocational educational committees. There can be a useful division of work between all the members appointed to these committees so as not to overload unduly any section of the council.  I suggest that anybody who approaches this question seriously must agree that if we are going to take all these powers from the managers and give them back to the elected representatives, it is a sensible arrangement to delegate certain work to the two committees who will have special functions to carry out.</P>
    <P>We had some complaints about the preparation of the estimate.  Under <Col N="660" /> the existing system, it was alleged that the elected representatives were in the saddle for one day only out of the 365. I would put it beyond mere allegation. It was said that they controlled the finances only on the day the rate was struck.  The manager prepared the estimate and the council could challenge it when it was presented, but not for a period of more than six or seven days.  It was prepared by the manager and submitted to the council, and where the council did attempt to assert themselves we know what happened. The estimate eventually came to the Custom House, and then somebody went down.  It was not the manager went down; it was the council went down.</P>
    <P>We are proposing now that the estimate will be prepared and passed with the consent and good-will of the people concerned.  The manager prepares his estimate after consultation with both the executive committees with whom he has been working&mdash;the health executive committee and the general purposes executive committee who have a full knowledge of the financial requirements of the county for the ensuing year.  The estimate is prepared in conjunction and in consultation with these committees. If the council feel like discussing or challenging that estimate, they can do so, but there you have at least two-thirds of the members of the council who have been in close consultation with the county officer in preparing that estimate for submission to the county council.  The county officer comes along in a friendly atmosphere to discuss the matter, but the last word is left with the county council. If anybody wants to challenge it, it can be challenged by any member of the council, but I suggest that, after all this discussion has taken place between the officer of the council and the committees, when the estimate does come to the county council it should have very little difficulty in arriving at a correct assessment of the sum required for the services of the council for the coming 12 months.</P>
    <P>I am not going to accept it that people elected by the votes of the people will be so regardless of their <Col N="661" /> duties and responsibilities as to stand for an estimate that will not be in accordance with the full requirements of the county in regard to social services and other functions.  If I were to take that view I would not be in favour of scrapping the managerial system at all.  I would rather be in favour of scrapping the county councils altogether and of handing over their functions to some responsible officers appointed by the Department.  I have, however, full faith that the people of this country&mdash;the same people who elect Deputies to this House&mdash;will be perfectly competent to draw from their own ranks, from the various strata of Irish life, councillors who will administer the affairs of our local bodies in an upright manner.  I have no feeling that there is any justification for the fears expressed by some Deputies that some terrible corruption is going to dominate them.  If corruption is going to operate in the administration of the affairs of any of these councils, the councillors will have to go before the court of the people at the end of their period of three years in office and the people will deal with them.  I have, however, every confidence that the votes of our Irish people will elect to county councils and urban councils men capable of carrying on the business of these councils in a clean and decent manner.</P>
    <P>The powers we are leaving to the manager are not being left to him because of any fear of how they would be exercised if they were handed over to the council, but because we believe they are such as any sensible council would vest in their county officer.  What are they?  Tenancy functions, employment functions and individual health functions.  These are the three items that we take out of the whole category of local administration and hand over to the county officers.  Yet by a piece of agile eloquence on the part of Deputy Major de Valera he proved to his own satisfaction&mdash;or I wonder did he?&mdash;that they constituted 75 per cent. of the total.  He divided the present executive functions into four classes, each of which he took to be equal in extent, and on this basis he claimed that the manager was going to discharge 75 per cent. of the whole, <Col N="662" /> because we were giving him the individual health functions, the tenancy functions and the employment functions. Deputy Sweetman answered that point very effectively.  Without going into any abstruse mathematical calculations to prove his proposition, he simply produced a book showing that in August, 1950, the Kildare County manager made 237 orders, and he pointed out that of these 237 orders he can, under this Bill, make only 23. That was a practical demonstration of the difference between the managerial system, as it is now operated, and the proposals contained in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The individual health functions left to the managers are such as, I suggest, should not be left to any public authority.  Many of them are functions which should be conducted with the maximum of privacy.  The commission of a patient to a mental hospital, the fee to be charged for his maintenance and the particular type of treatment to be given in a particular institution for particular infectious diseases that may call for the greatest privacy, are certainly not matters that should be discussed in public.  They are matters that should be arranged between the county medical officer of health and the county officer.  I trust that none of those Deputies who have been opposing this measure will again suggest that there is anything wrong in leaving these functions to the manager.</P>
    <P>On the question of tenancy functions it has been stressed by some Deputies who spoke here that the question of the fixing of rents should be one for the council, but it is one which will be fixed by the local authority because it will be part and parcel of their duties to consider the scales of rents whether they be differential rents, graded rents or fixed rents.  It will thereafter be the function of the county officer to arrange rents for individual tenants according to what has been laid down for him by the council.  I think that is a reasonable thing to do.  I also think that the collection of rents and decisions as to whether proceedings should be taken in the event of nonpayment of rent are matters which should be left to an individual officer for the purpose of efficiency.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="663" /> The point was raised that the giving of individual tenancies should be a matter for the council.  There may be an argument for it, but I hold that it is preferable to rely on the existing letting regulations and statutory provisions, whereby the medical officer of health is consulted and is required to have regard to the conditions of the people, how they are housed, their family circumstances, whether they have tuberculosis, and so on.  These are the statutory priorities and consultations which the present county managers must observe.  If we are not going to rob the medical officer of health of that necessary function, if he is to have a say in applying the letting regulations, I do not see anything wrong in having the final work of allocation vested in the county officer.  Otherwise the medical officer of health would have to make a report which would come to the elected representatives and they would have to vote on whether a house should be given to a tenant.  But you cannot have a vote on questions of fact and I have perfect faith in the county medical officer, with the co-operation of the local medical officer of the district, to see that the most deserving cases will be housed.  Out of a number of houses, they can say that No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 should get houses in that order and in that way the houses are allocated.</P>
    <P>The case was made from the Opposition Benches&mdash;I forget by which Deputy&mdash;that the local representatives would approach the question from the angle of who would be the best tenant, who would be the man who would best keep the house neat and clean, who would be the man who would best pay the rent and who would be a good solvent tenant; that in that way they would know more than the medical officer of health and that the medical officer of health would approach the matter from a different angle.  I say that I hope he will.  If there happens to be a careless father or a careless mother, I hope that the family will not be deprived of a house just because there is no guarantee that for a time they may not be the best people to keep <Col N="664" /> the house neat and clean.  If they cannot pay the rent there are methods of dealing with that.  I would prefer the doctor's approach of seeing that the family in greatest need would get the house and we are trying to carry that approach into other things besides the allocation of labourers' cottages.  I believe in the system whereby the medical officer makes a report as to the most suitable tenant and I believe that that should weigh with the county officer who will eventually become the county secretary as servant of the elected representatives.  The Bill provides that the manner in which he proposes to proceed must be laid before the elected representatives and there will be nothing underhand about the procedure.</P>
    <P>With regard to employment functions, I think that the employment of staffs should be under the control of one individual.  If you leave the employment of staffs to the members of the council they will often be faced with very distasteful decisions and I have no doubt that the elected representatives would clamour to have the employment of staffs restored to one individual.  Also rules and regulations are laid down whereby persons must be selected by the Local Appointments Commissioners or by interview boards. With regard to manual staffs, the county officer, who will eventually become the county secretary, will have control with the assistance of the engineers and others who run the services for the council.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we are providing something more for these employees than has been in the code already.  We are providing for an appeal.  There was an appeal as to conditions, grading and status for officers, but there was no such provision for manual workers. Deputy MacEntee derided it, saying that it was an appeal from the local authority to the local authority.  It is not.  If the workers have a grievance against the county officer with regard to conditions or status or remuneration they can appeal to the council who will sit and consider the matter.  I hope that there will be an advisory conciliation committee established in every county and every assistance that can <Col N="665" /> be given to them from headquarters will be given so that they will be able to try such matters on a local level and that regular conditions of service will emerge from the use of the conciliation machinery.  It is not an appeal from the local authority to the local authority but from the workers to the elected representatives and they can upset decisions of the county officer and it eventually comes to the Minister if a change is to be made in status or salary.</P>
    <P>Those are the three powers with which the county officer will be vested, individual health functions, tenancy functions and employment functions. I have read out a list of typical functions which will be taken from him in order to put it on record, because in spite of any blank denials that we are taking anything from him and in spite of those who say that we are only changing the label on the bottle, we are transferring important and comprehensive powers from the county officer to the elected representatives and we are making sufficient changes to warrant the title &ldquo;the repeal of the County Management Act&rdquo;.  We are leaving only special functions to the county officer such as are not normally performed in an assembly, but we are achieving a position where public administration will be under the control of the elected representatives.</P>
    <P>There are some particular points to which I should like to advert.  Deputy Bartley raised a question as to what would happen under Section 13 when the county officer becomes county secretary. The answer is that the assistant county officer's title may be changed by the Minister by the Order he will make amalgamating the post of county officer and county secretary under Section 15. However, the posts do not exist except in Dublin and Cork so it is not a vital matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bartley also wanted to know why we had not separate Acts to provide amendments of the Act of 1926. This Bill provides only temporary amendments to facilitate and expedite any consequential appointments. Therefore there was no need to introduce special legislation for them as they are quite proper to this Bill and <Col N="666" /> consequential on its other provisions and are due to lapse when their purpose is spent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kissane is in serious trouble, and, although I tried to call his attention to the fact that he was on the wrong line, he refused to look at any other lines.  He said that Section 9, sub-section (4), gives the Minister power to remove a county officer at any time and that, therefore, the Minister was more undemocratic than those who introduced the 1940 Act where the council had the power to remove the county manager by a two-thirds majority.  In fact, of course, a council cannot remove the county manager, even with a two-thirds majority, without the sanction of the Minister, but, in any event, if the Deputy had read Section 9, sub-section (3), he would see that the Bill does not propose to enable the Minister to remove a county officer, but only an officer appointed temporarily, pending the appointment of a permanent county officer.  This is a routine and necessary arrangement in the case of a temporary post.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kissane was not convinced that there was any real change whatever in the existing managerial system and said that the council were always able to appoint committees such as we have now, but there was a big difference, because those committees had not power to deal with the functions of the county manager.  I have listed the functions of the elected representatives which were not the functions of the county manager.  We have now given the right to the elected representatives to elect executive committees to deal with these extended powers which have been given to them by this Bill.</P>
    <P>Home assistance should not be left to the elected members, said Deputy Kissane.  The home assistance officer serves the county manager at the present time and it is the right of the county manager to override and overrule the decisions of that officer.  The committee will have the same power under the Bill and they should have that discretion.  The home assistance officer will report to the committee instead of to the county manager and they should have the same rights of <Col N="667" /> using discretion as the county manager has.  We are transferring the power from the manager to the elected representatives. They will also have the advice of the superintendent assistance officer and his reports and the views of the county officer himself will be available for the help and guidance of the members.</P>
    <P>Some complaint has been made about the menace of allowing a decision to be taken in the absence of a quorum, by one man, be he chairman or county officer.  That is confined solely and absolutely to home assistance claims and is put into the Bill to ensure that, in the absence of a quorum&mdash;we hope that it will not take place frequently &mdash;no deserving home assistance case will go unsatisfied, pending a further meeting.  It is confined absolutely to home assistance applications.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the question of tenancies and have given my opinion as to the suitability of the present system, of the doctor's reporting in consultation with the officer in accordance with the lines and specifications laid down and on the basis of the statutory Orders and letting regulations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Commons spoke about draft orders and said that there should be some prior consultation before the written drafts are submitted.  No doubt, such discussion may take place and may be suitable and useful, but I wonder if it is essential to put such a clause into the Bill.  It is a matter for purely informal discussion.  If they want to have a discussion about them, it might be useful to have one, but it is scarcely something which should be inserted in the Bill.  Such discussion will take place, I am sure, between the county officer and members of the committees.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan would prefer to continue to make the case for home help to the county manager rather than to the elected representatives.  Why, I do not know.  He says they always got a fair hearing from the manager and that he always listened reasonably to their case, and why he would not like to make the same case to his co-members, with the co-operation <Col N="668" /> and assistance of the county officer and assistance officers, I do not know.  It seems to be a further indication of the lack of confidence reflected in the speeches of Deputy Corry and, I think, Deputy MacEntee himself as to these people utilising their positions for the purpose of buying votes.  That is not a fair outlook on how elected representatives will do their business in dealing with home assistance for deserving people in their areas.  I personally have no fear that that will arise, and, if it does, there is the court of the people which can be appealed to in a very short time to deal with anybody who adopts that attitude. The other members will also be there to correct any such tendency, and, if there is any dishonest or corrupt member, he can be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also spoke about the same seven members being elected to the two committees.  I have already dealt with that.  That is scarcely a possibility.  There will be two committees comprised each of one-third of the members and then there are plenty other committees to which the other men can be elected.  They will be changing around every 12 months and I have little fear that any council will put the same seven members or the same 14 members on two committees, to the total exclusion of the others. If it does arise, it will be an indication that there is something wrong with the situation in that county.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan also says that the committees have no explicit power to amend the county officer's estimate. He must consult them before he prepares the estimate, and, if they have an estimates committee, he must consult that committee.  He must consult the two executive committees on the health and general purposes side, and, if there is an estimates committee, he must consult them also before finally submitting his estimate to the council. With all this previous discussion, there is no reason why a council should have any difficulty in dealing with the estimate in an atmosphere of friendly co-operation with the county officer or county secretary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman raised a point as to how a temporary officer would be <Col N="669" /> appointed who did not get in under Section 10.  He will find that, under Section 15, the Minister can appoint one who has not been so appointed. That is provided in the Bill.  Deputy O'Rourke said he had made a careful study of the health committee's functions and proceeded to inquire whether the health committee would be in a position to know the circumstances of even a few applicants for home assistance.  They will not touch that at all.  They will be confined to functions under the Minister for Health.  It is the other committee which will deal with that matter and with the help they will get from the home assistance officers and the superintendent, there is no reason to think that the system will not operate as successfully as, if not more successfully than, under the management system.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies asked why we did not simply amend the County Management Act and said that all the talk about this Bill was not justified.  It would not be so easy to amend the County Management Act and it was much more satisfactory to introduce a comprehensive and self-sufficient measure such as this.  We have enough legislation by reference, and, if we attempted to amend the County Management Act, we would have had a thing of shreds and patches, of scissors and paste, a lowyer's nightmare and not a lawyer's dream.  I think we are doing the correct thing in placing on the Statute Book a measure of local government which is self-contained and self-sufficing.  I am not going to say for how long it will last, but I have an idea that Ministers who follow me will be slow enough to make changes.</P>
    <P>This is a reasonable measure, a measure which will make for efficiency. There is nothing spectacular about it and we are denounced because it is not spectacular, but a moderate and reasoned approach was the best method to ensure the provision of an up-todate and efficient system of local government. I should be very slow to have anything to do with the introduction of any measure dealing with what I consider to be a sacred issue, local government, if it could be suggested that there was anything shaky, shady, or corrupt about it or that there was <Col N="670" /> anything of the nature &ldquo;hooey&rdquo; associated with it.  For that reason, I resent the gratuitously insulting references made across the floor.  Were it not for the sense of humour which Deputy MacEntee accused me of having, I could scarcely have taken them with the same equanimity.</P>
    <P>I do not feel guilty of the charges made of corruption or disreputable tactics of any kind.  I can say in complete sincerity that this Bill has got careful consideration.  I believe its draftmanship is should and I can assure the House that it is not a matter of steamrolling it through and not the result of departmentalism.  It is an honest approach to use the experience of local government which some of us have had to provide a democratic system with efficiency in administration. I believe it ought to appeal to the House.  There will, perhaps, be a good deal of amendments and I have been told that there will be many amendments.  These will be considered, but I believe that the framework we provide here is something on which we can build an edifice that will be a credit to the country and that will make for efficiency and the democratic advancement of local government interests.  I only regret that the criticisms from the other side were of a destructive rather than of a constructive nature and I am hoping that we will have more constructive criticism on the Committee Stage.  I have the greatest hope for the success of this measure and I commend it once more to the House.</P>

      <P>Between lines 10 and 11 to insert the following definition:&mdash;&ldquo;industry' means an undertaking carried on by way of trade or business in the course of which something is made, altered, finished or adapted for sale, and does not include agriculture.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I will accept it in part.  I do not think it is desirable to define the word &ldquo;industry&rdquo;, because it covers a great number of processes and it was never attempted <Col N="672" /> to define it, not even in the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936.  If the Deputy agrees, I will bring in an amendment on Report to exclude agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is necessary to exclude more than agriculture.  Is there not a possibility, if the term &ldquo;industry&rdquo; is left undefined, that the Industrial Development Authority may be deemed to have functions in relation to commerce, in relation to insurance, in relation to banking, in relation to any activity of that kind which might possibly be deemed to be covered by the term &ldquo;industry&rdquo; or some cognate terms associated with it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point in that, but the difficulty is to get a definition of &ldquo;industry&rdquo; that will be wide enough.  For some reason or another, it was never defined in any previous Acts and the Conditions of Employment Act is an Act in which it was regarded as desirable to have a definition but it was not done.  In fact, I do not think there is any necessity to do it.  As to the point the Deputy makes about distinguishing between industry and commerce, as long as the description &ldquo;industry&rdquo; here is made distinct from commerce, I do not see any necessity for defining it in precise terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I correct in assuming that this Industrial Development Authority will confine itself to manufacturing industry, to industries engaged in making, altering, finishing or adapting for sale in the course of trade, certain commodities and that it is not intended to cover the insurance industry, the banking industry, as they are frequently called, or ordinary commercial distribution, or any activities which are not manufacturing activities in the common meaning of that term?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly is not intended to cover banking, but I can visualise circumstances in which a proposal for, say, a new insurance company might be considered by the authority.  I know there is a statute to cover the requirements for the establishment of a new insurance business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="673" /> If the Deputy likes, I will examine it between now and Report.  I think that it is clear enough that it is not intended to deal with agriculture, but I can bring in an amendment which would make it quite definite.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is O.K., but the very fact that the Parliamentary Secretary suggests that this authority might be concerned with the insurance industry makes the necessity for some limiting amendment such as I have suggested all the greater, because, while we may disagree in our view as to the merits of the individuals who have been appointed on it, not even the Parliamentary Secretary can think that he will select four individuals, not merely competent to run the authority, but also competent to advise him or to take action in relation to other activities, such as insurance, which might from time to time be the Government's concern.  If there is to be an examination of possible developments in other directions outside manufacturing industry, it should be undertaken by some other body, even an <i>ad hoc</i> body set up for the purpose. Surely we have given these people enough to do in asking them to carry out the functions mentioned in Section 3.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 2 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The functions of the authority shall not extend to any undertaking constituted by statute, being an undertaking which is carried on by or on behalf of the State or the directors of which are appointed by the Government or by a Minister of State, or to any commodities which any such undertaking is authorised by statute to produce or make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that there is an important issue of policy to be considered in relation to this amendment.  The Dáil has from time to time passed Acts setting up various boards and companies and other authorities to carry on specified activities and given them powers and placed on them obligations &mdash;either obligations to the public or to the Dáil&mdash;in the matter of furnishing reports and giving information.  Is it contemplated that this Industrial Development Authority will have functions in relation to these other statutory boards and authorities?  Will it, for instance, have the right to interfere <Col N="675" /> with the Electricity Supply Board or Bord na Móna or Irish Shipping, Limited, or the Irish Sugar Company&mdash; or similar concerns set up under statute?  I do not think it should.  I think, in so far as it was necessary to justify the relationship between these statutory authorities and the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Dáil, that that has been done adequately in the existing legislation and that it would be a very undesirable complication if it was contemplated that this new Industrial Development Authority should have the right to interfere in the manner in which they conduct their business.  If they are not to have that power of interference with the functioning of these other statutory authorities, then that should be clearly stated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to make it clear that the functions of the authority do not extend to any other undertaking established under statute or to any commodity or service provided by statutory undertaking.</P>

      <P>I have an open mind on this amendment, but I must confess to some degree of confusion arising from Deputy Lemass's observations. I think this amendment must be read in the light of Section 3 of the Bill. If Deputy Lemass refers to Section 3 he will realise that that is so.  Certainly I cannot follow him when he suggests that the authority could perniciously interfere with the operation of semi-State companies because the functions of the authority as set out in Section 3 would, to my mind, preclude them from interference of the type to which he refers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>My suggestion is that in so far as the State is concerned with shipping through Irish Shipping. Limited, or transport through Córas Iompair Éireann, or electricity through the Electricity Supply Board or sugar manufacture through the Irish Sugar Company, it has already defined in legislation the relationship that should exist between the concern responsible for these undertakings and the Minister and the Dáil, and that it is disrupting an effective and efficient system already in force to impose between the Minister <Col N="677" /> and the Dáil and the directors of these concerns another body which may have functions to exercise in regard to them or powers such as are suggested in the Bill.</P>
      <P>My concern in this Bill, now that it has received a Second Reading, as indicated in a number of amendments, is to ensure that the Dáil is not deprived of the right to influence, through the Minister for Industry and Commerce, activities which should properly be the concern of the Dáil and to defeat any attempt to put between the Minister and the Dáil this autonomous body for the appointment of which the Dáil has no responsibility and with which it has no direct contact.  That may be an arguable matter when it comes to the issue of licences or the imposition of tariffs but certainly it is not an arguable matter when dealing with concerns such as Córas Iompair Éireann, or the Electricity Supply Board which were established by statutes&mdash;statutes which already set out the relationship that should exist between them and the Dáil and the Minister, and which require no amendment.  In my view it certainly would not be improved by giving this new authority any functions whatever in relation to them.</P>

      <P>Surely the most Deputy Lemass can make in his argument is that without this amendment it would be a contemporaneous authority, because without an expressed repeal it could not take away the statutory powers or duties that there are in existing legislation in the Minister and the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that there is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If it does not take away the existing statutory duties and powers vested in Ministers under the various statutes setting up these bodies, then the most that it could do is give additional contemporaneous power and that power might be necessary, for example, in regard to the sugar company.  It might be necessary, in considering the artificial fertiliser industry, to get information from the <Col N="678" /> sugar company about the manner in which they import fertilisers this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is to be light thrown on them I want it to be done here in the Dáil and not by this Industrial Development Authority.  I want it first-hand, not second-hand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Do Deputy Lemass's objections arise solely from the presence of Section 5 in the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Section 3, I should be glad if Deputy Lemass would point out to the House where it would be possible for interference of the type he mentions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there anything in Section 5 (4)  to prevent the four members of this Industrial Development Authority demanding from the Electricity Supply Board information as to the type of power stations they are going to build and to discuss with them the design of these power stations with a view to their modernisation, for example?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, that is desirable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is it desirable? If we have set up an Electricity Supply Board and appointed to it directors whom we think are the most competent people to run it, why make these directors subject to another body about whose competency we may have considerable doubts&mdash;who, at any rate, are certainly not chosen because of their particular capacities for running electricity undertakings?  I move to report progress.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; the Committee to sit again.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m., until 3 p.m., on Wednesday, 15th November, 1950.</P>
