    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Maintenance of Embankments.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he is aware that the present situation whereby several Departments bear varying degrees of responsibility in the matter of the maintenance of estuarine embankments causes much confusion; and, if so, whether he will take steps to have responsibility for this essential public service centralised in one particular Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for the maintenance of estuarine embankments rests, generally, with the occupiers of the lands affected, who may be a private individual or concern or a local authority, and the only Departments of State which bear direct responsibility for the maintenance of such embankments are, first, the Department of Lands, in respect of the comparatively limited number of cases in which the Land Commission administer trust funds for the upkeep of the embankments, and, secondly, the Department of Industry and Commerce, in respect of two embankments which happen to be in the area now included in Shannon Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One other Department has certain <Col N="2" /> functions connected with estuarine embankments: the Minister for Local Government may, in certain circumstances, authorise a local authority, under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949, to repair an embankment on behalf of another local authority which is unable or unwilling to execute the work, and he may make grants to local authorities in respect of the repair by them of embankments which were constructed by them or which they are required by law to maintain or the repair of which is in the public interest. The Department of Local Government has itself no direct responsibility for the maintenance of embankments.</P>
    <P>The Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, contains a provision which empowers the transfer to the Commissioners of Public Works of embankments constructed for the protection of lands purchased under the Land Purchase Acts or the subject of proceedings under those Acts, but no such transfer of embankments to the Commissioners of Public Works has yet taken place.</P>
    <P>There should be no difficulty in determining, in the case of any particular estuarine embankment, whether any Department of State has, in fact, any responsibility or function at all in the <Col N="3" /> matter, and, if so, which of the Departments is concerned.  Accordingly, I see no reason for taking the steps suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not consider that in cases where the local farmers are responsible for the maintenance of these embankments the job is far beyond their capacity as they cannot possibly undertake such expenditure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite a different matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Government have yet reached a decision on methods of bringing the activities and financial operations of State-sponsored bodies under systematic review by the Oireachtas, and, if so, the nature thereof.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that his attention was called to the necessity for a decision on this point as long ago as 24th June, 1948, again I think in March of last year, and on the 14th December last year? Will the Taoiseach assure the House that the decision on the matter will be arrived at and announced as soon as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I agree with everything the Deputy has stated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state in regard to the brochure entitled &ldquo;Ireland is Building&rdquo; published by the Stationery Office (1) how many copies were printed; (2) the cost of printing and publishing; (3) the number of copies distributed free; (4) the number of copies sold at the price <Col N="4" /> of 3d.; (5) the number of copies sold at less than 3d. and to whom, and the price charged in each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The information asked for by the Deputy is as follows: (1) the number of copies of the brochure which were printed on its first printing was 10,000; (2) the cost of printing and publishing was £614 9s. 0d.; (3) the number of copies distributed free was 7,700; (4) the number of copies sold at the published price of 3d. a copy was 2,300, and (5) no copies were sold at less than 3d. a copy.</P>
      <P>A second printing of 10,000 copies of the brochure, at an estimated cost of £315, is in course of delivery, and 1,000 copies from that printing have been distributed free.</P>
      <P>Although the point is not covered by the Deputy's question.  I think it well to add that further expenditure, amounting to £946, has been incurred, in connection with the brochure, on publicity designed to bring to the notice of Irish skilled building workers abroad the opportunities of suitable employment now available at home.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will state the number of skilled building workers who have applied to his Department for employment in building from addresses in Britain since December 1st, 1949, giving separately the number of these in each trade category, and the number in each category placed in employment through the Department.</P>

      <P>The reply to the first part of the Deputy's question is: carpenters, 209; bricklayers, 128; masons, 9; slaters and tilers, 16; plasterers, 65; painters, 176; plumbers, 47; glaziers, 4; steel-fixers and benders, 10; electricians, 48; steel-erectors, 26; woodcutting-machinists, 13; stone-cutters, 1; clerks of works, 6, and costing-clerks, 6 Total, 764.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The particulars asked for in the second part of the question are not available.  The procedure adopted in regard to skilled workers in the building trade at present in Great Britain, who indicate their desire to return to employment in this country, is to record them in a special register maintained by my Department in Dublin. Each such registrant is supplied with particulars of suitable employment as it becomes available.  The prospective employer is at the same time informed <Col N="8" /> that this is being done and is furnished with the name and address of the registrant. Both parties are advised to enter into direct correspondence regarding any matter they may desire to settle before a contract of service is completed.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary object of the Acquisition of Land (Allotments) Acts, 1926 and 1934, was to provide facilities for unemployed persons in urban areas to cultivate vegetables for themselves and their families.  In other areas, such as those mentioned by the Deputy, associations may be approved for the purpose of procuring land and cultivating allotments, and, as I have already intimated to the Deputy, I am prepared to approve of any reasonable proposals which may be submitted by allotment associations in the areas mentioned.  Free manures, seeds and implements are available for unemployed allotment holders, but I could not justify the provision of these facilities for persons other than the unemployed.  Cottiers who have land already may obtain credit for the purchase of seeds and manures under the Seeds and Fertilisers Supply Acts, provided the county council adopt a <Col N="18" /> scheme for the making available of such credit to them.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that last year when an inspector of his Department went down there, he was very reluctant to sanction any scheme? His objection was that we put up a series of schemes but in actual fact we grouped Portmagee and Valentia as one scheme.  In view of the extenuating circumstances and because of the position of the islanders, we asked that the usual regulations governing these schemes would be amended.  I appeal to the Minister to review the position with a view to instructing his local inspector, who is conversant with the position there, to co-operate with the committee and the others concerned.</P>

So far as I know, these are the only obstacles which have militated against the purpose the Deputy has in mind.  The resolution of either will result in the achievement of his purpose.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state why the lime subsidy has been reduced by 50 per cent. in County Clare this year, and whether, in view of the fact that there is no other potential source of supply open to farmers this year, he will accede to the terms of the resolution on the subject adopted unanimously by the county committee of agriculture at their meeting on Saturday, 21st January, 1950.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The maximum subsidy for burnt lime this year is 15/- per ton. In County Clare last year the subsidy varied from 22/- to 34/- per ton.  Burnt lime at current prices is no longer an economic method of supplying lime to agricultural land, and supplies of ground limestone are being made available through private enterprise all over the country.  I understand that there are plans in progress for the erection of a ground limestone plant in County Clare, the product of which will be available at 15/- per ton ex quarry, and that there will also be available a service of delivering it and spreading it on the land.  In addition to this, under the land rehabilitation project any farmer in Clare whose land requires rehabilitation can have lime and phosphate spread on the land dealt with under the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only reason for retaining the subsidy on burnt lime at all is to ensure that lime burners shall not have their means of livelihood abruptly terminated, and that they may be afforded an opportunity of adjusting their output to the knowledge that burnt lime, unless it were possible to produce it at <Col N="21" /> prices much lower than at present quoted, will no longer be used for agricultural purposes, and that they will be able to engage in alternative occupations as the demand for burnt lime tends to diminish to the point where it will be sufficient to cater for the demand for lime wash and similar purposes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="22" /> I am not aware of any general shortage of animal feeding stuffs.  The output of bran and pollard is limited by the quantity and rate of extraction of flour produced by the mills.  Even if the total output were made available for straight sale, feeders could not be assured of a steady or adequate supply. Arrangements have, accordingly, been made for the allocation to manufacturers of compound feeding stuffs of the total output of pollard for inclusion in the balanced feeding stuffs manufactured by them so as to maximise available supplies of balanced rations for pigs and fowl.  Over 90 per cent. of the bran produced is being reserved for sale to feeders through the usual retail channels, whereas, in previous quota periods, only 50 per cent. of total bran production was allocated to retail trade.</P>
    <P>No appreciable increase in the native production of these commodities can be expected.  The present price of imported bran and pollard would involve a retail price of about 22/- per cwt. and I doubt whether they are worth this price.</P>
    <P>Preferential treatment is not being given to any particular firms in Dublin or elsewhere in the matter of allocations.</P>

From that date, however, the higher rate of stamp duty (25 per cent.) provided for by Section 13 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947, was payable on conveyances and transfers to non-nationals of lands and buildings, save as provided in the section.  Records have been kept of all cases in which the higher stamp duty was paid and where the consideration was £1,000 or more. From these it has been ascertained that the numbers of transfers to individuals of hotels and other licensed premises which were subjected to the higher duty were as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Month of December, 1947, Nil; whole of year 1948, 4; whole of year 1949, 2.</P>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that the section does not impose the higher stamp duty in respect of all conveyances and transfers to non-nationals. There are certain exceptions; for example, the exception in favour of persons ordinarily resident in the State who had been so ordinarily resident during the three years immediately preceding 15th October, 1947.</P>
    <P>As to the Deputy's second question, here again there is no information for periods prior to 1st December, 1947, and, moreover, acreages of property purchased are not recorded in connection with stamp duty.  I am having further inquiry made, however, in regard to the question of acreages of land in cases where the higher stamp duty was payable and should be obliged if the Deputy would repeat his question, so far as it relates to the period subsequent to 30th November, 1947, in, say, a month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Cosgrave)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936, is the main statute governing civil aviation in this country.  There were amending Acts in 1942 and 1946.  This Bill is concerned with further amendments of a <Col N="39" /> type shown by experience to be desirable, the principal one of which is to provide for an increase in the amount of the subsidy to the air companies. Section 79 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936, fixed at £500,000 the aggregate amount which might be paid to the air companies by way of subsidy during a period of five years from 14th August, 1936.  The period was extended for five years from 26th of May, 1942, by the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act of that year.  The sum of £500,000 was increased later to £750,000 by Section 19 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1946, and the period in which payments might be made was extended for a further five years.  The limit of £750,000 which might be paid by way of subsidy was reached in March, 1948. It is necessary to make provision in the present Bill to continue the payment of subsidies to the air companies.</P>
      <P>The Bill enables the payment of subsidies to be continued for a further period of five years from the date of its enactment.  Because of the difficulty of estimating what moneys would be required over a period it is thought better that the Bill should not specify a limit on the amount to be paid during the period.  This Bill limits the period again to five years.  Any subsidy which has to be paid will be subject to the control of the Dáil in the usual way and will be brought before it under the appropriate Vote each year.  Aer Lingus showed a loss of £162,000 for the year ended 31st March, 1949.  The original Estimate for the current year was £125,000 and it is expected that they will do considerably better than that. Because of the participation of the British airlines only part of the loss falls to be met by the Irish Exchequer.</P>
      <P>Section 3 of the Bill makes clear that the Minister has power to prosecute in respect of breaches of the Air Navigation and Transport Acts&mdash;the two earlier Acts and this Act.</P>
      <P>Section 5 of the Bill brings the definition of &ldquo;State aircraft&rdquo; into accord with that contained in the Chicago Convention of 1944.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1936 Act defines State aircraft <Col N="40" /> as military aircraft and every aircraft used exclusively in State services, including postal, customs and police services.  This follows the definition in the Paris Convention of 1919, which was replaced by the Chicago Convention of 1944.  The definition of State aircraft in the Chicago Convention does not include aircraft used in postal services. As Ireland has ratified the Chicago Convention, it is desired to bring the definition of &ldquo;State aircraft&rdquo; into conformity with that convention, and also to make clear that the term relates to State aircraft of States other than Ireland.</P>
    <P>Sections 6, 7 and 8 of the Bill clarify certain of the powers conferred on the Minister by the 1936 Act relating to the acquisition and disposal of land and the maintenance of water supply, sewage and other works ancillary to aerodromes.</P>
    <P>Section 36 of the 1936 Act specifies the purposes for which land may be acquired, either by agreement or compulsorily, in connection with the establishment and maintenance of aerodromes. Certain purposes are stated, such as securing that lands adjacent to an aerodrome will not be used so as to cause a danger to aircraft using the aerodrome.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill is intended to remove any doubts that lands may be acquired for any purpose connected with the development of civil aviation.</P>
    <P>Section 37 of the Air Transport and Navigation Act, 1936, provides for the establishment and maintenance of aerodromes and the provision and maintenance in connection therewith of roads, bridges, approaches, apparatus, equipment and buildings and other accommodation.  To remove any doubts it is desirable that specific powers should now be taken to provide and maintain water mains, sewers and sewage disposal works, electric lines, lights and signs.  This is provided for in Section 7.</P>
    <P>The Minister is authorised by Section 8 of the Bill to enter, before conveyance or ascertainment of compensation, on any lands compulsorily acquired by him.  It might be necessary to exercise this power where the acquisition  <Col N="41" /> of land or of a water right would involve lengthy negotiation.  This might arise particularly if the Minister wished to use land in order to comply with an international civil aviation requirement which had to be met before a specified date.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill deals with the vesting of lands at Dublin Airport in the Minister.  Some of these lands were acquired as long ago as 1918 by the British Government for use as a military aerodrome.  The lands in question are subject to the provisions of the State Lands Act, 1924.  The Minister is hampered in making agreements and leases with airlines and others because the procedure laid down in that Act is not appropriate as a result of the developments which have taken place since the airport was built.  Section 10 is designed to remove these difficulties. Other portions of the lands were acquired by the Minister for Defence and it is now proposed to vest these also in the Minister for Industry and Commerce for convenience of administration.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides that these lands, as well as some other lands acquired at Shannon Airport under Emergency Powers Order, will be treated as if they had been acquired under the 1936 Act. This is being done in order to ensure that the provisions of the 1936 Act relating to the development of aerodromes will apply to these lands.</P>
    <P>Section 42 of the 1936 Act empowers the Minister to dispose of land no longer required by him for the performance of his duties or the exercise of his functions under that Act.  His right to lease sites, buildings, space or rooms at State aerodromes or to dispose of land other than land acquired by him under the 1936 Act is not expressly provided for.  Section 12 of the Bill puts the position beyond doubt.</P>
    <P>The presence of unlighted obstructions such as high buildings in the vicinity of aerodromes may be a hazard to aircraft.  It is essential that such obstructions should be marked, particularly where there are night operations by aircraft.  It is important that the Minister should have powers where necessary to affix lights or signs to <Col N="42" /> obstructions and that his officers should have access to these lights of signs for maintenance purposes.  Section 13 of the Bill proposes to give the Minister such powers.  It also provides for the payment of compensation where any person proves that his estate or interest is injuriously affected in consequence of the exercise of these powers.</P>
    <P>Recommendations have been made by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, of which Ireland is a member, about controlling the height of obstructions in the vicinity of aerodromes, particularly in the areas extending directly from the ends of runways.  Up to the present, the Minister has not had power to regulate the height of buildings or other structures in the vicinity of aerodromes, which would constitute a hazard to aircraft. It is now proposed in Section 14 that the Minister will have power to regulate the height of buildings in the vicinity of aerodromes.  The Minister may by Order declare a particular area to be a protected area and within that area no buildings may exceed a height fixed by the Minister.  Provision is made in Section 14 for the giving of notice to interested parties of the making of a protected area Order and for ensuring that any permit granted by the Minister in connection with a protected area Order shall not operate to release the holder from any restrictions imposed under the Town and Regional Planning Acts, 1934 and 1939.  Provision is made for the payment of compensation where any person proves that his estate or interest is injuriously affected in consequence of the making of a protected area Order.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for the laying on the Table of each House of the Oireachtas of every protected area Order as soon as it is made.  Either House may pass a resolution annulling such Order within the next subsequent 21 days on which it sits.</P>
    <P>Section 16 of the Bill enables the Minister to make by-laws for the maintenance of order and the control of traffic at State aerodromes and lays down penalties for the violation of the by-laws.  The Bill also enables the Minister to make by-laws for the custody <Col N="43" /> and disposal of lost property found at State aerodromes.</P>
    <P>Officers authorised by the Minister will have power to prohibit and restrict the entry of and to remove, persons, animals and vehicles; to control traffic and enforce speed limits and parking regulations; and to enforce the by-laws.</P>
    <P>Section 22 of the Bill provides that a State aerodrome is a public place for the purpose of any other enactment. The provisions of the Road Traffic Act, 1933, and of the Licensing Act, 1872, refer to public places and the section is intended to make it clear that the provisions of these Acts apply to State aerodromes.  Part X of the Road Traffic Act, 1933, deals with the lighting of vehicles on any road and it is intended that that Act should apply to roads in a State aerodrome.</P>
    <P>Section 23 of the Bill provides that, for the purpose of the management of Dublin Airport, Aer Rianta may act as agents of the Minister unless and until he otherwise directs.  Aer Rianta have been managing the airport since 1940, and no change is contemplated.  It is desirable that there should be statutory recognition of this arrangement because of the increasing activity at the airport.</P>
    <P>Section 24 of the Bill modifies the Water Works Clauses Acts, 1847 and 1863, so that the Minister may, with the permission of the sanitary authority concerned, sell water to any person from the supply at a State aerodrome.</P>
    <P>I should be glad of the co-operation of the House in having this measure enacted as soon as possible, in view of the necessity to pay subsidy before 31st March.  The provision for subsidy, if not paid before then, would have to be made in the Estimates for next year and, consequently, I would appreciate any co-operation possible in having the measure enacted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no objection to this Bill receiving a Second Reading and it will not be our fault if its enactment is delayed beyond the end of the financial year.  Many of the proposals in the Bill are of secondary importance, although we may have <Col N="44" /> some questions to ask concerning them when the Bill is being considered in Committee.  The main provision in the Bill is that relating to the increase in the subsidy limit.  That amendment of the law was, in fact, needed two years ago.  I do not know what complications were caused in the financial arrangements of the air companies by reason of the fact that the Government failed to produce this Bill two years ago.  We know that the Dáil had to revote this year the subsidy voted in the previous year and that, because of the operation of the limit under the 1946 Act, no subsidy has, in fact, been paid since March, 1948</P>
      <P>I should have thought that when the present Government had to produce proposals for legislation relating to civil aviation to the Dáil they would have availed of the opportunity to clarify their policy in regard to civil aviation development.  They cannot but be aware of the fact that their policy and intentions in regard to civil aviation are clouded in vagueness. They have taken action which appeared to indicate a decision to limit the development of our air services.  We can recollect the precipitate abandonment of the plans for the development of the transatlantic service, followed by the curtailment or abandonment of other services, in operation or contemplated, to centres in Europe.  We are aware from Press reports that discussions were proceeding last year concerning certain of the clauses in the bilateral agreement with the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had from the Government or any spokesman of the Government no clear expression of the Government's attitude towards civil aviation development.  The few brief factual statements made upon the introduction of the Estimates for the Department of Industry and Commerce did not help to clarify the position.  This is the first time a Bill of this kind has come to the Dáil since the Government came into office and I should have thought that they would have realised the wisdom of doing what was done when similar Bills were before the House, of indicating in a general way the development in progress or contemplated <Col N="45" /> for the future and the main aims of policy.  It is all the more necessary in the case of the present Government because of the uncertainty and vagueness created by their own actions.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Government have in fact reached decisions of which the Dáil should be aware to limit our civil aviation development.  We think they have, but from time to time Ministerial statements of a general kind have been made which suggested the contrary.  This is a far more suitable occasion for a statement of policy, for a discussion of policy, than the Vote for the Department, on which a multitude of matters are raised by many Deputies, not all of which can be adequately discussed and some of which are not discussed at all, apart from the initial statement of them by the Deputy most interested.</P>
    <P>Why should this State, as a State, concern itself with civil aviation development?  I do not know what answer the Government would give to that question.  Why should the taxpayers of this State be asked to subsidise civil aviation development?  If we are to have State enterprise in the air and provision for subsidy to air development by the taxpayer, for what purpose should we do so?  What is our aim?  How far should the development go?  These are questions about which, I think, the public knew the attitude of the Government in the past, but about which they do not know the attitude of the Government at present and I should like if, on the occasion of this Bill, some answer were given to them.</P>
    <P>We undertook the development of civil aviation here through State-sponsored companies because we thought that was the most effective way of doing something which was desirable.  We recognised in civil aviation a development which offered considerable benefits to this country as to every island country.  We knew there would be difficulty in developing our own aviation transport services, both because of our limited resources and because of other factors which are apparent to anybody who is familiar with the history of the rise and decline of our merchant shipping.  We recognised <Col N="46" /> the fact, however, that a new opportunity was being given to us to break out of the position which had been created by the decline of the Irish mercantile marine and the fact that almost all of the surface passenger services from this country to other countries were operated by foreign companies and that the bulk of our freight traffic was also controlled by foreign companies.  We felt, therefore, that something had happened of which we should take full advantage.  We believed that if full advantage were to be taken of that new development the State had to interest itself in the matter.</P>
    <P>We saw that in Great Britain civil aviation had in its initial stages attracted private capital, but that at a very early stage in its development it required the help of Government subsidy and ultimately private interests had to be acquired and amalgamated in State-sponsored companies entrusted with the task of civil air development. The history of civil aviation in other European countries was similar and there was no reason why we should repeat the experience of these other countries, but should rather begin on a substantial scale here by means of State enterprise.  Another important reason why the development of civil aviation by a Government sponsored company was desirable was that because of its character it can only operate in consequence of and in accordance with agreements made on an inter-governmental level for the provision of landing rights and traffic rights abroad.  The alternative to the establishment by the Government here of companies formed under the authority of legislation and assisted and financed by the Exchequer, as we saw it, was development by foreign companies and we felt that that was a process which would ultimately prove detrimental to the interests of this country and which should be forestalled by immediate action here.  The development of civil aviation offered also an attractive source of employment to Irish workers, employment of a skilled kind which would increase their utility and earning power and which would not be available if the development did not <Col N="47" /> take place at all or took place under foreign influence.</P>
    <P>The decision to develop civil aviation by means of State enterprise was easy enough.  The decision to assist its development by subsidies from the Exchequer was not so easy. In the development of a new service, such as civil aviation represented 14 or 15 years ago, it was easy to see that substantial expenditure would be necessary on what I might call experimentation and that the cost of developing the services and operating them was likely to prove considerably larger than the revenue that could be earned for a number of years.  We knew that the decision to subsidise civil air transport development was likely to be criticised, often unfairly criticised, as representing the utilisation of funds on what would be described as a luxury service to the detriment of other purposes for which State money was being asked. Nevertheless, we took the decision to proceed with the development of civil aviation and to subsidise that development. Originally, the capital sums required for the establishment of air transport organisations and the purchase of equipment were moderate, but as development proceeded further capital had to be provided.</P>
    <P>The 1946 Act, in fact, provided for a substantial increase of the limit to which advances for capital purposes for civil aviation could be made from the Exchequer.  The fact that air transport services are being subsidised in all countries is a fact of which we should take notice.  It is to be hoped and expected that air transport will prove capable of economic operation in the course of time but I doubt very much whether that stage has been reached yet or is likely to be reached for some years to come.  Equipment is still very largely experimental and, in so far as it is desired to provide Irish air transport operating companies with equipment which is safe, suitable and up to date, then clearly, if new developments occur, old equipment must be scrapped and replaced by new equipment. That all involved expenditure of a kind which private enterprise could not undertake and which necessarily <Col N="48" /> resulted in repeated calls on the Exchequer for help.</P>
    <P>The best illustration of that development which I can give occurred in 1947. The air companies and the Government were criticised in 1947 for what were described as the heavy losses incurred that year after a profit had been made in the previous year.  The House, I think, is aware that the company which operates the services between this country and Great Britain, Aer Lingus, is a joint company owned in part by Aer Rianta, the major Irish air company, and in part by the corresponding British company.  That arrangement, which was negotiated shortly after the war, was, in our view, a beneficial arrangement which certainly increased the prospect of economic operation by ensuring for the joint company exclusive rights on the routes between this country and Great Britain.  However, quite early in its history that arrangement appeared likely to break down over the question of the purchase of British aircraft.  The British Government at that time were very interested in securing an international market for British commercial aircraft and one type of aircraft upon which they based their hopes, the Viking, appeared to be of a character particularly suitable for the shorter type of journeys between Irish and British centres.  The technical experts of Aer Lingus did not like the aircraft and the Irish members of the board were against the purchase of these Viking planes. The decision by that company, in which the British European Airways Corporation had a substantial interest, not to buy British aircraft at that time would have been a very substantial reverse to the British effort to secure sales for these aircraft around the world and something in the nature of a crisis developed in which it appeared to me as likely that the outcome would be the termination of the agreement for joint operation on these routes.  At that stage, against the recommendation of the technical experts of Aer Lingus and mainly having regard to the political considerations involved in the maintenance of the agreement, I took the decision that these aircraft should be purchased.  The decision was, of <Col N="49" /> course, influenced by the very favourable technical reports upon the aircraft which the British partners in the air company were able to produce from other sources.  In the event these aircraft proved unsatisfactory by reason of the fact that they were unduly costly to maintain, and ultimately the board of Aer Lingus took the decision to ground them and to continue operating with the D.C.3's and to dispose of the Viking planes by sale.  That did not prove very easy, although ultimately, I think, all were sold.  The major part of the substantial loss of 1947 was due to that unfortunate experience, but I think that the development of civil aviation should not be restricted because of an occurrence of that kind. Commonsense will tell us that until types of aircraft are more generally standardised and until airport equipment has reached a definite stage in its development, it must inevitably happen that experimental development that looks promising will prove to be less satisfactory in operation and will involve a great deal of expense.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to know, however, what is the present policy of the air company in regard to aircraft purchases. The D.C.3 is a very satisfactory aircraft of pre-war design, but likely, I understand, to be ineligible under international regulations for operation on international routes next year.  If that is correct and if these international regulations are not modified or the period allowed for the operation of the D.C.3's extended, then clearly, this year or next year, Aer Lingus will have to reach very important decisions upon equipment policy, decisions involving substantial capital expenditure in the purchase of new aircraft to substitute the present D.C.3's.  I do not want anyone to take from my remark that there is any unsatisfactory feature in the operation of these D.C.3's.  The production of the D.C.3 represented probably the most important single development in the whole history of civil aviation.  The fact that an aircraft which was developed and in commercial use before the war is still regarded as the main civil aviation type at present is a remarkable tribute to its designers.  It is extremely safe <Col N="50" /> and economical in operation.  I do not know why the international air authorities have committed themselves to the adoption of regulations which preclude the use of D.C.3's on international routes.  I understand, however, that they have done so and that companies that want to remain in operation of international services will have to acquire new aircraft before very long.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should be perturbed by the fact that Aer Lingus is still losing money.  I always felt that the development of air traffic on routes such as exist between this country and Great Britain necessitates striving initially to discover the maximum traffic potentiality, that the company should be more concerned with ascertaining the maximum traffic potentiality than with economic operation in the arrangement of services and fares, that the main concern should be to test the traffic possibilities of the routes and only when that had been done to trim the organisation and adjust the fares to the extent necessary to get the costs in proper relation to revenue. The pressure which was exercised in the past and which is no doubt still being exercised by the Department of Finance to balance up the accounts of Aer Lingus before the initial stage of development has passed is likely to prove detrimental to progress and I would urge on those who are responsible for aviation policy in the Department of Industry and Commerce that they should still seek to strive towards maximum development of traffic and to leave the matter of economic operation for the future.  The present Government has at least this advantage which its predecessors did not have, that any intelligent and consistent policy of that kind will not be opposed here merely because it involves a subsidy sub-head in the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>However, when all these questions have been settled, when we have all agreed that civil aviation is properly a task for State enterprise, when we have agreed that the taxpayer may reasonably be asked to subsidise it, the more important question arises: for what purpose and to what extent are we to <Col N="51" /> push that development?  It is easy enough to argue in favour of development of air passenger services between this country and Great Britain and between this country and capital cities in Western Europe.  The frequency of the services, the type of aircraft to be used can be related to the traffic potentiality of each route.  But that we desire these services, that means of direct contact with British centres and European capitals by Irish airships is, I think, beyond question.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest, however, that there is no argument that can be advanced in favour of State enterprise and Government subsidy for air transport to centres in Great Britain or to centres in Europe that is not doubly strong when advanced in favour of the development of air services across the Atlantic.  I do not know what prompted the Government to take its hasty decision to stop the development of the transatlantic service.  I know that many ridiculous statements have been made in justification of that decision by various Government spokesmen throughout the country.  I think it is perhaps necessary to repeat right now that the development of that project to the stage it had reached when the change of Government took place, when the decision to abandon it was made, did not involve the taxpayers of this country in any loss whatsoever.  The total expenditure incurred on plans for the development of the transatlantic air service&mdash;and most of that expenditure was of a character which would justify its being charged to capital&mdash; was substantially less, more than £100,000 less, than the profit realised on the sale of the Constellation planes purchased for this service.</P>
    <P>However, I want to put seriously before the Dáil the case for the development of air services across the Atlantic, and I want to do so not upon Party or sentimental grounds.  I would think it undesirable that this question of transatlantic air development should become or should continue to be the type of controversial Party question which it has been in the past. If we are to have here air transport organisations equipped and capable of <Col N="52" /> maintaining communications with other countries overseas, is there any country in the world to which it is more necessary to plan for the maintenance of communications in exceptional international circumstances than America? Let it be quite clear that there is not now here any organisation, or any airplane in Irish ownership, capable of flying the Atlantic.  We are completely dependent, in so far as transatlantic air travel is concerned, upon the operations of foreign companies, operations which may be curtailed or altered in accordance with commercial policy in times of peace or abandoned altogether for other considerations in times of war.</P>
    <P>I have often drawn attention to the fact that when we entered the last war we found ourselves in this position: that we had not got a ship under the Irish flag capable of sailing the Atlantic, that we had not an airplane capable of flying it, that we had not even a radio station capable of carrying messages across it, and that even the cable stations operated from our territory were under foreign control, and messages had to pass through London before being transmitted.  Perhaps the Government which was in office before the war is open to criticism for having allowed that situation to continue.  It was, I think, busily engaged in useful work in the years it held office before the war.  But, certainly, having realised the problems and dangers which were created by that situation, we took energetic steps during the war so far as possible to end it, and decided when the war was over that these steps would be completed.</P>
    <P>Amongst the measures we decided upon then was the establishment of a transatlantic air service.  A transatlantic air service has got commercial possibilities far more considerable in my view than air services to Great Britain and Europe.  There exists in the United States of America a traffic potential which other air companies operating across the Atlantic would spend millions of pounds in publicity to create and still not succeed, a goodwill arising from the intimate relations between the two countries and the many <Col N="53" /> families in America who have contact with families here, which we could turn to commercial advantage if we tried. There is no technical or no commercial or no political reason why this country should not be able to operate air services across the Atlantic as successfully as any other country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I content myself with saying, concerning the development of transatlantic air services, that if the case for State enterprise and State subsidy of air development anywhere is based upon the essentiality of developing this new form of transport to an island country like this, the fact that the greater part of the shipping, whether for passengers or freight, coming to Irish ports is foreign owned, the fact that the alternative to enterprise by the Irish State in that field is enterprise by foreign countries and foreign companies, and the fact that it is a development which, if proceeding under Irish auspices, gives an opportunity of a valuable type of employment to Irish citizens&mdash;every single one of these arguments applies with double force to the development of transatlantic services and if there is no case for State enterprise and State subsidy in the development of transatlantic air services, then there is no case for State enterprise or State subsidy for air services anywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary will give us more information concerning the Government's viewpoint on this matter than we have had heretofore.  I assume most Deputies will agree with me that air transport is still in the infancy of its development.  Looking forward 25 or 50 years, is there any Deputy who doubts that by then the great bulk of international traffic in passengers and freight will proceed by air?  If that forecast is correct, then it is undesirable that we should hamper the development of Irish air services now by some false considerations of economy.  The prospects of successful operation on the Atlantic are at least as strong, and in my view stronger, <Col N="54" /> than the prospects of successful and economic operation to Britain and Europe.  We are not objecting to the provision of the subsidy as proposed in this Bill for the air services to Europe. Is there any logical reason why we should object to the provision of a subsidy, if required, for the much more important development of operating services across the Atlantic?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>That would apply equally to shipping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It does, and Deputy Hickey is no doubt as perturbed as I am by the evidence that other countries operating shipping services across the Atlantic are not unwilling to subsidise these services in order to maintain them in operation.  Heretofore, Irish Shipping has been able to operate with commercial success and there has been no question of a State subsidy for the development of our shipping services.  I think the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary will know from the records of the Department that the consideration of various projects which looked promising and likely to ensure successful development, but which ultimately proved abortive, proceeded for a number of years before we decided to take the straight road by establishing a State company and doing the job ourselves. However, that is rather an aside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Towards the middle of last year it was announced that representatives of the American Government had come here to discuss the alteration or amendment of the provisions of the agreement negotiated under my auspices with the American Government, particularly those provisions which obliged the American air companies licensed to operate in and through this country to make Shannon Airport their first port of call on the eastward run and the last port of departure on the westward run, and the suggestion was made that the American companies were themselves pressing to be allowed to operate into Dublin instead of into Shannon.  I do not know if the Parliamentary Secretary feels at liberty to discuss this matter now, whether these negotiations have reached any conclusive stage, or <Col N="55" /> if he thinks it would be embarrassing to express a viewpoint at all.  If he does think so, I shall not press him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The negotiations are still continuing, and I leave it to the Deputy to use his own judgment in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is just as well that the Dáil should know certain facts. The selection of the Shannon as the site for a transatlantic airport was made following consultation with all the international experts whom we could contact.  If my recollection serves me aright, it was particularly and strongly recommended by the American experts who came here.  It is, of course, true to say that the Shannon site was influenced by the fact that at that time there was no decided expert opinion as to whether the conquest of the Atlantic would be by means of land planes or flying boats.  There were as many experts of one opinion as of the other and we felt that, in view of the lack of decision, it was desirable to locate the airport at a site where either type of development would be both convenient and possible.  The Shannon site was ideal for that purpose.</P>
      <P>Obviously, this country cannot be expected to provide two airports of the size and with the equipment necessary for transatlantic operation.  Apart altogether from that obvious fact, there is another fact equally obvious; Dublin Airport is, if anything, overcrowded, catering as it does for all the services to Britain and Europe.  We must contemplate a continued expansion of air travel and, consequently, an increasing strain upon the resources of Dublin Airport.  It would be ridiculous to think that it would be possible to transfer to Dublin any of the Shannon traffic without creating conditions akin to chaos at Collinstown and without severely restricting the development of Irish civil aviation activities to Britain and Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to express an opinion as to the value of these restrictive clauses inserted in bilateral air agreements.  I do, however, deplore the suggestion that the future of <Col N="56" /> Shannon Airport depends upon the maintenance of these restrictive clauses.  Once again, I reiterate my faith that we are only at the very beginning of civil aviation development and that inevitably, assuming international peace, air traffic will grow. As it grows, it will cater for wider classes of people in its passenger services and for increasing tonnages of goods in its freight services.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary for us to be perturbed because there is a prospect that first-class traffic, that is traffic anxious to get from its point of departure to its ultimate destination in the shortest possible time regardless of cost, may at some stage by-pass Shannon.  Long before considerations of cost will have ceased to be of interest in relation to first-class traffic, a great volume of second-class traffic will be developing; and when traffic costs have been reduced there will then be a third-class traffic development in relation to which considerations of cost and economy in operation will always be a vital factor. Looking into the future and ignoring entirely the passenger traffic potentialities of the Atlantic route, we can see an increasing development in freight traffic in which cost will always be a predominant consideration and to encourage which the legislation establishing Shannon as a free airport was enacted some years ago.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, it is important to urge that the Department of Industry and Commerce and the air companies should not allow themselves to be intimidated by any repetition of the ridiculous statements to which we were accustomed in the past from the present Minister for Agriculture in relation to civil aviation.  Certainly they should not allow that misinformed criticism to limit them in any way in their efforts to maintain Shannon as an up-to-date airport in the matter of technical equipment.  It is a fact that Shannon Airport is well equipped with all the most up-to-date navigational aids installed in compliance with the standards laid down by the international authority for transatlantic airports. It is a fact that it was efficiently staffed and efficiently managed that secured its position in the past; these <Col N="57" /> facts will continue to secure its position in the future and continue to attract to it an increasing share of the inevitably increasing volume of transatlantic traffic.  I think it is desirable that that should be stated and that disparaging statements and gloomy forecasts should be thoroughly discounted.</P>
    <P>It may be that it is wise to postpone, as this Government has postponed, the construction of permanent buildings at the Shannon.  The temporary buildings there are reasonably satisfactory.  In view of the development in equipment and in the design of airport buildings, plus the element of uncertainty as to the type of traffic which the airport will handle in the future, we can afford to go slow in capital investment of that kind.  But the fact that temporary buildings are being used is no argument in favour of having the equipment of the airport less than first-class.</P>
    <P>I recognise that there may be some difficulty on behalf of the Government or on behalf of the Parliamentary Secretary in speaking upon this question of the negotiations with the United States authorities.  I shall not press the Parliamentary Secretary to declare himself at this stage in that regard, but I do ask the Government to clarify in the public mind their attitude to air transport.  I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to give the House an assurance that the initial policy of curtailment upon which the Government appeared obviously decided two years ago has since been reconsidered and revised, and that all the aid, all the drive and all the support necessary to secure the continued expansion of our activities in the air will be forthcoming.  If that assurance can be given by the Parliamentary Secretary, then not merely shall we facilitate him in getting this Bill enacted before 1st April, but we shall do so enthusiastically.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will accept the invitation given to him by Deputy Lemass to avail of the introduction of the Second Stage of this Bill for the purpose of making a general statement of the Government's policy in relation <Col N="58" /> to civil aviation.  I think there can be no difficulty in getting general agreement with much of what Deputy Lemass said.  Treating us to a history of the development of civil aviation in this country over the past 18 to 20 years, the burden of his speech was a plea for faith in the future of this form of transport.  The only reply I would make to Deputy Lemass is this.  I do not do it by way of defence.  We on these benches&mdash;the Party to which I belong&mdash;have never made a fetish of criticising the development of our aviation services, nor have we ever made a fetish of welcoming retrenchment for retrenchment's sake where we felt that the capital expenditure that was being undertaken was wise. We always welcomed it.  However, I think Deputy Lemass will agree that we must&mdash;to an extent, at any rate&mdash; cut our cloth according to our measure.  What that measure is I am not in a position to state with any degree of certitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time it was decided to scrap the Constellations and abandon the transatlantic services many of us had heart-searchings as to whether it was or was not the correct thing to do.  I am not yet in a position to answer that question.  I do not agree with the proposition which Deputy Lemass put to the House, whereunder he asked acceptance of the idea that, if a case can be made for subsidising cross-Channel air services or air services to the Continent, it is a logical and a necessary <i>sequitur</i> that a similar case is capable of being made and is tenable in respect of transatlantic services.  It may be so, but I do not think it follows as a logical consequence one from the other.  My view of the steps that have been taken by the Government to date is that even if they were, in Deputy Lemass's view and in the view of his Party, retrograde steps, at least they are steps that can easily be retraced. If a case can be made in the future that it is necessary or desirable or advisable that transatlantic air services should again be inaugurated, that our Irish air companies should again carry passengers across the Atlantic, I do not think we shall be faced with any <Col N="59" /> terrible difficulty in getting back into that business.</P>
    <P>There is one overriding consideration that, I think, must govern any decisions as to capital expenditure on either aircraft or machinery and that is the speed and quickness with which the ultra modern aircraft and machinery and equipment of to-day becomes the obsolescent, or obsolete, maybe, machine or equipment of to-morrow. For that very reason I think a case can be made for, perhaps, if not hastening slowly, hastening with a good deal of caution.  To the protagonists of speedy development of civil aviation a good deal of embarrassment was caused by reason of the fact that stupid mistakes &mdash;minor, if one wishes&mdash;were made in the operation and management of our existing air services.  I do not think that this is the time or the place to enumerate those mistakes or to deal with them.  I think everybody in the House knows that things were done which gave rise to properly founded criticism. However, that criticism was then seized upon by certain people&mdash;and God knows we have plenty of them in this country&mdash;who are opponents of any kind of progress, be it social, economic or scientific.  I think it is a pity that that took place.</P>
    <P>I was glad Deputy Lemass approached this Bill and the discussion of this question in the non-partisan fashion in which he did.  If there is going to be any protracted discussion of this measure I hope it will be on similar lines.  I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to accede to the request made to him to give us a general statement on the Government's civil aviation policy.  It may, perhaps, be difficult for him to do that.  He may not have intended to do that in introducing this Bill.  He may feel that this is not the occasion on which to do it&mdash;that, perhaps, it would be better to do so on the introduction of the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Nevertheless, I think he should accede to the suggestion made to him and give the House a general indication of the Government's views on this question.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to private enterprise. <Col N="60" /> I sincerely hope that, in the field of air transport, no undue encouragement will be given for the intervention of private enterprise.  If we are to develop civil aviation services in this country I hope that they will be developed solely by companies publicly owned and controlled.  That point of view will, probably, meet with as little sympathy from Deputies on this side of the House as it will from Deputies on the benches opposite.  With that I am not concerned.  I merely make that point to the Parliamentary Secretary for his consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass referred to the fact that the D.C.3's now being operated by Aer Lingus may next year not conform to the requisite international standards.  I do not know whether that is so or not.  However, I understand that if it is so their continued use may be possible as freight carriers.</P>
    <P>The question of American pressure was referred to.  I take it that that is a subject upon which we cannot, at the moment, press the Parliamentary Secretary. Let me content myself by saying that I hope that any pressure from any outside source&mdash;directed towards causing us to alter whatever policy the Government has decided is in the best interests of the State&mdash;will, in this as in every other respect, be resisted and strongly resisted.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude on this note. If it is not possible for the Parliamentary Secretary at this stage to deal with some of the matters that have been raised I would suggest to him that either he or the Minister for Industry and Commerce should, on the Committee Stage or on the Fourth Stage of this Bill, give us a general indication of the line of policy the Government intends to follow in respect of this important field of national development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly interested in this Bill because, first and foremost, it deals with a matter of vital importance for the people of my constituency. I do not, however, propose to detain the House very long but I should like to draw attention to some of the criticisms levelled by the last speaker at Deputy Lemass's speech.  I think that Deputy Lemass set a very <Col N="61" /> good headline, which might be copied with advantage by other Deputies in approaching this matter from a non-Party point of view.  Deputy Lehane stated that mistakes were made in the beginning but I think it is time that somebody pointed out another aspect of the matter.  It has been truly said that a person who never made a mistake never made anything at all, but the fact is that this company which was established many years ago has been one of the most successful, from the point of view of operation, of any company in the world.  I think it is a matter of pride for Irishment that this company has been able to operate for such a lengthy period without any serious accident.  It reflects the greatest credit not merely on the management of the company but on the efficiency of its workers, on the efficiency of Irishmen who have thus proven that they are amongst the best aviators in the world.  My only regret is that a number of them have lost their employment and have had to go abroad to earn the livelihood denied them here by the sale of the Constellation aircraft and the subsequent closing down of the Lockheed works which threw 300 men out of remunerative employment.  These men were all highly skilled mechanics and they are now scattered all over the world. Deputy Lehane pointed out that the Government can retrace its steps and change its point of view.  That may be so, but can it restore this industry which has been such a big loss to my constituents?  I am afraid that it is now too late and that that cannot possibly be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy Lemass, I do not want to press the Parliamentary Secretary for a statement which might be in any way embarrassing to him or to the Government at the present time but as soon as he or the Minister can do so, I think an assurance should be given to the House and to the people that there will be no weakening in our efforts to maintain our independent position and that, so far as the Shannon is concerned at all events, every step will be taken by the Minister and by the Government&mdash;and I might add with the backing of the entire House&mdash;to see that there is no interference with the <Col N="62" /> operation of the Shannon airport and that no dictation will be permitted from any outside Power whatever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the Parliamentary Secretary should have availed of the introduction of this Bill to give a concise statement of Government policy in regard to civil aviation. We do not appear to be clear in our own minds as to what exactly is intended in the field of civil aviation. It must be clear to the Parliamentary Secretary and to the Government, as a result of the speeches that have been made here this evening, that in the development of civil aviation, every support and encouragement, financial and otherwise, that may be required, will be made available without question by the House.  I feel that it is only right that tribute should be paid to the officials of all kinds and types who run our air services at the moment for their magnificent record of efficiency and safety.  I think that record is a remarkable one and that it is due entirely to the competence and the efficiency of everybody concerned with our air services.  I agree with Deputy Lemass that the future of transport is in the air.</P>

      <P>In fact.  I think that is a reasonable conclusion from developments over the past few years.  This problem of the transatlantic air services will undoubtedly come up again. When, on the establishment of the present Government, the matter was halted, it was halted for the purposes of examination.  There has been a period of two years in which to examine the problem.  I am quite certain that this examination over a period of two years must have convinced the Minister and the Government that transatlantic air services should be established.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not matter.  There is always a fight between a system of transport that is going out and the system that is coming <Col N="63" /> in.  I think that it was one of the criticisms of ourselves in the past that we made no real or genuine effort to build up a mercantile marine.  We made no real or genuine effort to build up a sea service although this was a country that was ideally situated for the establishment of such a service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that vested interests to some extent blocked us but a lot of the failure was due principally to our own lack of resolution in regard to it.  I feel that there is now an opening this new method of transport both for passengers and cargo and that by being in on the ground floor, as it were, by being in at the beginning, we can create a service which will provide exceptionally well-paid employment for many thousands of our people and will enable Ireland to take a foremost place in the matter of aviation.  I am quite sure that these considerations are receiving the attention of the Minister and of the Government.  It is for that reason that I would have liked to have, in the introduction of this Bill, a statement of Government policy from the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass and Deputy Lehane have both mentioned&mdash;but passed away from&mdash;this question of what is known as &ldquo;American pressure.&rdquo;  Deputy Lemass says he does not want to embarrass the Parliamentary Secretary and the Parliamentary Secretary says the negotiations are on at the moment. I want to give the man in the street's view in regard to this.  We have in Shannon equipped an airport that will take all these transatlantic airliners. The suggestion has been made that they will overfly Rineanna, and that it would be desirable and necessary for us, if we as a country are to get the benefits of this air service, to have another airport equipped to take these transatlantic liners in the vicinity of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin is a very short distance away from Shannon, relatively speaking, and the general impression created by that situation was that America was anxious to have another airport in this country <Col N="64" /> which would be able to take American heavy bombers in time of war or emergency. That is the &ldquo;pressure&rdquo; that has been hinted at this evening.  I think there ought to be a very clear and specific statement from the Government, through the Parliamentary Secretary, as to whether any such pressure as that has been exercised, or if the Government feel that pressure of that type is in fact being used by the American Government in regard to this country.  I think the Government know and the Parliamentary Secretary knows, and it has been so stated here by Deputy Lehane, that we as a people would resent any such pressure by America or by any other foreign State, and that if pressure of that kind were exercised for the purpose of involving us in a war in the future that pressure would be resisted and the Government in resisting it would have the full support of the people as a whole.</P>
    <P>It is an unfortunate thing, in regard to war, at the moment, that declarations generally are not made in advance. The war simply comes and the places that are to be occupied by the contending parties, the vitally strategic places, are occupied at once.  If we are to provide facilities for the landing of heavy bombers in this country, we hold such an important strategic position that there is the danger that those positions will be occupied some morning before we wake up.  That is a matter which must be before the Government for earnest consideration and it must be before the people as a whole.  Collinstown is very near Dublin and if Collinstown is to be occupied by a force, and if some other force comes to bomb that particular place, we here in the City of Dublin will not be in a very happy situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not be here very long.  I think those are the serious matters that Deputy Lemass hinted at and they are serious from the point of view of the general public.  If the Parliamentary Secretary will make a statement on that matter now, that statement will be appreciated.  If he indicates that it is not desirable to make it now, I do say that, in the public interest, <Col N="65" /> the earliest possible opportunity should be availed of to make a statement in regard to it.  The Parliamentary Secretary might be able to say whether it is intended to enlarge and extend Collinstown so that it will take the largest and the heaviest traffic from the skies.  A statement even on that aspect of it will be of some help to us in assessing the present situation.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer only to one section in the Bill, Section 8, which provides that when the Minister becomes entitled under the Principal Act to acquire compulsorily any land, he may enter on and take possession of that land before the matters of title or compensation are cleared up.  It is an extraordinary thing that for two years in this House that particular step has been advocated in regard to the taking over of land for the purpose of building houses.  It has been advocated for the purpose of curtailing the delay that faces local authorities in the acquisition of land for houses.  Now, in the matter of acquiring land for the development of aerodromes, that principle has been included in the Bill.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary think there is such grave urgency in regard to the acquisition of land for aerodromes that there must be this extra facility or speed in the acquisition of land before the matters of compensation and title have been finally determined?  If so, is that to enable certain lands which are in mind at the moment to be acquired speedily, and if so what is the purpose of that speedy acquisition?  I do hope that the Minister for Local Government will examine the section and that he will be able to avail of it, or of a similar section, in connection with the acquisition of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone will agree that in a matter of this importance it is desirable that discussion should be entirely free from any suggestion of Party rivalries or Party politics.  The debate this evening has proceeded in that way and for that the Parliamentary Secretary and Deputy Lemass and the other Deputies who participated in the debate are to be congratulated.  If each of us will endeavour to give this matter all the thought and consideration it deserves, if we can look into the future in the <Col N="66" /> way we ought to look into the future, it is quite possible that we will be able to build up an air service which will be a very valuable asset to the country. In that spirit I accept in general the principles that are contained in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as this Bill is concerned we are supporting it because we believe it is in the best interests of the country.  The request that the Parliamentary Secretary should make a statement on policy generally is one which I hope will be acceded to because the present position of the public mind in this matter is one of very grave doubt, even of discouragement.  I have heard it said that some of the staffs have become so discouraged that the standard of efficiency which originally was to be found in the staffs has deteriorated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the present Government came into office it started out by closing down the air services with America, with the result that the staffs of flyers were scattered over the world and the Lockheed shops were closed down. Deputy Con Lehane spoke of its being possible to retrace our steps but it certainly will be a very difficult thing to do.  It will take time to train staffs. I do not know whether it will be possible to get the Lockheed Company to come back or not.  The opportunity, which was a golden opportunity&mdash;perhaps I should call it a dollar opportunity&mdash;is lost.  All preparations had been made to start the service on the 17th March of that year.  In the changing circumstances, other factors have emerged since that deplorable step was taken which should make any Government reconsider the situation. At that time people were not advocating that as many dollars as possible should be brought into this country. It is since then that the necessity for doing that has become more emphasised in the public mind. People did not realise at that time how important our tourist traffic was and that it was worth spending money on that enormous tourist traffic, that we should try to get more dollars rather than sterling by making it easier for Americans to come to this country, travelling by Irish services.  When the question was raised in the Dáil the <Col N="67" /> Minister for Finance said: &ldquo;Yes, but they can come just as well by the American service.&rdquo;  If they come by the American service, obviously we do not earn the dollars.</P>
    <P>Then again there is the defence situation which has arisen and the sheer necessity of spending moneys so that we should have communications with the outer world in time of crisis.  We should learn from our experience of the past.  We went into the last emergency without any of these protective measures but we all felt that we needed communications by air services and otherwise and by a short-wave service with the outer world.  There are now very weighty and urgent reasons why, even if the Government still think they were right in shutting down the service at that time, they should now change their mind and try to establish an Atlantic air service.  From the point of view of traffic, it is admitted by the experts that the passage from America to Ireland is the bottle-neck of most of the European traffic.  If we can capture a portion even of that, we are assured of having a sound business concern.</P>
    <P>Deputy Con Lehane seems to speak with a divided mind.  The psychology of coalition seems to affect people to such an extent that they cannot make up their minds about anything.</P>

      <P>We in Clann na Poblachta are making up our own minds in our own Party and are not going to be influenced by one individual, as Fianna Fáil are.  Like some of the other Deputies, I would welcome a statement from the Parliamentary Secretary with regard to Government policy for civil aviation.  There is no doubt that there is a fog over the whole business at the moment and it is very hard to find out exactly where we stand.  It is a good thing to hear Deputies on both sides expressing a wish that we should develop our air services to as great an extent as possible; in other words, to the extent to which we can afford to develop them. We are in a much better position to do so now, in view of the state of affairs which has existed since the previous Government went out of office.  It was certainly necessary for this Government to call a halt when they came in and to find out where we stood, because all sorts of schemes were on foot and it was very difficult to distinguish the wheat from the chaff.  The Government should now be in a position to make their policy clear as they have had plenty of time to make up their minds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to one section of those who are employed in our civil <Col N="69" /> aviation services, the pilots.  I understand that a good number of these pilots would not be available to us if another emergency arose and if they were called upon to return to the forces in which they previously served.  This is a very important point on which we should get information.  If it is a fact that a large proportion of these pilots would be lost to aviation in this country on the outbreak of another war, it would be in our best interests to do something about that position, along the lines of giving encouragement to pilots who are being trained in the Irish Air Force, on the termination of their service, to enter civil aviation.  If necessary, they should get preference in that regard.  It would be a rather foolish situation to find ourselves in if to-morrow morning we had the planes while the men to fly them had disappeared. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary is in a position to give us a short statement of Government policy on civil aviation, although it may be unfair at this stage to ask him to do so. If he has not got a statement prepared on that matter, I hope we will hear such a statement from him in the very near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary one or two questions in regard to the general development of air policy and in relation to facilities at Shannon Airport. In connection with the controversy which has arisen in regard to the distance of Dublin from Shannon Airport, I should like to ask whether the Parliamentary Secretary has investigated the facilities for transport from Shannon Airport to the first train leaving Limerick for Dublin.  So far as I know, there is a need for an improvement in communications from the hour of about 7 o'clock in the morning until 9 o'clock in the morning.  Passengers who arrive from America and who wish to go on to Dublin and do not wish to take the plane, which leaves at 12 o'clock, are only able to get extremely expensive taxis at that early hour of the morning.  There are two friends of mine who arrived and who had only that alternative.  In one case, for some reason or other, there was not a taxi <Col N="70" /> available at that early hour to bring the passenger to Limerick station.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask also whether the Parliamentary Secretary has caused to be examined the whole question of the communications between Shannon airport and Dublin, and why it is that the plane service to Dublin is not availed of so readily&mdash;whether there is adequate publicity in regard to it in America and whether everything is being done to give people an exact account of how they can progress from Shannon airport to other parts of the country.  The Department of Industry and Commerce might be able to give helpful information and advice on that matter to air companies.  American friends of mine have inquired in regard to the matter and have not always been able to get the information as to how they can get from Shannon airport to any other point.  It seems to me that there should be some sort of coordinated travel information provided in regard to bus, rail and plane services. It may be that my information is a little out of date, but that certainly was the case in regard to travel offices in the middle western part of America and it affected the interests of people of Irish origin who wanted to pay a call to Ireland on the way to Europe.  More help could be given in that regard.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to extend the length or the scope of the debate, but it has been suggested that the proportion of people who travel from Munster to Europe and Great Britain by sea and rail is very much higher than the proportion who travel to Britain and Europe from the provinces and the regions nearer Dublin and Dublin City.  I was merely inquiring whether that aspect had been examined in the light of the general progress of the European service and whether Aer Lingus had ever undertaken any kind of research as to the first origin of passengers.  Allied to that is the question of having a feeder service from Cork to Dublin or a direct service from Cork to Europe and Great Britain.  I presume that it would be entirely from Cork to Britain.</P>
      <P>Again, in connection with the general development of aviation across the Atlantic, I should like to ask whether everything possible is being done to make use of Shannon Airport as a tourist centre and whether any experiments have been carried out of recent date to encourage passengers arriving there from America to take a tour around the country other than in a private car, whether any facilities in that respect have been suggested and whether the Parliamentary Secretary considers that such a scheme would be likely to succeed.  It was very interesting to hear that Deputies of the Government Party are now reconsidering the question of a transatlantic service.  I do not wish to be controversial, but I would not agree with Deputy Cowan.  At least in my constituency when the suggestion was made that the transatlantic service should be cancelled for re-examination of the matter there was widespread hostility to it at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to repeat what other Deputies have said, that we would like to hear more of the Government's policy with regard to civil aviation in this country.  All civil aviation development must be speculative and must cost very large sums of money.  There is little or no profit to be made for a long period and, as with the development of all forms of communications, the Government of the day have got to assume that there will be an increase <Col N="72" /> by some speculative percentage in the number of persons coming by air from all parts of the world across the Atlantic and develop air policy accordingly.  They are bound to take a very large gamble with regard to any development and cannot wait until ideal planes are produced or more inventions discovered to facilitate aviation.</P>
    <P>Lastly I should like to advert to the observation of Deputy Cowan regarding the fear that pressure might be brought to bear by the United States for the reconstruction of Dublin Airport to suit the purpose of war.  I do not think that need be of very much concern to the Parliamentary Secretary in itself until he also allies with it the question of our own air defence.</P>

      <P>Glancing over this Bill one notices that it deals with certain details but it is rather difficult to get any picture of what precise policy is the driving force behind it; in other words, what precisely we are aiming at with regard to the development of air services in this country.  That thought seems to be worrying some of the Government Deputies in addition and I think it might not be any harm if we were told at some convenient time what exactly is to be our policy regarding these services.  First there is the paramount practical consideration that you are dealing with something which in its nature is very expensive.  When you commit yourself to a particular line you are setting something in motion which involves expense and which also has a certain amount of inertia; by not pursuing energetically along the line on which you are launched, your effort represents in the end a waste.  I do not wish to go back, to say &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; or indulge in criticism of what has been done because spilt milk is spilt milk, but there is one lesson we can learn.  If you lightly throw over something and later decide to go on with it you will not only have all the disadvantages and difficulties with which you initially were faced but you will have in addition certain specific difficulties caused by your hesitation. Perhaps I am being premature.  It is reading too much into the Bill as it stands to say that we are being <Col N="73" /> invited to consider transatlantic services again but, rightly or wrongly, I have got the impression since coming into the House that such an idea is abroad here now.  If we are it is a great pity that we will not have the benefit of having made a start already, but on the other hand, if we are to make a late start we must face up to it.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly the development of air services here is something of more than ordinary importance to us.  It is of some importance, as some people have always advocated, from the point of view of the day-to-day life of the country and it has assumed a peculiar importance that even its advocates could not have foreseen in full with regard to present-day economy in so far as it could be a factor in a dollar earning campaign.  Undoubtedly it would be expensive, but its value would be that it would be a machine for exchange.  Even though it may be expensive still it will earn dollars and you will be able to pay much of the expense in the currency you are not particularly short of and to that extent it is an advantage.  I could go on in detail and build up a case for a transatlantic service, but I would like to hear whether it is contemplated.  If it is to be redeveloped I presume we will be told.  If it is, I should like to encourage it in so far as even from the present-day point of view it has its attractions, but from the point of view of future development it has even more. I think that Deputy Lemass mentioned earlier this evening its importance as a link with outside in the case of a crisis.  A particular type of plane is involved which would not be easily got and if that is to be taken into consideration it is a question of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that in the Bill a period of five years is referred to in another connection. That period of five years seems to turn up in other more menacing connections if one follows international affairs and it might be no harm if we used that limit of five years as a basis for quick development, the plain fact being that whatever chance you have of getting facilities, personnel and equipment now your chances will become more remote as time goes on, that is, of course, always assuming <Col N="74" /> that the international situation continues on the lines on which unfortunately it seems bent on continuing. Already two years have been lost. Already personnel have been scattered certain facilities have been lost and equipment has been scattered.  I only refer to these things to suggest that if this matter is to be seriously considered there is an urgency about it. Perhaps I would become irrelevant by getting into defence matters and I content myself in regard to this aspect of the matter in asking the Parliamentary Secretary to pay some attention to the question of a liaison between his ordinary day-to-day peacetime requirements and his possible requirements if it becomes necessary to tie up with defence.  A considerable amount of money is being spent on these matters and a considerable amount of money is also being spent on defence and the question of tying these up together for the maximum average benefit to the community should be considered.  We, in this country, fortunately have not had a history of actual hostilities which would drive that lesson home to us.  If there was any lesson we were likely to learn in the last emergency had it gone to the stage of being involved in hostilities, that lesson would have been the insufficiency of any proper co-ordination between the ordinary economic side of Government, the day-to-day living side of Government, if I may call it such, and the emergency defence requirements which would arise in such a situation.  I will content myself, as this is more a defence matter than a matter under this Bill, by asking the Parliamentary Secretary to see that in his Department this aspect is not forgotten in planning and in organisation and that an adequate liaison is maintained both in theory and, more important still, in actual practical effect. The details of the matter can wait for the Estimates or another Bill.</P>
    <P>The question of development of our air services generally calls for one remark and it is this: that if you have your service developed and, so to speak, have your market already developed sufficiently, thereby actually being in the field with your own little corner completely to yourself or to <Col N="75" /> some extent to yourself, it gives you a prescriptive right and has the practical effect of excluding competition to some extent and leaving you more or less alone.  In other words, the fact that you are developed in that particular field is something done in the direction of protecting your integrity. The same would apply to our Atlantic service and even internal air services.  That reference is made both in regard to ordinary peace time and to defence in the future.  If you are able to do the job yourself and to supply the service, you remove much of the inducement to others to come in and, by keeping the situation under your own control, you so far contribute to your own national integrity.</P>
    <P>I think that is a fair principle.  I think that it is on that principle, mainly apart from the economic advantages that one would hope to reap from a development of this nature, that you can justify expenditure and all the expense that attends on such a development as is contemplated.</P>
    <P>Coming to the Bill in further detail, there is the question of the compulsory acquisition of lands for airports.  The marginal note reads: &ldquo;Entry on land, etc., compulsorily acquired under the principal Act before conveyance or ascertainment of compensation.&rdquo;  That is probably nothing more than an administrative convenience.  However, I may say, apart from the context, that except there is really great urgency in matters of acquisition or dealing with private property of this nature, I think it is unwise further to encroach upon the rights of individuals than we have done unless there is very serious justification for it.  Already, the State machine has appropriated to itself very large powers in that regard for the benefit of the community.  My own personal opinion is that it has got to the stage where we should lean a little in our consideration in favour of the private owner, in favour of the person whose property is being acquired by the State.  On the other hand, I am willing to concede that matters of urgency for the benefit of the community must be taken into account. That was justifiably mentioned in the case of housing.  But for the acquisition <Col N="76" /> of lands for such a purpose as this I think such a power should not be taken unless there is some great urgency.  I refer to this period of five years.  There may be that urgency, but I think that the Parliamentary Secretary should justify in this House the reasons for such a procedure in a Bill such as this; that the people should be told in advance, anyway, what lands it is intended to acquire.</P>
    <P>We can visualise two things.  We can visualise either the extension of present aerodromes, such as Collinstown or Rineanna, or the development of such airfields as exist but which cannot be reckoned as first-class or workable fields.  That would be, so to speak, a foreseeable development. Another might be the development of proper airports near our principal towns, say, in the vicinity of Cork, for the purpose of linking up with big airports or other internal air communications. Whether that would be an economically justifiable thing or not I am for the moment leaving to one side.</P>
    <P>Lastly, there might also be the question of developing air fields, say, for external use.  I mean external use, in the sense of airfields as ports for use between here and England or here and across the Atlantic.  Therefore there are a number of possibilities. The people should know for what purpose the land is being acquired, for what purpose this section is inserted and what are the places where land is likely to be acquired for the purpose of developing air defences.  Of course, I also concede to the Parliamentary Secretary that perhaps from the point of view of the Department of Finance he may not like to say: &ldquo;I am going to set up an airport in such-and-such a place&rdquo; for fear it might lead to speculation in respect to the land being acquired.  Nevertheless, the people should be given some information.</P>
    <P>Further, some information should be given as to what the purpose of the development is.  The one trouble at the moment is that the idea was so well sold a few years ago, particularly in regard to transatlantic operation, by certain people, by members of the Government and their supporters, that <Col N="77" /> many people were convinced that transatlantic air communications were a waste, that the development of our air services was a waste and an unnecessary luxury in this country, a luxury for which we could not afford to pay.  If we now reverse engines, if we find, on a proper analysis and a proper view of this subject, that these things are worth developing, it is only fair that the people should be given the reasons and let them know where they stand.  The unfortunate effect of the type of thing which has happened is that it leads to rumours and speculations and unrest, to people of a certain type using their ingenuity to see what can possibly be behind something perfectly simple.  The only thing to nail that is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  It would be interesting, however, to know just precisely what lands are in question and what development is contemplated.</P>
    <P>The remainder of the Bill appears to be simply a matter of detail.  To use Deputy McQuillan's words, there is a bit of a fog over the whole business and in that fog it is rather difficult to interpret precisely what the Bill aims at. For my own part, I am willing to accept that it is designed for nothing more than to deal with these details which, in ordinary administration, have been found to need some adjustment.  It has been brought in to deal with this question of subsidy, as the Parliamentary Secretary has stated.  There are, however, so many details covered in the Bill and there are so many things, like the power for acquisition and this Section 16, &ldquo;By-laws relating to aerodromes&rdquo; and so forth, that the ingenious person would not be without material upon which to speculate in the wildest manner and on the basis of which to circulate the wildest rumours. That being the situation, I think it would be well for the Parliamentary Secretary to clarify things, to let us know precisely where we stand in these matters, to let us know particularly in regard to these transatlantic services which, frankly, I did not think would come in under this Bill; I did not see its relation to it until it was developed in the House.</P>
    <P>There is definitely this defence question; <Col N="78" /> there is particularly this question that any dealing with this matter should be tied up with the probable defence of Ireland within the next five years.  Taking all these things into account, I see nothing objectionable in the Bill, in any of its provisions.  But again, I suggest, with others who have spoken, that the Parliamentary Secretary might help us by clearing away the fog to which reference has been made.</P>

      <P>We have heard quite a lot about air services and the necessity for developing them.  I think Cork has been very badly treated so far as air services are concerned.  I should like to point out that very often there are four or five liners coming into Cobh. We have two airfields outside Cork, one within three miles of the city and the other within four miles of Cobh. These airfields could be made available for services even from Limerick airport.  I should like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary if it is the desire of the Government to develop the airfields that exist in the vicinity of Cork City.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what Deputies expect to get in the nature of a statement of policy, or what a mere expression of view can do to assist them to understand the Government's viewpoint on civil aviation.  In so far as the Government have a responsibility for ensuring that civil aviation is developed on certain lines, and in view of the financial commitments to which we are liable under the Air Navigation and Transport Act in respect of subsidies to the air companies, our policy is to provide efficient air services and to run them at a profit, and, if it is not possible to run them at a profit, to keep the loss as low as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as any steps that could be taken to increase the efficiency of the air companies or to implement any statements made when the Government came into office are concerned, I think the reduction in the loss which was effected last year is in itself an indication of the effectiveness of Government policy in that regard.  I am glad to say &mdash;and I can agree with the statements of a number of Deputies here&mdash;that the air companies here have an efficient <Col N="79" /> record, particularly in so far as safety in operation is concerned.  It is true that at the end of the war, when civil aviation revived after hostilities ceased, Aer Lingus became top heavy, but I think the steps that were taken in the past couple of years have reduced the effect which the anticipated expansion of the services and the consequent substantial increase in the numbers of persons employed by the company created.</P>
    <P>At that time people were employed on the basis that there would be a great increase in the number of flights, in the passenger and freight traffic.  It is also true to say that the increase in the number of persons employed and in the general administration of the company was tied up with the proposed transatlantic air service by Aer Linte.  That service was abandoned by this Government after mature consideration, after they had examined the records of other air companies operating transatlantic air services, and after taking into consideration their responsibility to the taxpayers for keeping the financial commitments as low as possible.</P>
    <P>I do not think there would be any advantage in discussing now the wisdom or otherwise of that decision beyond saying that I suppose there is no science&mdash;certainly there are few sciences&mdash;which has witnessed such development and expansion over the past quarter of a century&mdash;certainly since the beginning of the last war&mdash;as aeronautical science, and for this company to embark on a transatlantic service in view of the experience other countries had was a thing which this Government did not feel they could reasonably accept.</P>
    <P>The losses which Aer Lingus incurred were reduced last year.  I hope the deficit anticipated in the coming year will show more reasonable proportions. I agree with Deputy Lemass that at the end of the war it was reasonable to assume that the possibilities of developing air traffic seemed to be greater than they have turned out to be in practice. It is true that Aer Lingus during one year had a profit, but it is also true that that was a very exceptional year. <Col N="80" /> That was the year when hostilities ended and large numbers of people were anxious to get business contacts, either to resume old associations or secure new contacts, and make up for the time lag which had operated during the war period, when they were prevented from getting across to Britain. Restrictions on movements were relaxed and there was a great rush in the latter part of 1945 and in the early part of 1946.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Government can take any steps to improve the existing services or to provide services which will show a remunerative return, then all our energies will be bent in that direction.  On the question as to whether we intend to operate new services or provide more frequent services on existing routes, our decision will depend on traffic potentialities.  Aer Lingus is constantly alive to the need for surveying the potentialities of the various routes.  That company during the past year has reopened routes that fell into abeyance during the war years but which were operated prior to the war.  It has also inaugurated some new services, according as it appeared to the company that there was a possibility of securing sufficient traffic to warrant such services being provided. In the coming year I understand the company proposes to continue those services on a seasonal basis or for whatever period during which it is likely to secure sufficient traffic to warrant such services on the same routes or on additional ones.</P>
    <P>A number of general matters were raised and I think that I have now covered the Government's policy in relation to those matters.  Discussion also centred on the negotiations which have taken place on and off between the American authorities and ourselves in so far as they affect the compulsory stop at Shannon.  At this stage I do not want to say much about that matter, but I think it is right that I should point out, particularly for the information of those Deputies who appear to labour under a misapprehension when they describe the negotiations as due to American pressure, that under the bilateral agreement concluded in February, 1945, there is provision for a revision of the terms of <Col N="81" /> that agreement.  In addition there is the right to terminate the agreement on a year's notice by either party.  It is, therefore, neither correct nor accurate to describe the negotiations or the discussions as due to American pressure.  Either party has the right to ask for a revision and either party has the right to terminate the agreement on a year's notice.</P>
    <P>In so far as Deputy Lemass has stated the facts about Shannon, I do not think anyone will disagree with him.  Shannon was selected as the site after examination by international aviaction experts.  With regard to the question of building another aerodrome, I think any Deputy who contemplates that step is misinformed as to the purpose of Shannon airport. That is quite a different matter, however, from the terms of the bilateral agreement concluded in 1945.  That is the agreement which obliges transatlantic users to stop at Shannon.  Up to the present the number of landings at Shannon has been fairly constant. As to whether the tendency is upward or downward, no one can form any definite opinion either way.  I do not think anyone could come to the conclusion that more planes will land there in the future than have landed in the past.  Under the agreement, if there should be a greater number of crossings of the Atlantic in the future, then they will be obliged to land there, but on the present surveys and with the present transatlantic traffic the number of planes stopping at Shannon has remained constant over the last few years.  It is a matter upon which different persons may have different opinions.</P>
    <P>There may be a wide diversity of opinions as to the future development of civil aviation.  It is only right to say that up to the present planes crossing the Atlantic cannot economically over-fly Shannon.  Even the stratocruisers carrying a full load, and these are the most up-to-date planes, cannot over-fly Shannon economically.  In so far, therefore, as aeronautical development is concerned there is no technical or economic reason why transatlantic planes should over-fly Shannon.  No machine has yet operated on the transatlantic service which, with a full load, <Col N="82" /> can within the bounds of practicability or within the bounds of possibility over-fly Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that we have expended considerable sums of money in providing a proper airport at Shannon together with the meteorological and other services necessary there.  While the airport buildings are not of a permanent nature, they are, nevertheless, adequate for present needs.  It is also true that Dublin Airport is overcrowded. If transatlantic operators were to come into Dublin the existing facilities would be entirely inadequate.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised specific points on sections of the Bill.  I think the only point worthy of consideration at this stage is that the Bill is designed to extend the limit for subsidy.  That is the main purpose of the Bill.  The other sections are merely for the purpose of tidying up or making provisions for matters that were not covered in the earlier Bills.  It is true that Section 8 is rather wide.  I agree with Deputy de Valera that power of this nature to acquire private property should only be taken in very exceptional circumstances.  The only reason for this provision is because airports have, from time to time, to be extended in order to meet with increased traffic or provide longer runways to accommodate different types of planes.  The delay in the acquisition of land for such a purpose can cause serious trouble and disruption at the airport. I would like to mention that notice is always given in advance to those persons whose land adjoins the airport of any proposed acquisition.  In so far as Dublin Airport is concerned, the people have been notified that certain extensions are contemplated and they are given adequate advance information of the nature and extent of the lands it is proposed to acquire.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers asked some questions about the facilities for transporting persons from Shannon Airport to Limerick City and also from Shannon Airport to Dublin.  He mentioned that persons landing at the airport have difficulty in catching the early train at Limerick.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that planes land at the airport at different times. Transatlantic planes very often land <Col N="83" /> during the night or in the early morning. It is not always possible to have public services available, but I understand that taxis are available if anybody wishes to leave the airport in the early hours of the morning.  At the airport there is adequate notice of the time of the departure of the Shannon-Dublin service.  Information is also available in regard to train services. I shall, however, have the matters which the Deputy mentioned brought to the notice of the company and also to the notice of Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything else I can add, in so far as Government policy is concerned, except to say that it is not the intention of the Government to reopen the transatlantic air service.  As I said at the outset, that decision was taken after careful consideration. I know that the Opposition do not agree with the decision but, in view of the heavy financial commitments which the Government had to meet in respect of subsidy to the air companies at that time and which, up to the present, have not been able to be run at a profit, the Government decided that it was not in the public interest that they should reopen the transatlantic air service.  The rumours which some Deputies have mentioned&mdash;or the extent to which there is some suspicion or some uneasiness&mdash;I believe, have no foundation.  Whatever justification there may have been, for a short time after the transatlantic air service was discontinued, that further cuts were contemplated, I think the last two years have dispelled any such idea. The stability which exists, both economic and social, is, I think, ample proof that the Government propose to continue the air companies and we hope that the success which has attended their activities up to the present will be increased in the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass asked me about the policy of the company in respect of D.C.3. aircraft.  Some consideration was given to the possibility of limiting the use of these aircraft or to the restriction of their use after a certain length of time.  I understand now that no limit has been placed on the use of these aircraft but that the company <Col N="84" /> have under consideration the question of acquiring suitable machines to replace them.  They have, I understand, examined and are still examining from time to time suitable aircraft with which to replace the D.C.3.'s when they are no longer suitable for service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I remind the House that on December 7th, when we last discussed this matter, I endeavoured to put the case of a number of clerical officers in Córas Iompair Éireann before the Minister&mdash;some 300 of them who retired prior to August, 1947, and who had received nothing in the form of compensation to meet the increased cost of living?  They might be described as individuals who are alone in that particular respect because all other public servants such as civil servants, teachers, Gardaí, members of local authorities and so forth have had assistance to meet the steep rise in the cost of living.  It is doubly hard in the case of these particular servants because, prior to August, 1947, these men were on wretchedly low salaries judged by any reasonable standard. <Col N="85" /> So far as clerical work was concerned, they were agreed to have been on a very low level indeed.  The Minister will agree, I am sure, that, in the case of any public servant who has to retire, he has to adjust his domestic circumstances immediately to less than half his income&mdash;and that is a difficult proposition even in normal times.  But in the case of this particular section of the community, whose salaries were so low, their difficulty was naturally increased by the fact that there was such a serious increase in the cost of living&mdash;not alone was their immediate income decreased by half but it was still further decreased by the relative increase in the cost of living.</P>
      <P>As I say there are only some 300 of these servants affected altogether and even allowing for the fact that the finances of the company are not in the state in which we would like them to be, nevertheless a reasonable easement of the position of these servants would by no means seriously upset the financial condition of the company at present.  I understand they have made representations to the chairman and that he is sympathetic with the point of view put forward but apparently there is a desire to await certain events here.  As I pointed out, I should be quite satisfied if the Minister were to express the opinion that he would like to see this matter approached in a sympathetic manner and if he would go further and say that, in fact, there is liberty under the present powers of the board, or in the powers that are now about to be conferred on it, to enable that examination to take place.  I think the Minister will agree that it is undesirable that a small section of public servants should be left in this rather pitiable position, and it is pitiable in the extreme so far as a large number of them are concerned.  Because of their small salaries, they were never in a position to meet the steep rise in the cost of living.  I do appeal to the Minister to give some indication here that would, shall I say, be a helpful guidance so far as the present board is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing the section on the ground that I think it is unnecessary.  The section proposes to give power to the Minister to confer on the board by Order powers additional to those laid down in Section 12.  The Minister may by such Order provide for incidental and supplementary provisions which he considers to be necessary or expedient. Again the Minister may revoke or amend any such Order.  Then there is <Col N="87" /> a provision in which it is stated that any such Order made must be made with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  There is a further provision that that Order will not come into operation until it is confirmed by resolution of each House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

      <P>There are safeguards there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there appear to be safeguards but in effect there is not the safeguard that should be there. I take it that in drafting Section 12, the Minister made provision for every possible power that he thought this company should have.  Undoubtedly the powers contained in Section 12 are very extensive and very wide.  In addition to that, other powers are vested in the board by this Bill.  In other words they are given all the powers that Córas Iompair Éireann was given and all the powers of the Canal Company.  They are vested under the Act itself with the very widest powers.  If Section 13 were confined to conferring powers incidental or supplementary to those granted in the Act, something could be said for it, but this board can only operate under express powers provided by Parliament. I feel that it is unwise for Parliament to agree to any restriction of its own powers such as is contained here in Section 13.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a general tendency in every Government Department, no matter what Bill is concerned, to include a section such as this.  If we followed that procedure consistently, after a while this House would simply become a place for either approving or disapproving of Orders made by a Minister.  I think that is unwise.  I should like the Minister to indicate what circumstances in his opinion justify this section.  As I have said in the case of other Bills, if there was no such section as this, if the board felt that it required additional powers and if the Minister thought the board was right in looking for these additional powers, an amending Bill would be introduced. That amending Bill would have to go through all the usual stages in this House and in the Seanad and <Col N="88" /> would have to receive its final sanction in the signature of the President.  This section curtails that particular procedure.</P>
    <P>I feel that we are unwise if we agree to any such weakening of the powers of this House.  At some future date the board may feel that they require some particular power.  Then the Minister agrees they should have that power and makes an Order which comes before this House and before the Seanad for approval or disapproval.  It will be subject to one division in each House, subject to one argument; it cannot be amended; it must be approved or approval must be refused, but there is no power that I know of in the House to insert an amendment to an Order so made by the Minister.  On general principles, therefore, I am opposed to the provision of this power.  In particular, I am opposed to it when the draftsmen of the Minister and the board have gone to all the trouble of providing in this Bill for every power that they believe can or should be exercised in future.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, therefore, first and foremost, to indicate what kind of powers he thinks might be dealt with under this section.  I will go further, then, and ask him, on general principles&mdash;it will have to be faced up to sometime by this House&mdash;to withdraw the section, or at least that part of it which gives him authority to confer additional powers to those given by statute on the board which this Bill proposes to set up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know of any other subject that has received more attention in this House for the last five or six years than the very question to which attention has been drawn now by Deputy Peadar Cowan, that is, the question of Ministerial Order after Bills have been passed by this House.  I can always recollect an occasion here where, when my mind was immature at the time on such matters, my fears were very carefully set at rest by no less a person than Deputy Lemass, who informed us that it was an absolute impossibility to draft any measure that would, so to speak, remain absolute and complete for all time, that unless there was a certain <Col N="89" /> element of freedom, what might be described as day-to-day freedom, in a matter such as that of the Bill we are dealing with now, it would be absolutely impossible to have satisfactory legislation.</P>
      <P>Our grievances, and the grievances of the House all the time, have been about the fact that, where the Minister has attempted to take such powers, he did not allow the House some overriding consideration, to deal with those powers in the form in which this Bill under Section 4 now allows the House, where an Order can be tabled and the necessary steps taken to debate the subject in the House on the question of being for or against them.</P>
      <P>I gather that Deputy Cowan's main objection is that, although that safeguard is allowed here in the section, it would not be possible for him to move an amendment at that stage.  However, if that particular stage were reached&mdash;that is, the question of discussion of a Ministerial Order&mdash;and if it were a case where it was in conflict with the opinion of some members, it strikes me that the point to be reached then would be as to whether the Order made by the Minister was a good Order or a bad Order, whether desirable or otherwise, and the answer of the House should be either yes or no. From my experience here, I think the section as drawn is in line with legislation of a kind to which we have given general agreement; and so long as there is a safeguard in the Bill&mdash;which has not been given to us sometimes&mdash; which gives the House an opportunity to deal with the points here, I think we have sufficient safeguards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cowan is not right when he says that under Section 12 we have all the powers which the company requires or may require. One of the difficulties was that, if you set out to make Section 12 so all-embracing that it would give the power to meet any contingency, it would be open to the still greater objection, from my point of view, of having the powers far too wide altogether. There is nothing whatever sinister about this Section 13.  It is there not merely because we feel that it may be necessary but I might almost <Col N="90" /> say because we know it will be necessary.</P>
      <P>It may be necessary for certain very worthwhile developments by the company, which Section 12 or Section 24 would not empower them to embark on.  Of course, there is the safeguard there, as Deputy O'Sullivan has pointed out, that no Order made under Section 13 by the Minister can come into force unless and until it is confirmed by Resolution of both Houses. I want to put a case in point to the House&mdash;and I do not want anyone to draw any hasty or wrong conclusions from this.  Suppose the company tomorrow decided that it was desirable for them to enter into the production, transport and distribution of, say, ground limestone, Section 12 would not empower them to do that.  Or if the company decided, as I think they did contemplate at one time, to engage in the manufacture of certain engineering products for sale, I do not think the powers conferred on them, outside this power which I am proposing in Section 13, would enable them to do that. Certain developments may take place &mdash;I hope they will take place&mdash;regarding certain other transport systems in the country and again it may be necessary to have power to deal with them.</P>
      <P>I think Deputies, looking at this in a realistic way, will agree that, while it might be ideal every time you want additional power to come to the Dáil with a piece of legislation for that power and for that alone, it would not be very practicable.  I think that this is a desirable and necessary section and I do not see that there could be any objection whatever to it, particularly in view of the safeguard which is given in sub-section (4) of the section.</P>

      <P>Personally, I see no objection at all to a section of this kind if it is designed to give the Minister power to make minor adjustments in the Bill after it has become an Act and as the need arises but I could see objection if the power could be used to implement major changes of policy and I would regard it as a major change of policy for the company, now that it has become a State organisation, operating with the aid of <Col N="91" /> subsidy, to go into business in competition with private firms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are civil servants' sections which, when they are <Col N="92" /> drafted, the Minister feels he must stand over and support.  If they were not put in by the draftsman, there would be no obligation to support them. I have watched that development over a period of 25 years.  We even had it a couple of months ago in a Courts of Justice Bill in which was proposed&mdash; and in fact this House carried and gave to the Minister&mdash;power to change the quality of offences.  No parliamentarian would or should support that particular step.  It is a strange thing that if we look back 50 or 60 years ago, we see Acts of Parliament, drafted by parliamentarians, which contained no such power and which were effective for their purpose.  The whole tendency now is to draw a Bill as carelessly as you like and to insert in it this section which gives the Minister power to make regulations.  I agree with Deputy Lemass.  If that power is a power to make minor regulations for the purpose of making the thing go, well and good, but this section goes further than that. Why have we Section 12 in the Bill at all?  Why go to the trouble of prescribing all the powers that we as a Parliament give to this new company, when, in the next section, we say the Minister can make an Order giving additional powers to the board?  I am quite sure that draftsmen in future, instead of putting in Section 12, will simply say that the board shall have such powers as the Minister, by regulation, may give them and those powers will come into effect if approved by a Vote of each House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  When we set up a company of this kind, the powers we give them must be particular powers, must be limited and prescribed for the functions they have to carry out and, if it is found in the working of the company subsequently that the powers they have been given are insufficient, the Minister could bring in a Bill and say to the House: &ldquo;I suggest that these additional powers should be given.&rdquo;  There has never been any trouble in doing that.  The House will examine it through the whole <Col N="93" /> machinery of a Bill as laid down in the Standing Orders and will give such powers to the company as the House thinks the company should have.</P>
      <P>There are examples&mdash;admittedly there is not the same protection as is given in sub-section (4) of this section &mdash;where powers have been given to a Minister to make regulations and two days after the regulation was issued that regulation had to be amended and in another two days it had to be further amended, with the result that one could never find one's way through the maze of regulations that were made under statutory powers such as these. I may be wrong in this but this is the first Bill, as far as I know, in which the specific powers which Parliament proposes to give are set out and the Bill then proposes to give the Minister power to give the undertaking or company such additional powers as he thinks they should have.</P>
      <P>I can do nothing more than protest against it, as I have done in regard to other Bills.  I will do it every time I see it in legislation.  I do it now.  It is the duty of draftsmen drafting an Act of Parliament to provide for every possible contingency within the Act itself. This is not a question, as Deputy Martin O'Sullivan says, of day to day administration.  There will be no objection to the Minister having power to make regulations within the specific powers given by this Bill.  That is what I call day to day administration.  But, to give the Minister power to make a major change of policy&mdash;because that is what this section gives him power to do &mdash;is in my view entirely wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the section were limited to giving the Minister power to make regulations, such incidental and supplementary provisions as are necessary and expedient for giving effect to the powers contained here, I could follow it, but this is not a question of day to day administration.  It is a question of this House surrendering to the Minister a power which it ought to hold to itself, that is, the power to give by statute such authority or powers as an undertaking such as this requires, and, when additional powers become necessary, to give these also by statute.  If Deputy Lemass had put a section such as this&mdash;I do not know whether he did <Col N="94" /> or not&mdash;into his Transport Act, it is quite possible that the Minister might have been able to draw up a new Order, present it to the House and say: &ldquo;That is what I want.  Give it to me, yes or no.&rdquo;  You may talk as long as you like about it, but in the end it is the votes that will count.</P>

I am quite sure that, when the Minister presented this Bill to the House in its original state, he believed he was presenting a Bill which had got the finest and fullest possible consideration, a Bill which was the last word.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), lines 23 and 24, to delete the words &ldquo;or secure or promote the provision of&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have always disliked in our legislation sections of this kind which appear to express a pious wish but which otherwise have no very particular significance. We have here a section which proposes to impose on the board certain duties which, however, are not to constitute in any way a legal obligation on the board.  I hope that in my time I succeeded in avoiding this type of section in legislation whenever possible. Certainly the section in the Transport Act of 1944 which most closely corresponds to this, that which defined the purposes of Córas Iompair Éireann, was a model of simplicity in comparison with what appears here. Section 10 of the 1944 Act said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The purposes of the company shall be</P>
      <P>(I) to operate transport services, and</P>
      <P>(II)  to carry on ancillary services</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="97" /> It stopped at that.  Because of my dislike of this type of section, I read it with very deep suspicion.  On reading it, I was immediately struck by the inclusion of the words which, in my amendment, I propose should be deleted. This sub-section proposes to define the general duties of the new board to be established and I note that it states that the general duties of the board shall be not merely to provide transport services but to secure or promote the provision of transport.  I do not know why these words should be there.  I am quite certain that no member of the Dáil would like to contemplate giving to the board power to farm out its obligation to provide transport services to some other company not operating under statute and over whose aims and purposes we have no control.  I cannot see the circumstances under which it is necessary to give the board the duty to secure or promote the provision by somebody else of transport services.  It seems to me that the declared purpose of the Bill and the known purpose of all the Deputies in the Dáil who have spoken to the Bill is adequately met if the words are deleted and that the duties of the board shall be to provide transport services.  We will have something else to say concerning other parts of the sub-section but I would like the Minister to accept this amendment, or alternatively, to justify a refusal by explaining the necessity for the inclusion of these words.</P>

      <P>The Deputy need have no suspicions and need not have worried.  It is very clear that there is no question of &ldquo;farming out&rdquo; in the sense the Duty used the words.  If the Deputy read the Milne Report carefully he might recollect that one of its suggestions was that it might be found very desirable to enter into an agreement with small local hauliers in certain areas to do certain haulage work there.  That is just one of things we had in mind and I cannot see anything objectionable in that.</P>

      <P>When the company makes a contract with a private lorry owner that private lorry owner is acting as part of the company's organisation and under the company's licence and general powers.  If the Minister contemplates that in some parts of the country its obligations to provide transport facilities will be met more directly by Córas Iompair Éireann by entrusting that responsibility to a private individual or a private firm I would be very hesitant about agreeing with that.  Certainly the Dáil should have an opportunity of considering that as a policy if it is likely to be operated on any scale.</P>

      <P>It is not likely to be operated on any scale, but it could quite easily arise if the development and reintegration of transport in this country that we hope for takes place, that it would be desirable to do it. It might not be on a big scale but surely we should have the power to do it.  There is no question of the company trying to avoid its own obligations because its obligations are pinned on them in the Bill.</P>

      <P>We do not want at the same time to exclude them under any circumstances from entering into an agreement.

There is nothing <Col N="99" /> significant in this at all and the Deputy knows that as well as I do. There could be no conceivable objection to it.  May I say that there is nothing peculiar in this and I am advised that the wording in the Six Counties Act is exactly the same as it is here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, that is the whole tenor of the wording of Acts.  Somebody puts it into an Act in Northern Ireland or Great Britain and therefore we must put it in here. Section 12 provides in sub-section (3) that the company has power&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;to enter into and carry out agreements or arrangements with any person carrying on business as a carrier of passengers or merchandise, providing for the carriage of passengers or merchandise, by or on behalf of the Board and that other person under one contract or at a through charge or in the vehicles or containers, whether belonging to the Board or not.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is a particular power given to the company to enter into that kind of agreement.  It is in Section 12 and we have already passed it.  We come to Section 14 which is headed &ldquo;General Duties of the Board&rdquo; and undoubtedly the general duties of the board should be to provide an efficient, economic, convenient and properly integrated system of public transport.  Their general duties should not be the securing or promoting the provision of transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It struck me, when the objection was made at first, as being what is known as &ldquo;journalese&rdquo;.  I thought it was just the usual form in which an official document was written and that these words were put in for some particular purpose, but I hear now from the Minister that the words are in the Northern Ireland Act and maybe in the British <Col N="100" /> Act and that therefore we put them in here.  If the board has the power in a particular way to do this why should we put it in the general duties of the board?  I think there is substance in the objection made by Deputy Lemass to these words.  There is no necessity for them so far as the general duties of the board are concerned and the section would be much better if they were out of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that paragraph (f) in Section 12 is what is referred to but there is a distinct difference between the two sections. Sub-section (1) of Section 14 does give power to the board to make agreements with persons to carry passangers or merchandise by or on behalf of the board.  That power is very definitely limited and is merely the provision of a means of transport but in paragraph (f) of Section 12, sub-section (2), power is given&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;to make working agreements or arrangements for the provision by any person of transport services which the board is required or authorised to provide, or for the provision by the board of any transport services which any other person has power to provide.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only point which arises is that I cannot see the force of the opposition to the present phraseology in sub section (1) of Section 14, when in fact, we have passed the previous section.  If there is an objection on principle to giving power to &ldquo;farm out&rdquo;, as Deputy Lemass says, any responsibility, there is good grounds for limiting the phrasing of sub-section (1) of Section 14 and placing sole and complete responsibility on the board to provide the means of transport itself with out a third party.  But we have already passed a clause which gives unlimited powers to the board to make any farming out&rdquo; arrangements it likes.  I am not clear that there should be an objection on principle to that.  I do not see how we are going to protect ourselves against objectionable &ldquo;farming out&rdquo; by trying to amend Section 14 when we have already opened the gates wide in Section 12.  I thought at first that Deputy Lemass was merely trying to <Col N="101" /> tighten up the wording of Section 14. But, as he developed his argument, he seemed not to be tightening up the wording, but depriving himself of the only basis on which there is any legitimate objection to this.  That objection is taken away once we have already given to the board the power set out in the two paragraphs of Section 12 to which I referred.</P>

      <P>I do not want to enter into a useless discussion on this, but I should point out that, while I raise no objection at all to the board being given power to make working agreements, I am questioning the wisdom of setting out here as a general duty of the board the making of such agreements. So far as this section is concerned, it makes no difference to the powers of the board whether it is in the Bill or out of it.  It is so much &ldquo;blah&rdquo; so far as the real provisions of the Bill are concerned.  But it does represent, I take it, an attempt to put into words what the wish of the Dáil is.</P>

We are giving power to them to make certain agreements with other transport operators or to acquire them.  That is all right.  But if we are going to have a section of this kind, let us make it clear.  Their job is to provide a cheap and efficient transport. I take it, however, that this does not make much difference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 17:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), after the word &ldquo;operation&rdquo; in line 27, to insert the words &ldquo;the encouragement of national economic development, the maintenance of reasonable conditions of employment for its employees and its financial obligations under this Act&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This affects the same sub-section but it is perhaps more important, because, <Col N="102" /> as we go on to read the wording of sub-section (1) we find it set out that it is the general duty of the board to provide an efficient transport service with due regard to the safety of operation. That is a paraphrase of the section.  If we are going to give the board a general indication of the manner in which we expect them to operate, it seems to me rather strange that we should omit from that indication a reference to important aspects of policy which undoubtedly will concern the Dáil from time to time.  That is why I propose to insert in the Bill, not merely this reference to safety of operation but also words which are intended to make it a general duty of the board to have regard also in the provision of transport services to the encouragement of national economic development, the maintenance of reasonable conditions of employment for their employees and their financial obligations under the Act.  May I say that as regards the last of these three matters, the financial obligations of the board under the Act, the Minister appeared to meet it by his amendment No. 18, but then he subsequently confused me by informing the Dáil that the Government had decided to meet operating losses by subsidies from the Exchequer, which appeared to be moving in the opposite direction altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister apparently wishes to have in the Bill a section of this kind.  I think it would be a better Bill without it.  But, if we are going to have a section of this kind, a sort of general instruction given to the board as to how to use their powers under the Bill, then what aims are we to set before them?  The provision of transport services with due regard to public safety&mdash;that is important.  But our main reason for setting up a State transport organisation and for advancing to that State organisation capital funds from <Col N="103" /> the Exchequer, the only possible justification for the proposal to subsidise this annually out of voted moneys, is that it is serving aims that we think are important.  It is an important aim to give the organisation to assist in the economic development of the country. We know that the efficiency of a transport organisation can have quite important repercussions upon economic development.  Do we regard it as more important that the new board should have regard to considerations of economic development rather than to considerations of financial economy?  Are we to say to them: &ldquo;You are to have only these two purposes in view, public safety and your financial obligations under the Act?&rdquo;  Should we not say also: &ldquo;You are to keep in mind the tremendous amount of good or bad work which you can do by the manner in which you operate your transport services in relation to economic development&rdquo;? Should we not put it upon them, as expressing the general desire of the Dáil, that they should also have regard to the maintenance of reasonable conditions of employment for their employees?  Certainly, if we are going to give any directions at all, if we are going to ask them to take into account, in the fulfilment of their duty, to provide transport services any particular aspect of that problem, will not the omission of reference to the promotion of economic development, the maintenance of reasonable conditions of employment and so forth be regarded as significant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise and the Dáil must recognise that the board can read that section and forget about it.  So far as the section itself is concerned, it provides no sanctions if the board decides to forget about it.  The only ultimate remedy there would be against the board would be exercisable through the Minister and involve the removal and substitution of its members.  But, if the board is expected to reproduce it on a placard and stick it up on the wall of the board room in order to keep the members of the board in mind of their duties, then we should express their duties in a more comprehensive form and say that, in addition to public <Col N="104" /> safety, we require them to keep these three things in mind&mdash;I deliberately put them in what I think is the order of their importance&mdash;the promotion of national economic development, which to a very large extent will be in their hands; the maintenance of reasonable conditions of employment for their employees, which is their direct responsibility; and their financial obligations under the Act, which are undoubtedly the concern of the Minister for Finance and the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>One could think of other considerations that the board could keep in mind in the exercise of their duties.  Counting the question of public safety, these are the four primary considerations which the board should never be allowed to forget in the direction of their undertaking.  Therefore, if we are going to have a section of this kind at all, we should stress all four of them and not leave it to be assumed that they will be taken for granted by the members appointed by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputies are inclined to forget that this company, when this Bill becomes law, will cease to be a private company; that it will be a national company appointed by a national Government to carry out the national policy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass's argument might have some basis if we were continuing under the old system, but in view of what is proposed in this Bill, the setting up of a new national transport concern, I think we need not have any fears so far as the carrying out of national economic development is concerned. May I suggest to the Deputy that if he takes Section 14 (1) together with amendment No. 18, which I propose later to move, he will find that it sets out the duty of the board:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It shall be the duty of the board ...to provide... an efficient, economical, convenient and properly integrated system of public transport for passengers and merchandise by rail, road and water with due regard to safety of operation and for that purpose it shall be the duty of the board to improve in such manner as it considers necessary transport facilities so as to provide for the <Col N="105" /> needs of the public, agriculture, commerce and industry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am proposing in amendment No. 18 to insert a new sub-section which sets out that it shall be the duty of the board to conduct its undertaking so as to secure that the revenue of the board shall not be less than sufficient to meet the charges properly chargeable to revenue.</P>
    <P>I do not see any great objection to putting in what Deputy Lemass has in his amendment, but I think it is entirely unnecessary.  I have no objection to it, but I do not think it is required either in relation to national economic development or the conditions of employment and wages or salaries.  All that is adequately provided for; it is already protected and I do not think there is any necessity to put it into the Bill in this way.</P>
    <P>I must ask Deputies to remember that we ought not completely to hogtie the board we are going to set up. Deputies say they want to give the board every chance to operate efficiently and economically and give an effective transport service.  Probably what I am now saying will not have much force in relation to the amendment that is before the House, but we are in a number of ways, some of them rather small, niggledy ways and others major and more difficult ways, making it difficult if not impossible for whatever board is established to carry out the obligations we are putting on them.  I do not think the Deputy ought to press the amendment, but at the same time I have not any great objection to it.  I do not think it can do any great harm.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister has no objection to the amendment, I hope he will accept it, not because of Deputy Lemass's speech, but because of the Minister's own speech.  He convinced me that the amendment should be inserted.  Nobody desires to hamstring <Col N="106" /> the board, but there are certain matters that do obtain a character of importance and an order of priority. We are not dealing with the establishment of this board in, as it were, a vacuum.  We have had experience of other boards and of the difficulty of trying to get them to state their various duties in a proper order.</P>
      <P>I would not be so concerned with the acceptance of the amendment if I had not already read the terms of amendment No. 18 to be moved later by the Minister.  From that amendment it would appear that the overriding requirement placed on the board is a requirement in relation to its revenue and its ability to meet the charges properly chargeable to revenue.  Is that to be an overriding duty, or is it to be placed in its proper sequence?  Nobody will dispute that if we are setting up a national transport board its major function will be to provide an efficient, economical, convenient and properly integrated system of transport, with due regard to the safety of the public.  That is one duty they cannot be relieved from, one we cannot fail to set down once we define their duties.  Clearly, if we are to define their duties and we define their primary duty to be the provision of transport, we cannot expect that that should be carried out without any regard to the effect it might have upon the national economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass stresses the importance of encouraging national economic development, and then we come to the question of the maintenance of conditions of employment and its financial obligations under the Act.  I have had a peculiar nervousness during the discussions on this Bill&mdash;I raised the matter on the Second Stage&mdash;as to what is the primary obligation placed on the board to pay interest on its stock or to provide fair and reasonable conditions of employment for its workers.  I would like to get that clarified, and I think it is something on the lines of Deputy Lemass's amendment. If that amendment is accepted and if, subsequently, we accept amendment No. 18 we are, it seems to me, weakening the position, but at the same time we are making some attempt to define the relative importance <Col N="107" /> of the several duties placed on the board.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody on these benches expects that the primary duty of the board to provide an efficient economical and safe transport is to be sacrificed purely for the purpose of giving more than fair conditions to the employees.  Nobody expects the under taking to become the privileged refuge of the workers.  We have had experience on other occasions, dealing with semi-State and State boards, of being bluntly and callously told that they were business undertakings and they had no particular obligations to the staff&mdash;that their first obligation was to carry out a certain job and their second obligation, to meet the interest payments on money advanced.  I do not want that repeated in regard to this board.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to say it will be a national board operating in consonance with national policy.  With all respect to Deputy Cowan, it is not so easy to get questions in, with the crowded business of the House, and we have to depend on representations made to boards of this character.  It is very easy for a board of this character to say that their primary function is to provide transport and pay interest charges.  As I say, if the Minister has no strong objection to Deputy Lemass's amendment, I think it would case the fears held by many of us if he will accept that amendment because of the general implications involved and because it does set down for the board not merely the general duties imposed upon them but the relative order of importance of those duties in the estimation of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that Deputy Larkin has spoken in the way he did upon this amendment.  I think we must all be grateful to Deputy Lemass for placing the amendment on the Order Paper in the first instance. The Minister has told us that we must realise that this is a national transport undertaking and that the board is appointed by the Government.  The inference to be drawn from that is that the board will act in accordance with the <Col N="108" /> general principles of the Government. Of course that is not true because the board will be appointed to operate and carry out its duties under this Act and, if it does carry out its duties under the Act, then there is no power in the Government to remove that particular board.  There is power to remove from office a member of the board, but the Minister would be in a very weak position if he came to this House and said he wanted to remove this particular member from the board because he was carrying out the general duties laid down in the Bill but was not following the general policy of the Government. I do not think that could happen.  I feel it is vital, therefore, that these general powers should be provided and if the board subsequently fails to carry out these additional duties laid down in this amendment, then that will be a cause for the removal of a member of the board.  A national transport undertaking of this kind must have regard to national economic development in the same way as it must have regard to the needs of agriculture, industry, commerce and the needs of the general public.  The Minister has said that he has no great objection to the insertion of these words.  I take it that, in view of what has been said on both sides of the House, he will accept the amendment.  I am satisfied because of what has been said by Deputy Lemass, by the Minister and by Deputy Larkin that it is vital that these duties should be included in the general duties of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I omitted what is the strongest argument of all in favour of this amendment.  My excuse for doing so is the two months' hiatus in the consideration of the Bill in Committee. The time lag made me forget some of the later amendments which appear on the Order Paper in the name of the Minister.  The Minister proposes to establish a tribunal which will exercise certain functions in relation to the charges made by the board and in relation to the operation of services.  The board will not be able to increase charges or to reduce services without the sanction of the tribunal and the Minister proposes that the tribunal, in the exercise of their functions, shall <Col N="109" /> have regard amongst other matters to Section 14.  If, therefore, not merely the members of the Córas Iompair Éireann Board but the tribunal that will have these special powers is to have regard to the duties of the board as defined in Section 14, then I think it is more than desirable to extend the definition of its duties in the manner I suggest.</P>
      <P>The Minister may be able to ensure that he will select members of the board who will be conscious of their powers and obligations in relation to the matters to which I have referred. But when we clearly place upon the tribunal a legal obligation to exercise certain defined functions in relation to the duties of the board as defined here, then we must be much more careful in ensuring the exact definition of these duties.  I think that is a strong argument in favour of the addition I make to the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I could also cut the other way.  I have no strong objection to it.  I take it that as far as members on both sides of the House are concerned in the establishment of this new national transport undertaking, there could be no disagreement that that undertaking should operate in conformity with national requirements and national development, whether it be industrial or agricultural.  I take it it would be the wish of all that a national undertaking of this kind would conform to reasonable working conditions and to reasonable wages and salaries.  There can be no great point about that.  I do not think there is any issue on that.  As far as I am concerned there is no issue.  I do not think there is any inconsistency in making the principal and main obligation of the company the provision for the public of a first-class and efficient transport service compatible with economy.  However, we can argue that. I do not agree with Deputy Larkin that in order to give effect to what I propose in amendment No. 18, one can only do so by sacrificing the workers. The Deputy must agree that there are other ways in which it can be done.</P>

      <P>It is clear on the face of it what it means, but it leaves certain aspects of the Minister's policy in relation to transport anything but clear. As the Bill was introduced, we saw it as a scheme for the establishment of a State board which would be obliged to relate its services to its revenue and which would be given rather drastic powers to curtail services and to alter fares and charges without reference to any authority other than itself.  Following upon the Second Reading debate and the views expressed by Deputies during that debate, the Minister proposed to alter his Bill by taking back from the board these drastic powers of curtailing services and altering charges which he originally intended they should have.  He now asks the Dáil to agree instead to the establishment of a transport tribunal to which the Córas Iompair Éireann Board must go for authority when it proposes to alter fares or cut services and the tribunal must have, in the exercise of the function conferred upon it, regard to the provisions of Section 14, as amended by the Minister.</P>

    <P>At a still later stage the Minister made it known to the Dáil, on the occasion of the Supplementary Estimate debate, that the Government contemplated that any loss incurred by the company in any year, any financial consequence of a failure on its part to keep <Col N="111" /> its cost below its revenue, would be offset by an Exchequer subsidy.  I do not think the Minister can hope to make effective an injunction of the kind indicated in this amendment while the prospect of a subsidy, if they fail to do so, is held out before the company.  I think the Minister cannot hope to follow two diverging lines of policy. Under the 1944 Act it was contemplated that Córas Iompair Éireann would pay its way.  Certainly it was intended that the company should operate upon the basis that it was expected to pay its way.  There was no provision for subsidy and, in introducing the Bill to the Dáil, I made it quite as clear as words could make it that there would be no subsidy; that I was strongly opposed to the principle of transport subsidies and that, if circumstances arose in which transport was not able to pay its way, some remedy other than an appeal to the Exchequer would have to be found for that situation.  If the Minister had proceeded on these lines it would be understandable.</P>
    <P>You might have doubts as to the practicability of that policy in present circumstances but it was a possible line to follow.  That is the line which would necessitate such an amendment as is now proposed.  When it is made known to the Dáil and to the people directing Córas Iompair Éireann that the prospect of subsidy is there&mdash;that, to any extent they fail in any year to make their revenue equal their costs, the taxpayer will meet the difference&mdash;then this injunction loses its power altogether. If we are to follow the line of subsidy, we should forget this aspect of the business and let the question of the extent to which transport is to be subsidised by the Exchequer be settled in accordance with public policy and, with the intention of providing the type of transport service which we think the country needs, leave it to the board managing the undertaking to avoid waste, to secure efficiency in that sense but not feeling under any obligation to stop necessary developments or to impose uneconomic economies merely to avoid expenditure which, in other circumstances, would be considered desirable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="112" /> My difficulty in this matter is that, having read the Milne Report carefully and having come to the conclusion from the facts set out there that it is impossible for this undertaking to break level, that on the most favourable assumptions made by Sir James Milne a loss of some £500,000 a year is certain, I think we are driven to the conclusion that until transport is completely reorganised some such help from the Exchequer will be necessary. The only means by which I can visualise transport being put upon an economic basis, in a position to earn from its fares and charges enough to pay its way, involves far heavier capital expenditure on the reorganisation and re-equipment of the undertaking than I know the Government is prepared to contemplate.  On the basis of limiting its capital development, on the basis of imposing upon it this new idea of a tribunal, in relation to all the known facts, it is clear that it is an unreal proposal to ask the company to conduct its business so as to provide the interest and sinking fund charges on its capital.  It cannot do it.  There is no use in pretending it can do it. The company, knowing that if they do not do it, the Exchequer will make good any loss they incur, cannot even be expected seriously to try to achieve that operation.  I have no objection to making it clear to the board that even though there is going to be a subsidy there must be no wasteful expenditure, no overlapping of services; that there is no retention of equipment long after it has exhausted its utility; that there is no retention of services which are completely uneconomic merely because of possible public agitation if they are withdrawn; that we expect them to approach their task in managing this undertaking as businessmen, but telling them that our main concern is a proper transport service which will serve public convenience and which will provide reasonable conditions of employment for its staff and workers and that we regard these aims as more important than the narrow financial one indicated here.</P>
    <P>My trouble in discussing this amendment is that I am not quite clear yet upon which of the diverging roads the Minister would like to travel.  I know <Col N="113" /> he cannot travel both of them simultaneously. He has said much but I do not know which is his preference and which he is forced along by pressure from different quarters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some fears, in regard to the operation of this particular sub-section, resting under two heads.  My first fear is in relation to the service which the concern should give to agriculture as the outstanding industry of this country.  It is the experience, the world over, that where there are State railways special concessions are given to the agricultural community in respect of certain agricultural products and in respect of certain agricultural requirements.  This company is proposed to be a State company.  In view of the obligations which are placed on it in the preceding sections, I take it that one of these main intentions will have to be to ensure that agriculture will get all the attention it will need so far as State railways are concerned.  To bring that to its logical conclusion, it will be necessary at certain stages to give concessions so far as freight rates are concerned to agricultural products and to agricultural requirements.  There may be a danger, unless the Minister can convince me to the contrary in his argument, in that the board may regard this particular amendment as their overriding obligation to ensure that their accounts will balance at the end of the year.  That is the first point that strikes me in connection with this particular amendment&mdash;that the board may not be as free as we think they should be to encourage agriculture by suitable rates so far as its products and requirements are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="114" /> My second point is&mdash;and especially from our point of view on these benches&mdash;the particular change that would arise out of this directive to the board; that the staffs of the company might be one of the first to suffer to fulfil the requirements of this particular sub-section.  I say that, based on a long experience.  Every member of the House knows that, in certain institutions of this character governed or administered by a board, if, at the end of the financial year&mdash;I have seen it occur particularly around Christmas &mdash;they found the accounts were likely to show a loss, the first consideration was the dismissal of men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister can convince me, I should like to be satisfied under these two headings, as to the necessity for the inclusion of this amendment.  On the other hand it is true, as Deputy Lemass said a moment ago, that you cannot give a blank cheque to the directors of any concern.  There might be a danger that they would take it for granted that they could run as many trains as they liked with fares just to suit themselves and incidentally to run the concern into trouble.  I think a reasonable obligation should be imposed on them but not of the watertight character which seems to be implied in this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to explain what this amendment precisely means.  The wording is rather novel: &ldquo;It shall be the duty of the board so to conduct its undertaking as to secure, as soon as may be, that, taking one year with another, the revenue of the board shall be not less than sufficient to meet the charges properly chargeable to revenue.&rdquo;  It is very hard to know what exactly that means.  It does not mean that the charges will be kept down.  Does it mean that the revenue will be brought up?  The Minister said in putting this amendment before the House that it was perfectly clear.  I cannot, I must say, follow it.  I do not think it means anything.  It may mean everything that Deputy O'Sullivan has said and <Col N="115" /> it may not mean anything at all.  If the Minister would indicate what exactly it does mean, then I might have a few words to say on it.</P>

      <P>Taking this amendment as it stands, and assuming that it is intended to mean what the words imply, I should like to say that I wholeheartedly support it.  I think we ought to make up our minds very definitely that transport should pay its way and that transport ought not in ordinary circumstances be subsidised.  A case might be made for subsidising production inasmuch as if a State subsidy has the effect of increasing the volume of production it justifies itself because the increase in the volume of production pays for the amount of the subsidy but I cannot see any conceivable case from any point of view for subsidising transport as a general national, permanent policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Questions were raised by some Deputies in regard to the necessity for giving cheaper transport for agriculture. I am, of course, naturally desirous that everything possible should be done to promote and assist the development of agriculture but I think there are other and more direct ways of promoting the development of agriculture than by providing transport for agricultural produce at less than what it costs or by subsidising transport out of the national revenue. I think the House ought to make it <Col N="116" /> clear beyond all question that we expect this State undertaking to pay its way at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy enshrined in this amendment has to our knowledge, and to the knowledge of Deputy Lemass and of the present Minister, been operated in two different ways during the last 15 or 20 years.  At one stage in the history of the railways which are now operated under this company called Córas Iompair Éireann, when they found themselves in financial difficulties, they sent for the union leaders.  Deputy Lemass was in office at that time and although I dare say he did his best to let them down as lightly as he could, they balanced their budget at that period by insisting upon a 5 to 10 per cent. cut in wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That was before my time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>As well, they got rid of what they themselves described as redundant staff.  At another period, not too long ago, when they found themselves in further difficulties under the 1944 Act they put up their rates by 20 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That was only in 1947.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1947 they put up the rates on the railways and they cut down the bus rates and they got rid of staff at the same time.  In any case these are two different ways of carrying out the kind of policy&mdash;I may be wrong and the Minister will correct me if I am&mdash;that it is intended that the board should operate under this amendment. I objected to this all-round increase of 20 per cent. in railway charges in order to help the board of directors to balance their budget.  I think it is quite unfair that in an agricultural country such as this&mdash;and I hope Deputy Cogan will agree with me&mdash; that there should be an all-round increase in rates&mdash;the same increase in the rates for the raw materials of agriculture as there is in the rates for the transport of luxury articles which are not commonly used by the plain people of the country.  In other countries, as pointed out by Deputy O'Sullivan where the railways are controlled <Col N="117" /> by the State authorities&mdash;New Zealand and Australia in particular and Britain to a certain extent in recent years&mdash;specially low rates are provided for the transport of the raw materials of the agricultural industry. I think that should operate here, but I may point out particularly to Deputy Lemass&mdash;who will not contradict me&mdash; that the policy enshrined in this amendment has been operated in two conflicting ways in order to balance the railway budget at two periods in the history of his association with the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. John Flynn Mr. John Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. John Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Whilst appreciating the Minister's suggestion about balancing their budget, I would like to point out that at one period the railway company gave concessions in regard to rates for agricultural produce and for transport facilities operating in certain areas but they changed all that and deprived people in our county and in other southern counties of a concession that they had been accustomed to over a period of years.  For a certain number of years, as Deputy O'Sullivan pointed out, in the transport of seed potatoes and other agricultural produce the railway company allowed a flat rate. Subsequently, they withdrew that concession. We would like to see some safeguard there.  If there is a concession granted, we would like to see some provision whereby the board could not economise at the expense of the agricultural community, as they have done heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, we can prove that at a later period the railway company had a deliberate plan to cut out, exclude and close down branch lines.  They established zones of transport, diverting the regular railway traffic to the roads, and in that way at the end of the year they were able to show that those branch lines were uneconomic.  I can prove, and so can other Deputies from my county and from other parts of the country, that that was a planned arrangement by Córas Iompair Éireann headquarters.  They established zones of transport, diverting regular rail traffic to those zones; and the conveyance of goods to remote <Col N="118" /> parts of the country and to areas of the country adjacent to the railways was diverted, which doubled the cost on the consumers and on the general public and at the same time misrepresented the position with regard to branch lines.  We do not want that kind of thing to happen again.</P>
    <P>I made this point before, when the Bill was being introduced.  I welcomed the Minister's efforts, but I pointed out the possibility of giving too much power to a board that could do as they have done heretofore in the name of economy and could make it appear that it is best for the countryside to close down these branch lines.  Consequently, I would like some safeguard from the Minister in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if it would meet Deputy Davin or Deputy Flynn if we had just in the Bill: &ldquo;The company shall not economise&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out that there is a lot of talk to the effect that no one is going to be redundant under Córas Iompair Éireann, but for the past few months tradesmen and labourers have been cut off in Cork at Glanmire terminus.  It may be said that they were not permanent, but they have given five and ten years' service. There is no use in saying there will not be redundancy if they are cut off for economy reasons when they have given five or ten years' service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have endeavoured to get the Minister to explain this section to me and I think, with all due respect to the Minister and to whoever drafted this section, that it is absolute nonsense.  You start off, as the Minister says, with a board of men that the Minister or the Government think suitable men to do a good job of work.  If that is so, clearly they will endeavour to make the concern run as best they can.  Now, this amendment visualises, as far as I can see, that the taxpayer will be paying through the nose or otherwise for Córas Iompair Éireann for a number of years, so to a large extent this section is a pious aspiration. How can the board make revenue &ldquo;meet the charges that are properly <Col N="119" /> chargeable to revenue&rdquo;, if competition which is harming them, which is depriving them of essential revenue, is permitted?  If people are going to travel otherwise than by Córas Iompair Éireann, if goods are to be transferred from one part of the country to another otherwise than by Córas Iompair Éireann, how is Córas Iompair Éireann going to make revenue balance the charges properly chargeable to revenue?</P>
      <P>I dealt with this aspect on the Second Reading of the Bill, and I think the Minister must, in this Bill, face up to it.  What is he going to do with the private lorries that are running in competition with Córas Iompair Éireann? If that competitive transport is not under some sort of control, then it is clear that it is only a pious aspiration to say that the board is to pay its way. I gather that this very cumbersome section means that the board is to conduct its undertaking so as to pay its way.  That is what the Minister suggests it means.  It says &ldquo;taking one year with another&rdquo;&mdash;in other words, we are committed this year to a substantial subsidy, as the board cannot pay its way.  Next year, the Minister will expect that the subsidy be somewhat less, and so on; so that in a period of ten, 20 or 30 years this company may pay its way.  Now, I understand that it is impossible for the company to pay its way while this competition exists.  I think the Minister could get advice on that from Córas Iompair Éireann themselves. Does the present Chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann think the company can pay its way while that competition is permitted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that, for some reason or another, in the past Córas Iompair Éireann lost very valuable contracts. Deputy Cogan has mentioned charges. Apparently, the increase in charges does not help.  I understand that some time ago they increased their charges for parcels and the result was that that traffic was transferred to the Post Office and carried by Córas Iompair Éireann free&mdash;in other words, it was carried within the contract that Córas Iompair Éireann had with the Post <Col N="120" /> Office.  That is to say, they threw away that source of revenue.</P>
    <P>I understand that, down south in Cork, the delivery of the products of bacon factories was carried out by Córas Iompair Éireann until they lost that trade and their competitors now have fleets of 50 or 60 lorries carrying what Córas Iompair Éireann was carrying. I understand that certain organisations in their peak period employ private lorries to do work that should be done by Córas Iompair Éireann.  I understand that that is absolutely contrary to the law, that the law is not operating.  I understand that many of these concerns carry passengers at a charge to Dublin and back again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not in regard to football matches.  They are being carried day by day in lorries travelling from one part of the country to another and there is a fixed charge.  Does the Minister seriously think that Córas Iompair Éireann can pay its way at any time within the foreseeable future if that situation is not dealt with?  I would suggest that it would be much better to deal with that matter within this Bill and to give Córas Iompair Éireann the facilities and power to pay its way rather than to put into the Bill a pious aspiration such as is contained in the Minister's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very simple amendment, notwithstanding all that Deputy Cowan has said about it.  All it means is that the company shall so conduct its business that as soon as possible they will meet their working expenditure out of their revenue.  I do not know whether the Deputy is satisfied with that or not.  Deputy Davin, Deputy Martin O'Sullivan and some other Deputies have fears in regard to this.  I do not know whether they were here when we were discussing the previous amendment or not. They fear that the company can pay its way or break even only by worsening conditions, by reducing wages or by dismissing staff.  I think that is adequately safeguarded in the Bill.  It seems to me that the attitude of the House, including Deputy Lemass, is that every single section which may use <Col N="121" /> the railway or derive a living from its operation is to be safeguarded but that there is to be no regard to the cost of giving all those guarantees and safeguards and that it is all to come from the taxpayer.  Deputy Lemass told us he does not like subsidies.  He does not believe in them.  As a matter of fact he detested them so much that he set his face completely against them in the 1944 Act.  &ldquo;No subsidy.  You must pay your way.&rdquo;  He was satisfied that it would pay its way.  It did not pay its way.</P>

      <P>It would not do to finish on that particular note at this time of the night.  I have asked the Minister one question which is worrying me: where will the board get the revenue to enable them to meet all the charges properly chargeable to revenue, if the competition which is now reducing that revenue is permitted to continue?  The facts of the matter are that the people have provided a sum of about £4,000,000 substantially to meet deficiency in revenue.  I think that is so.  Last year, we had Córas Iompair Éireann in the position that, without the assistance of the Exchequer, <Col N="126" /> it was unable to pay its weekly wage bills.  Where is the change?  That was the parlous condition of Córas Iompair Éireann last year.  Where is the change this year?  Is it fair to the new board to say: &ldquo;We give you this duty.  It is your duty as soon as may be to pay your way, but we are going to permit all the competition which has developed against Córas Iompair Éireann and which makes Córas Iompair Éireann uneconomic to continue in the future.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not expenditure out of revenue; it is capital expenditure.  We will deal with that to-morrow, however.  What I want to know from the Minister is whether, apart entirely from this pious aspiration that the board will do its best, the Minister proposes to provide traffic that will enable Córas Iompair Éireann to pay its way and to meet all the charges that should be properly chargeable to revenue.  If the Minister does not do that, the Exchequer must make up the deficiency, not this year or next year and not in diminishing but in increasing amounts until either the company or the State goes absolutely bankrupt.  That is the problem I want the Minister to answer.  Does he propose to do that, or is he merely putting that sub-section in the Bill for the purpose of saying to the board: &ldquo;Do your best, and, if you do your best, we will make up the difference.&rdquo;  That is what I am very definitely asking the <Col N="127" /> Minister and I thought I put it as clearly as I could.  Is he going to place restrictions on private hauliers who are running in competition with Córas Iompair Éireann?  Is he going to tie up the misuse of lorries and other vehicles which carried passengers in competition with Córas Iompair Éireann? I want the Minister to realise that, unless he does that, there is no hope of Córas Iompair Éireann paying its way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been heartened by the reply given to-day to a question put by Deputy Lemass as to whether or not this building had been made over to the Department of Social <Col N="128" /> Welfare.  I was afraid that might have happened since the amendment was put down.  However, it has not happened and the situation can be saved. The amendment which has been for a long time on the Order Paper must have given the Government and Córas Iompair Éireann an opportunity of reconsidering their unfortunate decision not to proceed with the completion of this bus station at Store Street.  Certain Deputies are of the opinion that those Deputies who are taking a particular interest in this matter are concerned with it primarily because it is in their own constituency.  Let me say at once that that undoubtedly is a consideration. I do not want to say that it is not a consideration, but the primary consideration is the provision as soon as may be of a suitable place where bus passengers coming to the city from all parts of the country and travelling to all parts of the country from Dublin may have a convenient place at which to rest while waiting for their bus, a convenient place where they may have a meal, a convenient place where they may leave small parcels and a convenient place where if needs be they may reserve their seats on the bus.  Córas Iompair Éireann, realising the necessity for such a central bus station in Dublin, decided, after a considerable number of difficulties had been removed from their way, on building that bus station at Store Street, Dublin, and work proceeded on that building.  I understand that as an example of mass concrete construction there is nothing to compare with it anywhere in Europe.  I understand that this bus station has been admired by engineers from all parts of the world and that if it were completed it would have meant the provision of the most up-to-date accommodation in any place in Europe for long-distance bus travellers.  Some people do not like the appearance of the building.  It has been described as &ldquo;a skyscraper&rdquo; and many other descriptions have been applied to it, but, nevertheless, that particular building has gone a long way towards completion and were it not for the hold up it is quite possible that it would be ready for use now.  It is not ready for use.  It is lying there like a gazebo or some type of folly in <Col N="129" /> the middle of the City of Dublin. While that situation is going on and while the Government and Córas Iompair Éireann have been taking decisions, the travelling public are subjected to impossible and scandalous conditions on the quays of Dublin. Whether they travel in winter or summer the conditions under which they have to assemble outside the Córas Iompair Éireann offices on Aston Quay are certainly a disgrace to the city, a disgrace to the country and a disgrace to Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
      <P>I have been unable yet to ascertain what is the objection to Store Street. I have heard many grounds for objection advanced but I have heard no precise grounds put forward by Córas Iompair Éireann for their refusal to proceed with this project.  Perhaps in the course of the debate on this particular amendment the Minister may be in a position to indicate what precise objections Córas Iompair Éireann have to completing this bus station at Store Street.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOReilly" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that, in order to restore the pig industry, the price paid to the producer should be increased sufficiently to cover the cost of production on home-produced foods, and a reasonable profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am at a great disadvantage in having to take this motion to-night.  As the House knows there are five other motions before this which were not taken and that fact has left me entirely unprepared.  However, rather than let the motion go by default, I must get on with it in the best way I can.  The pig industry has presented many problems and gone through many phases during the past few years.  It has had its ups and downs and the question is disputed as to what was the cause of <Col N="130" /> these ups and downs in production. Three years ago, or even later, we had, I think, the lowest pig population recorded in the country probably in living memory.  As to the causes which brought about that decrease, I think it must be generally admitted that two factors were responsible.  One was the scarcity of home-produced foods and the virtual, if not absolute, disappearance of imported foodstuffs and the other what we claim was an uneconomic price.  Pigs became so scarce during 1947 that it was a rare luxury to get a piece of bacon at all, while the price at which the producer could sell his pigs was controlled so as to keep down the price that he might get for his pigs.  That continued until the increased production reached a point when there was more than sufficient to supply the home market.  Then the fixed price was lifted at a time when it was evident that the price was going to drop, although control was kept on the price the farmer might get when he was in a position to produce very few pigs.  Now, largely owing to the importation of maize meal in the last year, pig production has gone up, with the result that pig prices have gone down until, in many instances, pigs of the heavier type have been selling around £7 per cwt.  Although we were assured by the Minister last year that the price of certain pigs would be around £9 10s. per cwt., in many instances, particularly in my own county, the highest price was around £9 3s. and £9 4s. per cwt.</P>
    <P>The question will arise, as mentioned in the motion, should the farmer get the cost of production on home-produced food?  I claim he is entitled to that, because industrial producers are protected to such an extent that they get whatever their costs are on home production.  The prices at which they sell the manufactured articles are arrived at after the wages of the workers are estimated, after the costs of running the factory are taken into account and, last though not by any means least, the dividends for the investors.  To assure that, they are protected by tariffs and by quotas on imports so that no appreciable quantity of manufactured goods will come in from outside which might lower the <Col N="131" /> conditions of employment of the workers and the dividends of the investors.</P>
    <P>In passing, let me say that I am not by any means opposed to a policy of protection for native industries.  I think I can claim to have put that into practical effect, because I can make the statement that nobody can find about my place any article of foreign manufacture in the way of agricultural requirements, except one article which I had to buy when I could not get an Irish manufactured one.  That is the only article of foreign manufacture in the place.  Therefore, I claim to be at least as good a supporter of Irish industry as any Deputy or anyone else in the country.  But the point I want to make is that the prices of the farmer's requirements, both for agricultural and household purposes, are at an artificially high level as a result of protection.  Yet, when the farmer looks for what it would cost to produce his pigs, poultry, eggs, milk or anything else, he has no protection.  He reaches the point when he has to go on to the export market and, when he goes there, there is no protection; he has to sell at whatever he can get.  Therefore, he is suffering both ways.  He has to pay a higher price for his requirements as a result of protection which increases his cost of production and, when he goes to sell his products, he is faced with international competition and, in many cases in the past, has been faced with penal tariffs.  Therefore, I claim that pig producers are not being fairly treated in this respect.</P>
    <P>Over a year ago I put down questions here as to the inadequacy of pig prices and I also raised the matter on the Adjournment on one occasion.  I made the point that unlimited importation of maize meal was likely to lead to increased production to such a point that even the then prevailing price of £9 10s. 0d. per cwt. could not be maintained. Anyone who had any doubts then about that must have satisfied himself since that that has been the result.</P>
    <P>I claim that some protection should have been given to the pig producer <Col N="132" /> so that such a slump would not come about, particularly when he was not allowed to take advantage of the scarcity so as to get a higher price. He should at least be protected now to the extent that he will be guaranteed his cost of production and a little profit.  I would not advocate extravagant profits for any farmer, but he should be given at least a working profit.</P>
    <P>On the adjournment debate last year I gave details with regard to the cost of production of home produced foods.  The estimate I gave at that time was denied, but it was not disproved. I have not seen any figures since put up by anyone to disprove my figures at that time.  On the basis of £9 10s. a cwt.  I then estimated that potatoes grown on the farm were worth 8d. per stone, 5/4 per cwt. or £5 6s. 8d. per ton&mdash;it was on the basis of 8d. a stone anyway.  I do not think anyone will suggest that £5 6s. 8d. or £5 13s. 4d. would be a sufficient price for a farmer to get for the production of potatoes, particularly with agricultural wages as they are and with increased charges both for national health insurance and employers' liability insurance.  National health insurance stamps in the past year or year and a half have gone up from 1/- per week to 1/7 and employers' liability insurance has gone up by 27½ per cent.</P>
    <P>At the moment, to insure an agricultural worker against accident, to give him full cover, will cost something around £4 10s. 0d. per annum.  I think those two charges put on to the agricultural labourer's wages at present mean slightly over £3 per week.  I wonder would it be possible, on an average farm, to employ labourers at £3 a week or slightly over it and take a risk as to what kind of yield you might have of any crop.  In 1948, we had a good yield, but in 1947 it was a bad one, and we are told that there will be a scarcity of oats and potatoes in the present year.  When we take into consideration the uncertainty of crop production, I wonder would anyone assert that it would be profitable, taking the good year with the bad, to produce potatoes at £5 6s. 8d. per ton.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that one could produce <Col N="133" /> pigs to sell at £9 10s. 0d. a cwt. by using imported maize.  There, again, the question of protection for native industries arises.  We do not allow foreign manufacturers to come in to lower the conditions of employment in industrial production.  Therefore, why should we do it in connection with the agricultural industry?  Apart altogether from that point, is it a wise policy to pursue?  We saw how the production of pigs dwindled, particularly during the emergency years when maize could not be got.  That was a terrible upset.  Who knows but that same condition might arise again and, as a result, that pig production might once more dwindle?</P>
    <P>We have had an enormous increase in production during the past 12 or 18 months.  I think we have almost three pigs now for the one we had two years ago, or a little over two years ago.  But the pigs could dwindle again.  We have only to look at the example of the 1948 crop season.  Through the goodness of God we had a splendid crop of potatoes and oats that year, with the result that prices slumped and only very reluctantly the Government came to the aid of the grain growers by taking the oats from them at 28/- a barrel&mdash;I am not quite sure of that figure.  What was the result?  It was officially stated that there is a scarcity of oats and potatoes in the country this year.  Therefore, if we do not protect the pig producer now, when pigs are plentiful, what encouragement is there for him to continue to produce pigs?</P>
    <P>Possibly production may decrease considerably even one year from now and then the scarcity of bacon, even for the home consumer, would be as bad as in some years past.  To my mind it is essential, apart altogether from the producers' interest&mdash;it is essential in the national interest&mdash;to give some stability to the producer.  We see at the moment when pigs have to be exported that the price is not even £9 10s.  I think in order to maintain that price that some of the levy collected off the pigs in past years has to be drawn on to subsidise exporters of bacon in the hope that the Minister at a later date will be in a position to make a bargain with the British <Col N="134" /> Government so as to enable £9 10s. a cwt. to be paid for bacon pigs.</P>
    <P>We should have some assurance from the Minister, something in the nature of a long-term guarantee that the pig producer will get sufficient to encourage him to stay in production.  It has been the experience at all times that the more he produces the less he gets for it.  That is not good encouragement for any producer and particularly for the agricultural producer.  The farmer has enough to contend with, what with the uncertainty in the weather and everything else, without having to be uncertain as to what he is likely to get for the article he produces.  He has first of all to grow the crops and then to feed the animals before he can turn them into cash.  If he gets a disappointing price what encouragement is there for him to continue?</P>
    <P>I have been taken at a disadvantage in this debate and I cannot develop my point at any great length.  I hope other Deputies will fill in the gaps that I have left and that there will be an intelligent discussion on this motion from all sides of the House.  I hope something will emerge that will help to stabilise the pig industry.  I commend the motion to the House.  I trust it will be warmly supported and ultimately adopted.</P>

      <P>I support this motion.  I think the pig industry is of paramount importance particularly where there are uneconomic holdings on which the people are compelled, in order to eke out some sort of existence, to depend upon farm-yard industries. Pig feeding is very important in their particular economy.  It is important to them that the price of the finished article should be commensurate with the cost of production and give them a reasonable margin of profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion asks that the price be increased.  In asking to have the price increased to the producer, it is in order for us to point out to the Minister the ways in which the price can be increased. Last June, and on a number of other occasions, the Minister stated <Col N="135" /> that farmers were getting 190/- per cwt. for pigs weighing up to 14 stone.  If that price were being paid to pig producers it would be of some benefit to them.  But that price is not being paid. It was mentioned here on a number of occasions by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, acting for the Minister for Agriculture, that that price was being paid.  At one particular period, it was being paid by one particular factory during one particular week.  That was not the particular week during which the Parliamentary Secretary stated that it was being paid. It is well known that that price was not paid generally at any period during the past four months.  That is quite obvious from the public Press.  The firms that paid the highest price in the past and the firms that are still paying the highest price are advertising in the Press.  Those advertisements make it quite clear to the Minister that the price of 190/- is not being paid.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that one way in which to increase the price to the producer would be to ensure that when the price of bacon is increased to the consumer, the price of pigs is not at the same time reduced to the producer. I would inform the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach that the firms paying the lowest price for pigs are the firms which charge the highest price for bacon.  This week those firms have increased their price for bacon by 6/-per cwt.  If the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary want evidence of that I can offer again, as I offered in the past, the 10,000 pig dockets that I have in my possession showing that those prices are not being paid to the producers.  It is a simple matter for the Minister to find out what these firms charge for the bacon to the wholesalers and retailers.</P>
    <P>To-day the Minister for Agriculture told us that no pollard will be available to pig producers in the future, but that 90 per cent. of the bran will be available. It is possible for pig producers to make their own ration £3 per ton cheaper than they can buy it.  In order to make that ration it is necessary to have bran and pollard offals.  The <Col N="136" /> Minister told us to-day that all the pollard will be diverted in future to the manufacturers of compound feeding stuffs.  These compound feeding stuffs will be sold to the pig producers at a very high price.  They will be composed of one commodity at least which is subsidised by the community at a controlled price of about 14/- per cwt. That commodity will be mixed by the millers and sold back to the pig producers at something in the region of £30 per ton.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that all the pollard would be taken back by the millers and used in the manufacture of compound feeding-stuffs.  In order to counteract that, however, 90 per cent. of the bran would be made available to pig producers. That appeared reasonable but there is one point that must be kept in mind.  For every 100 tons of wheat milled there are approximately 12 tons of pollard and three to five tons of bran.  The pig producers will get 90 per cent. of the three to five tons of bran while the millers will get the 12 tons of pollard plus the remaining 10 per cent. of bran.  The Minister has advised farmers to produce their own pig and cattle feeding and to walk it off the land.  So far as the feeding of young pigs is concerned some of these offals must be made available.  The Minister has told us that if they are imported the price will be almost prohibitive. I think the Minister should examine his conscience in this matter. I think the Minister should ask himself if it is right that he should pass over all the pollard available to the manufacturers at something like £14 a ton to be resold to the pig producers at something in the region of £30 per ton. I want to emphasise again that it is not necessary to increase the price of bacon to the consumer in order to ensure a reasonable price to the pig producer. The pig producers are prepared to do their job.  They are prepared to increase production and deliver the goods if they get a fair price.</P>
    <P>There was an interesting little episode in Wexford.  A pig producer there had a pig weighing 1 cwt. 3 qrs. 8 lbs., and he was offered 140/- per cwt. for it.  He kept the pig and had it cured himself.  He subsequently sold <Col N="137" /> it for £16, representing a difference of £5 on that particular pig.  That proves that pigs bought by the bacon curers at 140/- per cwt. are afterwards retailed at the highest price to the consumers. I hope the Minister will take notice of that.  At the moment the position is that pig producers are tending to go out of pig production.  If in the next few months they feel, as they have felt in the last four months, that they are not getting what is their right and due they will definitely go out of pig production altogether.</P>
    <P>We shall find ourselves in the position that, within a period of six to eight months, bacon will be under the counter again as it was in the past. The price that is being charged for bacon is high enough to enable the producer to get a decent price for his pigs. If the farmer gets a decent price and if the curer is satisfied with a decent margin of profit, there is no reason why the pig industry should not expand and develop to the greatest degree.  But that is not happening and because it is not happening and because the farmers and the pig feeders are being cut down to as low as 140/-per cwt. for their bacon pigs while bacon is at a very high price, bacon producers are not going to stand for it or continue to produce pigs.  I suggest that this is a matter to which the Minister should give his immediate and very serious attention.</P>
    <P>The Minister, of course, has advised the use of home-produced foods.  These home-produced foods are increasing in their cost of production due to certain factors completely outside the farmers' control.  There are certain costs and certain charges that are passed on to the farmer&mdash;largely by Orders of the Minister or of the Oireachtas or of county councils or of some other body &mdash;over which the farmer has no control. As long as these increased charges are passed on to him he must ask for a similar increase to cover these particular charges.  If he gets fair treatment, the bacon and the pig industry will develop and expand and will be of considerable advantage, particularly in the more congested areas in the country.  I do not know who is responsible but I know what is happening at the moment and I know that it is having a very <Col N="138" /> serious effect on the pig and bacon industry in the country and that if it continues much longer the industry will be back in the position in which it was two years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this motion.  I think it rather an amazing fact that the Minister for Agriculture, who is responsible for this condition of affairs, is not in the House.  Evidently, this is another instance of his anxiety to show the farmers how much he cares about them.  When the Minister for Agriculture made the public statement alluded to by Deputy Lehane, he then stated that he was allowing a profit for the farmer in the 190/-.  That was doubted very much by experienced pig producers all over this country.  But when there was a by-election campaign down in West Cork the Minister went to the trouble of arriving down to the county committee of agriculture and he there pledged his word of honour that the farmer would get 190/- per cwt. for his pigs, knowing very well that West Cork is the home, I might say, of the pig industry in Cork County. He made that statement there.  I quite admit that nobody now takes any statement by the Minister for Agriculture seriously, for whenever he gave any kind of a guarantee in relation to price he flopped.  Only yesterday I had a bunch of his unfortunate dupes whom he told here in this House to grow malting barley and that they would get at least 55/- a barrel and probably a lot more for it.  There was an unfortunate member in the court yesterday endeavouring to get other industrial firms to honour that bond.  The Minister was far away from them then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, if the pig industry is not going to disappear completely in this country, some steps must be taken to protect the man who produces the pig and the bacon.  There is very little use in a Minister making a public statement to the effect that he is going to pay 190/- per cwt. or that 190/- per cwt. can be paid for bacon if that price is not obtainable from any bacon curer in this country&mdash;and that is the present position.  It is not obtainable.  The price has completely disappeared.  The Minister is, furthermore, driving the unfortunate farmer into the position <Col N="139" /> where he will have to buy a ration or an admixture&mdash;since we have such horrible words in this House by the very Minister himself.  He is now compelling them to buy an admixture.  He has removed pollard completely off the map for the pig-producing farmer.  It is handed over, 100 per cent., to the producer of ration.  No pig producer can now get one pound of pollard.  That is cut off.  The Minister is forcing them, then, to buy in the dearest market, to buy the dearest material that can be produced to fatten their pigs&mdash;unless he can get them into the position he had them in the year before last with their oats and their potatoes; unless he can drive them into that position where they will produce them and have no market for them and have to do something with them.  He is evidently endeavouring to create that condition of affairs in this country again by his recent statement. We know that the price of imported maize has gone up somewhere between £4 and £5 a ton during the last couple of months, since the devaluation of the £.  The price of maize meal, I think, is still remaining stationary. We are wondering where the subsidy is coming from&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that has kept the price of maize meal stationary during the past five months.  Is this what the Minister is going to do, when the farmers will produce the barley and the potatoes and the oats for fattening the pigs or for cattle feeding?  Is this what he is going to do&mdash;to subsidise the North American maize producer, to throw his stuff in the market, to knock out the barley grower of this country? In the past few months he has paid what is definitely a subsidy on bacon when he subsidised the maize meal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not the figures to go back as far as Deputy Lehane went back, but I have figures here from last November to the 13th February.  They show that green bacon has gone from 232/- for full sides in November&mdash;it was the same price in December&mdash;to the present price of 236/-.  That is, 4/- per <Col N="140" /> cwt. added on right through.  But there has been no increase in the price paid to the producer of the pig.  There has been instead, I think, a reduction, because those gentlemen have now got into the happy position&mdash;like the buyer of the old hens&mdash;that they say the Minister is all blow and no more.</P>
    <P>The Minister frequently fulminates and shouts about what he is going to do but he never does anything.  He is creating in this country a profiteers' paradise, that is if any faith can be placed in his statements at any time. If he says that he permits a price to be charged by buyers which will allow 1/8d. per lb. to be paid for old hens and 190/- per cwt. to be paid for pigs to the producer, then I hold that it is his bounden duty as a gentleman to whom the taxpayers of this country are paying £2,150 to carry out his job, to see that those whom he represents in this House will get that price.  That is his job; that is what we were often told was the job of the Minister by Deputy Dillon himself when he was sitting over here.  We look to this House through this motion to insist that the Minister will at least honour one of his pledges. He gave a definite guarantee in the first place, and he followed that up with his word of honour, if any reliance can be placed on the Minister's word of honour as we are now experiencing it, to the Cork County Committee of Agriculture. I admit that it was given in the middle of the campaign in the West Cork by-election but you would expect that the Minister's word of honour would be something upon which the people of this country could place some reliance.</P>
    <P>What is our agricultural policy going to be if we can place no faith whatever on any guarantee of the price to be given for flax, bacon, eggs, old hens, young hens, cocks, even down to the unfortunate rabbit?  If we can place no reliance on any statement in regard to price or any guarantee given by the Minister in regard to anything at the present day, what is our agricultural policy going to be or where does a policy of that description lead to? These unfortunate people who got sows and started breeding bonhams and rearing and fattening pigs on the Minister's word of honour that they would <Col N="141" /> get 190/- per cwt. for their pigs when they had them reared, could not change over in a day.  They are now stuck with the pigs, the sows, the bonhams and the Minister's word.  I expect that this House in fairness to the agricultural community will insist through this motion on the Minister honouring his word of honour.  The statement that he gave his word of honour is not mine.  It is a statement made by the vice-chairman of the Cork County Council at the county committee of agriculture.  The vice-chairman of the Cork County Council is a supporter of the Minister's Party and is one of those responsible&mdash; I am quoting one of themselves&mdash;for having the Minister sitting there.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to see the bacon and pig industry getting back as quickly as possible to the position when we shall have pigs for export.  What hope have you of that if you are going to have people driving out the sows in disgust and looking the gate lest they come back again?  That is going to be the condition of affairs if this House does not give the Minister a definite order under this motion, to keep his word of honour as given to the farmers of this country last June and July.  I do not wish to delay the House but I do state that the motion merits the support of at least every rural Deputy, and certainly of every Deputy representing a rural constituency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate but I feel that I cannot allow to pass unchallenged certain statements made by Deputy Corry in regard to the price of Indian corn.  I should like Deputy Corry and other Deputies to bear in mind the method of distribution of Indian corn to-day as compared with the method of distribution before the present Minister took over control.  I want to make it clear that under the method of distribution in operation under the previous Government certain areas had the advantage of a cheaper rate and were entitled to buy corn delivered at specially selected areas at a price much lower than the price at which it was made available in other areas.  My recollection is that in those days people who bought direct from the Continent in big quantities and brought in the <Col N="142" /> corn in big shiploads had a special price as a result of which the corn was distributed to those areas on very favourable terms while the millers who bought indirectly, who bought, say, from the Liverpool boats in small quantities were at a disadvantage. The corn was taken by these millers in small boats into the smaller ports. It gets wider distribution and is of greater benefit to the consumers under the present arrangement.</P>
      <P>The present Minister has made Indian corn available to every part of the country at a carriage paid price to the nearest railway station, where the miller can have that corn ground and turned into Indian meal.  That was a perfectly fair and reasonable way to do it and it put every consumer in the position of getting his Indian corn and Indian meal delivered at the same price as the man living beside the port in Dublin or any other part of the country.  So far as a monopoly in price is concerned, it was solely due to import facilities that existed previous to the change the present Minister has made.</P>
      <P>So far as the consumer is concerned, there was a disadvantage in Mayo, which is miles and miles away from Dublin port and a great distance from other ports.  We have the advantage now and we have to give credit to the present Minister for giving us the Indian meal at Ballina station at the same price as that at which it can be purchased in Sligo, Cork, Galway or Dublin.  I am satisfied that he has done the right thing.  He has given a facility to the producers to get the corn at the right price.  The previous regulations did not give that advantage. For years, in Mayo, on the borders of Sligo, Indian meal was costing anything from 12/- to 15/- a ton more than it was costing people in County Sligo.  Sligo had the advantage of a big port and a big ship coming direct, an advantage we had not got as Ballina port would not suit a big ship and the Indian corn did not come in there.  Now we have it as cheaply as anyone else.  That is due to the regulations made by the present Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now let us talk about the price of <Col N="143" /> pigs.  There is no suggestion from Deputy Corry or anyone speaking on this motion as to what the production cost should be for pigs.  I cannot see anyone being able to arrive at it.  The Minister and everyone else knows the export value of the potatoes grown on the land, and pig prices may depend on that.  How are you going to arrive at production cost?  If potatoes are 8/-or 9/- to the farmer, that will depend on export conditions and world markets, but if you had the condition existing to-day where the Minister could not give an export price for potatoes, what would be the price of potatoes to-day?  Everyone knows it would be much lower if you had not an export market for them.  It is by the export value of potatoes grown by the farmer that you have to fix the price of pigs to give the producer the production cost.  If you had not the export market, I do not think you would have potatoes making anything like 8/- a cwt. to-day to the farmer.  At that rate, I still feel that the pig is not a paying proposition.  However, it gives the farmer his choice.  He can sell his potatoes to the potato factories which will export them and make their own price, or if he wishes he may retain them in his own house and feed them to the pigs.  I have had a fairly big connection with the farmers and know the views of the farmers as they are to-day and as their views have been over 25 or 30 years.</P>
    <P>I do not believe a pig producer could say that the pig ever was a paying proposition. There was only one advantage in pig raising, that the pig was a sort of little savings bank for the small farmer and had the effect of building up a small deposit in the bank.  There was another advantage.  At certain periods of the year, you had certain portions of your crop which were not saleable&mdash;there were small potatoes, or potatoes not saleable at certain periods of the year&mdash;and these were used for feeding pigs.  What value would you put on that?  You could not put a value on that which you would put on the ordinary table potatoes or on those specially grown and selected, or exported for seed.  If you had not a pig, what would you do with this class <Col N="144" /> of stuff you were raising on the land? The pig producer had the advantage of having a use for that class of goods he produced; otherwise, he would have no outlet.  Without pigs or poultry, he would have to leave that otherwise useless produce on his land and waste it. The pig and poultry enabled him to make use of something which he could not use otherwise.  In August or early September, or from the 1st October until the 1st January, he might have this class of potato on his hands.  The pigs enabled him to use that portion of his crop.  Even then, the pig is still not a paying proposition.</P>
    <P>I would go further and say that you would never get anyone to say that the pig is a paying proposition.  There is, however, the advantage that the pig uses up something grown on the farmer's own land and, with the money collected, the farmer and his family have something to do in their spare time and have a sort of small reserve from this class of stuff grown on the land.  Then, when the time comes, by means of other mixtures of different food, Indian meal, pollard, bran and so on, he makes up his own compound, and that later is turned into bacon and he is ready to take advantage of offering his pig on the market.  Even the price he gets then may not make it a paying proposition, but he gets the money in one lump sum.  If a small farmer raises three or four pigs and after four months finds that they have a value of between £14 and £17 for four months' feeding, it means some money to him as a side-line.  That side-line may not be a profit, but has the advantage that the family has something to do in their spare time.  They are able to do this work and so fill up a gap which pays its own way and is a sort of income.</P>
    <P>We know the conditions that existed for a period of four or five years.  Bacon supplies were on a quota basis.  The consumers could not get bacon.  The price of bacon was beyond the ordinary man in the rural area and even at that price it was not available.  When the present Minister for Agriculture came into office a change was brought about in the situation.  Within a period of <Col N="145" /> nine months there was plenty of bacon on the counter of every shop.  There were complaints one year, on the discussion of the Estimate for Agriculture, about the price of bacon.  I remember saying on that occasion that, in my opinion, the only way to reduce the price of bacon was to put bacon on every counter and let competition regulate the price.  I admit that the price of bacon was increased by the bacon factories, but I do say that if any T.D. makes inquiries he will find that bacon is available in every shop at a lower price than the price prevailing before the present Minister took control. What is happening in my district must be happening in other districts.  The Minister for Agriculture is responsible for that.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows that eight or ten years ago the bacon factories could not continue to exist on the small supply of pigs available to them, with the result that people who had been in permanent employment for years in the factories were put out of employment.  As a result of the policy of the present Minister, all those workers have been brought back into the factories.  Pigs and bacon are again on the market and there is no shopkeeper who is not selling bacon to-day cheaper than he was selling it before the present Minister's administration.</P>
    <P>Complaints have been made with regard to the supply of pollard and bran.  I do not know what has happened the pollard.  In my opinion those areas where the flour is consumed are entitled to the bran and pollard.  The people who consume the flour should get the bran and pollard.  Bran and pollard are the main feeding-stuffs for raising young pigs and fowl.  Without them you have not the proper ingredients to make a mixture suitable for young fowl up to at least six months. Without bran and pollard you cannot make up a mixture suitable for young pigs from eight to 16 weeks.  There is no other mixture that will give the same return or that is as safe or as healthy as bran and pollard for young pigs of eight to 16 weeks.  There is no substitute.  Indian meal is not a suitable food.  Crushed oats is not a suitable food.  It is a dangerous food. <Col N="146" /> Crushed oats and Indian meal are all right for pigs over 16 weeks.  It is good food then but it is not a healthy food for young pigs.  I repeat that bran and pollard should be consumed in the areas where the flour is consumed. The ordinary farmers, pig producers and poultry producers who demand bran and pollard in their local shops should not be told that there is none available.</P>
    <P>We all know that 100 tons of wheat when converted into flour will give 85 tons of flour on an 85 per cent. extraction basis, ten tons of pollard and five tons of bran.  The areas that consume that 85 tons of flour produced from the 100 tons of wheat should get the ten tons of pollard and the five tons of bran.  In these areas poultry, eggs and pigs are produced.  In these areas the pigs are sent to the factories and the farmers of these areas are responsible for putting bacon on the counter.  If bran and pollard are being sent out of these areas, it means that the people of these areas are deprived of a cheap food.  It is the cheapest food available at the present time.  There is no comparison between the price of bran and pollard and the price of any other animal feeding.  The ordinary wholesale price in general is about £12 10s. a ton.  The fixed controlled price is about £14 a ton.  Having regard to food value, it is a cheap food.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Chair will allow me to say a word on a matter that has been raised by Deputy Corry.  I think Deputy Corry mentioned the price of eggs.  I think he said that there was something said to the Cork County Committee or the Cork farmers in connection with the price of eggs.</P>

      <P>Under the arrangement the Minister has made for a flat rate for eggs, there is a big difference between the price now and the price that obtained before he took control.  The Minister has made a job of the pig industry.  He has made a job of the whole Department connected with the raising of pigs and in connection with putting workers back in the factory and I support fully everything he has done. He deserves, and is getting credit for the way in which he is giving the pig producers an opportunity to get back into a business which they had forgotten, due to the way pigs were handled by the previous administration, and I feel I would not be doing my duty if I did not congratulate him on the way he has handled his Department since he took it over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember in the year 1932 the pig population of this country was pretty good.  Then the people who are now so solicitous with regard to the price of pigs introduced a commodity to which they gave the lovely name of &ldquo;admixture&rdquo; which was supposed to pull the farmers out of the rut in which they found themselves because of an economic war then in progress.  In one 12-month period, there was an amazing slackening off in the pig population and in the number of pigs being produced. Crocodile tears have been shed to-night by Deputy Corry and it reminds me of a famous circus which used to travel the country 50 years ago.  I notice that Deputy Allen has at last consented to smile.  His sanctimonious face has undergone a big change.  I told him before that he lost his vocation&mdash;he should not be an auctioneer but something else.  That circus had a bill on which was depicted a cock, with the statement: &ldquo;While I am alive I will crow.&rdquo;  Deputy Corry must have taken an example from that bill, because while he is alive he will crow about barley one year, wheat the next year, oats the next year, fowl the next year <Col N="148" /> and he has now arrived at apples. Apples are not a bad food for pigs.</P>
      <P>There is apparently only one section fattening pigs, the farmers, and by farmers are meant farmers like Deputy Corry, who has practically a ranch, and who at one time believed that no farmer should have more than 100 acres. A marvellous change came over him, however, and when opportunity offered he became a rancher.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I have digressed.  There are, however, other people producing pigs.  There are the cottiers in the towns and rural areas. It is most surprising that, for the past 12 months, these people have gone in more for the production of pigs and are continuing to enlarge their stocks week by week.  These are the people for whom, as Deputy Browne said, it is only a savings bank, but it would be a very serious matter for them if they were to get no interest on their investment after six months.  Very quickly they would drop out, but they must be making some money, because such people as small farmers, cottiers, town workers and people with little shops in towns who can afford to have a pig house at the back are getting into pigs and are feeding on the ration, and only the ration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a lot of talk about bran and pollard.  I do not know what has happened to some of the people here who speak about bran and pollard, because they were very anxious last year about the flour, for fear more bran and pollard would be taken from the flour and the poor man would suffer. There was to be discrimination in prices with one flour for the rich and another for the poor.  This year, they are wondering what has happened the bran and pollard.  You must remember that the particular people about whom I am speaking cannot afford to buy a ton of pollard, half a ton of bran, fishmeal and meat and bone meal and make their own ration.  Some of those people can only afford to go in and buy a couple of stone to feed two or three pigs, and that may be bi-weekly, as they have no <Col N="149" /> place to keep this ration.  Perhaps some of those people who are so anxious about the ration which is being issued by the millers should look over their own shoulder and see the authority they gave the millers some years ago when they issued a mixture composed of hulls of oats, beet pulp and a share of manganate thrown in with it.  Of course our friend will tell us that in Wexford they raise pigs and, of course, they have their share of sawdust too in the admixture.</P>
    <P>The queer thing is that there was never an analysis of that admixture but you can get an analysis now.  You can find out how much bran, pollard, fish and bone and meat meal there is in it.  Everyone of those people has to produce their formula which must be accepted by the technical staff of the department and it is not like before when you were getting beet pulp and oat hulls.</P>
    <P>I think that 190/- a cwt. is a glorious price for pigs and I would like if it could be maintained.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lehane will exhaust himself sometime or other with the weight of letters he is getting seeking that information.  I do not know if it can be got but it would be a glorious price.  Supply and demand governs every market in the world.  There are people who are very solicitous regarding the price the bacon curers are charging for bacon.  The retailers are charging a price which we believe is not in keeping with the price the producer is getting for his pigs, but we do not hear very much about them at all. All we hear is wailing and moaning about the bad price the pig producers get.  It is like the costings of milk. Deputy Lehane on a point of order at Cork County Committee of Agriculture succeeded in stifling this matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Of course milk is a very essential food for pigs.  Skimmed milk is a substitute for fishmeal and bone and meat meal.  We know that milk can be produced for 11.94d. for the whole year round although people are looking for 2/- a gallon.  To come back to the poor pig, the pig will be produced in this country while there is an economic price for the pig, but the very moment that people cry out that they are losing by it you will find, as happened in 1932 and 1933 that the pig will just fade away.</P>
      <P>Before I finish I would like to pay a tribute to Deputy Corry for bringing before the House that letter which was received from the Minister by the Cork County Committee of Agriculture.  It was one of the finest letters ever written by a Minister because for once the committee of agriculture in Cork were told the truth and they could not swallow it.  For the future, when we are debating pigs, I hope we will confine ourselves to pigs, but when one man extended his speech to fowl I thought we would have apples.  I was thinking eventually we would turn to haws and that the Minister for Agriculture might be held responsible by my friends on the left for having a good haw season when the rest of the fruit failed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great sympathy with the motion as it is put down, but we must realise that the problem has been created principally by the successful <Col N="151" /> efforts of the Minister for Agriculture to increase the pig population and supplies of bacon in this country. As a result of that very rapid success the pig producers now find themselves at the mercy of greedy distributors who are trying to exploit the producers and who will go on as long as they are allowed.  Deputy Corry surprised me. He is an unpredictable individual and you never know what to expect from him, but I got a surprise when I heard him sympathising with the pig producers because he must have remained silent for a long time when the figures show that for nine years the pig population in this country declined until in 1947 there was in this country the lowest population of pigs for a very long time.  We must remember, too, that the war had finished for two, practically three, years at that time, and we might have expected that the figures would have changed and that bacon would have shown an upward trend. Instead of that we know almost certainly that only for the change in agricultural policy the pig population in 1948 and 1949 would have been lower than it was in 1947.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A hundred and ninety shillings was mentioned several times and it must be agreed that that figure is substantially higher than the Fianna Fáil price, except of course the black market price which was allowed to flourish <Col N="152" /> during the years Fianna Fáil was in office.  At the same time it was not the producers who benefited by that black market.  I agree with Deputy Keane when he says that it would be grand for the farmers if they could get 190/-. The difficulty confronting them at the present time is that advantage is being taken of the fact that there is a good supply of pigs and that the price is being depressed by those who are responsible for buying pigs for the factories. I suggest that something should be done about the present methods of buying pigs for the factories so as to ensure that the producers will get a price nearer the maximum retail price than they are getting at the present time.  It would be only right to expect it as the maximum retail price has increased.  I agree that there is more grading of bacon than there was.  There is a larger selection and the prices are marked down from the maximum but when the maximum has increased the producers might have expected that that slight increase would be reflected in the price which is made available to them by the buyers for these factories. I heard Deputy Corry criticising the Minister for Agriculture and complaining that he was not doing his part for pig production.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, 16th February.</P>
