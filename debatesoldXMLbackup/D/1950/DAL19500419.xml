      <P>The Land Commission sanctioned a grant for the repair of the embankments in Callanafercy East and Callanafercy West on the condition that the benefiting land-owners would contribute towards the work. As the beneficiaries in Callanafercy East made the required contribution, the embankment in that townland has been repaired.  The repair of the other embankment cannot be proceeded with as the land-owners affected are not prepared to shoulder their responsibilities and contribute towards the work.</P>
      <P>As regards the other embankments the Land Commission are considering the question of granting assistance towards the necessary repairs, but a decision has not yet been reached.</P>

      <P>At this stage in the project work it is not possible to give figures which could confidently be regarded as average or representative.

As I have indicated in reply to previous questions, these restrictive practices on trade are being considered.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply which I gave to him in Dáil Éireann on 17th November, 1949, to the effect that the prices of some tinned and bottled foodstuffs are controlled either directly by Order fixing maximum retail prices or indirectly by arrangement with the manufacturers or importers.</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the schedule has already been received by the county council?  These two schemes have been put on the delayed list, if one can so describe it, despite the fact that the county council has made specific appeals for them in order to give employment in the area.  The town of Fermoy is periodically flooded.  There are 250 unemployed.  The local authority is waiting for the Department of Local Government to sanction these schemes as quickly as possible so that work can be proceeded with. Would the Parliamentary Secretary review the situation in that light?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not right to say this scheme has been rejected.  It necessitates a detailed examination, and a provisional allocation of money was made to the Cork County Council and to other county councils for schemes which could be put into operation immediately.  I think the Deputy will agree that this is a scheme which requires careful examination before a decision can be given and before money can be allocated for it.

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will state (a) the formula used by the Garda Síochána in 1928 when estimating road traffic density; (b) the number of miles of roads in the environs of Dublin where vehicles may be presumed to be circulating at the rate of over 400 per hour (assuming that the density increases in proportion to the total increase in vehicles licensed since 1928); (c) the number of miles of road now requiring double carriageways of 24 feet width, using the formula prepared by the engineering staff of the Department of Local Government about 1944; (d) the number of miles defined at (e) using any of the well-known methods of calculation in use abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>(a) The census of traffic taken in 1928 by the Garda Síochána at various points throughout the country was on the basis of a count of vehicles passing the selected points. Beyond assigning an assumed average weight to each vehicle for the purpose of determining the weight of traffic, no particular formula was used and no estimate made of traffic density. The details of the census will be found in the Report of the Department of Local Government and Public Health for 1928-29.  Subsequent investigations in the Department led to the determination in 1944 of a formula for estimating road traffic density for design purposes, based on the results of the 1928 census.</P>
      <P>(b)  On the assumption referred to&mdash; 12½ miles.</P>
      <P>(c)  In 1944 it was recommended that the provision of dual carriageways would be justified where the traffic density for design purposes might be assumed to exceed 400 vehicles per hour.  The application of the formula for the design standard for 1950 traffic shows that the same mileage of road as indicated at (b) was assumed in 1944 to reach a traffic density of 400 vehicles per hour in 1950 and on the basis of the formula in question the reply is, therefore, 12½ miles.</P>

      <P>I have received no proposals for the building of hospitals at Carrickmacross and Clones.  What I assume the Deputy has in mind is a proposal which I have approved in principle for the conversion of the fever hospitals at Clones and Carrickmacross into district hospitals when the old sanatorium at Monaghan is converted into a central fever hospital for the county.  It is obvious that the conversion work at both Carrickmacross and Clones cannot be undertaken until the work on the old sanatorium at Monaghan is completed and it is ready for the transfer of fever patients from these two institutions. The planning of that work is proceeding and an estimate of cost was recently submitted by the local authority. I am having the matter examined in the light of this estimate with a view to determining how the conversion can be carried out most economically and to the best advantage, and I hope to communicate with the local authority shortly.</P>

      <P>In July last a proposal of the local authority for the erection of a dispensary and residence at Ballickmoyler was sanctioned.  Following representations made to me as to the unsuitability of this location from the point of view of convenience of residents of the area, it was ascertained on inquiry from the local authority that the manager was reconsidering the matter. In September last the manager intimated that, after consideration, he was of opinion that the location originally proposed would be the most appropriate.  He was asked in November last if he had taken into account the possibility that in order to provide a better health service for the people it might be necessary in the near future to alter the boundaries of the present Ballickmoyler dispensary district and, if so, whether the proposed location would be suitable in the altered circumstances.  He replied back that he was again examining the matter, in consultation with members of the county council from the area, and would communicate with the Department.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In resuming this debate it may be well to remark again <Col N="667" /> that there is a situation sufficiently dangerous, sufficiently threatening, to warrant, and in fact to necessitate our actively tackling this defence problem, and, secondly, that our defence problem is such, and the amount of leeway that has to be made up is such that it is unnecessary to resolve some of the questions that were introduced into this debate last night as a preliminary to tackling our defence problem.  In other words, vital, urgent, and of paramount national importance as the problem of Partition is, or however important the problem as to our precise position if an emergency should come may be, the fact nevertheless remains that so far as our defence problem is concerned, the approach indicated for us and the steps that we can take and which we should take to met this defence problem will be the same in any event and can be embarked upon and prosecuted irrespective of the solution or the outcome of these other problems which have been adverted to.  That is important.  It is important because it, to that extent, leaves the defence problem a simple one.  We are fortunate in this at least that our problem is of such a nature that we have not to speculate on the events of the future and that the general plan we can embark upon will be generally the same in any conceivable event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second thing is, and it is equally important, that urgent, vital and important as these other problems are, there is no reason for making them an excuse for putting our defence problem on the long finger.  We can, without prejudice to them and without in any way being involved, provide for our defence here at least to a considerably greater extent than anything that has been proposed or embarked upon up to the present moment.  We can do that and should do it.  What can we do? Visualising what may be before us, whatever it may be, it will be a state of emergency and to a certain extent a state of relative isolation.  Whether it is emergency of threatened war, or whether war is actually visited upon us, there will be the problem of feeding <Col N="668" /> the population.  With that broad problem of defence our whole agricultural policy is closely connected and though our agricultural policy will come up for discussion on another Estimate, since we are dealing with the question of defence and as this is the only opportunity we shall have of dealing with the repercussions of the agricultural policy on the question of defence, I would ask you, a Chinn Chomhairle, to allow me to refer very briefly to the reactions of our agricultural policy on our defence problem.</P>
    <P>A basis to any well-thought-out defence plan is that the country should be self-supporting as far as possible in the production of foodstuffs for our own people.  We should not lose sight of the fact that our agricultural organisation should at all times be kept at the stage where it can be immediately turned and developed to feeding and keeping our people at a reasonable standard, if anything like war should come.  Fortunately for us &mdash;it may be that it was due more to other considerations than to any specific defence design&mdash;the tillage policy which we had developed in the pre-war days helped materially to give us independence in that regard when war came, and we found ourselves in the condition of being able to survive the emergency with plenty of food for our own population.  Our position as regards food supplies was much superior to that of many other countries in the world.  That followed incidentally from the village policy that was developed before the war. So in the present case our Minister for Defence should exercise his influence with his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, to ensure that at all times such plans will be in existence in connection with our agricultural policy that if an emergency should come the feeding problem will be in at least as satisfactory a position as it was in the last emergency. That is the first and most vital element in our defence.</P>
    <P>We, on these benches, by virtue of the fact that we held certain views in regard to an agricultural policy, operated a certain policy from the time this Party assumed the reins of <Col N="669" /> government in 1932.  It has been effectively tried out and found not wanting as the policy that is best for us in peace and in war.  Some of us feel that it has not been vigorously enough pursued of late and that in recent years balance has been lost. That is a first priority in defence, and if the Minister for Defence is going to provide for an emergency, the first thing he should do is to use his influence with his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, to ensure that his schemes will provide for that paramount requirement.  You may talk about sympathy for others and feeding the people outside, looking after other people's interests and so forth&mdash;well, our own people come first and should come first.  I mentioned that at length, because in perspective it is the first requirement in defence, and the Minister mentioned it.  We can do that. That is the point.  The prosecution of that approach to our defence problem is quite independent of any of the other problems, serious, urgent and vital as they are.  It is an approach that can be implemented independent of them and, in fact, will contribute towards assisting us in our approach to those other problems.</P>
    <P>The next question that arises in connection with the Minister's Department is a question that has been frequently adverted to on this Vote, and it is a vital thing in modern times where war is of a total nature.  That is the question of co-ordination with the Department of Industry and Commerce. Firstly, arrangements must be made to feed the people; arrangements must be made to keep life going on at home. If you have the best army in the world you will get very little distance if you have not, as part of your defence preliminaries and organisation, arranged for these things also.  That, too, is a subject for another Estimate in detail; it could provide extensive material in itself for a debate.</P>
    <P>Certain points come to mind.  In so far as the international situation is deteriorating&mdash;if it is&mdash;and in measure of the probability or danger of an emergency, care should be taken that essential stocks of the materials that we could not import during an emergency <Col N="670" /> are maintained.  Storage space is one thing in which the Minister could interest himself actively with his colleagues.  During the last war storage proved to be a difficult matter. Provision of stocks and adequate storage can be and should be made in advance.  These are vital aspects of our defence policy.  They so tie up with a proper peacetime policy for this State that the two can happily go hand-in-hand without throwing any great strain on the community.  It is merely the economics of the self-reliant man which not only is best for himself, but also usually works out as his best preparation for an emergency or a time of want.</P>
    <P>Fuel and transport come in there. Stocks and emergency production of fuel should actively engage the attention of the Minister.  Then there is the question of transport for military purposes or for the evacuation of civilians. How far have these things been co-ordinated?  How far has any realistic approach to the possible demand in this element in times of crisis been made?</P>
    <P>The question of particular industries is also important.  It is regrettable in this connection that when this Government came into power it let certain industries go that would be vital in this regard&mdash;industries of a mechanical nature.  But spilt milk is spilt milk. We should do what we can with what is left and what we can develop.</P>
    <P>There is one line which is important from a defence and a civilian aspect. I have mentioned this in another debate. It is the question of a fertiliser industry.  We know from the last war that a fertiliser industry would have been of great value.  From the defence angle its importance lies not only in helping to solve the food problem but also from the point of view of deriving chemical supplies from it.  A chemical industry can be built around a fertiliser industry.  It is of considerable importance in peace time and it can be a useful adjunct to a country such as this in time of war.</P>
    <P>Cement is another thing to be considered if we are to deal with the protection of the civilian population, and <Col N="671" /> even from the military side of the picture.  In that respect cement supplies must be of considerable interest to the Minister.  These are all problems of co-ordination, but there is not an element that I have mentioned so far that should not be of interest to the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to coordinate with the Department of Local Government in the matter of regional organisation and so forth.  The defence of the civilian population is one thing that must be uppermost in his mind.  Whether you are involved or not, certain preliminary arrangements must be made.  If there is any danger of war it is vital, if the country is to survive, that adequate protection will be given to the civilian population, particularly in places like Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  If you do not provide for that type of defence you can forget about your military defence, because the whole morale of the country will depend on that.  Apart from the fact that the nerve centres of Government will largely be featured around these centres of population, the whole question of the morale of the community will depend largely on the provision you make.</P>
    <P>In modern times it is vitally essential that you should provide for civilian defence.  You need adequate protection from air raids.  Incidentally, I anticipate a number of people will talk about atomic bombs.  So far there is very little published about whatever success there may have been with the hydrogen nuclear bomb, but there is one thing experts are satisfied with and it is this, that with organisation and proper preparation a very high degree of protection can be achieved in face of threats of bombs of the nature used in Japan.  But a <i>sine qua non</i> is that that organisation should be effective; that there is good organisation there and that physical protection in the nature of shelters is provided.  Given the organisation and the shelters, it is now believed that protection in face of these new terrors is by no means impossible.  It is possible to such an extent that many authorities doubt whether wholesale <Col N="672" /> bombing will be worth while.  The important thing is that a high degree of protection can be attained.  If that protection is not there, you are very vulnerable indeed.  That is one point upon which the whole structure of national morale depends.</P>
    <P>On top of that there is the possible threat of chemical or bacteriological warfare.  I am not going to try to assess the probabilities in this connection, but once already these agents have been used.  In the last war they were expected.  The Germans developed more potent chemical poison gases than ever before.  Incidentally, following from the development of the atomic bomb there are radio active poisons which have to be considered now.</P>
    <P>In England and other countries very vigorous steps are being taken to provide protection against possible attack by these agents.  Some protection is possible and the point is that if you do not minimise vulnerability to these things it is hardly worth while to do anything about defence at all.  Before the last war, even though it was in a small way, some effort was made to train people to combat these things. This aspect is tied up with Industry and Commerce and Local Government and the Minister who will be considered responsible for thinking about defence in pre-war years must make it his business to bring these aspects to the notice of his colleagues in the Government in order to see that in the present situation, which we are all agreed is sufficiently dangerous to warrant serious attention, every possible angle is attended to.</P>
    <P>Not only must civilian defence to that extent be provided for, but the question of evacuation assumes a far greater importance than even in the last war.  It ties up with transport and possible troop movements, if there are to be any.  Now, we know from the past that these were headaches, and that if any such problems had arisen, problems posed by possible troop movements and the evacuation of the civil population, there was going to be resulting chaos.  Having had the opportunity of learning that lesson and of having it so graphically brought before <Col N="673" /> us we should not fail to assimilate it.  We should now take concrete steps in regard to planning, preparation and preliminary implementation. There is, of course, the point of the expense involved, but the earlier the start we make the better so that the cost can be more broadly spread.  If we put the thing on too long a finger ultimately we will find that there is neither the time to do everything nor the facilities nor money for doing it.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned medical services in connection with the civilian population. All these things are, so to speak, basic factors in defence.  I think somebody pointed out in a previous debate that our defence force comes in, so to speak, as the hedge inside which you will have to organise your life in emergency conditions if these should come.  You need your Defence Forces for internal security, for garrison purposes, and as a deterrent to anybody who might be tempted to interfere with you, and to provide sufficient protection so that no person will have the excuse to come in and dictate to you because you are not sufficiently protected.  Just as we can take certain concrete steps in regard to the broad aspects of defence to implement a broad positive policy in that regard so too in regard to our Army.  We know that the Minister is having a difficulty in getting equipment at this stage.  Everybody has sympathy with him.  There are certain things that can be done, and these should be vigorously pursued.  If we cannot expand in one direction that is all the more reason why we should vigorously proceed in the direction in which we can.</P>
    <P>The Army that we need for defence in time of emergency has fundamentally to be composed of three elements, or five if you like to put it more specifically. You need a permanent force; you need a First Line Reserve; you need a territorial force or the F.C.A. I pointed out last night the vital distinction there is between the roles of these two elements.  You also need a naval service as part of your Army and you need your air element.  The Minister's advisers will advise on the technical roles for each of these. Generally speaking you have to provide <Col N="674" /> firstly garrisons&mdash;local tactical dispositions all over the country&mdash;in which your F.C.A. will play their part, and thereafter what one may call your field force.  An important matter is whether you want these forces concentrated or whether they should be dispersed, but you want them no matter how they are placed.  To meet that picture you need a permanent force of a certain size.  Last night I think I was able to point out that the present force is inadequate.  We know that actually we are in a worse position, relatively speaking, than we were in in 1940 when the emergency broke.  Our permanent force strength is just about comparable to the strength we had in 1939, which was completely inadequate.  What can we do about that?  There is one thing we can do, and that is to go all out to recruit and build it up to the peace establishment strength which was decided on after long thought and consideration as a basic minimum. Two excuses for not doing that have been given already.  I think I have already pointed out that they are not valid.  The first excuse was that we could not get the men.  The recruiting drive since Christmas shows that we can get the men if we go after them and make conditions sufficiently attractive for them.  The second excuse was that we were taking good men away from production.  I pointed out last night that that excuse is not valid while we have the emigration and the unemployment that we have to-day.  As far as the permanent force is concerned we can and should build it up.</P>
    <P>The Minister asked for help.  Surely, there is something ironical in that. The Minister will get all the help he wants to build up the permanent and voluntary force, and what we say to him is to &ldquo;go ahead with the job&rdquo;. He will get encouragement and he is getting it now.  It is encouraging to know that in three months he was able to get enough to make up the wastage of two years&mdash;not completely by any means but to a certain extent.  We did get about 1,100 recruits.  It should, therefore, be possible to get the few thousand more that we need to fill up our establishment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="675" /> I have been very critical of the Minister, but I am very glad that the Minister has preserved the percentages in the way that he has.  The Minister has preserved the proportion of N.C.O.s and officers.  I think that was a very wise and proper thing to do.  I do not know if they are quite up to establishment, but the point is that whatever wastage occurred in the specialised elements it has been less serious, even though something below establishment, in the case of N.C.O.s and officers.</P>
    <P>We are pleased with the reports we have heard in regard to the military college and of the standard of training there amongst leaders and officers.  I think it always had a high standard, and I understand that very good work is being done there.  Every facility and encouragement should be given there, and I hope it will continue to be given. We can provide a training for leaders. There is surely enough equipment to provide general training and that should be used to build up a full peace establishment with the proper cadre for reserves, so that you will have the structure and skeleton around which to build up your purely military defence schemes.  In addition to the military aspect of the question, the Minister will have to provide an organisation for civilian defence, which may require whole-time personnel.  That is a matter that can be gone into in greater detail at another time.</P>
    <P>Now the permanent force is the basis upon which everything depends on the purely military side of the picture. In fact, in a small country like this our whole defence problem largely depends on the morale of the regular forces because in the pre-emergency stages practically all defence problems will be shifted back to this particular Minister and his Department.  I should like, therefore, to digress at this stage to something which the Minister has been insisting upon in a number of debates.  The Minister has been very fond of saying to Deputy Traynor, in particular, that he was merely trying to carry a large voluntary Army; that <Col N="676" /> years ago this Party was all out for reducing the permanent Army and having a voluntary force.  Be that as it may, I want to deal with two possible views on this question which have been advanced in the past.  I have done so already in previous debates, but as the Minister has brought it up again in this one, it is no harm to dispose of it.</P>
    <P>There were two schools of thought in this regard before the last emergency. One school said you were wasting your time on reserves.  That particular school of thought saw the difficulty of training reserves, the high percentage of wastage inevitable with voluntary reserves, and felt that the only answer in modern times was, as many military people in these days thought, a very highly mobile trained regular force and concentrated on that.  The trouble about that is that you cannot get the uniform standard of personnel required; that you cannot support the numbers which will justify you in having such a force in a small country like this and that you have to rely on reserves largely which will only become a serious expense to you when actually needed.  Therefore, on the opposite side of the argument, there were those people to whom the Minister was referring who advocated that you should have a small skilful Regular Army where every man was trained to be a potential officer and that on that small cadre you should mobilise the reserves; in other words, an extremely small permanent force and a big reserve which would be mobilised on that.</P>
    <P>That idea, in the light of our experience also, is not altogether practicable. The first thing that we learned in all our experience with the Volunteer Reserve in 1929, the B Reserve, the O.T.C., and particularly the Volunteer Force, and I think it will be learned from the F.C.A. to-day, although they are not a first line reserve, was that there was a limit to the size of the Reserve you could maintain and that that limit is fixed by the size of the Regular Army; that if given a Regular Army of any particular size that Army can only usefully support a Reserve of a certain limited size related to the particular size of the existing Army. <Col N="677" /> Therefore, you might put it this way: that for so many men in the Reserve you want one man in the permanent service, whether officer or N.C.O., to provide for administration, Reserve, training, etc.  It is illusory and dangerous, therefore, to think in terms of a reserve of 100,000 and a regular force in the vicinity of 5,000 to 10,000 as such a regular force could not cater for that reserve and the whole thing would become simply a sham.</P>
    <P>There is another reason which I gave before as to why the aspirations of having a small highly-skilled army and a big reserve will not work.  I mentioned the fact that the standard of character, education and so forth of the personnel in an army as you will find in practice will never be such as to give 100 per cent. or a very large percentage of potential officer material of the sort you require.  The next one is the incidence of garrison and similar duties.  There is a certain basic limit there and it will be shown up particularly in a time of emergency, as in 1939.  There are certain basic guards which must be supplied by the regular troops and those guards and garrisons take away from the pool which will handle the Reserve and be available for field troops.  That is a further factor which invalidates the argument.</P>
    <P>The next thing is that on mobilisation you must have trained and ready for the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; a small minimum number of troops for disposal to protect the key points and meet immediate requirements. You must have them ready immediately and that necessitates the particular strength of the permanent force being something more than that of a cadre.  In other words, even though every man was of officer material, nevertheless, apart from wanting regular personnel to be a skeleton for reserve formations, you want certain regular units already embodied and disposable as such and that requirement absorbs a considerable number of troops and again tends to increase the size of the Regular Army you must maintain.</P>
    <P>Lastly, there is the technical consideration that under modern conditions the training of technical troops, signals, engineers, artillery, and I would go so <Col N="678" /> far as to say, infantry, is such that it is not sufficient to have the individual skilled and trained, but the team as a whole, as a unit, must be trained and technically skilled.  To get skill and efficiency in that sense requires numbers and that also tends to increase the size of the force.  Two years ago in this Estimate I dealt with these particular points in great detail, and I do not intend to labour them now.  But, in reply to the Minister's suggestion that all he was doing was carrying out what was advocated from these benches, namely, a small Regular Army supporting a large reserve, I say that from our experience in the years of the emergency, coupled with present-day conditions, that concept has to be revised.  It may have been valid when most of the equipment consisted of rifles, but it is not valid now.  We have to take these facts as we find them and, therefore, the strength of the permanent force, particularly in regard to specialists, should be increased.</P>
    <P>Finally, it resolves itself back again to attaining and maintaining the peace establishment that is there, particularly in regard to technical corps. The Minister has adverted to something I said on the Defence Forces Bill, namely, that the unsatisfactory position exists where men have left the force and that the technical corps are being maintained by civilian personnel. I know the decision from which that flowed and I think I could have anticipated that.  The Minister says this matter is under consideration and I simply then commend to him that he should pursue vigorously whatever method is adopted, whether it is a question of restoring the specialist pay or whatever it is; that something will have to be done to mobilise, in the sense of making mobile, those units which depend on such personnel.  It is perhaps a more urgent job than merely filling the infantry units.  As part of the task of maintaining the establishment this whole question of specialists needs urgent attention.  The next problem is the problem of the First Line Reserves.  For a number of years past an idea seems to have crept in that the F.C.A. will take the place of the <Col N="679" /> First Line Reserve.  Last night I gave the reasons as to why I think that is not so and cannot be so.  The First Line Reserve is nothing more nor less than the personnel to be mobilised in order to build up an army of sufficient strength in times of emergency.  They are the personnel which will be called upon in order to expand by so many more thousands to a bigger army than one can maintain in peace time.  Under modern conditions it is essential that such a reserve should have sufficient experience to enable it to take its place quickly in the military machine should mobilisation be necessary.</P>
    <P>The ideal type of First Line Reserve is that of officers, N.C.O.s and men who served in the Regular Army for a few years and who do a certain amount of refresher training every year.  That is the most efficient type of reserve, and that is the type that will give one the least wastage and the least friction should mobilisation become necessary. These men have already had experience both as a team and as individuals, and a greater degree of training than can be achieved by a purely voluntary force.  One of the snags in that regard, however, is that such a reserve is completely conditioned by the outflow from the Regular Army.  If one maintains the Army at a certain strength, one can only maintain a reserve of a certain corresponding strength.  It looks, and I make this statement with a certain amount of caution, both from the pre-war figures and the present-day figures, as if the approximate strength of the Reserve will be something similar to the strength of the permanent force itself.  It may be a little less.  That depends upon the terms of service.  It is something which can perhaps be adjusted.</P>
    <P>Before the war we had 4,000 to 5,000 in the &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo; category.  Now we have about 6,000.  That means that at any time one must be content with a fully mobilised Army of approximately double our peace-time strength.  The only alternative is to supply the deficiency by some other means, either by means of compulsory service or by means of a voluntary First Line Reserve.  I traced the <Col N="680" /> figures in detail last night, and they clearly show that a First Line Reserve of that nature will not be good enough since it only gives us about 14,000 first line men at the moment. Both the Cumann na nGaedheal and the Fianna Fáil Governments felt there was a definite need to supplement this part of the Reserve.  The &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo; Reserves were in existence only a few years when the Cumann na nGaedheal Government felt there was a need.  That Government was in the position of having a big &ldquo;A&rdquo; Reserve of both officers and men, who had been trained over a number of years in the Army, and who had actual experience of fighting.  The first experiment then was the Volunteer Reserve and the O.T.C.  The Volunteer Reserve was on too small a scale to give any indication of its potentialities.  The O.T.C. was inefficiently prosecuted and turned into a holiday camp for university students. It cannot be counted, therefore, in any serious reckoning.  The &ldquo;B&rdquo; Reserve was a kind of militia scheme, and did give a certain amount of promise.  It augmented the then available Reserve by approximately 3,000 men.  Many people objected to it because it gave you men but did not give you leader material.  But it gave good men working on a system of three months' intensive training and an annual period of training thereafter.  It may be that the Minister will consider supplementing the First Line Reserve by something of that nature.  There was then the Officer Reserve.  In those days there was a larger proportion of Reserve officers than would normally flow out from the Army.  That was due to certain historical reasons.</P>
    <P>Now some provision will have to be made for a Reserve of Officers as time goes on.  That is much more important than the men.  With the men, after two years' service one automatically has a certain number in reserve.  But there are very few officers flowing to reserve, since when they are commissioned they go right through until they reach the retiring age.  At that point they are useless as field soldiers. The present Reserve of Officers consists for the most part of officers who came from the emergency, and who <Col N="681" /> remained on the Reserve after the emergency.  As far as I know, no addition has been made to that group, and the Minister has the serious problem of supplying his First Line Reserve with commissioned personnel.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the experience of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government. The experience of the Fianna Fáil Government was also that some fúrther reserve was necessary.  Deputy Aiken, as Minister for Defence, energetically developed the Volunteer force and provided approximately 10,000 more men on the First Line Reserve. In its initial stages it was found that the scheme was almost too voluntary and the provisions made for resignation and so forth were most unsatisfactory. I traced its history on another debate.  The important point is that in the early months of 1939 that force was reorganised and reconstituted a First Line Reserve with no escape, so to speak.  The officers, N.C.O.s and men were given a proper army standard of training and when war broke out it was possible to mobilise out of that Reserve approximately 7,500 men.  One was able to add to the 4,500 A and B Reservists 7,000 from this Volunteer force.  All the members of that force had done a certain amount of full-time training and its officers had attended an intensive course of night-time training every week and every week-end over a period of 18 months or two years in order to bring them up to the required standard, or else a whole-time course at the Military College.  Despite that, the military authorities felt that some further time would be necessary to get that particular element up to the regular standard and that more time would be required for that purpose than would be required for the A Reserve or the natural First Line Reserve flowing from the Regular Army.  Yet, here we are to-day with no provision for that First Line Reserve.</P>
    <P>It is high time now that the Minister adverted to that problem.  In the days of his predecessor it was already under consideration.  Only two courses are possible&mdash;(1) compulsory military service, which has been adopted in practically every country in the world or <Col N="682" /> (2) some sort of voluntary scheme. There are particular problems in this country which make the matter extremely difficult in regard to what has been done in other countries as to first line reserves.  However, the alternative was open to us, and it was effectively pursued by us and in the last analysis justified.  If you could mobilise about 85 per cent. of that reserve when you wanted them in 1939, then your experiment was justified.  It was more than justified in the event, particularly as time was available to absorb these men.  The officers and men were of importance; even the wastage was of importance.  When it came to call for recruits in 1940, many of those who had already got partial training, who were wastage in the sense that they had already gone, came back and the training given them then paid dividends and came back to the advantage of the Army as a whole.</P>
    <P>The point for the Minister now is this: that in dealing with this problem of the Reserve he can do little in regard to the flow from the Regular Army; that his officer reserve is a problem in itself and that he can only hope to keep it going in the future supplemented by some voluntary scheme; that something must be done about the necessity for adding to his Reserve to bring it up to any particular size in time of emergency.  If the Minister or the country is not prepared to deal with the problem as it has been dealt with by other countries, then some voluntary scheme must be put into force in addition to the F.C.A. The rôles are two completely different things.  Both matters were largely examined and what you might call the planning and report stage were done before the Minister assumed office.  Much of the donkey and spade work has been done.  Very little time should be wasted on exploratory planning, as much of that has been done. I would commend to the Minister the necessity for developing this element of his First Line Reserve&mdash;again, the <i>sine qua non</i> is to have a Regular Army of sufficient strength.  It would be folly to embark on anything like that if you have not the regular personnel and cadre.  It was considered at that time that the peace establishments <Col N="683" /> which now exist were the absolute basic minimum.  This matter is very serious and the Minister is responsible if anything should break.  If the situation should become more serious, mounting towards a crisis, it is the Minister in this particular period who will have to bear the blame because precious time is flowing and all this particular part of the problem could be solved without undue strain on the community.  We did it in 1934 to 1939 in times when it was much harder to make the people of the country understand, in times in which the Minister had parliamentary and other opposition to any such course.  Surely to-day, when an intelligent people see the signs, when we can get unanimity here, when the Government can be certain that the Opposition in Parliament will not exploit or will not hinder it where it is tackling a job of national importance, surely in all these circumstances there is no excuse for not attending to those particular problems.  The solution in no way depends on many of the extraneous although important matters that have been introduced into this debate.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the F.C.A.  The F.C.A., as I pointed out last night, both from its nature and from the rôle which it may be called upon to play, is not to be considered as a First Line Reserve.  It is wrong and dangerous for us to consider that the F.C.A. as such, on its present establishment and so forth, is taking the place of a First Line Reserve, and it is wrong and dangerous to represent to the country that we have a sufficient Regular Army with about 20,000 reserves tacked on. It is wrong for the reasons that I mentioned last night.  The F.C.A. have a rôle of their own to perform, and they will be needed in that rôle in time of war.  Many from their ranks will possibly flow as volunteers to the Regular Army when wanted but then somebody else will have to attend to the F.C.A. job.  It is an important and honourable rôle.  These same F.C.A. men will not be available either in peace or war to do the intensive training necessary to fit them for the specialised job of First Line Reserves. That does not mean that they are in <Col N="684" /> any way inferior.  Their job is specialised, but it will be specialised to fit in with the fact that they will only be part-time soldiers, and can give only a certain amount of time, and that some of them will be needed in their civilian vocations during war as in peace-time.  That fact should be grasped, and particularly so at the moment, on their terms of service. Some time ago I asked the Minister and he was good enough to furnish me with the terms of service of the F.C.A. in comparison with the terms of service of the Volunteer Force.  From that information it is quite apparent that the officers and men of the F.C.A. will never be able to get the degree of training in all the specialised arms and aspects that are necessary for a First Line Reserve.  For instance the F.C.A. officer will not be able to get the detailed technical training that the First Line Reserve officer requires to take his place in a first line formation. On the other hand, he has certain very vital jobs of a different nature altogether to do.  The same applies to the men.  I am by no means disparaging the F.C.A. in its functions, but it is perfectly evident that on the present terms of service of that force they cannot and should not be called upon to fill that bill when we consider the standard of training required from a first line point of view.</P>
    <P>Another aspect, too, to which I might refer is that at the present moment for some reason that I do not understand they have been confined to the rifle battalions except in a few specialised areas such as Dublin.  That is the information which I got a short time ago.  I hope that has been changed.  I see no reason why these men should not be trained in the use of all automatic weapons, the placing of mines, demolitions and so forth, that they can do and should do.  The main difficulty arises from the question of time.  There, therefore, is another problem.  The training of the F.C.A. should not be confused with the raising and training of a First Line Reserve.  But it is equally important and should get attention, and in this regard I think it would be only courteous to say that I think the Minister is doing the right thing if he attaches <Col N="685" /> more regular personnel to the F.C.A. to train them and to encourage them. They are a vitally important and necessary factor in our defence scheme. They are a pool of possible recruits either to your First Line Reserve when you embark upon it or even to your regular Army, and they should be trained and given all facilities.  It applies to all reserves, First or Second Line, the necessity for supplying not only adequate administrative military personnel and training equipment but also adequate training personnel to train the force.  In other words, it is back to the old story of to every element of the Reserve a minimum cadre or skeleton is needed, and that puts a strain on your permanent Army, and we come back to the question of peace establishments and the necessity for maintaining its strength.  The facilities the F.C.A. will require will be almost as exacting upon the Regular Army, if not more so, than the facilities for First Line Reserve.  But the two should not be confused.  I hope in the future we shall not make the mistake which I think has been made heretofore of largely confusing the roles of these various elements.  I am not saying anything about the details as to the exact disposal of these elements in time of crisis.  That is a technical matter.  It is a matter for the staff, but the point is that no matter what way you tackle it you need men and the organisation to do it.  You need adequate permanent forces and an adequate First Line Reserve, so that you will have an adequate Army when mobilisation becomes necessary, and, on top of that, a Local Defence Force to fulfil their own particular role, to collaborate with the Regular Army and, to a certain extent, to save the necessity for having an excessive call on manpower for purely military purposes.  So much for personnel.</P>
    <P>These are the concrete things we can do.  These are things in regard to which it is no excuse to say that the problem is so difficult that we can do nothing about it.  These are things for which you require only a little bit of energy on your part and you will get results.  There is nothing in the requirements of that aspect of the <Col N="686" /> picture that would justify the Minister in his attitude when he said that he wished he were living in some past age and had not his present problem. Something concrete can be done and should be done.  Our experience of the past is that it can be done particularly as regards a First Line Reserve.</P>
    <P>We move on to an equally vital aspect of the story now, the question of equipment.  One must realise the great difficulty the Minister has in this regard, if we accept his statement when he says that he cannot get any equipment at all.  On the other hand, there are certain steps in that direction that we could take ourselves and why cannot we take them?  First of all, is everybody satisfied that every vigorous effort necessary is being made by the Government?  I am quite satisfied that every effort is being made by the Army, but the Army, so far as the Minister's Department is concerned, must act departmentally in peace time. I wonder if any vigorous effort was made by the Minister's Department to get vital equipment, in spite of all the protestations we have heard?  I have heard, for instance, that two years ago certain equipment was available and we did not take it.  I know that up to that time there was the problem of balancing the danger of buying too soon against the danger of being too late.  That has been mentioned on previous occasions.  It is true that that problem remained up to the spring of 1948.  It was in the early summer of 1948 that the Scandinavian countries gave the first danger signal. It was not until the following autumn that the British post-war trend was reversed towards war preparations again.  It was not until the autumn of 1948 that that took place and that the acute needs of the situation became really apparent but, nevertheless, it should have been possible at that time to get some equipment.  I am not quite satisfied that if a vigorous effort were made some could not be got, of some sort.</P>
    <P>I mentioned last night in connection with equipment that whereas expenditure on every other head had increased in the last two years, there was a startling decrease in expenditure on the <Col N="687" /> heads dealing with equipment.  Even though I am prepared to concede to the Minister that possibly the price of equipment, since it is a very technical thing, may not have increased owing to what I might call the reflection of present price trends, still it is significant that instead of showing an increase, as other items have shown, where vital equipment is concerned, we show a radical decrease.  Anyway, surely the Minister and the Department might find it possible to do certain things and to go a certain distance towards providing certain equipment? I know that what we can do here will be small indeed, but it will be doing something all the same.  The Minister referred to the armoured brigade, that if we had an armoured brigade going down O'Connell Street we would not see the men in it.  All right, but in spite of the Minister's suggestion everything is not conditioned by the armoured brigade.  Anything I have read on that matter seems to suggest that military writers and thinkers wonder as to whether the defensive is not in the ascendant again.  I cannot turn up the reference at the moment, but the works of certain writers which I have read seem to suggest that an efficient anti-tank defence is the mine-field. Towards the end of the war one of the big trends was towards the mine. Surely it should be possible to make mines?  Handicapped as we were in the emergency, we could do something in that direction.  We could even make a home-made explosive for it.  Surely in conjunction with certain scientific people in the country, as we did in the Emergency Research Bureau, you could get results in that way.</P>
    <P>There have been relatively simple anti-tank devices developed during the war, like the Bazooka.  It is not beyond the engineering possibilities of our country to develop devices of that kind, if we cannot get equipment outside. They may be inferior to what you could buy, but they would be better than nothing.  When you come to an emergency, anyway, you will be forced to improvisation of that kind. If the Minister is not prepared to spend the money on actual production, surely he could get together some <Col N="688" /> staff, some people to lay the plans, and who would be ready at the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; to provide for these things.</P>
    <P>The Minister has difficulty in getting equipment&mdash;we can see that.  He should try to get all he can.  I am not going to go back over the sorry history of his first year in office in that regard.  He can explore and get effective results in the line of improvisation. It may not be the most satisfactory way, and I know there is a certain repugnancy in that approach to any Regular Army officer or anybody who has a pride in his trade, but nevertheless it can be done.  But there is a possible concrete approach to this problem.  All of these items could be expanded.</P>
    <P>I want to refer again, before I close, to some figures.  It has been necessary to deal with these figures because the Minister's information in regard to some of them, particularly on the last occasion, was not very accurate, and I think we should insist, without offence to the Minister, on a very high standard of ministerial accuracy in regard to such things as statistics.  Parliamentary life would become a complete farce if Deputies are to be in any way misled or put off by inaccurate information from ministerial quarters.  I make every allowance, realising what the Minister said on the Defence Forces Bill was impromptu.  Nevertheless, the principle is of sufficient importance.  What is more, the method in which these remarks were made was such as to indicate that the Minister was grossly misinformed within his own Department, and that is a serious thing.</P>
    <P>In the debate on that Bill there were four occasions on which reference was made to figures and I will ask the Minister to advert to them.  These figures got a certain amount of publicity in the country and it was misleading and inaccurate information for the country.  It was featured in papers favourable to the Government.  The first was the question of Army strength, and I can hardly accept that as a slip, because it was repeated three times. In Volume 119, No. 6, column 820, Tuesday, 28th February, the Minister is reported:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="689" />&ldquo;It is higher than when I took over.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At column 993 the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...the fact of the matter is that we have a bigger Army to-day than his Minister for Defence left behind him.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In columns 884-5 he is reported:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As the Deputy knows when he left me a smaller Army than we have at the moment, he camouflaged that by putting down a figure which misled his Leader this evening...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There were three definite statements and, resulting from them, certain searching questions were put to the Minister and the Minister quite frankly admitted his error, the fact being that not only had the Army fallen in strength but by December of last year it had reached a figure lower than in 1939, when war broke out.  In December of last year we had a Regular Army of less strength than was available when war broke out in September of 1939 and there was a First Line Reserve of approximately only half of the First Line Reserve then available. In view of that situation, and particularly because those figures got such publicity, I feel it is my duty to advert to them now.  I regard it as a dangerous thing.</P>
    <P>In the Seanad the Minister mentioned in connection with the same Bill that the recruits numbered 895, but in reply to Deputy Colley he gave, in Volume 119, the figure 842.  Another error I would like to ask the Minister to explain is this: in Volume 119, No. 9, dealing with the question of strength, the Minister referred in column 1279 to the number of cadets.  Surely the Minister should know the number of cadets?  I referred to the cadets and said there were about 100 and the Minister said 170 or 180.  It is quite clear if one does a little arithmetic on the figures the Minister gave that the number of cadets was 134.  In a question asked him about cadets about 31st March the number was set out as 134, and presumably the number was more or less the same for the past year. If the Minister had 134 cadets there is no excuse for telling the House that <Col N="690" /> there were 180.  In the same debate the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I venture to say offhand that, in the way of armaments and warlike stores, I have purchased in two years more armaments and warlike stores than were ever purchased before my time in any given two-year period.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder will the Minister expand that?  He said last night that we are now purchasing less than ever, and he gave the reason.</P>

I know you are getting a certain amount cheaply because the goods are coming out of stock, but if you compare these figures with the amount expended on warlike stores in 1937 and 1938 you will have some interesting results.  With regard to the delivery of the stores, the position does not seem to be altogether satisfactory. In the year when the Minister took office there was provision in his Estimates to the extent of £216,000 for warlike stores.  There is every reason to believe that they could have been ordered.  The Minister himself, when he assumed office, as part of the first economies of the Government, reduced that sum by £63,641, giving him approximately £145,000 to expend.  He managed to place orders for the whole amount of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the answers given to me, there was delivered during the year only £56,000 worth of equipment. He expected in June, 1949, a further £9,000 worth of equipment which, apparently, was subsequently delivered. <Col N="691" /> Outstanding there was about £80,000 for radar equipment, which the Minister expected would arrive last February.  I understand it has not arrived, or if it has, it only arrived very recently.  He placed an order for £62,000 worth of equipment during last year, which was a good deal less than he had budgeted for.  The difficulty that I see is that he has allowed in his Estimate for 1950-51 only £94,000, while he has orders outstanding.  It looks to me, so far as the Estimate is concerned, that while he may get the radar this year, he will not get the other £62,000 worth of equipment this year.  The whole position seems to mean this, as the Minister has said, that the Government has failed completely to get any equipment for the Army, and that we have to depend on what we have got.  I presume that much of that stuff came in during the emergency and that it is still there. One can say that it is better than nothing.</P>

      <P>That is more of the parrot talk.  Everyone will admit that there are these problems of warfare and that modern warfare does make a difference, but still there are approaches possible to these difficult problems.  On the question of defence, there is much that can be done, and much of the conventional warfare remains a factor.  For instance, take the last war, as it was.  For all the development there has been, rifles and Thompson guns, pistols, bombs and mines, all played a vital part in the last war, and even arms went back to cruder forms.  Specialised artillery weapons gave way in many respects to things very much cruder.  It will be a very long time before the conventional aspect of war, as we know it, is completely submerged.</P>

      <P>I am looking for a comment from a book which I have here.  Recently in America there have been a number of scares about these horrible potentialities.  Column writers have been writing them up, and so it was felt necessary that a sober estimate should be given to the public on these matters.  I propose to give a quotation from an eminent scientist who wrote a sober book on this matter. This is one paragraph from his book:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The second world war was, far more than the first, a war of applied science.  The great campaigns that swept across the continents and the oceans drew so heavily on the accumulated stockpile of fundamental scientific knowledge that this was all but exhausted when fighting stopped.  Nearly every nook and cranny were explored in the application of theoretical scientific knowledge to the weapons of war.  Should a new war have to be fought in a decade or so, there will be innovations, but in all serious probability no such burst of new devices as accrued when organised science and engineering first turned their full effort into war, drawing without inhibition or restraint upon the great unused accumulations of the past. For a new war farther in the future, the probability of major innovations is proportionately greater.&rdquo;</P>

I quote that for this reason that one of the most dangerous forms of national sabotage in face of such a problem, is the protestation that the problem is so big that we cannot tackle it.  We might as well fold up and say that the problem of living as a nation is too big, and that it is not worth trying to live at all.  That in effect is <Col N="693" /> what Deputy Davin is saying.  I call it sabotage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Admittedly, we cannot have a big air force, but we should be able to afford a number of fighters.  The point that I want to make, by way of assistance to the Minister and not by way of criticism, is that there is a problem here.  It is difficult for him, and we can sympathise with him, particularly on the question of getting equipment.  It is an extremely difficult problem for a Minister for Defence, but nevertheless there are concrete steps which we can take and which we can hope will give us some results.  We ask that these steps be taken, particularly in the matter of strengths, organisation, civil defence, the co-ordination of industry and agriculture and in provision for improvisations.</P>
      <P>To conclude, there are a few further figures I should like to give that may be of interest to the House with regard to defence.  I have already referred to the reversal of the move into peace that took place in 1948.  How is that reflected in the defence expenditure of other countries and how does ours compare?  We are paying nearly £4,000,000 out of our £78,000,000 that we are going to spend this year.  We propose to allot in or about 5 per cent. of that to defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is happening in other countries, particularly those countries along the line that I traced last night?  The best figure probably to take for comparison is the percentage of the defence estimate as against their total Budget estimate. The military expenditure in Switzerland has been increased and that expenditure now is nearly 30 per cent.  Last year it was about onequarter and it is a little bit more this year.  That is a very high ratio. Switzerland is a small country, more industrialised than we are, but a country whose defence problems in some respects should be comparable to ours and which has succeeded, small and all as it is, in standing on its own feet so far and remaining immune. <Col N="694" /> There is the index of the expenditure which that people will bear to preserve their own freedom.  In Spain they are spending one-third of their Budget on defence&mdash;from 30 to 34 per cent.&mdash;and from newspaper information that I have of a few months back it is apparent that they are continuing it.  I refer to the Sunday newspapers of March 12th.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Strictly military. It has been increased in the subsequent year by a big amount.  As to Portugal, another small country, I have only the 1948 figure.  It was 16 per cent., very much more than we are spending.  Sweden, before the set back in 1948, before the reversal of policy and before this trend towards war again became accentuated, was spending 19 per cent., and there is reason for believing that that is being increased.  In Belgium, according to the <i>Economist</i> of 11th March, 1950, 11 per cent. of the Budget effort is being expended on defence.  According to the <i>Economist</i> of January 14th, the figure for Holland is 22 per cent.  Holland is a small country and its population is comparable to ours.  Norway, as has been remarked on many occasions, is spending a colossal amount.  The normal defence expenditure there is estimated to be about £15,000,000, with additional expenditure working out, I think, to something like £137,000,000 over a period of six years.  That is something colossal.  If anyone suggested it here or in any country of comparable size, it would formerly have been called sheer lunacy.  It has been recommended by an all-Party committee there and I am not sure it will be implemented.  I did notice in last night's papers that arms are arriving. Now, Belgium, Holland, Norway, Spain, Portugal, Sweden and Switzer land all lie in the same area where we are.  What is the position with regard to our neighbour.  If you read to-day's papers, you will see that they are spending £21,000,000 more on defence and a large amount of that is going&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A large amount of it is going on production.  A summary of it can be got in the <i>Economist</i> of March 11th, or better still in the Command White Paper called &ldquo;A Statement on Defence, 1950.&rdquo;  Incidentally, that statement in 1949 as compared with 1950 showed that the upward trend continued.  In 1948-49 the British estimate was £692,000,000.  They increased it last year to £759,000,000.  It has increased again from that to nearly £781,000,000 this year.  The effort in 1948-49 was approximately 23 per cent., or one-fourth of their total Budget effort.  That is the United Kingdom Budget, and does not include Canada and other Empire countries. They are in economic difficulties enough in England without increasing expenditure to that amount if it were not necessary.  Nevertheless, they find it necessary to increase the defence burden by £21,000,000.  We are bearing an increasingly low ratio to our total expenditure.  Here we are with a defence Budget which is merely what you would expect in a pre-war Budget if you multiply it by a factor representing the increase in the cost of living and the decrease in the value of money.  It is £4,000,000 out of £78,000,000&mdash;in or about 5 per cent., very much less even than the weakest of the countries that I have mentioned. Then we talk about our sacred duty and our determination to defend ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has acknowledged that there is only one policy for us at the moment in this matter, and that is to rely on ourselves and provide the men to garrison the defences to the extent which we can possibly do it.  It is a vitally important thing from the national point of view.  We have a sufficiently dangerous situation which we all hope we will survive, but it is sufficiently dangerous to warrant us doing something about it.  There are concrete steps which the Minister can take.  All we are doing is asking him to take those steps, and he will get every support.  He has not been criticised for anything he has done. In fact, I think he has been complimented. I give credit where credit is due for the bright sides of the picture, such as the good work being <Col N="696" /> done in certain quarters of the Army, and for the decision to get men and the facilities for the F.C.A.  Let him proceed to do it, and do more if  sible.  But, in addition to that, there are the other problems which I mentioned, and which do now urgently need attention.</P>

      <P>I lack the technical knowledge of which Deputy de Valera has just given us such a remarkable number of examples.</P>
      <P>In so far as he stated it as a general proposition that any real defence of the country is dependent upon the organisation of our people and our resources as a whole, I am in complete agreement with him.  In so far as he assents to the necessity for the pursuit and attainment of the greatest possible degree of self-sufficiency, I again find myself in complete agreement with him.  I have not risen here this evening to take part in the general discussion on this Estimate or to traverse the very wide territory which Deputy Major de Valera covered in his very lengthy but very interesting contribution to the debate.  I have a specific reason for intervening at this stage.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, speaking to this Estimate, Deputy Seán Collins made the following observation:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I want to say quite seriously that no matter how bitterly I resent the partition of Ireland, I would take the responsibility&mdash;even if we had seemingly to condone it in an Atlantic Pact&mdash;to come within the defence wall of the Atlantic.  We might then be showing more courage than standing in a deliberate isolation that might mean our ultimate annihilation.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am quoting from this morning's <i>Irish Times</i> where, rather naturally in the circumstances, Deputy Seán Collins is reported <i>in extenso.</i>  I want to go on record on my own behalf and on behalf of the members of Clann na Poblachta as dissenting from that statement in the most emphatic manner possible.  I do not <Col N="697" /> know what consideration Deputy Seán Collins gave to this matter before he made that statement.  I know that in the course of debate here it is very easy to find oneself saying something which, if one had the opportunity of first analysing it, one would discard as not representing a correct statement of one's particular point of view.  I think it is essential that that statement should not go unchallenged.  I think it is essential that it should be made clear that it does not represent the point of view of the Government, of the Opposition or of the majority of the Deputies here.  We may differ on many matters, but surely this was the one matter upon which there was unanimity.  If Deputy Seán Collins, holding the views to which he gave expression yesterday, wanted to raise this matter he should have raised it long before this and raised it on the first occasion on which the House had an opportunity of discussing the Atlantic Pact and its application to this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>It is on record.  I do not think it is necessary for me to develop the reasons why the vast majority of Deputies subscribe to the view that we cannot take any part in the Atlantic Pact or come, in Deputy Collins' own words, &ldquo;within the defence wall of the Atlantic&rdquo;.  The reason is that by becoming a signatory to that pact we would be specifically guaranteeing territorial integrity as it then stood and was then recognised by the other signatories.  In other words, and I think this is something that Deputy Collins must have overlooked, we cannot become signatories to the Atlantic Pact without by our own signature assenting to the partition of our own country.  How can it be suggested that we could enter into an alliance with Powers pledged to maintain the <i>status quo</i> while one of these Powers occupies portion of our territory <Col N="698" /> against our will?  I would suggest to Deputy Seán Collins that he should reconsider his attitude on this matter.  I think if he does he will realise that one cannot enter into a friendly alliance with an aggressor who has one hand in our pockets and another at our throats.</P>

I regret to say that in the concluding portion of the Deputy's speech, as reported, that qualification seems to have disappeared. But even if the Deputy's suggestion is only that this is a matter that should be considered, my reply to the Deputy is that this is a matter that cannot be considered; and no Party, no Government or no group should attempt to consider it or give any degree of consideration to an alliance with Britain while Britain holds our territory; and any Party, any group or any Government who would attempt to reconsider it would be repudiated and rightly repudiated by the Irish people.</P>

      <P>May I make this observation to the Deputy?  Is it not weakening our position internationally to suggest that this is a matter that can be reconsidered?  Why water down, by reverting from the position taken up by all Parties here, the one single issue on which we got unanimity and the one single issue on which Parties that differ widely and violently on other matters were able to say they had a common purpose and a unity of aim?  I intervene merely for the purpose of dealing with that particular observation made by Deputy Seán Collins yesterday.  In so far as the Atlantic Pact is concerned.  I express my own point of view when I say that even if Partition were gone to-morrow our attitude to that pact would have to be considered <i>de novo.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not subscribe to the view that <Col N="699" /> we can make a bargain about the occupation of our country.  I do not subscribe to the view that we can depart or retreat from the attitude that we demand the unconditional withdrawal of the British forces from the Six Counties of our country which they occupy.  In recent months&mdash;in fact for a period of years past&mdash;a good deal of propaganda has been directed at that group of Irishmen who have been misled into the position of becoming Britain's willing tools in the running and administration of the Six Counties. Anything that was said about them has been merited by them.  I would urge on Deputy Collins that before he makes statements such as that to which I refer he should remember that the responsibility for Partition is Britain's responsibility, that the responsibility for its continuation is Britain's responsibility and that Britain can end it in the morning by clearing out of our country bag and baggage.  Until such time as Britain does that, no Irishman can consider any alliance with the only country that is committing any act of aggression against us, the only country which has ever committed an act of aggression against us in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was struck by the Minister's statement in introducing this Estimate that he is experiencing difficulty in securing more material for our Defence Forces and that it is being supplied only in insufficient and inadequate quantities to our Army.  He said he felt that the world is divided into two armed camps and that we are being forced, whether we like it or not, into a position of neutrality.  I do not know how our nation has been driven into that position.  As Deputy Collins has just pointed out by way of interruption, the question of our relationship with the anti-Communist alliance has never been referred to this House for decision.  We have never been asked, as a deliberative Assembly, to decide what our attitude should be towards the general policy of the democratic nations of Western Europe who are co-operating together and co-operating with the United States for their own collective security.  I think <Col N="700" /> we ought to consider this matter seriously.</P>
      <P>The whole purpose of the Defence Estimate is the defence of this country. If there is no danger of attack upon the independence of our nation there is no need for a Defence Force&mdash;all we need, perhaps, is an enlarged police force to maintain internal peace, or something like that.  If we are satisfied that there is no real danger of attack, then we have no need to vote money for defence purposes.  If we decide that there is danger we must have some idea in our minds as to the source of that danger.  When the Minister says that the world is divided into two armed camps we must ask ourselves which of these camps is likely to be an aggressor in so far as this nation is concerned.  I feel that we are simply deceiving ourselves if we do not acknowledge that the whole of Western Europe is in serious danger. If I were a citizen of a town which was on fire I would co-operate with all my neighbours in trying to extinguish the fire or to prevent it from spreading, regardless of the fact that I might have some sort of quarrel, or even a very deep quarrel, with some of my neighbours.  Is it not possible for this country to co-operate with the most powerful of all the nations that stand for the protection of freedom in this work of defence?  We may have, and we have had, a long and bitter quarrel with Great Britain, but we have never had any quarrel with the United States.  Is it not possible for us, realising the inadequacy of our defence equipment, to meet the Government of the United States and ask them to co-operate with us in equipping our Defence Forces and to co-operate with us in planning for the defence of this island?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is always the lesser of two evils to be considered.  If this country and Western Europe is in serious danger of being overrun by the forces beyond the Iron Curtain, I think we should be slow on any pretext to help the forces on the other side of the Iron Curtain.  If we establish <Col N="701" /> a position whereby in the wall of the organised defence of Western Europe there is one gap and that gap is the area under our control, then it may be said in the future that we have betrayed the cause of freedom.  There is now no security that armies can be held at bay by the Atlantic ocean or by any sea barrier.</P>
      <P>There were plans in the last war for a sea-borne invasion of this country. There may be plans already in existence for a sea-borne invasion of this country also from the continent.  Surely that is one aspect of national defence which we ought to consider.  If our nation is inadequately equipped, that may be a temptation to the forces who seek to use this country as an outpost against the United States by means of a sea-borne invasion.  In addition to that, is it not clear to everyone that the next war, if war should come, will be a disaster of untold magnitude?  Is it not clear to everyone that every civilised nation should co-operate to prevent that war and that the only way effectively to prevent that war is by the democratic nations who do not want aggression being sufficiently strong to defend themselves?  Surely in order to make ourselves sufficiently strong we have got to co-operate with the nation that can equip us properly? If war were to occur and if the forces that seek to destroy and tyrannise Western Europe were to move forward, our nation would in all probability be in that war as quickly as any other, but if we neglect to secure equipment for our Army, our Army will go into that war less adequately equipped than the armies of neighbouring nations. Our soldiers, brave as they are and our officers able as they are, will find themselves at a very serious disadvantage. Therefore I say that, first of all, to help, so far as it is possible, to prevent war we should co-operate with the United States in building up the defence of Western Europe in so far as our small portion of territory is concerned. In order also to put our Army into an effective position in the event of war, we should be doubly concerned so to co-operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For these two reasons I think that Deputy Collins has served a useful purpose <Col N="702" /> in facing this question boldly and courageously, as one would expect him to do.  There is always the danger of misrepresentation, the danger of one's words being distorted and twisted, the danger of one being misrepresented as seeking, as Deputy Lehane pointed out, to condone or to emphasise the partition of this country.  No Deputy in this country has any intention of doing anything of the kind, and I think it is unnecessary to say that no one could seriously accuse Deputy Collins of having any such intention.  But there is always the danger in a problem of this kind of over-simplifying matters and, when confronted with two evils, of choosing not the lesser but the greater of these two evils.  I think the greatest evil this nation could choose would be to assist in any way, either directly or indirectly, in giving the forces at the other side of the Iron Curtain an encouragement to attack and, secondly, in putting our nation in an inadequate position to co-operate with other nations in the event of war.</P>
    <P>We all know that there would not have been a second world war if the military dictator who decided on that war had not believed that a great number of nations would remain neutral when he struck.  There will not be a third world war unless the people in the Comintern are convinced that a number of nations will fail to co-operate in striking back at them. Therefore, I think it would be a useful service to the cause of freedom and to the cause of our country, to be ready to help to co-operate with the United States in the defence of our country and the other countries of Europe because this is not a question alone of helping the cause of freedom generally; it is a question of effectively defending our own country and of utilising the money we are voting in this Estimate for the defence of our country.  We do not want the brilliant officers and men of our Army to be ill-equipped. We do not want them to be any worse equipped than the forces of any other nation.  We want them to be in a superior position so far as equipment and training are concerned. We therefore, I think, should consult <Col N="703" /> with the Government of the United States in seeing how the best equipment can be put into the hands of our Army, and how best, in present world circumstances, we may effectively fit in our Defence Forces and our plans for the defence of our island with the plans of the United States military staff.  I think if we do that, we shall be doing our small part towards preventing war in the first place, and towards our being effective in supporting the right side in such a war.  If we do that, also I think we shall be going a long way further towards the reunification of the country than by any other alternative course.</P>

I am satisfied with the present Army Estimate, and I feel that the strength of the Army is reasonable and fairly satisfactory from the taxpayer's point of view.  In this debate, many interesting points were raised and many divergent points of view expressed.  That, I feel, is all to the good because the people of the nation can only get a proper mental outlook by hearing different views expressed.  I have nothing to say against the speech made by Deputy Collins.  He has expressed the outlook of a man of vision, a man of character and a man of honour who believes in a certain thing and is not afraid to say it in the native Parliament. That was what he was elected for and I congratulate him on his courage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate centred largely around the question of Partition and what our attitude should be in the case of future war.  That, of course, is quite natural because, at present, appearances are fairly menacing all over the world.  At any moment we may be faced with a new conflagration and we do not know where it will end.  I am satisfied that we should push ahead with the training of our young men.  I believe that the F.C.A. is a force which every young man worth his salt should join.  It would give him an opportunity of mixing with the people and it is an <Col N="704" /> excellent means of killing class distinctions and class prejudice, and of building the character of our young men. I should like to see in every area some building where our young people could get a post-school education, buildings in which we could teach the rising generation to be worthy successors of the generation who went before them. In the last few years, it has become apparent that many of our young men have not that national outlook we should like them to have.  They are all out for a good time and they do not care what happens to the country if their own good times last.  At the same time, they should realise that in the past a vast amount of people in this country had a very bad time.  It is the duty of every young man of spirit to join with his fellows in the uplifting of the nation as a whole, and in the F.C.A. they can do that.</P>
    <P>We want to see far more voluntary effort amongst our people than we have seen for some years past.  I do not believe there is any need for alarmist speeches here.  In any event, if the worst comes to the worst, tough times are nothing new to us.  Our nation had tough times for 750 years, the toughest time of any country in the world.  What Poland is going through to-day Ireland went through yesterday.  We survived it, not by our military might, but because of the character of our people, because of our Christianity and the spirit our people have always shown.  In that way, we came out on top, although we had generations of suffering.  The nations behind the Iron Curtain will have their sufferings too, but there will eventually come their day of freedom, their day of sunshine, because the spirit of Christianity will live in spite of all the pagan hordes in Russia and elsewhere. They have tried to oust Christianity for hundreds of years and they have failed to do so.  Those nations that are mighty and powerful to-day will be crumbled in the dust, not in the distant future but in our lifetime.  They are the makers of their own destruction and destruction will assuredly come on their heads.</P>
    <P>Our island is a tiny atom in the broad Atlantic.  It hardly counts as far as <Col N="705" /> military strategy is concerned.  We are important because we are the nearest place to the greatest military nation in the world, the United States of America, and we can be used as a useful base.  So far as our manpower and our resources are concerned they do not count.  We ought to let people know that straight away.  We could put 30,000 or 40,000 men into the field and arm and equip them, but what would that mean in a modern war?  Not 12 hours of battle.  We have no room for manoeuvring and we would be powerless. We are the smallest nation in the world and there is no use trying to blink people that we are a mighty race.  We are a country rent asunder, split asunder by different outlooks and ideals.  We have a population of 3,500,000 and we are not in a position to talk very big about war or anything like that.  We are but an atom in a vast world.</P>
    <P>Take the last war as an example. What did we do then?  Is it not a fact that we just had to do as we were told? The great allies that were fighting German might saw to it that we put into the field all the young men we possibly could and equipped them with modern weapons.  The Americans and the British were quite satisfied we would be able to stand the first shock of battle and then, before we would be smashed completely, they would be able to take our place.  If they were not so satisfied, both the British and the American armies would land on our shores and take their stand here whether we liked it or not.</P>
    <P>Ours is an awkward situation and it needs careful consideration.  There is at the present moment a world line-up and it is a case of black against white, a case of those who follow the Cross against those who want to crush the Cross.  We want to know will we be in that line-up or not.</P>
    <P>How does the partition of our island enter into the consideration of the bigger menace with which the world is confronted?  It was on that point that Deputy Collins was more or less called to order by another Deputy.  I believe that Partition is a great handicap and it is a distinct menace to the relationship <Col N="706" /> of our country with Great Britain and America.  Every effort should be made to get the consideration of Partition brought to the highest level and every effort should be made to bring this problem to a happy conclusion at the earliest possible moment.  There should be a bigger effort made, not by shouting at each other across the Border, but by different tactics.</P>
    <P>There are people whose families have been living in the North of Ireland for generations and who desire to remain there and, whether Partition is ended or not, we will not put them out of that part of the island as Germany was put out of Poland and other countries. These Irish men and women will still remain there and in that situation we must make our choice.  If war does come there is no alternative; we must make common cause with the North. North and South must join together in Ireland's common defence whether we like it or not.  Why not face that situation?  If war does come&mdash;and I am satisfied unless the hand of God intervenes at the right time, and there is every prospect that it will before many years have passed&mdash;we have no other alternative.</P>
    <P>There are many barriers to friendly relations.  There is an artificial bigotry on both sides.  There is no use in saying that they are a bigoted set in the North.  In the South there is just as big a set of bigots.  There are people in Dublin, the big new industrialists, who would drop dead if they thought the Border would be removed.  They would get a heart attack.  There is as much bigotry on one side as on the other and much of that could be overcome by friendly contact.  I often see the Northern bigots, as they are called, coming to our fairs and markets and when you meet them you find there is nothing wrong with them.  They have their ideologies, but they are not so bad at all.</P>
    <P>In the North there are many decent men and women.  There are many Catholics in the North who do not want to come in with the South at the present moment.  They are doing well and are having a good time.  Of course, there are many people in the lower strata in the North suffering, but <Col N="707" /> many of the barriers could be removed and many things done to try to remove those barriers.  It is up to us as the inhabitants of the larger part of the island to do our utmost.  If we had a more Christian outlook on things we could make a different approach to the North.  There is no reason why we could not have contact with the North, why, at our garden functions in the President's Lodge&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They do.  There is no reason why, when we have our Army functions or our Dublin Horseshow, we could not invite these people here and why we would not expect them to invite us to the North.  If we are to act as Irishmen in a common cause in the future we must overcome our differences.  For years I have been in the I.R.A. and the Army.  I did as much fighting as anybody else and I did my suffering, too.  I carried my burden in British prisons.  I am satisfied that at the moment there is a whole lot of cod in the whole thing. The men who carried the burdens on their shoulders in difficult times are living to-day in misery in this country; they are living on a mere pittance. We forget all about them.  At the same time, the boyos who never did anything have got into the saddle and they are having a good time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>There is too much cod and the position is serious enough to compel us to see what we can do. There are so many different outlooks it is hard to come down to brass tacks. The Minister has put a reasonable Estimate before us.  We have a reasonable standing Army, but it is more or less of a peacetime character, and so it should be.  We can all see the huge amount that is being spent to run the country and we all realise what it is costing the people.  All our young men should get a proper training.  They should have a military training.  They should have a good education and have their characters properly formed so that they would have a genuine national outlook.  In that way they would be able to view the picture on both sides and not from one side.  The people in the North are looking at it from one side and we in the South are doing the same.  There is no reason why the people in North and South should not look at both sides of the picture.  That is the only way in which you will bring about happy relations in both parts of Ireland.  There is a race going on at the present time in America between Basil Brooke and some Irish people there.</P>

      <P>It does not do us any good to have that going on.  It would be far better if we had friendly contacts between the people North and South.  This speech made by Deputy Seán Collins was, in my opinion, a worthy and a manly one.  The question was, should we or should we not line up in an Atlantic war or sulk and stand idly by because of Partition.  If I believed that a war was coming I would not be a bit afraid or ashamed to take my stand in the Atlantic war, because of two evils I would choose the lesser. My doing so would not do one bit of harm to this country as far as Partition is concerned.  Whether we fought with Britain or against her in a future war, it is not going to interfere with the position of our country.  Ireland is <Col N="709" /> ours and will continue to be ours.  The question is how are we going to make it a united, peaceful and prosperous country.  We are not going to do that until we make a proper approach to that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We put down the motion to refer this Estimate back for reconsideration in order that we might have the opportunity for a broad discussion on the whole question of defence.  We have been trying for a couple of years to direct the attention of the Government to the seriousness of the situation which was developing. Until this debate, I think there was no evidence on the Government side that they regarded the situation really as serious at all.  Looking at the figures in the Estimate, the cold figures that were presented to us, that conclusion seemed to be justified, because this is an Estimate that might have been brought in at any time in which there was no threat of any kind to the country.  However, with the discussions that have taken place here now I think we are in a somewhat different atmosphere.  I think that even the Government is beginning to waken up to the seriousness of the situation, and realise that there is in front of this country a dangerous situation in which it is essential that public policy should be made clear, and that the plans for carrying out that policy should be indicated, as far as it is possible to indicate them.</P>
      <P>I am not going to refer to the Minister's speech.  I know well that if the Minister were here on this side, and if he had listened to a speech made by a Minister for Defence, say from our Party, of the kind which he made, that he would search the whole of his very extensive repertory of abuse to find appropriate epithets by which he could characterise that speech.  I am not going to do that.  I think the whole situation is much too serious to allow ourselves any satisfaction of that kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We will satisfy you later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister's repertory is very extensive.  We all know that, but I am not going to be deflected from my desire to deal mainly with this subject as it ought to be dealt with.</P>
      <P>The problem of defence for any country at the present time, whether it is a large country or a small country, is not an easy one.  The problem of defence for small countries has always been difficult.  At present the difficulty for small countries is infinitely greater than it was in the past, because modern war is of such a character that to have any hope of real success in it requires a big industrial potential.  It requires access to raw materials and so on which small countries, as a rule, have not got. Now, the position in Europe is that the small countries, on account of the threat that is facing them, have tried by entering into combinations to provide for themselves the best protection they can.  The Minister has indicated that he would like that we were in a position of that sort.  He regrets that it is not possible for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now the first thing that any country and that we here in this country must do is to be quite clear as to what the national policy is going to be.  This is the place where national policy is going to be decided.  The first thing that the Government has to do, and the first thing that the people have to do, is to be satisfied with regard to what the general policy is to be.  The Minister some time ago said that there is no question about that policy, that the policy has been stated in explicit terms by the Taoiseach, the head of the Government, who, he said, was the proper person to indicate what the policy was to be: that policy was to be a policy of non-intervention in this war; in other words, a policy of neutrality&mdash;and that that policy was bound to be the national policy so long <Col N="711" /> as our country was divided.  Is that the position?  I take it that it is.  If it is, let us accept it and make it the basis of our planning.</P>
    <P>No country wants to enter war if it can avoid it.  That is true not merely of the small countries but of the big countries, too.  Wherever you have democracy, the people of that country if they can possibly avoid it&mdash;having power over the Government and the Government being responsible to them &mdash;are going to see that their natural desire to keep out of war is given effect to.</P>
    <P>We were attacked in the last war because of our neutrality.  But it was not we alone who did not want to enter the war if we could avoid it.  The United States of America, a great country with vast resources whose Government could call upon some 150,000,000 people&mdash;a country with vast resources and a vast territory&mdash;did not rush into war at the start.  I remember that in 1916 the President of the United States of America on account of the system there being a democratic one, and of the natural desire of the people to keep out of war, was elected President in that year mainly because he said he would keep the United States out of the war.  We have no reason to be ashamed of our desire as a people to keep out of war if we can avoid getting into it.  In 1916, as I have said, the United States of America elected a President on the basis that America was to be kept out of the war. In the late war everybody knew the side on which President Roosevelt's beliefs were ranged, but when the war started and for a number of years after the United States of America did not get into it.  The United States only went into the war when they were attacked.  If there were principles involved, these principles were at stake from the beginning and did not arise in the middle of the war.</P>
    <P>We have no reason in this country to be ashamed or to hang our heads because some people blame us for standing on our rights to keep out of the war.  If big nations do that and feel that they are justified in doing it, why <Col N="712" /> should we be ashamed of it?  When big nations get into a war, they are strong enough in their own resources to be able to have an important say in how the war is to be conducted.  They know that when the war is ending they can have an important say as to the conditions in which it is going to end and the conditions they are going to have when the war is over.  The small nation has no such satisfaction.  When a small nation gets into a war it is pulled at the tail of the big powers. They decide what is to be done.  The smaller nations have got to do practically what they are told to do.  When a war is brought to a close, what happens?  Do you think the views of the small nations are taken into account?  It is the interests of the powerful nations, who will claim that it is they and their efforts which have won the war, which are taken into account.</P>
    <P>It is a very serious thing, therefore, for a small nation to enter into war. If a small nation does enter into a war and the side which it is on is defeated, that small nation has very little hope of survival&mdash;it disappears.  It is different with a big nation.  Take Germany, for instance.  Does anyone believe that Germany, in one way or another, will not ultimately be resurrected? Its power of survival is due to the fact that it consists of a large number of people bound together by national ties.  Those national ties will ultimately prevail, with the strength that is behind them.</P>
    <P>A small nation is not in that category.  A small nation, if it is on the defeated side, can be wiped out, it can be submerged.  It can be held by the conquering power against its will. Its people can even be displaced.  If you have only 3,000,000 or 4,000,000 people, they can be taken bodily and transferred to Siberia or somewhere else.  You cannot do that with 70,000,000, 80,000,000 or 90,000,000. Therefore, the position as far as a small nation is concerned is completely different from the position of a large nation.  But we must not burke the issue.  Can a small nation survive in what the Minister spoke of as isolation? That is a very difficult question <Col N="713" /> to answer.  There are undoubtedly the gravest dangers.  When examined thoroughly, notwithstanding all the dangers there are in an alliance of small nations with greater ones, it might very well come to be regarded as the safer of the two policies.  But we, in this country, with our country divided and a portion occupied, know perfectly well that we would have a more serious situation than the dangers from outside if we were to attach ourselves to one of those States. I take it that that is what the Minister means when he says that it is all very well for academic gentlemen in armchairs to talk about participation. In other words, they are not realists. Sometimes it is suggested that the only people who are realists are the people who ignore that fundamental factor.  I believe it to be true that a house divided against itself will fall and that if we can get in this country unity behind a national policy it is much more likely to be successful than any policy which has disunity in it.  There is bound to be disunity as long as our country is occupied if it is proposed to ally ourselves with the occupying power.  It is suggested that ours is a petty matter in a world adrift, or a world facing a desperate war.  It is not a petty matter to us.  Let the people who consider it a petty matter be the people to put it aside.  We do not consider it a petty matter. Although our population is only four and a third millions we are as interested and have as much stake in the survival of our nation as a big nation with 150,000,000.  We have just the same interest in the life of our nation as they have.  If our country is mutilated we have as much interest in seeing that that wrong is undone as the United States would have in retaining its territory or Great Britain in keeping its integrity.</P>
    <P>Consequently, I do believe that the only policy at the present time that can be adopted by this country with any safety&mdash;and I am not going to run away from the dangers attached to it&mdash;is the policy of neutrality.  Again I say that, if Partition is a petty matter, as some people would like to suggest, in view of world conditions, then those who <Col N="714" /> regard it as a petty matter and who have the power to end it should take action and should not expect us to do what no nation in a similar set of circumstances would do without running the risk of completely destroying itself.</P>
    <P>May I take it then that the policy of the Government is as the Minister for Defence has set out, that we have to keep separate and apart, so long at any rate, as the division of our country lasts, and that, if that were ended, then we, as a nation, completely free would take our decision like any other nation would take it?</P>
    <P>During the last war I was approached and it was suggested to me that we should enter into the war and that doing so, of course, would be helpful about the ending of Partition. I said that our people had heard that tale once before.  In 1914 there was an appeal to Irishmen to fight for small nations and they were told that if they so fought the division of this country, which was then beginning, would not take place.  They did fight.  We know what thanks they got.  We know how the principle of the freedom of small nations and large nations to determine their own way of life was interpreted. My answer, therefore, was: &ldquo;We cannot believe you&rdquo;.  We believed that if we were foolish enough to accept that invitation and if our Parliament was prepared to follow that course we would be cheated in the end. Their excuse was ready to hand&mdash;the old cry&mdash;Ulster must not be coerced. Of course, certain Ulster people could be coerced, but others could not.  I said: &ldquo;No.  I will not ask our Parliament to consider such a proposition. If you want it to be considered, there is an obvious course open to you.  You have power to influence the people who at present dissent from the unity of our country.  Let us have a united Irish Parliament and that Parliament can then discuss it&rdquo;.  That was my view then.  That is my view to-day.  If there are people who think that we are important, they will have to give our people the right first of all to feel that they are free, and the moment they are free, they can discuss that question on its merits.  The decision <Col N="715" /> must be left to them in the circumstances in which they will find themselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister says he wants to be frank with the country and that the policy of the Government, as stated by the Taoiseach, is the policy upon which plans will be made.  If that is the policy, then we can consider what plans we can make.  I do not suggest for a moment that it will be easy for us to carry out that policy.  The trouble about neutrality is that one is in danger of attack from both sides. If one joins one side one knows exactly where one is, and one knows what reserves there are to come to one's assistance in time of danger.  If one is neutral one does not know from which side the attack will come.  Each side may attack.  One side may want possession of one's territory, not for the purpose of conquering it or controlling the lives of the people, but for the purpose of using the territory to more effectively prosecute attack upon their opponents.  The other side may want to conquer one's territory in the sense of having ultimate and continuous possession of one's land and control over the lives of the people.</P>
    <P>We know that during the last war both sides had their eyes on this country.  Both sides were considering plans by means of which their occupation of this country would help themselves. Some of these plans have been revealed in documents found on the Continent.  Others are known to us.  Anyone who wants to know what the attitude of Britain was has only to read Mr. Winston Churchill's speech on the matter.  We were in the position of being a neutral country, and we were in the difficult position that we had to guard against both sides, so to speak.  My view was, and I am sure it was the view of the Army too, that we need not fear so much attack from the Continent&mdash;that it would not be ultimately successful.  If such an attack did come we would resist it as a united people in the same way in which the people of the United States were united when they were attacked by Japan.  I was perfectly certain that our people would do that. <Col N="716" /> I knew that the moment we went into action we would have assistance from those who were at war with our attackers, not for the purpose of helping us but simply because we had a common enemy and a common foe, and it would be in their own interests to put out that foe.</P>
    <P>The least of the Government's worries then during that period was the danger of attack from the Continent. Our real worry was the danger of attack by Britain, not because Britain wanted to reconquer our territory but because British statesmen, and the Prime Minister in particular, had repeatedly stressed the fact that non-possession of our territory was a serious handicap to them in the prosecution of the war.  As head of the Government and Minister for External Affairs, I tried to get from Britain a specific assurance.  They knew perfectly well that our attitude towards them was that of a friendly neutral.  I never denied that.  I did not deny it to the German representatives.  We were a friendly neutral for a variety of reasons: Britain was our neighbour, and so on.  That attitude was known to the highest civil and military authorities in Britain and I tried to get from them an assurance that there would not be an attack by them upon this country.  But I could not get that assurance.  There was always a reservation. I tried to point out that such an assurance would simplify our difficulties to a considerable extent.  I tried to get them to see that from the British point of view it would be an important safeguard for them if we could face, so to speak, in one direction. But we were never able to get into that position.</P>
    <P>I say this now because I want to point out to the House that neutrality is an extremely difficult policy to carry through effectively.  There were people before the last war who talked as if one had only to declare that one wanted to remain neutral and one's problem was immediately solved.  Some of those who talked in that fashion occupy important positions in the Government to-day.  It would be very nice, indeed, if we had only to say we wanted to keep out of a fight and that <Col N="717" /> that settled the matter&mdash;everything would be all right for us.  But that is not what neutrality means.  Neutrality means that you must put yourself in the position of defending your neutrality and denying your territory to any of the belligerents that might seek to violate it.  I hope there are not such foolish people in existence at the present time as those who talked pre-1939 as if we had only to serve notice on the nations of the world telling them that we wanted to remain neutral thereby making everything all right for us.</P>
    <P>If we want to carry out the policy the Minister has indicated as being the policy of the Government, a policy with which we agree as being the only policy in the circumstances which can carry the country through, I hope that every single individual in this nation will realise that we have a difficult road to travel and that it is only by the utmost exertions on our part we can hope to come through.  We did our best in the last war.  We came through successfully. We should all of us thank Almighty God for His merciful providence in bringing us safely through that period. I do not think we have done in this respect all we should have done. I think we should have done what the French once did, when they too survived a serious period.  We should have erected here a permanent monument of thanksgiving to Almighty God for having brought us through.  We may have to go through another period like that and &ldquo;Providence helps those who help themselves&rdquo;.  If we honestly believe that this is the only safe policy for our country&mdash;the policy of neutrality&mdash;then it is our duty to set about our task at once of trying to defend that neutrality to the best of our power. There is no use in complaining that we have not this piece of equipment and have not that.  Our duty is to make use of everything that we have got and to try as best we can to provide ourselves with the things we require to make ourselves effective.  We have not in this country a very large manpower. But, considering the size of our country, our manpower is not our weakest point and we ought at least to make up our minds that that manpower will be used to the maximum advantage. <Col N="718" /> How are we going to use that manpower?</P>
    <P>I have been quoted in a statement which I made years ago, I do not know whether I repeated it later, by the Minister as appealing for a certain policy here when I was in opposition. I cannot say how many years ago that was&mdash;it may have been 1927, 1928 or 1929.  I suggested that the policy for this country should be a small Army backed up by a strong Volunteer force. I would emphasise that a lot of things have happened since then.  That policy may be equally good to-day or it may not.  The fact is that it was put forward as the right policy at one particular period when the world situation was very different from what it is now. Conditions in the period 1927-29 were completely different from the conditions prevailing around the year 1939 and from the times in which we live at present.  However, there are certain fundamental things which do not change even in war.  I would say that it is quite possible that that is still, at the moment, the best policy for this country.  But it was then a peace-time policy.  I hope that after this debate we shall not hear again from the head of the Government that our policies are based solely on the prospects of peace.  We are not at the moment in conditions of peace and we cannot complacently act as if we were living in a world in which peace and security prevail.  I hope there will not be a war. It used to be said, whether it is true or not, that the best way to prevent war is to prepare for it.  At any rate, we have a clear duty in the circumstances of the moment to prepare as best we can, with whatever materials we have at our disposal, for possible danger and for a very real danger.</P>
    <P>I have been talking about the question of the use of our manpower.  Very well.  As I have said, for a small island, we have a fair proportion of available men of military age.  It is not by any means a number that can be despised.  It is a number that, if reasonably equipped, would, in my opinion, be the best possible force to defend this country.  Irishmen would be fighting for their hearths and homes. They would not be as people coming <Col N="719" /> in to defend this island.  They would have a regard for everything in this country and for the interests of our people.  Strangers would not have the same regard for the people who inhabit the territory over which they would be moving.  We have had an example of that on the Continent.  There is a good deal of ill-feeling there due to the fact that even though the soldiers concerned were liberators they did not have the same feeling for the country they were liberating as they would have had for their own land.  They were not immediately defending their own hearths and homes and the lives of their own people.  In their own country they would have a sensitive regard for the property of the people and the rights of the people.  Any home force will have that regard.  We have, therefore, from the point of view of the manpower of the country, a force that, if it is used, is not by any means to be despised.</P>
    <P>I think a speaker in this debate mentioned a gap in the general defence line.  There need not be any gap.  We in this country, if we are properly equipped, can defend the area at our disposal better than a force three times our size from outside.  There will be no gap from that point of view. There will be no space here for any foreign power to come in if we get the equipment that is required.  It is nonsense, therefore, to talk about our leaving a gap.  There need be no gap. Our manhood in this country are well fitted to man our territory if we have the proper equipment.  We must start with a regular permanent force, well trained, well organised, and sufficiently numerous to be capable of expansion so that on mobilisation it can control the available manhood of this country.  If we are serious in maintaining our freedom&mdash;and that is what it comes to&mdash; then we must be prepared, every one of us, to the ultimate power we have got, to try and play our part in that defence.</P>
    <P>Naturally, in a small country like ours we think of the question of obligatory training for everybody.  I know that that would not be popular in the country and that from a Government <Col N="720" /> point of view it is out of the question.  The only thing that can replace that is to go out and appeal to the manhood of this country&mdash;to appeal as we appealed during the recent emergency&mdash;to join the forces of this country, to get themselves trained so that they may be able to play the fullest part possible in the defence of their country.  The Government is not doing that.  The first thing that appeared at any time since the Government came into office was the appeal the Minister made very casually, it seemed to me, in his speech.  If he is serious about getting the young men of this country into a force so as to be available for the defence of the country he will have us full strength behind him.  There never has been any question of that.  Our complaint is that neither the Minister nor the Government seem to realise the necessity for action of this particular kind.</P>
    <P>Of course, people will say that this is panicky, and so forth.  We were said to be panicky, too, before the recent war.  Let us then have a regular force sufficient with its reserves to train our manpower and take charge of them on mobilisation.  I will be met with the question&mdash;&ldquo;How many is that?&rdquo; There is where you come to the figure of 12,500 that has been disputed so much.  That figure was arrived at on the basis of the manpower likely to be available on a volunteer basis&mdash;on a basis of appealing to our people to join the Defence Forces and not on a basis of compulsion.  It was estimated that 12,500 men would give us the necessary nucleus around which we could gather the available manpower of the country.  That is where the figure of 12,500 came in.  The officers of the Army at that time wanted it more than that.  They felt that 12,500 would not be sufficient.  You have had figures as to what the position was when the real crisis faced us in this country in 1940.  There were about 14,000 men in 1939 who could be regarded as fully trained.  From our experience we found that these 14,000 men were scarcely adequate to perform the tasks which they had to perform&mdash; that is to train, and find officers, N.C.O.s and so on for the new force <Col N="721" /> that was required, the force that enlisted after war was declared.  The figure that is here is all right perhaps in peace times.  Even though the 12,500 was regarded by us as a peace-time establishment, as being the establishment you would have if you had a sudden crisis and which would enable you to deal with the manpower you were able to collect, we are some thousands short of that figure now. There is no use in the Minister quibbling about its being 1,000 this way or 1,000 that way.  A thousand officers mean a tremendous difference, even 1,000 N.C.O.s mean a tremendous difference.</P>
    <P>I admit that it is not 1,000 officers that are in question; it is simply a question of some thousands of people, but there is no use in the Minister saying that although we were supposed to have 12,500 we made provision in the Estimates for 1948-49 for some 8,000-odd. What is the use of talking like that?  The former Minister for Defence has explained that after the war there were men leaving the Army, and that it was against our will that the strength of the Army was reduced to that level.  We did not talk like the Minister for Defence of the uselessness of men knocking sparks off the barrack square.  If the number was reduced it was reduced against our will.  It was reduced because some soldiers had been with the colours over a long period of years.  Some people got tired of the military life and said they had to go back to civilian life.  In that way, we had to pass through a period when the number was unduly reduced. Even though we decided that we had to make provision then only for 8,000 or 9,000 instead of 12,500, I say that is not the position to-day.  It is not the people who are responsible for the present position who will suffer if a crisis should come; it is the nation as a whole.  On their heads be it if they refuse to give us the necessary cadre around which we can range the manpower of the country if the danger that threatens should eventuate.  We must have a regular force that will be capable of handling our manpower as a whole should the necessity arise.  We said that a standing Army of 12,500 would be necessary for that purpose in <Col N="722" /> accordance with the regulations of the general staff at the time.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned the general staff, perhaps you would pardon me for digressing from the main subject of the debate to pay a tribute to the general staff.  I said that our thanks were due to Providence for sparing us from the horrors of war during the last conflict. Next to Providence we should thank the men of the Army, and in particular we should thank those in charge of the Army.  We should particularly thank the chief officer in the Army, whose services to this nation will never be sufficiently recognised.  He was a man who knew his work and knew our people, a man of ability and a man of great common sense.  No matter how skilful a person may be in professional or particular matters, if he fails in that quality of general common sense he can be a danger.  We had the great blessing of having at the head of the Army a man who was loyal and true to the country, a man whose common sense was of an exceptional character. He enabled us to get through a very difficult period, and in dealing with various problems that arose with various people in connection with the crisis he was able to get their confidence and to get them to realise that he was a man of his word and that he represented the Government that was also a Government of its word.</P>
    <P>We want then first of all a central cadre and next a First Line Reserve. The First Line Reserve must be of such a character that on mobilisation it is undistinguishable so far as training and ability are concerned from the central cadre.  If we had a nucleus of about 12,500, from that would flow an annual reserve, a reserve which, having had its primary training, would have its occasional refreshers, a reserve that would be just as good as the central cadre the moment the need for mobilisation had arisen.  We want that central cadre first of all.  I say to the Minister that the central force we have got at present is too small.  His first business should be to go out on a recruiting campaign.  He should never have stopped the recruiting campaign initiated by us, but there is no use in crying over spilt milk now. Let bygones be bygones.  The thing is <Col N="723" /> to go out now on a fresh campaign and we will help it.  The Government is in the happy position now of dealing with an Opposition that is not trying to make political capital by pretending that an economy can be safely effected when it cannot.  There is no economy in leaving the country defenceless. There is no economy in the case of a business firm that refuses to take the steps necessary to safeguard its property by insurance.  We have to regard expenditure on the Army as an insurance premium.  If money is being spent it should be spent first of all in ensuring the nation's safety.  We say to the Minister that if he wants to deal with this matter seriously he is dealing with an Opposition which does not want to make capital out of the situation by saying to the people: &ldquo;They are only knocking sparks off the barrack yard.&rdquo; We shall support him in all the steps necessary to get a sufficient central cadre.  Next there is a certain reserve, it is not big but it will add something at any rate to the central cadre.  It is at the present time I believe some 4,000 or 5,000.  In that way we could say that we would have, at any rate, 16,000 fairly quickly available in the case of mobilisation.</P>
    <P>In addition, we must go all out to induce the young men of this country to come into the Defence Forces.  I am perfectly certain they will.  It is true that we did not get everybody, even during the time of emergency, but we got enough to satisfy the people who might be anxious to come in here, that they would have considerable trouble if they did come in and to satisfy them also that their enemies would have the same.  The one excuse we must not give, particularly to Britain or America, is that we can put up no defence.  We must not give them the feeling that they have only just to come in and take possession of our territory at will.  Our attitude must be that we can put up a defence and that we shall defend ourselves.  We can say to them: &ldquo;If you want to make sure there is no gap in the general defence, then give us the necessary equipment.&rdquo;  We asked for that equipment in the last war, but we did not get very much.  We did get some.  I thought they were very foolish <Col N="724" /> in not giving us more.  I saw that equipment was being sent to the Far East at a time when there was a big danger of invasion of these countries from the Continent.  I thought that was stupid.  They knew perfectly well and they can know for the future that if we have weapons in this country, we will see so far as we are concerned that there is no gap left by which possession of our country can be taken.  However, if they are not going to listen to reason of that sort, what can we do?  Again I have said that we have to make the fullest use of whatever resources we have got.</P>
    <P>What resources have we got?  The Minister seems to be under the impression that we have got nothing.  Rifles are still useful.  The man with the rifle, even with atomic bombs in question, may not be able to defend you immediately against atomic bombs, but if you have a large number of the manhood of this country armed with rifles, and if they have ammunition, you will be in no helpless position.  At least we ought to see that whatever guns are there, there will be a manpower able to take hold of them.</P>
    <P>I do not ask the Minister to tell&mdash;I do not think it would be wise, perhaps, but it would be a matter for himself to say whether it is wise or not&mdash; exactly how many rifles or revolvers we have got, and how many rounds of ammunition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter how many we have got; we have got to make the best use of whatever we have got, whether it is one, 20 or 40. It is our business to try to get more if we can and, if we cannot get them, we have to realise that we have not got them and to do the best we can with what we have got.  If we have a people determined to safeguard their liberty, really determined that they will sell that liberty and their lives dearly, and if we put into their hands whatever weapons we have got, then you will be doing your duty.  I believe that whatever chance there is of getting more equipment it is by adopting that attitude you will get it and not by any other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="725" /> If there is a feeling abroad that you can be coerced by lack of equipment into doing what other people want you to do but what you think is not advisable in your own interest to do, then you are in a dangerous position.  You must make up your mind no matter what happens that you will not be coerced.  If those people want to see there is no gap, then there is a manpower here, as there was in the last war, quite ready to see there will be no gap so far as defence is concerned. If they do not want to do that, then they want to use you for their purposes and not for the general good.</P>
    <P>Let us in the meantime train our men so that they will be available to use whatever weapons may ultimately come into their hands.  The freedom of this country was not got by having magnificent equipment.  A great deal of the equipment that had to be got was got from the other fellow.  Let us make up our minds, if it is the national policy to be neutral as long as our country is divided, that we will train our manpower to use any weapons, even though they are of the small arms variety.</P>
    <P>There is a certain number of rifles available and a certain amount of ammunition available.  Let us see that every rifle and every round of ammunition is in the position in which it can be used by a man who knows how to use it effectively.  Every small arm should be availed of.  There was a time when Britain for local defence had to depend on shot guns.  There was a time when they were glad to get rifles of a pattern to which they had not been accustomed.  It was a compliment to get some of these rifles for local protection here.  If we are not going to be foolish we must not be deterred from doing our best because of the difficulties of our task.  Let us see that there will be a man to use every rifle and that he knows how to use it properly and that his training in that respect is effective.</P>
    <P>We have a certain number of machine guns.  Let us see that we can use those and the ammunition that goes with them to the best advantage.  The Minister will tell me if there is any truth in a certain rumour I have heard <Col N="726" />&mdash;I hope there is not.  He was talking about the driblets of arms he was able to get; that he was offered a regiment of 25-pounders and he took only a battery.  I do not know whether that is true or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind that is very satisfactory, because I think it would have been a terrible thing beyond belief.  It is well that these rumours should be knocked on the head the moment there is an opportunity of doing so in public.</P>
      <P>We have a certain number of field guns, but not as many as we would like. Let us see that these can be used to the best advantage.  If we do that we will be doing our duty, and by doing our duty we will be doing all we can do. Nobody can expect more of us.  As long as we do not do anything we can do, to that extent we will be culpable.</P>
      <P>I have referred to the attitude of those who are not prepared to make better equipment available.  In my opinion they are acting as foolishly as they acted in the last war, even though it turned out finally that it was all right.  They were taking unnecessary risks when they were sending arms far away and leaving the central citadel relatively unguarded, when you realise how much better it could have been guarded if we had sufficient equipment.</P>
      <P>I have dealt with the policy, and the difficulty of carrying out the policy&mdash; the policy which has been enunciated by the Taoiseach and confirmed by the Minister for Defence.  I have referred to the difficulties and the steps we ought to take if we really believe that there is a serious situation in which we should take measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have spoken about our manpower. I think it would be quite wrong not to make full use of that manpower.  We on this side are quite prepared to help the Minister and the Government in every way in trying to bring home to the young people of this island that they have a duty to enter into the <Col N="727" /> Defence Forces and get themselves trained; that we will support him in a public recruiting campaign to get the necessary Regular Army nucleus, and that we will do everything we can possibly do to see that this country is put in the best position in which we can put it to carry out that policy.  I believe when we have done the best we can do with our resources, such as they are, realising how small they are compared with the task, but realising also they are the most we have, we will have done our duty, and then we will leave the rest to God.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to this debate since some time yesterday afternoon and, at the beginning, I would be inclined to ask permission to deal with the Estimate, because it would appear to me that if I proceed to deal with the Estimate I will be both unique and exceptional among the speakers who participated.  We have had phrases juggled around with regard to a frenzy of helplessness from members of the Opposition.  I never in my experience have yet viewed a more unhelpful army of avowed helpers.  The purpose of the frenzied, laboured and vehement speeches made from the opposite benches since 5 o'clock yesterday evening was to try and discredit the Army as it is at present and to publicise whatever weakness it may have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had that particular line of country opened up by the ex-Minister for Defence and followed by a number of others.  Listening to them, it struck me that they are ample understudies and efficient understudies of <i>The Horsemen of the Apocalypse.</i>  Twice yearly we get the same exhibition of people parading one by one&mdash;Robinson Crusoe and his man, Friday&mdash;foretelling doom and disaster with nothing in front of the Irish people but appalling chaos.  I would ask the Leader of the Opposition and his cohorts is that the way to keep heart in the country in difficult times?  Is it by engaging in a policy of depression that you are going either to keep heart or courage in the people?  The whole debate was similar to previous debates.  It was maintained on a line that I cannot but <Col N="728" /> call bluntly, a line that is not honest, endeavouring to paint the picture of the present Government and Ministry as dangerously reducing Army strength.</P>
    <P>I do not know&mdash;I leave it to the choice of the leaders opposite&mdash;whether it is roguery or stupidity that deliberately misreads the Book of Estimates as left to me by my predecessor in office.  He budgeted for an Army of 9,000 odd.  Having stated what the peace establishment of the country would be he budgeted for that amount and asked the Dáil to give him so many officers, N.C.O.s and men.  That Budget is there on record, showing the numbers that the Leader of the Opposition, as Taoiseach, and his Government looked for at a time when we were considerably nearer war and in a far more dangerous position than, thank God, we appear to be in at the present moment.  When confronted with their own figures and their own considered policy, which would have been presented to the Dáil had the general election of two years ago turned out other than it did, we had a dishonestly laboured effort to say: &ldquo;Oh, but if we did not get that or if we got more men than are covered in the Book of Estimates we could always bring in a Supplementary Estimate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition was for 16 long years Taoiseach and head of the Government.  Deputy Traynor was for the best part of ten years Minister for Defence and his predecessor was subsequently Minister for Finance. We know that if there is any honesty in Government that the Estimates are presented to the Dáil, that the Budget is based on the Book of Estimates, and that the people are taxed accordingly. It is merely sheer trickery to say that the figures shown in the Book of Estimates are purely imaginary and can be departed from at will at any time. What would be said if I were to adopt the same attitude since I became Minister for Defence?  The peace establishment is there still and portrays figures similar to those presented by my predecessor. The deduction for numbers below strength is 1,000 greater under my administration than it was under that of my predecessor and I could meet the whole of the avalanche of debate by saying that &ldquo;these figures <Col N="729" /> are meaningless and I can always bring in a Supplementary Estimate,&rdquo; but I would not adopt such a line.  Those figures are not meaningless.  They are real and, be they sound or unsound, they are the considered policy of the Government and of the present Minister for Defence who will stand over what he puts in the book and will not indulge in any evasive tactics to mislead the Dáil or to misrepresent the attitude of the Government.</P>
    <P>Whether the late Minister for Defence understood that Book of Estimates or not, I do not know.  He may have completely misunderstood it because during the war years the Estimate was presented in a round figure. It was not set out in the detail that was customary before his time and from 1947 onwards.  It may have been that a quick one was slipped across him either by the Government or by the Department of Defence, and that he did not read the figures in italics in the Book of Estimates or that if he did he did not understand them.  I leave the choice to him.</P>
    <P>The fact is that after listening to all these speeches since 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon portraying the helpless and vulnerable position in which the country is being left by the figure that I am estimating for, the net result of the whole thing it that I am estimating for something like 1,000 less than was estimated for in the Book of Estimates and in the headline that was set to me. Not only that but we had, in 1947, in explanation of the Estimate presented, Deputy Traynor as Minister for Defence in his speech on the Estimate pointing out that the peace establishment was in the neighbourhood of 12,500, but that all the troops he was looking for were considerably less than that.  Now, since positions have changed, we have an attempt, which I regard as a despicable one, to repudiate not only the book as printed and, presumably, considered, but the speeches made on the earlier Estimates introduced on this framework.  What is the explanation of that?  Is all this thing pure stupidity or is it pure vindictiveness and maliciousness?  It is an attempt merely to wound those who are politically opposed to them, regardless of the fact that, in wounding their <Col N="730" /> political opponents, they are at the same time in danger, to a very great extent, of wounding the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>In my opening speech, I approached this question of defence in an endeavour to see the greatest degree to which we could find agreement and I was met by one speaker after the other clearly endeavouring to ascertain the maximum extent to which we could find disagreement.  Let it be so.  For very many years we have experienced and withstood this kind of tactics.  We had the Leader of the Opposition this evening referring to my facility for attacking a political opponent.  I wish to goodness that gift was better developed in me then I could, with some little hope of success, compete with those about me.  But, in my inexperience in that direction, I do at least say outright what I have to say and I avoid as much as possible the oblique wound in regard to which the Leader of the Opposition is a master technician. A straight blow is a fair blow; an oblique approach is not quite so fair; but I cannot even claim to be a master technician in either one or the other.</P>
    <P>I referred to the proposal made by the Leader of the Opposition with regard to the type of force, regular, volunteer and territorial, which he in his considered judgment thought was the most suitable for application to this country.  The proposal was not put forward in the course of an ordinary speech.  It was not an impromptu proposal, but a proposal put forward by way of reasoned amendment to the Defence Forces Bill and supported by all his Party.  At that time the charge against the Government was that the Army was too large and too costly.</P>

      <P>The point is easily made, that the Government thought that after the war there was a disposition to get out of the forces.  It was difficult to recruit and a peace-time complement of 12,500 was not available for the year and there was no use putting in a number for the year and looking for money for them when you were not able to get them.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether to believe Deputy de Valera orally or the Deputy in print.  That is another question which I must leave between the Deputy and his conscience. My attitude is that I introduced an Estimate for an Army strength some 1,000 less than was introduced by my predecessor.  It does not matter what the reasons for that were. I am giving just the fact that I looked for 1,000 less than my predecessor and the charge levelled against me was that I was bringing ruin and disaster on the country.  That was not levelled at my predecessor by his Leader or by any one of his colleagues at the time.  I referred to the fact in my opening statement that we are dealing with combinations of millions and that it is just silly and childish to be discussing <Col N="733" /> here the difference between 8,000 and 9,000 or 9,000 and 10,000.</P>

      <P>I listened to the ex-Minister for Defence when he was speaking and, if I ever heard a speech which was devoted to anything but defence, it was that particular speech. That was followed by a three hours' speech by Deputy de Valera, Junior&mdash; a lecture on strategy, defence and geography delivered on the assumption that inside the General Staff there was nobody to give advice with regard to defence.  There are people there and there are people in the Dáil who cut their milk teeth chewing on the kind of question that the Deputy put before us this evening as, apparently, a revelation or new discovery.  Away back from the beginning of wars it was well known that armies and populations had to be fed.  Yet we were told that we had to attend to the food supply of the nation, the transport of troops and of the population and all these things well known to children in their earliest classes in school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to bring this Dáil down to a sense of reality.  There are two things to be considered, perhaps three, when we are dealing with Army strength or rather the strength of our Defence Forces, because I do believe that the main strength of the Defence Forces in a country such as ours with a tiny population must be found by training men outside barracks and not by immobilising the men in barracks.  If the same effort is put into that as is required to train them inside the barracks, then we would have far more men to carry the rifles and the small arms to which the Leader of the Opposition has referred.  If I placed any stress on heavy guns and armaments, I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that I did not place nearly as much stress on heavy guns and armaments as did the Deputy sitting behind him during the course of this debate; pencil and paper were worked with to red heat in entering into mathematical calculations in an effort to reckon, allowing for the decrease in the value of money and the possibly enhanced value of goods, what <Col N="734" /> the relative purchases were three years before the last war, three years since the last war and during the two and a half years of our administration.  All that argument was based on the necessity for the heavier type of armament. Then the debate finishes up with the Leader of the Opposition telling us to forget about that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say forget about it.  I said we can only use what we have got and make the best use of it, and get more and get heavier and better stuff if we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are the truest words the Deputy has ever spoken.  We can only use what we have.  That is true.  My job is to try to make the &ldquo;have&rdquo; greater and to put more into the hands of our soldiers.  If I had not been so frank I might not have pointed out so clearly what the difficulties are in putting more into the hands of our soldiers.  Judging by the speech made by the Leader of the Opposition last February there would appear to be no difficulties in the way. He asked then why we were not amassing arms and armaments against the day when the next emergency would burst upon us.  I thought it was due to him and to the position he holds to give him quite clearly and candidly the reasons why we could not amass any very considerable stores.  Other speakers then by way of criticism reckoned up the amount of money spent on such armaments in previous years as compared with the amount spent in recent years.  But that was an altogether unreal and untrue picture of the situation.  When buying arms on the eve of the last war and even in the last year of the last war one was buying at sky-high prices.  When the war was over stores were brought back. Material in armouries and dumps accumulated, as happens after every war.  Surplus stores were sold freely for a period and we got materials during that time at 25 to 30 per cent. less than the price previously prevailing. Therefore, that sum of money would represent in cost three to four times as much taking one year against another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time came then when that passed from the War Office to the Department of Supplies with the organisation and <Col N="735" /> implementation of the Atlantic Pact. One was provided with a list of the countries in that pact in order of priority.  I explained all that when opening the debate.  Since that time we have found it extremely difficult to get supplies.  We are getting driblets. We are continuing to try in all directions to get supplies.  We shall go on trying.</P>
    <P>Finally, with regard to armaments and war-like stores, when we can get supplies money will not stop us purchasing the amount we require.  Why I should be attacked and criticised because of that particular attitude I do not know.  I made the statement.  I repeat the statement.  The Leader of the <Col N="736" /> Opposition was quite carried away on the subject of what our position would be.  In previous debates on the Army his dissatisfaction was that he did not get a clear statement with regard to our attitude in the event of war, in relation to existing mighty world alliances and combinations.  In this particular debate he got the answer to both his queries as bluntly as I could give them.  It appears to me that the more fully and the more freely questions of that kind are answered and the more compatible the answers are with the previously stated views of the Opposition, so much the more virulent and violent and frenzied is the criticism of the Opposition.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £579,550 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st day of March, 1951, for Wound and Disability Pensions, Further Pensions and Married Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 26 of 1923, No. 12 of 1927, No. 24 of 1932, No. 15 of 1937, No. 2 of 1941, No. 14 of 1943, No. 3 of 1946, and Nos. 19 and 28 of 1949); Military Service Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 48 of 1924, No. 26 of 1932, No. 43 of 1934, No. 33 of 1938, No. 5 of 1944, Nos. 11 and 34 of 1945, and Nos. 7 and 29 of 1949); Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 37 of 1936, and No. 9 of 1948); Payments in respect of Compensation for Members of the Local Defence Force (No. 19 of 1946 and No. 15 of 1949); and for sundry Contributions and Expenses in respect thereof, etc.</P>
      <P>The total of £869,320 for the Army Pensions Vote is roughly made up as follows:&mdash;Cost of pensions, allowances and gratuities, £848,336; cost of administration, £8,820; cost of incidentals, £12,164; total, £869,320.</P>
      <P>The pensions, allowances and gratuities comprise 18,377 awards already made during the past 27 years, amounting to £823,477 and about 1,486 new awards which it is expected will be made before 31st March, 1951, and which are estimated to cost about £64,976.  Twelve months hence, therefore, there is expected to be about 19,863 awards at a gross cost of £888,453.  If, however, allowances be made for the cessation of certain pensions through death, etc. at £10,696 and for abatements at £29,421, the net cost will be £848,336.  Included in this amount is a sum of £9,574 for gratuities and £3,360 for arrears, so that the recurring charge on the Exchequer will be, approximately, £835,402 a year.</P>
      <P>Incidental expenses at £8,820 include £500 for surgical and medical appliances, £1,250 for the treatment in St. Bricin's hospital of temporary pensioners; £5,000 for the expenses of applicants for pensions and special allowances attending before the Army Pensions Board, and the expenses of witnesses called before the Referee in connection with military service pensions, and £2,070 for various odds and ends but especially for the fees of local pensions medical officers to expedite the work of determining claims for pensions and allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Administration expenses at £12,164 refer exclusively to the salaries and allowances of the two statutory bodies, the Army Pensions Board for the Army Pensions Acts and the Referee and <Col N="739" /> advisory committee, for the Military Service Pensions Acts.  As regards the latter it will take some time to sift the chaff from the grain, and to determine what petitions merit a hearing.  The estimate, however, for military service pensions provides for about 400 awards during the year. That figure does not in any way limit the Referee in his determinations.  It is simply a reasonable guess by the departmental officials on the scanty evidence available to them at the present moment.</P>
    <P>The Army Pensions Board dealt with 938 claims during the 12 months ended 28th February, 1950.  That figure includes 35 appeals and 277 revisions.  Of the claims examined, 322 failed and 616 succeeded, but, as regards special allowances, there were 261 favourable and 245 unfavourable reports.</P>
    <P>Finally, though there is an increase of £20,750 over the corresponding Estimate last year, it must be remembered that pensions were increased during the past year and the total of the increase was about £34,500 a year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few queries I should like to put to the Minister for the purpose of securing some information.  There is nothing special I want to say in respect to the Estimate proper but I should like the Minister to tell us if the Referee and his Advisory Board are meeting at present for the purpose of hearing claims.  There seems to be a doubt as to whether they are or not.  Several queries in that respect have been put to me.  It appears that cases are not being called and the individuals concerned are wondering if the Referee and the Advisory Board are, in fact, meeting and adjudicating on the cases in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point about which I have been asked to secure information, namely, in respect of a number of individuals who would be entitled to apply for pensions and who were resident in the U.S.A.  For one reason or another&mdash;I do not know that they had any particular reason&mdash;they do not appear to have ever applied for pensions. Now they have apparently wakened up and they are anxious to <Col N="740" /> be permitted to apply.  Some have signified their intention to apply and have stated that there are other individuals in the U.S.A. who would be entitled, in their opinion, to secure pensions.  They were anxious to know if there was any means by which these people could be notified.  I do not know if the Department take any special measures beyond the measures which they take to advise applicants at home both by advertisement and by statements over the radio.  I do not know if individuals of this type in the U.S.A. can be contacted.</P>
    <P>The Minister will remember that I raised the question of special allowance applicants on quite a number of occasions.  These people are granted this special allowance by reason of the fact that they are incapacitated.  They are incapable of earning a livelihood. Their incapcity may be due to age, to mental deficiency or to the fact that they are unable to work for some other reason.  I do not want to reiterate what I said on past occasions as to the difficulty confronting these individuals when the means test is applied to them.  In one particular case, a certain individual was receiving 30/- per week&mdash;£78 per year&mdash;and the fact that his sister went out working and endeavoured to contribute to his support was taken as means and the unfortunate individual, who was bedridden, had the sum reduced to 7/-.  I said on a former occasion that when we were instituting this special allowance for individuals of that type, we never visualised that the fact that a sister or brother or some other relative helped to keep that individual, would be taken into consideration in applying the means test to that particular type of case and that something like 20/- or 25/- would be deducted from his allowance.  The Minister will remember that he undertook more than a year ago, when the question was first raised, to have the matter examined, and on a later occasion he informed me that it was being examined.  I again ask the Minister to look into the matter to see if anything can be done. I raised that matter before I went out of office and I believe the then Government would have given sympathetic consideration to the case I was making. <Col N="741" /> Perhaps, if that matter was looked up, it might help the present Minister to do what I was hoping to do.</P>
    <P>There is then the question of the forfeiture of pensions.  The Minister brought in a Bill which gave him power to re-examine these cases.  I think, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, pensions that had been forfeited for some very simple reasons could be restored either in whole or in part.  On that occasion I gave a number of examples.  I gave one particular case which the Minister admitted was a very hard case.  Other Deputies cited other cases but, generally, the Minister was bound by the Act, and if a particular judge trying a case sentenced a man to a certain period of imprisonment, the Minister had no power and the pension was automatically forfeited.  I would be glad to know from the Minister if the new machinery has been availed of to any extent and, if so, how many of these forfeited pensions have been restored either in whole or in part.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot find any provision in the Estimates for pensions under the 1949 Act.  There is certainly nothing in the same position as the pensions provided for under the 1924 and the 1934 Acts.  I would like to hear if that is correct and, if so, why is that the position.  Does the Minister not anticipate that any pensions will be paid under that Act this year?</P>
      <P>Has the Minister considered increasing I.R.A. pensions on the same basis as that on which other classes of pensions have been increased?  Surely, there is a case for that just as in the case of other pensions?  In some cases there is, perhaps, even a better case. There are people getting a special allowance and the conditions in which they live and the meagre amount they get call out for serious attention.  They certainly deserve an increase just as other pensioners, in view of the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion the means test in the Special Allowance Act of 1946 is altogether too severe. Both the means test and the medical test are somewhat severe and it would be well if social welfare officers who, up to now, have been implementing <Col N="742" /> that Act, would realise that they are not dealing with mercenary soldiers but with men who, during the best years of their lives, gave good service to this country.  They were able to see the army of the enemy who occupied this country for over 700 years leave&mdash; and that was done as a result of their efforts.  The amount given to most of these people is altogether too small. Every day in the week there is a complication arising with regard to old age pensioners and Old I.R.A. men in receipt of special allowances.  When they get the old age pension the special allowance ceases and if they get the special allowance the old age pension ceases.  It would be well if the Minister clarified that position, if necessary by legislation.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to know how the 1949 Act will be implemented.  What machinery will be set up?  I ask the Minister particularly not to bring persons up from the country a distance of perhaps 100 miles at their own expense. They may have to remain in Dublin a day or two and that may be a hardship to them because they are men in advanced years, men in the autumn if not the winter of their lives.  There should be some sort of local court set up.  I do not care whether it is of the brigade or divisional type.  It is scarcely fair to bring men a distance of 100 or 150 miles to Dublin.  It will mean that unless local machinery is set up most, if not all, of those who have claims will have crossed the Jordan long before the Army Pensions Board, if one board is to deal with it, can possibly reach their applications.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Colley's appeal for an increase in pensions, there are definitely many Old I.R.A. men depending on these pensions and I would be quite happy to see new legislation, if necessary with the means test, introduced to increase military service pensions.  I hope the Minister will treat sympathetically those people who have given the best years of their lives in voluntary service.  Now, when the admission of want is there, I hope this appeal will not have fallen on deaf ears.</P>

      <P>The Minister knows exactly what is in my mind.  I rise to ask him again if he can do anything for <Col N="743" /> the ex-soldiers who are in married quarters in Dublin barracks.  I understand there are 56 of them.  They gave good service to the State and at the end of their service, when pensions were awarded them, they could not find housing accommodation and their pensions have been stopped from that day to this.  Some of them are owed pensions for three years.  I hope the Minister will make some kind of approach to the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance in order to give the usual grant for the building of houses so as to enable the corporation to deal with these cases.  It was only yesterday or to-day that the Minister for Local Government said that the ex-soldiers in married quarters whose pensions are stopped are not on the priority list.  I hope the Minister for Defence will appeal to the Local Government Department and the Finance Department, and also the corporation, so that something will be done to enable those men to draw their pensions.</P>

The board was appointed some two months ago and the members have been occupied up to the moment drafting regulations and application forms and generally deciding on administrative procedure. I have at the moment in preparation an advertisement which I expect will be published throughout the country within the next week or ten days, which will call attention to the procedure to be adopted in making applications, etc.  I imagine that the work of interviewing applicants will begin almost immediately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  With regard to cases abroad, in the United States of America, principally, and in some other countries such as Australia, any reasonable steps which we can take to publicise the new Bill in such countries we will take them.  The Deputy knows that a considerable number of applications <Col N="744" /> from abroad came in too late for the previous Acts.  We intend to notify those people at the last address that we have on record and so bring the matter to their attention.  There are a number of people in touch with the Department who know of cases in America.  We have told them to get in touch with those persons abroad. When the application forms come in they will be dealt with.</P>
      <P>The third query was with regard to forfeited pensions.  A number of forfeited pensions were restored under a recent Act.  I have not with me particulars as to the actual number restored.  I believe that all who applied under the Act have had their pensions restored, with the exception of a group of a dozen.  There are a number who have not yet applied.  People here and there may know of such cases.  If the people concerned apply they will get an opportunity at all events of getting their pensions restored.  As regards the bulk of the cases that have come in, the pensions have been restored.  The cases that have been held up are mainly cases of serious crime where it has not been decided whether the pensions will be restored or not.  The number of such cases would be in or about one dozen.</P>
      <P>With regard to allowances under the special allowances scheme, as I am sure the Deputy is aware, it is not a case of a pension of any given amount to any person.  The conditions necessary to qualify are uniform, namely, that the persons must be totally unfit by reason of health to earn a livelihood and must be totally unfit to earn a livelihood to a permanent degree.  A person totally unfit to earn a livelihood through a disease that might be curable in one month or in six months would not qualify for the allowance. The person must be totally unfit to earn a livelihood to a permanent degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second condition is that their means are such as to entitle them to an allowance.  The amount given is not a fixed sum in each case.  It is the sum that is sufficient to bring the income of that person, if the person is single, up to, I think, £80.  If two people qualify on health grounds, and if one has an income of £60 a year, <Col N="745" /> that person can only get £20 to bring his total income to £80.  If the other person has no income he can get £80 to bring him up to the same figure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. MacBride)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil approves of the Convention on the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organisation signed at Geneva on the 6th March, 1948, a copy of which was laid on the Table of the Dáil on the 3rd March, 1949.</P>
      <P>The Convention on the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organisation was drawn up by a conference held in Geneva from the 19th February to the 6th March, 1948.  The conference was called by the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations for the purpose of creating a permanent intergovernmental organisation to deal with technical questions in fields of shipping. All members of the United Nations and a number of other countries, including Ireland, Portugal and Switzerland, received invitations to the conference.  Thirty-six countries accepted the invitation and were represented by delegates or observers. Ireland was among the countries represented by a delegation.  The convention was adopted on the 6th March, 1948, and signed by the representatives of 20 countries, including Ireland.  Signature was given in each case subject to acceptance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The convention has not yet entered into force.  Article 60 provides that it shall do so when 21 States, including seven States each with a total shipping tonnage of 1,000,000 gross tons or more, have become parties to it.  A State may become party to the convention by signature without reservation as to acceptance, or by acceptance where such State has either not signed the convention or signed it subject to acceptance.  Acceptance of the convention by a State not invited to the conference is, however, conditional on its application for membership of the organisation set up by the convention being approved by two-thirds of the members.  A member may withdraw from the organisation on 12 months' <Col N="747" /> prior notice at any time after the convention has been in force for one year.</P>
    <P>Article 52 provides that amendments to the convention may be made by a two-thirds majority vote of the assembly of the organisation, such majority to include a majority of the members represented on the council. A member which does not accept an amendment is not bound by it but may in that case, in the event of the assembly so desiring, cease to be a party to the convention within 12 months after the amendment has entered into force.</P>
    <P>The purposes of the organisation established by the convention are set out in Article 1.  They are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  To provide machinery for cooperation among Governments in technical matters affecting international shipping.</P>
    <P>(2)  To encourage the adoption of the highest practical standard in the matter of maritime safety and efficiency of navigation.</P>
    <P>(3)  To encourage the removal of discriminatory action and unnecessary restrictions by Governments in international shipping.</P>
    <P>(4)  To provide for consideration of matters concerning unfair restrictive practices by shipping concerns.</P>
    <P>(5)  To provide for the consideration of matters concerning shipping referred to the organisation by any United Nations organ or specialised agency.</P>
    <P>(6)  To provide for the exchange of information on shipping matters amongst Governments.</P>
    <P>It is to be noted that Article 1 (b) lays down that &ldquo;assistance and encouragement given by a Government for the development of its national shipping and for purposes of security does not in itself constitute discrimination, provided such assistance and encouragement is not based on measures designed to restrict the freedom of shipping of all flags to take part in international trade&rdquo;.  It is to be noted, on the other hand, that Article 4 <Col N="748" /> provides that before the organisation shall consider a question involving unfair restrictive practices by shipping concerns an effort shall be made to settle the point through the normal processes of international shipping business, and direct negotiations on the subject shall take place between the members concerned.</P>
    <P>The organisation established by the convention is composed of four main bodies, viz., the assembly, the council, the secretariat and a maritime safety committee.  The assembly consists of all members and is to hold regular sessions once every two years.  The council is to consist of 16 members appointed for a period of two years, of which six are to be Governments of the countries with the largest interest in providing international shipping services, another six the Governments of countries with the largest interest in international seaborne trade; two are to be elected by the assembly from among the countries having a substantial interest in providing international shipping services, and the remaining two are to be elected by the assembly from among the countries having a substantial interest in seaborne trade. The countries comprised in these different categories are to be defined by the council.</P>
    <P>The first council, however, is to consist of 12 members designated by the conference for the purpose and of four members to be elected by the assembly from panels nominated by those 12. The secretariat shall consist of a secretary general appointed by the council with the approval of the assembly and of staff appointed by the secretary general in accordance with the conditions laid down by the council.  The maritime safety committee shall consist of 14 members elected by the assembly for a period of four years. Not less than eight of its members shall be the largest ship-owning nations and the remainder shall be elected so as to ensure active representation of countries with an important interest in maritime safety.</P>
    <P>The assembly is the sovereign body of the organisation.  The council will conduct the business of the organisation between sessions of the assembly. The maritime safety committee will be <Col N="749" /> concerned with all matters relating to the safety of life at sea, including aids to navigation, construction and equipment of vessels, rules for the prevention of collisions, salvage and rescue, etc.  Each member of the organisation shall have one vote.  Provision is made for associate membership on the part of territories not responsible for the conduct of their international relations.</P>
    <P>The organisation, like all specialised bodies of a similar category, such as the International Labour Organisation, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, the World Health Organisation, is to be brought into relationship with the United Nations by means of a special agreement.  It is to enjoy the legal capacity, privileges and immunities normally accorded to such specialised organisations.</P>
    <P>The conference at which the convention was drawn up decided to establish a preparatory committee pending the entry into force of the convention. The preparatory committee was to perform a number of functions, including the convocation of the first session of the assembly within three months of the entry into force of the convention, the preparation of a scale of contributions by members to the expenses of the organisation and the conduct of negotiations with the United Nations for the preparation of an agreement to bring the Maritime Organisation into relationship with the United Nations.  This committee consists of the 12 States which have been appointed to the council for the first period, as set out in an appendix to the convention printed in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>The convention has not yet been accepted by any country and is not, therefore, in force.  The preparatory committee has also not completed the work entrusted to it.  It is not, therefore, possible to indicate at this stage the amount of our contribution to the organisation.  It is probable, however, that it will be relatively small.  The point was stressed at the conference that the expenses of the organisation should be kept as low as possible.  It is likely, on the other hand, that the proposed scale of contributions will be based on the tonnage owned by each <Col N="750" /> of the members.  As our total tonnage is small our share of the expenses of the organisation would be accordingly small.</P>
    <P>The main reason why it was decided to establish the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organisation was that there was a general feeling among shipping countries that it would be advisable to provide for the international regulation of such an important economic activity as shipping.  As Deputies are aware, the need for international regulation in various fields has been increasingly felt in recent years.  Although it has developed rapidly during the last 20 years or so, this tendencey is, of course, not new. The International Postal Union, established in the last century, is a good instance of the application of the principle.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have seen the establishment of an international organisation to deal with civil aviation and the preparation of a charter for the establishment of an international trade organisation.  Although there have, of course, been international instruments dealing with various aspects of shipping and navigation (in particular for the safety of life at sea) there has not hitherto been any instrument providing for the international regulation of shipping generally.  The present convention is an attempt to fill this gap.  While the functions of the organisation are advisory and consultative, it will, nevertheless, provide a forum in which to discuss questions relating to shipping practices and standards.  It should, therefore, play a useful role not only from the point of view of the maintenance of fair and non-discriminatory practices in the business of shipping but also from the point of view of ensuring reasonable standards for the men engaged in operating ships.  The functions of the organisation in the matter of eliminating discriminatory action and restrictions by Governments in international shipping are of considerable importance.  The rôle of the organisation in relation to the elimination of discriminatory practices on the part of shipping companies is limited in a certain degree.  It is to be hoped, however, that its powers may suffice to redress <Col N="751" /> the more glaring injustices in this field such as the efforts of the so-called &ldquo;shipping conferences&rdquo; to exclude young fleets from certain areas of sea traffic.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a double interest in an organisation dealing with international shipping.  As an island we are directly dependent on shipping for our exports and imports.  We have, therefore, a definite interest in seeing that facilities for transport by sea are available in reasonable conditions.  We have also for some time past been developing an independent merchant fleet.  If this development is to thrive we must have safeguards against discriminatory shipping practices on the part of both Governments and shipping companies.  Membership of the organisation should help us to attain both these ends.  I, therefore, hope that the Dáil will approve acceptance on behalf of Ireland of the convention establishing the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 35, to delete the word &ldquo;value&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;price&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I think it would be wise if we introduced some sense of reality into State transactions in land.  I find it difficult to see exactly what the Minister's opinions are in regard to land acquisition and the price to be paid for land. In Volume 118, column 897 of Dáil Debates of 19th November, 1948, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Indeed only a very small number of cases of serious dissatisfaction with prices fixed by the Land Commission has arisen during the entire period since 1923.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then in Volume 119, column 896 of Dáil Debates of 28th February, 1950, having said there has been no serious dissatisfaction with price, the Minister says that he &ldquo;does not want the system of robbery or confiscation that <Col N="752" /> has obtained up to the present time.&rdquo; I find it difficult to relate the two statements. At column 902 on the same date, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I wonder will the Leader of the Opposition or the Deputies on the other side of the House stand over some of the open robbery that was carried on&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>despite the fact that just previously he had said there was no serious dissatisfaction with the price.  Again in Volume 119 at column 907, the Minister says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Deputy knows quite well that the method of paying for acquired land was a scandal to a civilised country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would like to get some idea of what the Minister's exact opinions are in relation to the price of land.  Are we to take it as his expressed view that there has been no serious dissatisfaction with the price of land since 1923?  Are we to take it that there has been open confiscation and robbery?  One cannot combine the two.</P>
    <P>In relation to land, injustice begets injustice.  Because the land of Ireland was confiscated many of our own people held the view that the only possible way of undoing that confiscation by a foreigner was a further confiscation by our own people.  It is only with the inevitability of gradualness that the Irish people have been weaned from that point of view.  The Minister has now decided to pay market value.  He has various mental reservations as to what market value should mean.  He refuses to recognise market price as market value.  Market price may not really be the intrinsic value of land, but it is the nearest way in which one can get to a conception of what the market value of land is.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the Minister's proposal makes no change in what was the accepted custom under the 1923 Act.  Then the term applied to land values was &ldquo;fair to the Land Commission and fair to the owner.&rdquo;  Because the Minister refuses to define what exactly he means the position he is now creating is no better than the position that existed under the 1923 Act.  In my opinion he is, of course, leaving the <Col N="753" /> matter exactly as it has stood up to the present so far as definitions are concerned.  It is clear that he has in mind an idea of being more generous in the efforts he proposed to make; but since he has not defined in any particular way the price he proposes to give I can see no real change from the existing position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman in Volume 118, column 1222 of Dáil Debates of 23rd November, 1949, said that the Minister had courageously decided that in justice the community will in future pay the true market value for the property. I have a good deal of sympathy with the Minister.  I take it the Minister is desirous of avoiding a definition because he is a party to the making of a bargain and he declines to show his hand.  Now I am reasonable. I am sympathetic with the Minister's viewpoint and with what he desires to secure, but on one particular point it is wholly desirable that the Minister should be specific.  If the Land Commission goes out in the ordinary way of its transactions in land, a bargain has to be struck somewhere and perhaps it would be asking too much of the Minister to define in these cases what exactly he means by &ldquo;market value.&rdquo;  But, in relation to the purchase of land in the open market, he must be specific and he must define his intention.</P>
    <P>When a man puts up his land for public sale and when the Minister intervenes or proposes to take part, personally or through an agent, in the purchase of that land at a public auction or a public sale, the only true definition of &ldquo;market value&rdquo; is the price at which that land would sell if the Minister did not intervene.  I will give the Minister all the leeway possible and necessary, knowing his difficulty in regard to the general transactions of the Land Commission, believing that certain injustices have been done and that he wishes for a freer hand in the payment of the price. Maybe there is reason in being indefinite in these particular cases but certainly, in regard to the price of land offered for public auction and purchased by the Minister, there is not a reason in the world why he should not <Col N="754" /> define in the Bill his purpose of paying &ldquo;market price&rdquo; for that land.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fagan, a Government Deputy, mentioned a particular case&mdash;the Minister will find a reference to it in the Dáil Debates.  If there is any truth in the statement made by Deputy Fagan it would appear that a very grave injustice was done to a particular land owner and a particular family who were well off before the intervention of the Land Commission and have now been reduced to poverty.  While I cannot relate the Minister's statement that there was no serious dissatisfaction with his statement that there was robbery and confiscation, I know that there are difficulties in relation to land acquisition that a single rule that must be operated must somehow now and again operate to the detriment of somebody.  Apparently, in this case which was raised by Deputy Fagan, a grave injury was done to a particular family.  If there are a few such outstanding cases where the price that should have been paid was not paid, where people had been reduced from affluence to poverty by the Land Commission, everybody on this side of the House will be glad to co-operate with the Minister in bringing in a Bill or a section of a Bill or in taking any action that may seem open to him for the remedy of these difficulties and injustices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>My main objection to this section as it stands and my main support for the amendment now before the House is that I object to the House's writing into legislation an expression, the meaning of which neither the House nor anybody outside the House understands.  The expression is &ldquo;market value&rdquo; as it appears in the section and the Minister has told us on the Committee Stage of this Bill that he would not define it, that he just put it there in this particular section and that he would let it be interpreted however it may be interpreted outside this House.  It is the first time in my experience in this House where the House deliberately let an expression go in a Bill that nobody understood what was meant by it.  We should be particularly suspicious of this expression being left in the air in view of <Col N="755" /> some of the provisions in this Bill and in view of the fact that the Minister has taken power under Section 3 of the Bill whereby the Minister for Finance may make regulations&mdash;and whatever regulations the Minister for Finance may make may completely upset whatever the Minister has in his mind as far as market value is concerned.  It is interesting also to note that no provision is made to lay these regulations on the Table of this House.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance may make rules and regulations in connection with land purchase finance under this Bill and under previous legislation.  If the Minister for Finance, whatever the Minister for Lands may think or whatever intention the Minister for Lands may have in connection with market value, makes regulations to deal with market value in a specific way that would suit the Department of Finance, neither the Land Commission nor the Minister for Lands, under this Bill, would be empowered to question these regulations.  These regulations will be statutory regulations and they will have statutory effect.  They will be able to override any principle laid down in this Bill.  We are, therefore, under Section 5 of this Bill letting this expression through&mdash;an expression that may be watered down by regulations made by the Department of Finance at any particular time in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Statutory regulations made under a particular Bill can override and it has been so decided that they have overridden even Acts of Parliament and previous Acts of Parliament. Actually you have regulations and statutory rules made which specifically repeal Acts of Parliament. If the Minister wants any instances of that, I can quote them to him <i>ad libitum.</i>  The Minister has only just to give one reference to the matter.  His advisers will tell him that the recent District Court rules override several Acts of Parliament and they are expressed to repeal Acts of Parliament <Col N="756" /> and to repeal Courts of Justice Acts wherever these rules are in conflict with the Acts.  The Minister is taking these powers under this Bill.  He is leaving the expression &ldquo;market value&rdquo; in the air.  Whatever may be decided at a future date, whenever these regulations are made by the Minister for Finance, may completely upset the ideas that have been held in this House as to what may happen under this section.  In addition, the expression &ldquo;market value&rdquo; has already been defined in different types of legislation. It has been defined in the Finance Acts.  It has been defined for the purpose of income-tax.  It has been defined for the purpose of estate duty, as to what the market value of lands may be.  The Minister must realise now that if he lets this section through and does not accept this amendment, the expression &ldquo;market value&rdquo; will be open to all these interpretations.  How, if that will be the position, is any court going to interpret what the Minister may have in mind by this airy expression &ldquo;market value&rdquo;?  In view of the dangers that may come about by the Department of Finance closing down under rules to be made under this Bill and completely upsetting the intention of this Bill, and in view of the confusion that will undoubtedly arise without any further definition of that expression by the Minister, I would appeal to him to accept the amendment which was tabled by Deputy Moylan.</P>

      <P>The amendment tabled by Deputy Moylan left me under the impression that he was anxious to substitute the word &ldquo;price&rdquo; wherever the word &ldquo;value&rdquo; appeared in the section. No case has been made for that, I notice.  The debate has rambled off into quite a different field altogether. I am quite satisfied that this section will be workable and that it is going to produce the result we want, that is to give a fair price for land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That has not worked out so well in the past.  Deputy Moran has made, what appears to a layman like me at least, the rather <Col N="757" /> astounding statement that regulations made under this Bill can override the principles of the Bill and can actually repeal previous legislation.  I never had a legal training but that statement appears to me to mean that because Section 3 of this Bill gives power to certain persons to make rules, they can actually undo the work of the two Houses of the Oireachtas and substitute something they like themselves. I have no previous experience of this but surely that cannot be so.  I can imagine rules or regulations perhaps by-passing obsolete sections in previous Acts, but certainly none of the regulations or rules will be necessary to govern the conduct of the commissioners in fixing the market value as the price for land because the statute tells them what to do.  Heretofore they were expected under the 1923 Act to fix a price which was fair to themselves and fair to the owner.  That has worked out in some cases to be little short of confiscation or at least it resulted in doing serious damage to the person from whom land was being taken.  In the 1939 Act it was definitely specified that the market value should be given for unvested land which, without going into the question of the merits of the particular section, is all wrong because in the case of unvested land it is not the land that is being taken; it is the tenancy and it is the right to live on the land that is being compensated for.  Market value was not defined in that Act but no complaints have arisen and very few appeals on resumption have come before the Appeal Tribunal.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission in future will determine the price of acquired land and knowing that they are expected to pay the market value for it, I think this provision will work satisfactorily in the case of acquired land as it has worked since the passing of the 1939 Act in compensating the tenant for resumption.  I can assure the House that it is going to prove as satisfactory in the case of the purchase of vested land as it has in the case of unvested land.  It is a pretty big change but in my opinion the 1939 Act should have brought the two types of land into the same field straight away.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  It is a distinct method of purchasing if you like, because in one case the land is acquired compulsorily.  Whether the owner likes it or not it is going to be taken from him and the question of fixation of price arises.  In the case of purchase in the open market, the Land Commission will determine the price they are going to pay and if it goes more than that, it will withdraw.  The same would happen any person who goes to buy land at a price which he had fixed beforehand.</P>

      <P>The point is that while the amendment of the Minister does go a little way to meeting the difficulty, yet that does not limit the Minister to a particular area for the purchase of land at a public auction.  It does not limit the Minister's power to buy land within three miles of a rundale holding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore the Minister has not met my point.  I want to ensure that where the Land Commission purchases a holding in the open market for cash, the assignment of an allottee to that particular farm shall be a function of the commissioners which is quite reasonable.  In Volume 189, column 1123, we have the following statement by Deputy Sweetman:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I entirely agree with the Minister that it would be most irregular, most improper and most unwise for him to interfere in matters therein set out as being excepted matters.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the same Volume and number, column 1300, we have the Minister stating:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="760" />&ldquo;The security of tenure of every farmer in the country depends on the fact that the lay commissioners hold these powers in excepted matters.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again in column 1301 we have the Minister stating:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It would be most undesirable that the Minister should have power to acquire or allot land.  I would be the first to oppose it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no reason in the world why the Minister should have power to appoint an allottee to any of these farms purchased for cash.  That should be specifically an excepted matter, all the more because of the statement of the Minister that I have quoted.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment.  It does not curb his style in any fashion and it gives confidence to people that justice and right will be done and that political influence will not count.  I will shorten the matter here for the Minister, if I may, by taking the next amendment&mdash; coupling it with the other.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(o)  the determination of the actual lands to be purchased for cash for the rearrangement of lands held in rundale or intermixed plots by way of the provision of migrant holdings.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I admit that the Minister has come some way in No. 5 to meet my point of view.  I am very much concerned with the question of farms purchased in the open market anywhere throughout the country.  The determination of the lands to be purchased shall be an excepted matter under the control of the commissioners.  In view of what the Minister has said during the debate he himself sees how desirable it is to have these excepted matters specifically designated.  I will not say anything further except to urge on the Minister the advisability of accepting these two amendments and including their proposals as excepted matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me take amendment No. 4.  The Minister will not <Col N="761" /> have anything to do with the purchase or the acquisition of any land either by the compulsory powers that the commissioners have held and now hold, or by the new departure proposed in the Bill to purchase land in the open market.  The purchase of land in the open market is definitely safeguarded in Section 11 (m) which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The determination of the highest offer to be made by the Land Commission in the case of a proposed purchase under Section 25 of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That means that the commissioners still purchase the land.  The Minister has nothing whatever to do with the purchase of any land.  I hope that is clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned with one particular type of farm which the Minister knows and I desire to have that excepted from the exception made by the Minister to the first exception in (d) and (e) of Section 11.  First of all, we have an exception under the 1933 Act which was right and proper.  The Minister, for his own purpose, made an exception to that.  I want him to make a further exception in order to minimise the difficulty he created.</P>

The Deputy is not satisfied with my amendment, No. 5, which amends the definition to &ldquo;such other lands being either adjoining any of the lands held in rundale or intermixed plots or not more distant than three miles from any of such rundale lands or intermixed plots&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Some Deputies on that side of the House were under the impression that the Minister could have a say in the determination of holdings or farms to be given to migrants two or three counties away or 100 miles away.  Possibly under the old wording the Minister could argue with the commissioners that he had such power, even though that was not my intention. My amendment, No. 5, means that.  It prescribes the Minister's power and the divisional inspector's power.  It prescribes it to a three mile circle around that area and the reason three miles is fixed is that in some cases of rearrangement in the past some tenants in rundale or intermixed villages or townlands got a holding almost that distance away which, for the purpose of rearrangement, they might be asked to surrender.</P>
      <P>When I speak of a new holding now it is construed to mean two things.  One is that a new rearranged holding can be called a holding.  I choose to call that a rearranged holding.  The new holding I refer to, while it has never been defined, like market value or market price, is the average migrant's holding, which is part of a larger farm or land on which the Land Commission have built a new house and out-offices and have fitted up as a migrant's holding.</P>
      <P>I want to assure Deputies that this amendment of mine now tightens up the thing completely; the laxity that may be possible under the first drafting of the Bill is now definitely removed and the principles that Deputies on the other side want to see installed are amply safeguarded by this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 6 to delete lines 51 to 54 and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(b)  any officer of the Land Commission of not less rank than that of principal officer.</P>
      <P>This amendment is directed towards retaining public confidence.  The Minister has certain authority under this Bill to delegate powers to officers of the Land Commission.  In my opinion the drafting is too loose and faulty, and permits the Minister to give to any officer of the Land Commission directly, without the intervention of a senior officer, authority to do certain things as his agent.</P>
      <P>The Minister has very wide powers under this Bill, wider and more extensive than were given in any other Bill. The officer of the Land Commission is the Minister's agent to do his bidding. It would be very unwise for the Minister to delegate powers to an officer other than a senior officer of experience and responsibility.  It is essential that some permanent official can be made responsible for any act that he carries out as agent for the Minister. It would be unfair to saddle junior officers in the Department with certain types of responsibility.  I suggest to the Minister, in order that the Department may retain public confidence, that he should accept the amendment so that when delegating his power or authority under the Bill it should be delegated to an officer whose rank is not less than that of principal officer in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I do not know how far it is the Minister's intention to delegate those powers.  We tried, in so far as we could on the Committee Stage, to cut out paragraph (a) of sub-section (2) <Col N="764" /> altogether, which gives the Minister these powers.  We pointed out to the Minister what this might lead to and what it might leave the public open to if the Minister or any future Minister were prevailed upon by political friends in connection with any dealings in land. If the Minister were to delegate these powers, especially those in connection with a rearrangement scheme, to a junior officer in the Land Commission, he should be well able to appreciate what that may lead to.  If that officer is not a very experienced man such delegation of authority may lead to all kinds of trouble and hardship.  The Minister must be well aware that one of the greatest difficulties of the Land Commission has been to get experienced staff, particularly in regard to rearrangement schemes.</P>
      <P>Suppose a young engineer or a young man in the employment of the Land Commission for a short time had this authority delegated to him, he would be absolutely hopeless on the job.  I suggest that it would take such a man a considerable time to acquire what I shall call the necessary psychology to enable him to get the people to agree to the swopping of bits of land in order to reach an agreed rearrangement scheme.  If the Minister were to delegate his powers to some inexperienced officer of that kind irreparable damage might be done without the Minister knowing it so that ultimately more harm than good might be done by the scheme.  The result might be that it would be impossible for years to get people to agree on such scheme. What Deputy Moylan is asking is that the Minister would be required, from the point of view of efficiency, to delegate his powers to a principal officer. I think the Minister would be well advised to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>All this was discussed on the Second Reading and Committee Stages of the Bill.  I thought that I had assured the House on both stages that there is positively no danger of abuse arising from the proposed powers being given to divisional and other inspectors in the case of these schemes.  Under the amendment which was passed a moment ago, only the commissioners will now have the alloting <Col N="765" /> of the new holdings, as I described them.  They will also have the allotting of additions or enlargements, as they are more correctly termed, to uneconomic holdings.  These two things will be the commissioners' job.  They are safeguarded by the amendment already passed.  In the case of a rearrangement scheme, I can assure Deputies that it will not be the Minister's scheme or the inspectors' scheme, but will be the tenants' own scheme.  Let us suppose that a rearrangement job has to be done in a townland or in an area comprising a group of townlands which have been badly messed up since the landlords' days.  The inspector goes down there. He has a very troublesome piece of work to do, and that is to get all the people within that area to agree to the proposed striping, the moving back and the moving forward, until finally the inspector gets agreement from the lot. It is not his scheme but rather the scheme which the tenants themselves agree on.</P>
      <P>I can assure Deputies that an inspector who goes out on a rearrangement scheme is only too delighted when he finds that there is complete agreement between those concerned. The reason why I am seeking these powers is because it has been a heartbreaking job for the inspectors to get agreement from all the tenants concerned under the old system which obtains even at the present time.  Under it a scheme which was prepared by a grade two or three inspector had to be sanctioned by the inspector in charge. Then it went to the divisional inspector, and from him to the chief inspector in Dublin.  It then went to the special branch in the Department where boundaries and every detail of expense had to be checked up.  Finally, it had to go to the commissioners.  In most cases delay occurred, due to all this travelling.  By the time the scheme was returned to the country again, it frequently happened that there were radical changes in the personnel of those who had originally agreed to it. Perhaps some people had changed their minds.  In some cases one or two years and sometimes ten and 11 years elapsed before it was possible again to get agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="766" /> What I am seeking to do under this is to give the divisional inspector power and authority&mdash;to give him the commissioners' authority if you like&mdash; to sanction the scheme when it is prepared. There is no question of the Minister or of the Minister's friends or of any member of the Opposition, or anyone else, interfering.  As a matter of fact political interference is bad in most cases.  It only gives tenants in a village a perfectly wrong idea that with it they have a better chance of getting a bigger slice of the loaf than they are entitled to.  The powers sought here are intended to bring about a quicker settlement of rundale and intermixed problems all over the country, and there is no danger whatever of any abuses arising, because, instead of the commissioners having the sanction of these schemes, the fact is that every single tenant in the village or villages to be rearranged, will be a commissioner in himself.  You can be quite sure that every man will have an eagle eye to see that none of his neighbours gets away with something that he thinks he himself is entitled to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment has been thrashed out already pretty thoroughly.  I think the officials of the Land Commission would agree with me that when a rearrangement scheme is being prepared it would be impossible for the divisional inspector or the senior inspector to go into each rundale area to prepare such a scheme.  In 99 per cent. of cases they act on the schemes submitted by the junior inspector.  I think that is not any great departure from the old policy which was carried out since land division first started.  I think Deputy Moylan need have no fear and I have no fear with regard to this proposal.  It means that a junior official who is in charge of part of a county makes his report.  He goes on to every bit of land and tries to get agreement between the people concerned and reports back to his senior and the matter is &ldquo;okayed&rdquo; in the shortest space of time.  That is what we have been wanting for quite a long time.  I find myself in disagreement with the statement that the schemes are <Col N="767" /> the schemes of the people concerned. We know perfectly well that without some encouragement or lead, in many cases perhaps a little threat on the quiet by the official, the people concerned would never agree amongst themselves.</P>

I only rose to try to convince Deputy Moylan that these schemes will be prepared as schemes have been prepared for 50 years and will be submitted in almost the same way, except that there will not be delay in connection with the commissioners' sanction.  In nine cases out of ten they will be in agreement with the senior and junior inspector.</P>

      <P>The Minister seems to me completely to misinterpret what I am trying to get at.  It seems to me that the Minister has already determined the question of authority to the senior inspector.  The senior inspector, I contend, is attached to a field force.  There is also an office force.  I am trying to get the Minister to delegate authority inside the Land Commission, which he must do sometimes, to an officer of the same rank in the office force as he does in the field force.  It is easy to do it.  &ldquo;Any officer of the Minister or the Land Commission for the time being authorised whether specifically or by reference to a class of such officers&rdquo;&mdash; surely the Minister had in mind when he spoke of reference to &ldquo;a class of such officers&rdquo; that he should delegate authority or power as his agent to a senior inspector experienced and responsible. As the matter stands, it is too loose and authority inside the Land Commission might be delegated to a typist.  The Minister ought to answer that part of it.</P>

      <P>I must express thanks to the Minister for conveniencing the Opposition.  I think the Minister is making a change in this section which is not by any means desirable.  I think he is taking an action with regard to Government appointees which is a derogation of their status and is creating a precedent which is not desirable. When a Government selects a man to hold a high office, I think that appointment should be recognised by the succeeding Government except the appointee has been derelict in his duties.  I think that derogation of status is a grave wrong to any man. Apart from that, while the Appeal Court of the Land Commission is not constituted along the lines of an ordinary court of justice in which a jury examines the facts and the judge applies the law, broadly speaking the lay commissioners bring a very wide and considerable experience to bear on the facts and as such they take the place of 12 good men and true.  On the other hand, they combine and cooperate with the judge in applying the law to the facts of which they have experience and which they closely examine.  A legal expert is likely to give a reasoned and intelligent judgment on facts if he is familiar with the problem in which they are embodied. But the facts of Land Commission problems are so intricate and involved that only a man of daily and long experience is in a position to unravel them.  I do not think that a single judge is able to handle the work of the judicial tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="769" /> The Appeal Tribunal was set up, not as a whim but as a result of repeated demands made by the public because of the expressed distrust of the public. I pointed out here before that when a native Government comes to power in a hitherto unfree nation, the officers of the former foreign Government, no matter how loyally they serve the incoming Government, are always the objects of suspicion by many people; and it is not quite wise to say that they are completely just in their dealings. It is much wiser to ensure that they appear just as well as being just in such dealings.  It was to obviate any sense of injustice, even where there was no foundation for it, that the Appeal Tribunal was set up in the manner in which it was set up.  The Minister gave us some figures in relation to appeals and he pointed out that the work of the commissioners would not be unduly heavy in the future since much of it would be allocated to inspectors. You cannot allocate the real work of the commissioners to inspectors. With figures, of course, it is possible to prove anything.  By slightly reversing the figures, I get a different result from that achieved by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Last year there were five times as many appeals heard as were heard during the war years according to the figures given by the Minister.  Yet only 8,100 odd acres of land were acquired.  If you have five times more appeals during one year after the war than you had during all the war years, even with the acquisition of only 8,100 odd acres, surely one can expect an excessive number of appeals if the Minister is successful in acquiring all the land he desires under the terms of this Bill.  I might add that I have taken those figures from the Land Commission Report at page five.</P>
    <P>The Minister declined to make a clear definition of price and I believe, as a matter of fact, that because of that, there will be a plethora of appeals and I think it will be quite beyond the ability of one judge working alone, very often possibly not quite familiar with the facts of the case before him without long and arduous inquiry, to get through the work satisfactorily. <Col N="770" /> Deputy Cowan mentioned here the number of cases heard by a district justice in Dublin in one day, and compared that with the number of cases possible of hearing by the Land Commission. It is quite easy to say &ldquo;One bob, or a week&rdquo; to all the drunks that appear in the District Court; but they will not be drunk coming into the Land Commission.  They will be stone cold sober and tough and, believe me, some of the most intricate cases and some of the toughest men from Mayo will come into the Land Commission to fight it out there.  I suggest to the Minister that he should leave the system that worked so well alone in regard to the judgeship of the Land Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig.</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Moylan's plea that the Minister reconsider the provisions of Section 13. I thank him for affording us an opportunity of stating our point of view with regard to these proposals.  As Deputy Moylan has pointed out, when the 1933 Act was introduced, with its provisions described by the then Opposition, now the chief element in the Government, as being of such a drastic nature that they amounted to confiscation of the land of this country from its owners by the Land Commission, there was considerable debate here in relation to the additional powers being conferred upon the Land Commission.  It was suggested that there was a danger in the situation that civil servants appointed by the Minister or persons not of a judicial character, having functions in regard to appeals on the question of the price of land and the acquisition of land, would afford opportunities for political interference and it was stated quite specifically that the functions of the Land Commission ought to be exercised in such a way that there could never be any doubt but that the people exercising them were completely removed from all suspicion of interference by the Minister, by the political Party to which he was attached, or by his political followers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Lands dealing with the Bill at that time introduced provisions to make it quite clear that the Appeal Tribunal would be completely independent and, to guarantee that <Col N="771" /> position, he gave the members of the tribunal the same status as judges of the Circuit Court.  As the House knows, a judge cannot be removed from office except for misdemeanour or misbehaviour and, in addition to that, the misdemeanour or misbehaviour has to be so adjudged by resolutions passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It is quite definite that the members of the tribunal had that special position. Under Section 6, sub-section (4), of the 1933 Act, it is stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Nothing in this section shall apply to the Judicial Commissioner or to the Appeal Tribunal or operate to give the Minister any power or control of any kind over or in relation to the exercise of his functions by the Judicial Commissioner or their functions by the Appeal Tribunal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 7, sub-section (2), of that Act states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every lay commissioner appointed to be a member of the Appeal Tribunal shall hold his office as such member by the same tenure as a judge of the Circuit Court holds his office as such judge.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here we have provisions that the Minister is to have no authority to interfere with the members of the tribunal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>When I recollect that it was the present Taoiseach and the present Minister for Agriculture who were so anxious that the members of the tribunal would be preserved from all danger of having any stigma attached to them that they were in any way subordinated to the Minister or could in any way be interfered with by him, I think it is an extraordinary revolution that now, 17 years afterwards, a Government of which these two gentlemen are members&mdash;one the head of the Government and the other occupying an important Cabinet post&mdash;should now give its sanction to a provision under which the Minister can arbitrarily <Col N="772" /> remove from office members of the Judicial Tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt but that that is the intention, according to the White Paper issued by the Minister on the Bill.  He describes it as the withdrawal of two lay commissioners from appeal work.  If these members of the tribunal have had the tenure to which I have called attention and if that has been solemnly guaranteed by statute and if, under the Constitution, a judge of the High Court cannot be removed from office except for misdemeanour and by virtue of resolutions subsequently passed by the Oireachtas, both Houses finding him guilty of such, how in the name of goodness can the Minister claim that he is entitled to interfere in the way he has done?  Let the House note that although the Minister takes care to avoid the phraseology which would indicate directly to an ordinary lay person what he is doing, he does not profess clearly in black and white to be in fact removing these persons from the functions or to be taking upon himself authority to do so, and to be depriving them of the status the House had conferred upon them. He goes a roundabout way in the matter.  It is quite definite that the intention is that the Appeal Tribunal should be reduced from three members &mdash;which is its present size, and the number of its personnel under existing law&mdash;to one individual, the Judicial Commissioner.  The fact that it is still to be called the Appeal Tribunal cannot conceal that that is the intention. The Minister gave us no explanation. I think that before this very serious step is taken he ought to acquaint the House with the justification from the legal and constitutional point of view for the action he is now proposing to take.  I do not believe that that can be justified.  I think that if this question were referred to the courts by the members of the tribunal it would be found that the Minister, in violation of the law and the Constitution, is arbitrarily interfering with their status and tenure and functions.  The House should be given an explanation for this very extraordinary departure from normal constitutional practice and from accepting the principle which a <Col N="773" /> democratic Government must accept that persons carrying out judicial functions or persons upon whom such a status is conferred must be absolutely preserved in their right.</P>
    <P>It is an extraordinary thing that in this democratic age, in dealing with such an important matter as the land of the country, the Minister can step in in this way.  If we admit the right of the Minister to put provisions of this kind through the Oireachtas, interfering in this way with the membership and personnel of the tribunal, there would, I suggest, be nothing to stop a future Minister from taking up the same attitude with regard to other personnel performing other judicial functions.  What would our position be if members of the Government were permitted to come along to justices or other judicial persons and inform them that for reasons of economy or because of certain changes in the courts, or because they had decided that the work could be done better in another way, they proposed to terminate their appointments and to reduce their status to a lower level?  There is not the slightest doubt but that that step would be declared unconstitutional.  I do not know how the Minister has got the law officers of the Government to agree that he could possibly get these proposals through the Oireachtas without experiencing severe criticism and the strongest possible opposition.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to explain to us the exact position of the persons who are exclusive of the Judicial Commissioner.  Are they, when this Bill if it becomes law in its present form is an Act, going to be in the position that they are still members of the tribunal but that they have had their functions removed from them and, if that is so, how can we reconcile it with the provisions of the Constitution and with the terms of the 1933 Act? Or is it that they will be incapable of performing the functions under the Bill&mdash;that they will be incapable of performing the functions that have hitherto been theirs?  If it is suggested that there is a case&mdash;and I suppose the Minister is going to make the case that the new arrangement will be more economic and more effective and point to the fact that in the past the work <Col N="774" /> performed by the Appeal Tribunal since 1933 was carried out by a single individual, the Judicial Commissioner &mdash;I should like to point out that there will be, presumably, three commissioners sitting upon the court which will determine questions and give decisions in the first instance which may later be raised on appeal to the tribunal.  Is it not reasonable to suggest that it is better, in the interests of the State and in the interests of the national work which the Land Commission is performing, that the Appeal Tribunal should be as strong as it has been in the past?  Is it not reasonable to suggest that the judge, who may have a certain experience, undoubtedly, of the work but who is strictly a legal person who will regard the issues that come before him on land from the legal point of view, should have the benefit of the advice of the two lay commissioners of appeal who would have the advantage of being acquainted with the Land Commission work from inside?</P>
    <P>These commissioners have had the advantage that, as well as sitting on the Appeal Tribunal, they have from day to day been dealing with the questions of land acquisition.  There is no suggestion, of course, that we are dealing with matters that it was arranged would come before them on appeal. The work was arranged so that they would be given a certain amount of the ordinary work of the Land Commission&mdash;and they were daily engaged upon that work as well as performing the work of the judicial tribunal.  These men had, therefore, a wide knowledge and experience of the Land Commission and its activity and of the general objectives of the Government and the national policy for which all Parties in the country, I think, stand with regard to placing as large a number of families of Irish people on the land as possible.</P>
    <P>They could envisage, therefore, the problems before them and, in coming to a decision, they would have in mind not merely the legal issues, important and all as they might be.  They should depend upon the Judicial Commissioner, who has special knowledge and experience, paying particular attention to that side of the work and they <Col N="775" /> would see the other issues, such as the problem of the relief of congestion, the burden that would be cast upon the State, the employment likely to be given and the general advantage in other ways to the State of the policy they were pursuing.  It would be their duty, I think, while preserving their impartiality as judges in particular cases, to see that that general policy was made effective.  Is it suggested that it would not be to the advantage of the Land Commission and its work, to have a tribunal of that character on which you would have members specially qualified, having special experience and special knowledge of all sides of the activities of the Land Commission, to enable them to see what a particular decision or a particular precedent is going to mean perhaps in years to come, upon the work of that body?  I suggest that under this Bill it is very likely that very important questions will come before that tribunal.  This question of the market price of land is certainly going to mean one thing, whether it be market price or market value.  It is well known from past experience that by securing able advocates, a coach-and-four can be driven even through the most carefully drafted land measure.  I am quite certain the result of this legislation will be that every owner who thinks he has the slightest grievance and that he is not getting what he considers to be the top market value for his land will appeal. There is a great danger that there will be a regular glut of such appeals if the Government mean to take up land on that basis as the Minister has given us to understand.  In the first place it is necessary that the very best possible tribunal should be there to give decisions.  It is not merely that there will be plenty of work to be done but that the decisions that will be given and the precedents set up in the initial stages with regard to what is market value will, of course, determine the price that is to be paid in all future transactions.</P>

We are embarking upon a new orientation in this matter.  Even the Minister himself can give no guarantee that it is going to be completely successful.  We all hope it will and that it will secure the ends he has in mind, but I suggest that if he is going to ensure that the best results will be obtained from his point of view, he should leave the tribunal as it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>That is Mr. Justice Maguire.  He has to sit practically the whole of his time in the Four Courts. It is proposed under this section to have the Judicial Commissioner alone sitting on those cases and to deprive him of the help he formerly got, and would get if he had two commissioners sitting with him, who were in a position, before the Judicial Commissioner sat at all, to have a knowledge from the court below of the case or cases to be tried by the Judicial Commissioner and in a position to have studied the files and the notes of the evidence given in the court below.  I believe that in that way they would save a lot of time because they would be in a position to advise the Judicial Commissioner with whom they sat, as to the net points and the facts of the particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter which I think should be considered by the House before doing away with this tribunal, as it formerly operated.  This is one of the most important, if not the most important, tribunal in this country dealing with the question of land. When an appeal is taken from the lay <Col N="777" /> commissioners who hear these land cases throughout the country, to the Appeals Tribunal over which the Judicial Commissioner presides, there is no further appeal, except on a question of law to the Supreme Court.  No matter what grievance a person may have he has no right to go any further than this particular court except there is a net question of law involved.  That is a point which the Minister should consider very carefully before he continues on this course.  There are questions arising in connection with land, irrespective of how we discuss the matter from the point of view of the relief of congestion, that are very important to landholders.  There are, as the House is aware, cases coming before this particular court, day in day out, in which the issue is whether a man is to be left his farm or not, whether the land which he needs to make a livelihood is going to be taken from him or not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

      <P>With great respect it has.  If a case comes before the lay commissioners at a court down the country on the question of the acquisition by the Land Commission and the matter is decided in favour of the Land Commission, if the lay commissioners do anything wrong there is an appeal to the Appeals Tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not.  There can be an appeal from the Land Commission Court only on a question of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying is that there is an appeal from the lay commissioners to the Appeals Tribunal, which is at present composed of the Judicial Commissioners plus these two commissioners who are being removed under this section.  There is no further appeal, as I have stated, in cases of that kind except to the Supreme Court when the appeal can be solely on a question of law.  There are many <Col N="778" /> matters connected with the acquisition of land for the purpose of relief of congestion, outside the question of price altogether, that come before this court.  To my knowledge there is at least one case from the Minister's own constituency on that very issue pending before that court at the present time.  What the Minister is now doing under this section is this.  He is weakening that court by removing the two lay commissioners who sat with the Judicial Commissioner and who were in the position, from their experience, of being able to advise the Judicial Commissioner on the matters set out here by Deputy Derrig and the other considerations outside strict questions of law that might affect the people concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>One must take into consideration the very onerous type of work that is carried out by the lay commissioners and the serious results that decisions of the court may have on the people who seek justice there. Apart from all that, there is the point urged by Deputy Derrig.  These men, who have the status of Circuit Court judges under the 1933 Act, are now being removed from the bench because that is, in effect, what this legislation is doing.  I believe under this Bill, if the Minister is going to make any drive to acquire land, the work of this particular court will be increased to a very large extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="779" /> If the Minister has not already considered the matter, he should consider this, that the time of the Judicial Commissioner is taken up elsewhere and if he is satisfied that these two men gave good service in that court and would be able to shorten the work of the Judicial Commissioner and put him in a position to arrive at decisions in a more expeditious manner, it would be the height of folly to remove them now. It would mean that the work the Minister suggests will be done under this Bill will be delayed.  That aspect must be considered, outside altogether of the question of interfering with these men, who are guaranteed by law the status of Circuit Court judges.</P>
    <P>I think this section was drafted too hastily without being duly considered by the Minister's advisers.  If the Minister insists on putting this through he will find he will have to come back to the House shortly to change the type of tribunal that he visualises under Section 13.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Derrig sought to give the House the impression that this section will remove the independence that the two tribunal commissioners have held up to this.  I gathered that from the Deputy, but perhaps I misunderstood him.  Anyway, such is not the case.  All this section is doing is that it is merely giving a different type of duty to the commissioners for the future, duty which in my opinion is of a much higher and responsible nature than what they were doing up to this.  There is no reduction in status, no reduction in tenure, no reduction in salaries; it is merely giving them freedom to perform a different type of duty from what they were free to do up to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason this change is being made is that I have full confidence that in the future the Judicial Commissioner will be quite well able&mdash;I should say easily able&mdash;to handle all the work that will come to the Appeal Tribunal. I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that with the change in the method of price fixation for vested land the number of appeals will be remarkably <Col N="780" /> few.  I should take this opportunity of saying that I have every confidence in the complete fairness, justice and impartiality of the Judicial Commissioner in the exercise of his functions on the Appeal Tribunal</P>
    <P>Section 13 (3) protects and preserves the status and tenure that these commissioners held heretofore.  I am afraid Deputy Moran is all mixed up about the different duties.  The two appeal tribunal commissioners dare not open a file which may have appealable matter in it.  They do not see it and they have no pre-knowledge of the case.  I have no doubt that they have lived up to the expectations of their office in not even discussing a case with their colleagues who may have a knowledge of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest any such thing.  I know that as regards the matters dealt with by these commissioners they cannot sit on appeal on them.  I said that the files in respect of cases coming up from the court below come to them&mdash;cases on which they have not sat&mdash;and they are entitled to look at them and do look at them in order to know the points made for the purpose of shortening the procedure when they sit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister ought to ask his advisers; obviously he does not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That means that they go to the court with a pre-knowledge of the case, a thing which is denied to District Justices, Circuit Court judges, judges of the High Court and of the Supreme Court.  Such is not the case.  Unless on an appeal on price the two lay commissioners on the appeal tribuanl have no function that I can understand, and I have examined the matter.  I will say I have examined it only from the layman's point of view. On all questions outside of price the judicial commissioner is responsible for the decision.  In no section or sub-section is the Judicial Commissioner obliged even to seek advice.  He may do so for all I know, but I cannot find where he is obliged to seek the advice of the other two commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="781" /> The Appeal Tribunal commissioners will be taking part in a much more serious kind of work&mdash;that will be the work of the lay commissioners for the future&mdash;which is the acquisition of a man's property.  That is a very serious matter in itself.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moylan was afraid that there was a derogation of status in this section. That is not so.  He also mentioned that this tribunal was set up under the 1933 Act.  Surely, it is not contended that, when the need for alteration in a particular body occurs, this House cannot undo something that it did before.  The salary of the commissioners is untouched and their status is preserved under sub-section (3) of Section 13.  Their tenure is not disturbed.  It is merely a case of allocating to them a different type of duty, but I would say a more responsible type of duty than they had been carrying out so far.  There is nothing to substantiate the arguments of the three Deputies who have spoken in favour of leaving the situation as it is.</P>
    <P>My advice to the House is that the Appeal Tribunal, consisting of the Judicial Commissioner, will function perfectly.  We anticipate that the number of appeals will become fewer on questions of price.  As regards appeals on law, no one can tell what the future may hold.  Deputy Moran, I think, said that the position should be left as it is, and made the prophecy that either I or some other Minister might have to come back to the House to reinstate the commissioners.  It is quite true that nearly all things are possible, but for the present I am recommending this as the wisest course to the House.  I would not be a party to, and would not allow myself to be a party to, casting a slight on honourable men, men who have performed a really good job of work and men who, I want to say, will have a tough job of work to do in a new sphere when this Bill is passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand how the Minister can contend that there is not a derogation of status and interference with functions when a person who has been given the status and tenure of a judicial personage by Act of Parliament is taken from a superior <Col N="782" /> court of appeal and placed in a lower court.  Suppose the Minister were to bring forward a provision whereby a Circuit Court judge was to sit in future in the District Court, even though there was no objection made, and provided he continued to receive his old salary, I wonder what the courts would think about it?  Surely, there must be a derogation in status and an interference with the functions of the tribunal if the Minister can remove a judicial personage from a superior court to a lower court.  It is contrary to what was laid down in the Act of 1933, and is against the spirit of the Article in the Constitution. There is no suggestion that the Judicial Commissioner will not perform his functions with efficiency, with judgment and in a proper manner.  The suggestion is that this proposal is a weakening of the tribunal.  Up to this we had three persons on it.  One was specially qualified in law, and the other two were specially qualified to determine the ordinary issues that come before a land court from the point of view of national land policy in particular.  Deputy Moran has suggested that the judge, before coming to a decision which may have implications for the whole future of land division policy in this country would, if the present system were continued, have the benefit of the advice of two experienced companions sitting with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Land Commission has not been in the habit of giving evidence when the issue of price comes before the court.  Unless the Minister is going to commit himself in the future to paying the full market value in every case to persons from whom land is acquired, I cannot see that there are going to be less appeals than there have been in the past.  It is possible that may be the case, but it is also possible that there may be a spate of appeals in the case of persons who feel aggrieved.  They may think that they may succeed with their appeals if they get the most competent legal advice and the best assessors, and if they use up the general resistance which seems to have been developing for years past against the operations of the Land Commission and in a <Col N="783" /> general effort to try and curb its work. I think the Minister should reconsider his decision even at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister has ever studied the genesis of the clause in the 1933 Act which set up an Appeal Tribunal consisting of a Judicial Commissioner and of two lay commissioners to be associated with him.  There was a very long debate on that in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>There had been for years, particularly in the West of Ireland, grave dissatisfaction regarding the price fixed by the single Judicial Commissioner. Grave criticism was given voice to in the Dáil that lands which should have been taken by the Land Commission were not being taken and that the prices fixed for certain land by the Judicial Commissioner, prior to 1933, were altogether excessive.  We all know that the price which the Land Commission had to pay for land was reflected in the past in the rent which the incoming tenant had to pay.  I take it that it will be so in the future. No matter what subsidy the State may pay, there will have to be some sort of a relationship between the price which the Land Commission pays and the annuity charged to the allottee. This is an extremely grave matter.  If the price to be paid for land by the Land Commission is fixed so high that they cannot afford to take land and redistribute it, that will put an end to all land division, even in proper cases.</P>

    <P>I think that the Dáil and the Minister should consider this matter very gravely before they set up a single individual, no matter who he may be, as the sole judge of what the price to be paid for land will be.  In 1933 we arrived at this system that we would have a Judicial Commissioner, a judge familiar with the conduct of courts, and that we would associate with him two lay men who would take into consideration not only narrow legalistic considerations but the general policy in regard to the acquisition and distribution of land.  Those two men would have a good knowledge of the difficulties under which the Land Commission <Col N="784" /> operate.  Not only would they have a good knowledge, but they would have an interest in seeing that the work for which the Land Commission is being maintained would proceed as rapidly as possible.  I think it is fair to say that since 1933 the system has worked well.  Now the Minister proposes to abolish a system that worked well and to reintroduce a single judge as the arbiter between the Land Commission and the new allottees on the one hand and the owners of the land on the other.  I doubt that it will give satisfaction.</P>
    <P>We know how the Appeal Tribunal operates.  If there is an appeal on the question of price, only the owner whose land is being acquired or resumed and his valuers are heard by the court. That was all very well as long as there were associated with the Judicial Commissioner two lay commissioners who, from their knowledge of the work, had a good idea of the value of land, its value to the Land Commission and to the incoming tenants.  The two lay members of the Appeal Tribunal, although they could not handle Land Commission files dealing with cases which were likely to go for appeal beforehand, did handle those files afterwards and were able to see the result of the decision of the Appeal Tribunal, how it worked out with regard to the incoming tenants and how it affected the work of the Land Commission. They acquired knowledge of the work over a number of years.  If a new man was appointed he would not be very long handling the ordinary work of the lay commissioners before becoming an expert on this particular question.  If we set up again the system of a single Judicial Commissioner, which was subject to such criticism in the past, it must necessarily, I think, be followed by a complete new procedure in the court of the Judicial Commissioner which is still going to be called an Appeal Tribunal although composed of only a single person.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission cannot possibly allow a question as to the price of land to be decided by a Judicial Commissioner who is not familiar with the inside working of the Land Commission purely on the evidence <Col N="785" /> given by the person from whom the land is being taken and his valuers. The Land Commission will have to bring up their own field people to give evidence as to their idea of the value of the land as against the value placed on it by the owner.  If they do not, the Judicial Commissioner will naturally be very much swayed by the evidence put forward by the owner of the land.  We do not object to an owner thinking that his land is very valuable, but, certainly, if we are to give the market value of the land on the owner's valuation, it will be a fairly high price.  The Land Commission cannot possibly allow the owner's valuation to be put forward without giving their idea as to what the value of the land to be acquired is.  That is going to take a long time and, instead of speeding up the work of the Land Commission, it will add very considerably to the delay in the process of acquiring land.</P>

      <P>It is to be hoped that we shall hear Deputy Sweetman's words of wisdom on this matter.  It certainly seems to me, however, that it will delay matters very considerably.  If the Land Commission are compelled, because of the absence of any knowledge on the part of the tribunal as to the inside working of the Land Commission <Col N="786" /> or how the price of land affects their operation, to give evidence before the Judicial Commissioner it will take very much longer.  I appeal to the Minister to drop this particular part of the Bill.  The system which we have of a Judicial Commissioner associated with two lay commissioners has given satisfaction to the people of the country as a whole.  There were, of course, certain people who were not pleased with the price they got, but I think that the people living near a farm which was not being properly worked were reasonably satisfied with the price at which the land was offered to them when taken over by the Land Commission.  No matter what judge we get to operate this price fixing function, I do not believe he will give satisfaction either to the people from whom the land is being taken or the people to whom the land is being given.  It is of the utmost importance that the Land Commission, in carrying out their work, should have the confidence of the people.  A very important function has been given to the Land Commission.  We want to see them, in proper cases, proceed to take land which is not being properly worked and give it to people who will work it.  If that is to be done satisfactorily, it must have the support of the people and, in order to have that support, it is necessary that the Appeal Tribunal should be one that will give general satisfaction and one in which the people as a whole will have confidence.</P>

      <P>I think this is definitely a retrograde step and it is one which should not be taken by the Minister. The Minister has been asked to withdraw the section and I think he would be well advised in doing so.  He has stated that the Judicial Commissioner need not take any advice from the lay commissioners.  I think that is a meaningless statement.  He might as well say that anybody acting in authority need not take advice from anybody else.  These two lay commissioners are men of experience, apart altogether from their qualifications, and I do not think it will serve any useful purpose to take them away from the duties they have been performing for a number of years.  If the Minister is such a firm believer in the administration of one judicial person, then the same theory could be extended to the Supreme Court, where there are actually five judges.</P>

People who own land and from whom land may be acquired would like to have every assurance possible that their land will not be lightly taken from them or taken without having all the surrounding circumstances fully examined.</P>

      <P>If there was no dispute there would be nothing more to be said about it.  Everything would be grand.  But I can assure the Minister that any transactions in connection with land are more than likely to give rise to dispute.  I would ask the Minister to answer my question.  If there is to be no derogation of the status of these two lay commissioners and no interference with their tenure of office why is the section there at all?  I think the Minister should listen to the advice given to him and let well alone. He should permit the machine that has worked well over a number of years to continue to do the job.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Evidently the Minister misunderstood what I said.  I am sure he is not as familiar as I am with the workings of the Appeal Tribunal.  What I stated earlier here is quite true.  The Appeal Tribunal does in certain cases determine whether or not a man's land will be taken from him.  In the ordinary course of events the Land Commission furnish a notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> Notice is also served on the owner and the petition presented by him comes in the ordinary course of events before the lay commissioners. <Col N="789" /> If the lay commissioners decide against him he may on a question of law, apart altogether from the question of price, appeal to the Appeal Tribunal and that tribunal is the body which will ultimately decide whether that man is to be put out of his farm or whether he will remain in it.  It is after that decision has been taken that the question of compensation arises.  The Minister may say with a certain amount of justification that questions of law are determined solely by the Judicial Commissioners. That is so, but the Judicial Commissioners can only determine questions of law on facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>It is for the Judicial Commissioner to decide the question of law, but he cannot do that until the facts are ascertained and in order to get the facts he needs the assistance of the two lay commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely he can ascertain the facts just as well as the lay commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that he cannot or that he will not be able to ascertain the facts.  What I do suggest is that the lay commissioners are experienced and their advice as to conditions prevailing in particular districts may be of considerable assistance to the Judicial Commissioner.  I suggest that they have been, are and will be of immense value and assistance to the Judicial Commissioner.  It might be suggested that the question of price will always be a question of law, and presumably the question of price will be a question of law under this Bill. The Minister himself admitted earlier that the question of price will vary from area to area, from county to county and, in many cases, from parish to parish.  When the question of price comes before the Appeal Tribunal the Judicial Commissioner has the assistance of these lay commissioners who would be and have been, I am sure, very familiar with the different parts of the country.  Their assistance on these matters would also be very useful to the Judicial Commissioner before making up his mind as to what <Col N="790" /> the expression &ldquo;market value&rdquo; might mean and which this House has refused to define.  I would again impress on the Minister that this is the last court for the farmer whose land is being taken from him.  I want to get into the Minister's head the point that, irrespective of the question of getting the land, there is the question of the individual from whom the land is being taken&mdash;and this is his last court. He is finished when he comes before the Appeal Tribunal as it is at present constituted, except on a very net point of law.  That being so, I think the Minister should consider this court, with its grave responsibilities, as carrying out as important a function or possibly a more important function in respect of the vital issues involved&mdash; the vital property rights involved&mdash;than any other court in the land.  For these reasons I think the Minister should reconsider the suggestions put up to him by this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister, in having this section in the Bill, is basing his whole argument in having it inserted on the fact that because the Land Commission will decide in the future to give a better price for land there will be less dissatisfaction amongst landowners from whom land will be taken and therefore less work to be done by commissioners of any kind.  When a person's land is being acquired because it has not been properly worked, and is going to be given to somebody who will work it, the person in question has, first, the concession of having the annuity redeemed for him that he had not before, thereby putting more money in his pocket and, secondly, he gets the market value of the land, that is, a reasonable price for land sold in the locality.  Such landowners will in many cases be quite satisfied with this procedure and consequently there will be less appeals to the Appeal Tribunal and less cases to be decided by that body.  Therefore I think the Minister, in having this section inserted, is doing something which will speed up rather than retard the progress of the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody in this House is acquainted with the views which I hold <Col N="791" /> in regard to the system of acquisition and division of land and in regard to the slowness with which that is at present carried out.  Members of this House must be aware that I blame, and have blamed time and time again, the commissioners of the Land Commission, both lay and judicial, because of that slowness and because they will not come to a decision.  I feel they have failed in their duty in that respect and that a period of from 20 to 25 years without coming to a decision is much too long for any group of men in Government employment or for any group of men put there by a democratic Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can have the particulars.  The Minister is aware of the case.  These are the matters the Minister wishes to speed up and these are the matters that can be speeded up, not by removing the two lay commissioners from the Appeal Tribunal, but by giving a better and a more satisfactory price for the land.  In that way you will satisfy the people.  Of course, there will be a certain number of appeals to the Appeal Tribunal and I agree with Deputy Moran that such appeals will be brought where landowners will, on a question of law, appeal against having their land taken over by the Land Commission.  That has happened before.  It is happening at the moment and I suppose it may happen in the future.  There are so many loopholes in land legislation that it will be possible to delay a case by bringing it before the Appeal Tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question now arises in relation to the Judicial Commissioner, who is a judge of the courts, as to whether he is able on his own to settle those appeals without the help of the lay commissioners.  Different arguments can be adduced with regard to that <Col N="792" /> matter.  It might be wise to have lay commissioners, who have tried the case in their own tribunal down the country, there to advise him.  On the other hand, it might be wise not to have the advice of the lay commissioners or to have them there at all.  But the Judicial Commissioner in this case has to act for the Land Commission; and the officials of the Land Commission will be there giving evidence as to why the land is being taken and as to why such and such a price is sufficient.  On the other hand, the owner, in the first instance, will appeal against the land being taken over and, secondly, that the price is not sufficient.  I think the Judicial Commissioner should be well able to give a decision.</P>
    <P>Personally, I believe that any senior official of the Land Commission&mdash;the secretary, the chief inspector or any of the senior officials&mdash;could give a decision just as satisfactorily and just as well as a Judicial Commissioner. But that, seemingly, does not satisfy the people and does not satisfy the members of this House, who have decided that they will support the Government and the Parties who have introduced this legislation here to appoint an Appeal Tribunal.  It is, perhaps, just and equitable to have an Appeal Tribunal but I must say that I believe that where you will have less appeals, because of a more satisfactory price, you will have less work for commissioners of any kind and it should be quite within the powers of any single commissioner to do it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moylan pointed out that last year there were five times the number of appeals and yet only 8,000 acres of land were acquired.  The reason for that is quite simple.  It is because the Land Commission decided that the five, six or three and four acres in a congested area deserved more immediate attention than the 500, 600 and 700 acres in other counties.  That is the reason why there were five times the number of appeals and very little land taken over.</P>
    <P>I have been through an ordinary Land Commission court where, I think, there were 26 appeals against the resumption or acquisition of approximately <Col N="793" /> 108 acres of land&mdash;whereas, with one single appeal five times that amount could be taken over.  However, that is beside the point.  That argument is no point as to why the Land Commission and the Appeal Tribunal had so many appeals last year and so little land taken over.</P>
