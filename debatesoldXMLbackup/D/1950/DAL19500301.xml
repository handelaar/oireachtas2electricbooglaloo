      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether, with reference to his recent public statement on the matter, he is now in a position to state what practical steps are being taken, or will be taken, by the Government, to help the repatriation of sterling assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the statement referred to by the Deputy is the address that I delivered to the Institute of Bankers on the 19th November, 1949, dealing with the Government's policy of capital investment for productive and social purposes by means of repatriating part of the sterling assets.</P>
      <P>As I indicated on that occasion, the repatriation of sterling assets takes place through imports of goods and services in excess of current earnings, that is, through a deficit in the balance of payments.  This is, in fact, the only way in which such repatriation can take place.  I added:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In 1947 there was a deficit of £30,000,000 in our balance of payments. In 1948 there was a deficit of £20,000,000.  A temporary disequilibrium in the balance of payments is inevitable according as repatriation of capital takes place.  There are greater evils, however, than a temporary deficit in the balance of payments. This Government believe that impoverished and unnecessarily infertile land, lack of housing and shortage of hospital accommodation are far worse evils, evils which we are determined to extirpate, and which would even justify short-term <Col N="940" /> economic loss for the sake of social and long-term economic gain.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to ensure, however, that the deficit in the balance of payments is a reflection of increased capital investment at home rather than increased consumption.  It is also necessary that the new State investment must be in addition to, and not in substitution for, private investment which would have taken place anyway.  Indeed, the Government would prefer if as much as possible of the new investment were undertaken by private persons, because it would be more likely to be productive of a proper economic balance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I stated that such parts of our external assets as are spent should be used for the purchase of capital equipment, not unnecessary consumption goods; that money spent on productive capital investment should be spent on projects that yield the best revenue returns; that, in the case of other forms of capital investment, the projects selected should be, like housing, of prime social importance or should be potentially capable of so increasing productivity that the home investment undertaken will reduce our future dependence on imports; and that the State should not absorb capital which would be better used by private enterprise.</P>
    <P>Since we assumed office, the Government have, in fact, been acting, in this matter, in accordance with the policy adumbrated by me in the address to which I have referred.  They have taken steps, both directly and indirectly, to promote the repatriation of sterling assets for purposes calculated to raise domestic productivity and to yield adequate economic and social gains to compensate for the attendant loss of external income.  The financing of the greatly enlarged programme of housing, electricity and turf development, land rehabilitation, hospital- and school-building, extension of the telephone system, transport improvements, afforestation, etc., which the Government have in hands will call for resources on a scale that could not be met from current savings and will necessitate over a period of years the realisation of part of the accumulated savings of <Col N="941" /> the past now held in the form of sterling investments.</P>
    <P>Apart from directly influencing the repatriation of sterling assets in this way, the Government will continue to aid and encourage the undertaking of capital enterprises by private concerns and individuals, and it is expected that there will be further realisation of sterling investments for the financing of imports of plant, machinery and other goods required by such undertakings.</P>

      <P>In 1935-36 the committee drew up and presented to the Department a scheme of development comprising proposals for (a) five central schools, namely, schools of technology, commerce, trades and crafts, domestic science and music; (b) for new regional schools in Marino, Cabra, and Crumlin; (c) for extensions to the existing schools at Bolton Street and Rathmines and (d) for the replacement of the old Domestic Science School at Shelbourne Road, Pembroke, by a new building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the war, in November, 1945, on the occasion of their appeal to the then <Col N="945" /> Minister for increased grants the committee intimated that they had in mind a building programme as follows: Pembroke Domestic Science School, Crumlin (boys' and girls' schools), North Strand (boys' school), Whitehall (boys' and girls' schools), Bolton Street extension (boys' school), Kevin Street extension (boys' school), Williams' Park, Rathmines (boys' school), a new school of music, new central offices.</P>
    <P>The present long-term programme would appear to include in the first instance:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Boys' schools at Clogher Road, at Whitehall, at Killester and at Emmet Road, and girls' schools at Whitehall and at Crumlin, and later a boys' school at Williams' Park (Rathmines), an extension to Bolton Street (boys' school), a new science school and a new school of music.</P>
    <P>Since 1935-36, when building proposals were first presented to the Department by the committee, the following building programme has been carried out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  The new College of Domestic Science at Cathal Brugha Street and the new regional schools at Marino and Cabra.  These are completely new buildings, as well as being new schools.</P>
    <P>(2)  A completely new building has been provided for the domestic science classes which are at present housed at Shelbourne Road (Pembroke).  It is expected that this new building will be ready for use after Easter.</P>
    <P>In addition to this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(3)  New schools have been opened in buildings reconstructed for the purpose at Mount Street, at Denmark Street and at Aldborough Parade (North Strand).</P>
    <P>(4)  Considerable extensions have been made to Rathmines school and to Bolton Street schools, which enable these schools to serve as central schools of commerce and trades, respectively.</P>
    <P>(5)  Sites for new regional schools have been obtained at Crumlin Road, (girls' school), at Whitehall (a boys' school and a girls' school), at Killester (boys' school), at Emmet Road, Inchicore <Col N="946" /> (boys' school), and at Clogher Road, Crumlin (boys' school).</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he has received a communication from the Waterford branch of the Hatchery Supply Farm Association regarding (1) the great hardship imposed on the supply farms by the restrictions imposed on the sale of hatching eggs following the outbreak of fowl pest; (2) the disproportionate cost of feeding mashes in relation to poultry returns, and (3) complaints made that some hatcheries in County Waterford were not paying a bonus for eggs of over 80 per cent. fertility; and, if so, if he will state re (1) to what extent he proposes to meet their request for compensation, re (2) what action he proposes taking to reduce the cost of feeding mashes, and re (3) what action he proposes taking to enforce the payment of bonuses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The communication referred to was received and a reply has been sent.</P>
      <P>Under the Fowl Pest Orders, 1950, provision is made for the payment of compensation only in respect of poultry slaughtered and poultry carcases destroyed by direction of an inspector appointed by me for the purpose.  No claim for consequential losses such as those set out in the Deputy's question can be entertained.  The Deputy will appreciate that some temporary inconvenience has had to be borne by all sections of the poultry industry, but this would be a very small price to pay for the elimination of fowl pest.  As from the 15th February, County Waterford was completely excluded from the infected area and the movement of hatching eggs in that county is now permitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wholesale prices of proprietary feeding mashes are related to the cost of the ingredients.  As maize, oil-cakes and white fish meal, which are used in such mashes, must be purchased at prevailing prices on the world market, no steps can be taken to make any substantial reduction in the cost of the mashes until such time as there is a fall in the prices of those <Col N="949" /> commodities.  I must again emphasise that the cheapest way of feeding live stock is the production and consumption on the farm of as much as possible of the feeding requirements.  The future uncertainty relating to the prices and supplies of imported feeding stuffs is a compelling reason why home production of animal feed requirements should be pushed to the maximum.</P>
    <P>There is no obligation on hatcheries to pay a bonus on hatching eggs of over 80 per cent. fertility.  The matter is one for arrangement between the hatcheries and the suppliers of eggs and I do not propose to intervene.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether, is view of the increased cost of fishing boats and gear over the past 12 months, he will consider the advisability of arranging for a reduction in the amount of the initial deposit on the purchase of such boats, as fishermen find it difficult, and in some cases impossible, to meet the present initial outlay.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Chinn Chomhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 21 together.  In accordance with rule No. 16 of the Irish Sea Fisheries Association, the normal minimum prepayment to be made by a member, who himself proposes to engage in fishing, in respect of a boat issued to him on hire-purchase is 20 per cent. of the cost of the boat.  Rule 23, the currency of which expired on 31st December last, provided for the acceptance in exceptional circumstances of a lower prepayment than 20 per cent. but not less than 10 per cent.  The question of the continuance for a further period of rule 23 is at present under consideration.  In the event of its being continued, it is not intended to provide for a lower minimum prepayment than 10 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware <Col N="952" /> that fishermen on the Kerry coast are unable to pay the 20 per cent. deposit? Because of their inability to find the initial deposit, they have been informed that they are excluded.  Would the Minister at least consider their being supplied with boats if they can find a 10 per cent. deposit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  In any case where the Sea Fisheries Association has reason to believe that a man is honest and intends to work, it is my intention that he shall not be deprived of the opportunity of purchasing a boat out of his earnings merely for want of a 20 per cent. deposit.  In suitable cases an application to reduce that initial deposit will be favourably considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the cost of a 50-foot boat nowadays, suitable for all kinds of fishing, is as much as £9,000?  A deposit of 20 per cent, of that amount would run to £1,800.  That is entirely too much of an initial outlay for the ordinary fisherman.  Is the Minister further aware that there are many fishermen in Dingle and elsewhere who are awaiting a decision as to whether or not there will be a revision of the policy of the Department in connection with this deposit?  Would it not be better to accept a deposit of perhaps 5 per cent. and leave the remainder to be collected over a period of years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the excellence of the boats now provided and the excellence of the general equipment now provided.  I am aware that both those features have resulted in the boats costing somewhat more than did the inadequate vessels which were heretofore made available to the fishermen. It is my intention to ensure that any fisherman on any part of our coast who, in his particular circumstances, has a reasonable chance of successfully using a boat to earn a living for himself and for his crew, will have access to such a boat and that he will be afforded facilities to pay for it by instalments collected out of his catches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Deputy will probably agree with me that any man who contemplates undertaking on behalf of <Col N="953" /> himself and his crew a liability of from £9,000 to £10,000&mdash;these boats are very expensive because they are the best boats that can be bought for money anywhere in the world&mdash;does himself an injustice if he accepts a liability of that size without having certain resources to justify him embarking on such a venture.  I am sure the Deputy is aware that most of the men who contemplate skippering boats of this kind have no unreasonable strain placed upon them to put up £800 or £900 if they are thereby enabled to secure a boat which will enable them to go further afield in the knowledge that whatever catch they bring back will be taken from them at a fixed and certain price at the quay.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Sea Fisheries Association is an autonomous body in the day-to-day activities of which I am solicitous not to interfere; but were I to learn that the Sea Fisheries Association, by stipulating for too substantial an initial deposit, are cutting across the policy of the Government, which policy is to make good boats available to all good fishermen, I would deem it my duty to intervene in that matter and correct the misapprehension under which they would then appear to be labouring.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Cosgrave) (for the Minister for Finance)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to both parts of the question is in the negative. Where a wage-earner omits to make payment of his income-tax when it becomes due, the usual course is for the Revenue Commissioners to require his employer, under the provisions of Section 6 of the Finance Act, 1923, to deduct the tax in instalments from his earnings and to pay it over to them. In arranging the instalments the Commissioners have due regard to the circumstances of the taxpayer and every <Col N="955" /> care is taken to avoid causing undue hardship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied that either of the Deputy's supplementary questions is correct.  The Deputy is no doubt aware that the pay-as-you-earn system has been described as a perfect example of a perfect tax that has become a perfect nuisance; that it did not result in increased revenue to the Exchequer and that, in fact, its operation was found to be more costly and is more costly even where there is a far larger number of taxpayers than here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no evidence available which suggests that that is so. The system has been criticised in Great Britain where it has been in operation since 1943 or 1944.  In Great Britain there are approximately 9,000,000 individual taxpayers, while here there are approximately 120,000 employees who pay income-tax and 43,000 of the 120,000 already pay it by deductions at the source&mdash;in the case of employees of the State by deductions from salary, and certain other undertakings also.  About 5,000 additional persons have arranged to have the deduction made at source.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister is he not aware that because pelts are worth five times as much across the water a number of them are being smuggled out of the country?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the prices charged for leather by Irish tanners in each of the years 1943 to 1949, inclusive.</P>

      <P>As the reply to the Deputy's question is in the form of a tabular statement I am arranging, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to have the information circulated for inclusion in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>As Irish tanners produce a great variety of leather it is not practicable to give the prices of all the lines but the schedule hereunder sets out prices of the main products of each tannery at various dates in the years 1943 to 1949, inclusive.</P>

      <P>The quantity of sugar estimated to be required during the year beginning 1st April next for consumption by the population and for consumption in manufacturing processes is 120,000 tons.  I am advised by the Irish Sugar Company that the total quantity of sugar obtained from the 1949 beet crop was 88,700 tons.

      <P>Would the Minister not consider that there is a very serious position, where you will have to pay the foreigner something like £2,000,000 to make up the deficit in sugar, and where you will have to pay him practically £500,000 over what you would pay, if all our sugar were produced here?  Seeing that it has been already stated by the Parliamentary Secretary that the beet crop is down by 15,000 acres in two years would he not consider that sufficient to call a conference so as to make sure that we shall get the sugar we need?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal of the Castlebar Mental Hospital authority was to dispose of approximately 12½ acres of mental hospital land to the Castlebar Urban District Council for housing purposes at a nominal price of £25.  I am anxious to facilitate the Castlebar Urban District Council in every way in connection with its housing programme and I am prepared to sanction the disposal by the mental hospital authority of the lands in question for that purpose, even though any alternative land it may purchase in substitution cannot be nearly so convenient but, while appreciating the desirability of keeping down costs so that rents may be as low as possible, I was unable to sanction the sale for the nominal figure proposed, as I had to take into consideration the subsidies available to local authorities for housing projects, the fact that alternative land will have to be purchased by the mental hospital authority and that such land will have to be bought at the current market price.  The purchase of an equivalent area of land will involve the mental hospital authority in considerable expense and as no subsidy would be available for this purpose, I feel that it would be unfair to expect that authority to subsidise the housing project to the extent of the additional expenditure which the purchase of alternative land would involve. Further, it is not unreasonable to assume that the amount which the Mayo County Council will spend on health services is limited and, as the cost of the additional land would be a charge on its funds, the improvement and expansion of health services, which is my primary responsibility as Minister <Col N="970" /> for Health and which is urgently needed, would necessarily be retarded.</P>

      <P>Before taking this decision, did the Minister consult his Labour colleagues in the Government?

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

I appreciate that it would be possible for me to use my position as Minister to purchase some cheap popularity by agreeing to the disposal of this property in this way, but I do not believe I would be true to the trust placed in me if I were to allow this disposal to take place at a loss of £1,600 to the health authority, even in this very desirable project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that some two years ago the Government attached such importance to this matter as to make an announcement through the Government Information Bureau that they were issuing instructions to local authorities to use turf instead of coal to as great an extent as possible, and is it a fact that after two years no member of the Government is in a position to say whether these instructions have been carried out or not?</P>

      <P>I will be prepared to consider any proposals which may be submitted to me by the Galway County Council for the leasing of any lands which may be available at Gort workhouse for house building.  I have not received any such proposals.</P>
      <P>The State Lands (Workhouses) Act, 1930, fixes the maximum period for which such lands may be alienated at 99 years and there cannot, therefore, be any question of the sale of the site.</P>
      <P>Portions of this property have been or are being leased to private individuals as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="972" /> (a)  The old fever hospital leased as a residence for a period of 50 years from 18th August, 1927, at a rent of £25 per annum.</P>
    <P>(b)  Lease being prepared for the grant of 1 rood 1 perch as a site for the erection of a dwelling-house for a term of 99 years and at a rent of £1 a year.</P>

    <P>Section 4 of the State Lands (Workhouses) Act, 1930, requires that full particulars of certain leases proposed to be made under the Act must be laid on the Table of the House for a period before they are made.  The section applies to the two proposed leases referred to in the reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved to report progress last night, I was dealing with the argument which Deputy Moran had advanced in support of his amendment and of the amendment in the name of Deputy Moylan.  I was endeavouring to show that Deputy <Col N="974" /> Moran knew quite well that part of the argument which he was making had no foundation in fact, and particularly the examples which he had given as to the method adopted by the Revenue Commissioners in fixing the value of farms of land, both in cases of the death of the owner and of the transfer of lands where there was no monetary consideration mentioned.  I have stated that, where the rule of thumb method was employed by the Revenue Commissioners, the commissioners did not pretend that the value which they found as a result of the calculation was &ldquo;market value&rdquo;, and they call it, and practitioners call it, the artificial value.</P>
      <P>I mentioned last night that I think it is regrettable that Deputy Moran adopted examples of that kind because, thinking over the matter, I am quite sure that Deputy Moran knew they had no relevance, and that he simply produced these examples to mislead Deputies who would not have the same advantage as he has and the same familiarity with the matters to which he was referring.  I feel sure that if Deputy Moran does speak on these amendments again, he will, on consideration, admit that he was wrong.</P>
      <P>Now, to try to clear the air and the confusion that has been created by all the talk that we have had on these two amendments, I think it would not be a waste of time if we just try to recall what the Minister is trying to do by passing into law Section 5 of this Bill which Deputies Moran and Moylan are endeavouring to amend by their two amendments.  The position is, as I understand it, that under Section 39 of the Land Act of 1939, the Land Commission is bound to pay the market value for holdings which the Land Commission resumes, and this House, in 1939, when giving to the appeal tribunal a direction as to the amount of compensation which ought to be paid to the owner of a resumed holding, gave that direction in a very simple manner.  The direction is contained in paragraph (a), sub-section (5) of Section 39 of the 1939 Land Act and it says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The resumption price of such holding or part of a holding, that is to say, the compensation to be paid <Col N="975" /> therefor by the Land Commission, shall be the market value of the holding or part of a holding so resumed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There, in very simple and clear language, was the direction which this House gave to the appeal tribunal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephTimoney" hpid="Mr. Timoney Mr. Timoney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have an opportunity of reading these paragraphs to the House if he wishes.  For the purpose of my argument, paragraph (a) is sufficient, and I am satisfied to rely on it.  The appeal tribunal has been operating under those provisions since the 1939 Land Act became law, and I take it that the Minister is quite satisfied with the manner in which the appeal tribunal has dealt with resumed holdings under that section.  I gather that the Minister is now trying to get into line with resumed holdings, in the matter of compensation, those holdings which henceforth will be acquired by the Land Commission, and he, in dealing with the question of compensation, deals with it in just as simple a manner as this House dealt with it when passing the 1939 Land Act on this question of compensation for resumed holdings.</P>
      <P>That is the object which the Minister has in mind.  We have had experience in the last 11 years of the working of the appeal tribunal on the direction given to it contained in the words &ldquo;market value&rdquo;.  All that the Minister is now saying is that these are words which have been used time and again.  They have, apparently, created no great confusion.  The Minister says that the appeal tribunal has satisfied the owners of resumed holdings to a very great extent, and he asks us now to bring acquired holdings into line with resumed holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite convinced that the Minister is safe in leaving the section as it is, and that the House is safe in <Col N="976" /> doing so, for the achievement of the purpose mentioned.  Whether it is a good purpose or not is another matter, but for the achievement of that purpose the section is quite satisfactory and the amendments would only confuse the matter.  As I said last night, they would be almost fatal to the usefulness of the section.  They would be fatal to the proper working of the section as it is in the Bill.  For these reasons I would oppose both amendments. I am quite satisfied that the section, as contained in the Bill, ought to stand.</P>

      <P>Deputy Timoney wants to clear the air.  Every Deputy on these benches wants to clear the air.  Every Deputy in the House wants to clear the air except the Minister, who deliberately refuses to define what he means by the expression &ldquo;market value&rdquo;.  Nobody in this House knows better than Deputy Timoney that the appeal tribunal, when this House refuses to define the expression &ldquo;market value&rdquo;, is open to any definition that appears in any statute passed by this House.  The Deputy is well aware that it is open to anybody to go before the tribunal after this Bill is passed and to say: &ldquo;This is an expression called &lsquo;market value&rsquo; which the Legislature, in its wisdom or ignorance, refuses to define.  The same expression appears in other statutes and it is defined there&rdquo;, because this expression has certain definite meanings under Section 61 of the Finance Act, 1910, and Section 16 of the Finance Act, 1894.  If any court or tribunal is left without any guidance as to an expression like this, the nearest they can get to it is to take one of the definitions already set out by law.  Nobody knows better than Deputy Timoney that, if the Bill is passed leaving the expression &ldquo;market value&rdquo; in the air, it is open to anyone to argue that under the Act of 1894 it is 25 times the valuation, less the redemption value, or on the other hand, under later legislation, it is the value that appears for the purpose in a deed and to add to that the redemption value of the annuity.</P>

The people whom the Minister mentioned were being robbed are the very people who were the victims of this nebulous expression &ldquo;market value&rdquo; since 1939.  According to the Minister, this matter is deliberately introduced into this Bill and he refuses to give an interpretation of it.  I invite any Deputy to ask himself what he will think of himself if a piece of legislation of this kind goes through the House.  If anybody asks him: &ldquo;What do you mean by the expression &lsquo;market value&rsquo;?&rdquo; all he can say is: &ldquo;We do not know; we put it in.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wants to check up on Section 16 (1) of the Finance Act of 1894 or on Section 61 (1) of the Finance Act, 1910, he is welcome to do it.  I suggest to the House that there have been legal definitions under these Acts as to what we call &ldquo;market value&rdquo;.  There is no definition given here.  It is open to every individual to consider what his interpretation might be at his own sweet will.  Never in my experience of this House did I hear any Minister suggest that he was deliberately refraining from defining any matter in a Bill.  As a matter of fact, it was generally accepted as a principle of legislation going through the House, if anybody suggested that there was any doubt about the interpretation of any phrase or section, that the Minister would undertake to set it right and try to define it so as to give guidance to the courts who will have to interpret the measure when it comes before them. This is the first time in my experience that we have had a Minister deliberately informing the House that he refuses to put in a definition of what he means by certain words.</P>
      <P>I am again warning the Minister that if that is his attitude the people will accept his words and he will not get their co-operation.  What is more important for western Deputies, he is not going to get land; because if any man is left without knowing what he will get for his land, he will not take the chance of allowing his land to go to the Land Commission.  I know of no precedent for the Minister's attitude. During the years I have been in this House I know of no Bill being presented to the House and the Minister deliberately stating that he is going to leave the issue confused and refusing to define a particular expression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="979" /> We have had disagreements in this House about certain interpretations and, even if the Bill went to the Seanad, if we were doubtful when it came back about an expression we had a debate about it and when the Bill left this House we thought everybody understood the implications of it and knew the interpretation of it.  This is the first time in my experience that a Minister deliberately wants to confuse the issue by putting in this expression that nobody understands.  We want to be co-operative with the Minister.  His suggestion that we want to delay the measure will not cut any ice with anybody. On the Second Reading, the Minister stated that he would give ample time to consider this.  As a matter of fact, he told Deputy Moylan that, if necessary, he would give three days for its consideration.  The old bogey of suggesting, if amendments are put down to try and improve a Bill, that that is obstruction is not going to cut any ice.  The Minister played himself out on that issue in the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  He accused the Opposition in general, and me in particular, of holding up that Act.  I am not prepared to let this section through when nobody understands what this section means.  I think it would be bad for the Minister and the House, and unfortunate for the people, if the courts have to face the task of interpreting an expression which the House refuses to determine.  That is the issue before the House.</P>

      <P>Knowing Deputy Moran, I did not take him at his word, and I went out and got the Acts myself.  I challenge Deputy Moran now to read out of the Finance Act, 1884, any section in which market value is defined.  Will he do the same with the Finance Act of 1910?  We might then have some respect for his argument.  But I cannot trace any reference whatsoever to the words &ldquo;market value&rdquo; in the sections from which he quoted.  If he read the wrong sections, I shall accept his <i>bona fides</i> when he quotes the right ones, but not until then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of <Col N="980" /> this discussion is, I assume, two-fold. Firstly, its purpose is to find a phrase that will do justice to the person from whom the lands are being acquired; and, secondly, to find a phrase which, by doing justice, will permit of no ambiguity.  Having listened to the discussion for some time, I feel impelled to speak.  The Opposition is pressing for a definition.  In doing that they appear to me to be losing sight of the fact that in constructing and putting together Acts of Parliament we are presumed to use both intelligible ordinary English and intelligible ordinary Irish.  These words, therefore, must be construed in their natural and ordinary sense.  Is there any person here or outside the House who, if he were asked the meaning of market value, would not immediately be able to say what it is?  If the words &ldquo;market value&rdquo; were something invented or something put in for the purpose of causing discussion in court, there might be something to be said for the arguments that have been adduced here. But market value is defined in the dictionary.  Market value is surely understood by all intelligent, sensible people.  Half an hour ago, during Question Time, Deputy Moran cross-examined the Minister for Health as to why somebody did not receive market value for a plot in some town in the West of Ireland.  Is there any difference now in the meaning that he would attach to market value and in his understanding of it when he questioned the Minister for Health? Market value is understood by any reasonable person or by any tribunal appointed to fix compensation in a matter of this kind.</P>
      <P>Market value is defined in that well-known work, <i>The Oxford Dictionary,</i> as the current value in the market, saleable value.</P>

Change one back to the other and you get to the stage where every valuer or auctioneer &mdash; and I think I have a colleague from County Wexford on the Opposition Benches who should appreciate this&mdash;will surely not admit that he does not know what market value means.</P>

      <P>If any valuer was asked to give the Land Commission his view as to what the market value is of any particular holding at a particular time he would quite definitely know what it was.  I can put the minds of those Deputies who have any doubt in this matter at rest.  I can tell them that if they consult the 1925 <i>2nd Irish Reports</i> at page 240 they will find there where a judge of our High Court, on an appeal from the Circuit Court, definitely laid it down:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Market value is a fact well known to valuers, and definite methods of proof are always available.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In addition, therefore, to market value being capable of definition by means of the dictionary, it has also received judicial interpretation in our own courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is right to say that market value has been defined in a number of statutes, but it has been so defined for a specific and particular reason.  It has been defined in order to attach to the expression something more than the ordinary general public would attach thereto.  It would only complicate the matter here if we were to lay it down that compensation would be assessed for these lands at market value and that market value is to be defined in a specific way.  If you approach the subject from that point of view you must state that the lands will be assessed at a certain value based upon so-and-so. It is not a proper use of language to say, first of all, that you have market value and then proceed to whittle that down to something else.  Let me give an example.  In one particular statute market value was defined.  I refer to the Damage to Property Act under <Col N="982" /> which compensation was paid after 1923, and later on in a subsequent Act. It was defined in sub-section (13) of Section 10 as the price which the property could be expected to fetch if sold by a willing seller to a willing buyer at a price prevailing in a free market for such property at the time of the award. Will not any valuer, perhaps in not such precise legal language, have that in his mind?</P>
    <P>As regards the Finance Acts, there one has an artificial method of fixing the value of the property for the purpose of estate duty.  Deputy Moran knows that very well.  He knows that the market value fixed under those Acts is considerably less than what the holding would fetch in the open market.  It is for the purpose of having just such an artificial assessment that the definition is put into the particular Act.</P>
    <P>I want to point out to the House the danger of defining too fully &ldquo;market value&rdquo; for the purpose of assessment. As Deputies know very well, where either the State or local authorities acquire property compulsorily, there is imported into the particular Act under which they purport to exercise their functions the provisions of the Acquisition of Property Act, 1919, which has become part of our code.  Any Deputy who has had experience of the assessment of compensation under that particular code must know that it militates absolutely against the person from whom the property is being acquired.  That has always been a source of dissatisfaction because under Section 2 of that particular Act the value is fixed according to certain welldefined principles.  I do not think the words &ldquo;market value&rdquo; are used.  The Referee can assess the amount of the compensation with special regard to Section 2.  In so far as it operates, it operates against the full compensation being paid to the person from whom the lands are being acquired.  It seems to me that we have been rather running round in circles in this discussion. I am attributing to the Opposition a genuine desire to have this section made perfect.  If for one moment I thought that the section was not perfect in what it sought to do I would have no hesitation whatsoever <Col N="983" /> in saying so.  Attributing to the two movers of these two amendments that desire, I can see, reading into their two amendments, nothing that puts the matter further.  The only thing is that it will complicate the matter to a certain extent in so far as the valuer who comes up to give evidence&mdash;when he has to give evidence as to what is the guide in the section&mdash;will be obliged to take only into consideration the matters that are in the particular amendments whereas, if the use of the expression &ldquo;market value&rdquo; is left at large he will have no difficulty whatsoever as an auctioneer and valuer in arriving at that figure.</P>
    <P>There is one point, however, to which I should like to draw the attention of the Minister.  I take it the overriding desire on the Minister's part is that the person from whom the land is acquired will get full market value compensation.  I know there is considerable delay between the time land is acquired and the time the whole matter is adjusted.  When I use the term &ldquo;fluctuating market value&rdquo; everybody knows what &ldquo;market value&rdquo; means.  Values on the market fluctuate from time to time.  There might be a period of one to three years between the original taking over and the final completion of the matter.  During that period market values might fluctuate.  I think it might be important to define either in this section or in some other section or somewhere in the Bill the definite point of time at which the market value is to be gauged because there might be either a rise or a fall.  In the period in which we are now living&mdash;with devaluation, world prices and so forth&mdash;values tend to change from time to time.  The Minister might consider that suggestion from his point of view as to what he actually wishes to do&mdash;whether he wishes to give the market value actually at the date of the first service of the notice or at the date of the final adjustment or the date of the fixing of compensation. It may not seem of importance to us here now but I think it would be of extreme importance to the person from whom the land is being taken.</P>

      <P>I moved the amendment <Col N="984" /> in the hope of getting some expression of the intention of the Minister in regard to the definition of &ldquo;market value&rdquo;.  The Minister might either explain his position fully or desist from half explaining it.  In the Minister's Second Reading speech he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We are not prepared to give a price which is unfair to ourselves for land, and for that reason I took very good care not to say in the Bill that we were giving market price, but that we were giving market value...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The reference is Volume 118, No. 9, column 1311.  In the 1923 Act the expression in regard to price was &ldquo;fair to the owner and fair to the Land Commission&rdquo;. As a definition it meant nothing and as a definition, as expressed by the Minister on the Second Reading of this Bill, &ldquo;I took very good care not to say in the Bill that we were giving market price but that we were giving market value&rdquo; does not mean anything either.  I know nothing of legal terms and the various Acts that might affect the matter.  I cannot be an expert on those.  But, after the long speech we had from Deputy Esmonde, the only thing that emerged clearly was that his definition of market value was according to the dictionary, and he proved to us that it was &ldquo;market price&rdquo;.  I read Section 39 of the Act of 1939.  It was the only piece of legislation to which I referred.  Deputy Timoney spoke at length on market value.  Instead of hiding behind the various barriers of legislative quotation, why not let us all get down to brass tacks and answer one question?  Deputy Timoney avoided it.</P>

      <P>We discussed both amendments and I am now formally moving amendment No. 6 in order to have it put to the House:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The market value of land to be purchased or acquired by the Land Commission shall be determined by the average current price paid for land of similar quality to that being acquired in the immediate vicinity of the district where it is being acquired.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman splits hairs about the principal value, the market value or the market price.  The definition of principal value is set out in various statutes.  The particular sections which he has questioned specify clearly the method under which the value is arrived at; that happens under certain Acts of Parliament that are still in force in this country.  I will quote from a publication issued by the estate duty authorities and known as Form A&mdash;2E.  The principal value is there defined under paragraph 29, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Where the deceased died before the 30th April, 1909, the principal value of any property passing on that event is the price which, in the opinion of the Commissioners, such property would fetch if sold in the open market at the time of the death. Provided that in the case of any agricultural property&mdash;i.e., agricultural land, pastures, and woodland and such cottages, farm buildings, farm houses, and mansion houses (together with the lands occupied therewith) as are of a character appropriate to the property &mdash; [see Section 22 (1) (g)]&mdash;where no part of the principal value is due to the expectation of an increased income from such property, the principal value shall not exceed 25 times the annual value, as assessed under Schedule A of the Income Tax Acts, after making such deductions as have not been allowed in that assessment, <Col N="989" /> and are allowed under the Succession Duty Act, 1853, and making a deduction for expenses of management not exceeding 5 per cent. of the annual value so assessed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Under the 1894 Act you call it the principal value; you certainly call it the market price here.  The Minister says the market price is different from market value and he has split hairs on that issue.  However you approach this question, the finance people define it under different Finance Acts in this country.  The Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, provided a definite method whereby an arbitrator sitting down the country on the question of land being acquired is directed to assess compensation.  The definition, if my memory serves me correctly, under the 1919 Act, is the price that a willing purchaser would pay a willing vendor.  Under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, there are certain directions and an attempt to define what the legislators then thought was the market value.  There is another method under the Finance Acts as to how market value should be defined.  There is a definition under the Compensation Act where compensation was paid to people who suffered loss during the war period.  They made an attempt to define what they called market value.  Every time the expression was used there was some attempt to define what they called market value.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I make a present to the Deputy of the difference to be arrived at in what in his opinion is the market price and the market value.  I call the market price the market value, whatever the Deputy might call it.  In every Act there has been some attempt at definition, but we are leaving it up in the air.  If the Minister wants to stop endless litigation, if he wants to get the land he says he is looking for in order to relieve congestion, I urge him not to leave this question up in the air. He should introduce before the Report Stage another section, even giving his own expression to what the Land Commission call market value.  Then we <Col N="990" /> in this House, the courts in the country and the people from whom the land is being taken will know where they stand.</P>

Why was he deceiving himself or trying to deceive the House? Everybody knows that market value means market price.  I have one fear and it is a very serious one.  The State is setting out to acquire land and the Minister has expressed his determination to get land at all costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be got&mdash;the problem of the congests in the West must be solved at all costs.  I want to suggest to the Minister that, under the operation of the section as he has made it now, the market price of land can rocket to the sky so long as the State has a long purse and is prepared to pay the difference between what is a fair price to the allottee and to the person who owns the land.  If the Minister is able to get from the Minister for Finance an unlimited amount of money, then, under this section, he can get any amount of land.  But market value or market price will vary from day to day and from week to week.  We saw that in the case of cigarettes during the emergency even though there was a fixed price on them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It depends on the market which you create.  Everybody knows how farms of land in the same townland of the same intrinsic value will realise quite different prices. Values change from day to day and from week to week.  If it is known that the Land Commission are setting out to purchase land, and that they must get it at all costs whether by auction or by private treaty or otherwise, then the market value, or the market price, will go up and up.  That is a danger that I want to point out to the Minister. It may prove a very serious one in the future and you may have an abuse of the whole principle of land acquisition and division under this section.</P>

The Minister should be most careful in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I do not share many of the fears which Deputy Allen has expressed in regard to this section.  I do not think there is anything in them unless the Land Commission were utterly reckless.  The Land Commission have not given much indication of recklessness in the past.  I do not think there is any need to worry about the value of land being forced up to the sky.</P>
      <P>I am, however, worried about another aspect of this question.  The Minister, on a number of occasions, has expressed the view that persons from whom land was acquired in the past were unjustly treated.  This section seeks to remedy that injustice.  In so far as it does, it is very welcome and desirable.  If the Minister is convinced that an injustice has been done even to only one, two or three citizens, then I think he should be more than anxious to rectify it.  As I have said on other occasions, the Minister can hardly be held responsible for anything wrong that was done before he took office. He, however, should take responsibility for anything that has happened since 18th February, 1948, when he took office.  In my opinion, it is from that date that this section should operate. I am not in a position at the moment to say, although I think I asked a question about it last year, how many holdings were acquired by the Land Commission during the year 1948 and the year 1949.</P>

      <P>As I cannot move my amendment, I can request that the Minister should, at a later stage, bring in a somewhat similar amendment of his own.  As I have suggested, the provisions of this section should in my opinion date back to the 18th February, 1948.  The Minister has taken a very strong stand on this question.  He has been very definite in his assertion that people from whom land was acquired were unjustly treated.  I have plenty of evidence at my disposal to support that.  I think that both the Minister and myself are in agreement on that. I want to say again that I think it is only fair and just that this section should take effect from the date on which the Minister took office as Minister for Lands.</P>

Deputy Sweetman appeals to us not to define a definition, but the Minister has given a negative definition of a definition.  He said on the Second Reading, and in the debate on the amendments to this section, that market value was not market price.</P>

      <P>Market value was defined in the 1939 Act in the Irish version by reference because marga-luach is the translation into Irish of both market value and market price.  The Minister comes along to-day and he says that marga-luach is not marga-luach.  Surely, we should have that cleared up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>This whole business of the acquisition and resumption of land has gone on for a long time, and surely we should clear this up.  In the 1923 Act you had a definition, or a provision for the fixation of price which the Minister now proposes to delete, and to put in his own provision in regard to all land acquired.</P>
      <P>Under the 1923 Act you had the situation that the Land Commission could resume land.  They could acquire untenanted land, but they could not acquire land which was vested in the tenants.  As the years went on, you had a situation in which the Land Commission were resuming small parcels of land and leaving, side by side with these, large tracts of land which had been vested in the tenant and which they could not touch.  Under the 1933 Act the Dáil decided to give as much protection to the person whose land was resumed as the person in whom the land had been vested.  Under the 1939 Act the Dáil decided that, where holdings were resumed, the person from whom the land was being taken should get the market value or the market price.  Under this section the Minister says, on the one hand, that he proposes to increase the price for land acquired and, again, he says that there will not be very much difference between the price fixed for land hereafter and the price given for land up to the present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is really the Minister who has created the confusion.  It is up to him to try to clear the air.  If what he says at one time is true, that this is going to give an increased price for land, somebody will have to pay it, either the <Col N="995" /> State or the incoming tenant.  When I saw this section, I thought the Minister had been persuaded by some remnants of the old landlords who still have certain portions of land to increase the price.  A very small amount of vested land has been taken over by the Land Commission, but a fair amount of land has been resumed.  Under the 1939 Act the market value or market price was to be paid for resumed holdings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <P>We want the Minister to clear up the confusion and we are entitled to an answer to this question. What does the Minister mean when he says that market value is not market price?  The Minister proposes to set up a single individual to interpret this section in the Bill.  That situation in which a single individual fixes the price of land obtained from 1923 to 1933.  It was not very satisfactory, to the knowledge of a number of Deputies.  The <Col N="996" /> Minister proposes again to set up a single individual to determine the price, a price which must affect either the State Exchequer or the annuity payable by the incoming tenant.  Under the old definition &ldquo;what is fair to the Land Commission and fair to the tenant&rdquo; there were grave allegations up to 1933 that land was taken at a price which was unfair to the incoming tenant and over-generous to the person from whom the land was taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>An unsustained allegation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that prior to 1933 that did not happen.  I should like him to look up the debates in the Dáil on that question.  It was thought in 1933 that the State could pursue the policy agreed to by all Parties in the House, that wherever land was not being worked in a reasonable way having regard to the necessity for production and the desirability of increasing the productivity of the land, the State should have the right to take land from people who were abusing their ownership of it.  The Minister is now changing the system in regard to the price of land being acquired from the remnants of the landlords in the country, and he will not give the Dáil any indication as to what this new price is to be.  Is it right that the owners of land from whom the land may be acquired should be informed as to what the Dáil is proposing to do under this Bill?  People who are hoping to get portions of land should also know what price they will have to pay under this new definition in the Bill.  Will they, as a result of it, have to pay an increased annuity or will they not?</P>
      <P>The Dáil is entitled to an answer to that question also.  Again, I urge upon the Minister, between now and the Report Stage, to get his officials and the parliamentary draftsman together and clear up some of the confusion he has created during the course of the two debates on this measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephTimoney" hpid="Mr. Timoney Mr. Timoney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>Evidently Deputy Aiken was not listening to Deputy Moran and Deputy Allen, because they would have solved his difficulties for him as to the effect of Section 5 on <Col N="997" /> the price of land.  Deputy Allen told us that the effect of the section would be to drive the price of land up very high.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy now says &ldquo;might be&rdquo; I shall accept that. But I certainly understood him to say that it would; and I gathered from the whole tenor of his speech that that was a very real fear in his mind.  I take it I am right in that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>He does fear that the price of land will be driven up to astronomical heights.  On the other hand, Deputy Moran is in considerable anxiety by reason of his fear that the section as it stands will so depress the value of land that people will not be willing to sell it at all and that there will not be a sufficient pool of land for acquisition and redistribution purposes. It would probably solve the problem if Deputy Allen and Deputy Moran would get together, with Deputy Aiken acting as arbitrator.  They could then work out which way the balance would go.  As a matter of fact, the two usually cancel each other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">

    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephTimoney" hpid="Mr. Timoney Mr. Timoney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has taken up a perfectly sensible attitude, just as sensible as was the attitude adopted by the Minister in charge when the 1939 Land Act was introduced. He used the phrase &ldquo;market value&rdquo;.  There has been no trouble about that since.  A perfectly competent tribunal has interpreted the phrase ever since.  That tribunal consists of reasonably sensible people with a high standard of intelligence. The more I listen to the debate the more convinced I am that the section, as it stands, will attain the object the Minister has in mind which, as has been stated <i>ad nauseam,</i> is to put land being acquired by the Land Commission on the same basis as land being resumed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="998" /> It was very ingenious of Deputy Aiken to haul out of the Irish version of the 1939 Act the Irish word for market price.  I think it appears only once.  In paragraph (b) of sub-section (5) of Section 39 the Irish word used is &ldquo;marga-luach&rdquo;.  In all other cases where the word price is mentioned you find &ldquo;resumption price&rdquo; and where price is defined you find the Irish word &ldquo;praghas&rdquo;.  In view of that I do not think one should be coerced into accepting the view that market price and market value are one and the same thing.  I think Deputy Moylan mentioned the price of cigarettes.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with the effect of the section on the price which the owners of land will henceforth get where that land is resumed.  I have no intention of trying to define market price.  I do not think I could do that. Neither have I any intention of trying to differentiate between market value and market price.  It seems to me that a rather good analogy is the difference in the price of a packet of cigarettes in the Twenty-Six Counties and in the occupied part of Ireland.</P>

      <P>Up there the packet of cigarettes costs 3/6.  It surely has the same market value in the Twenty-Six Counties and in the occupied part of Ireland, but there is a difference in the price.

I am perfectly satisfied with the section as it stands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The attempt made by Deputy Timoney to knock the heads together of two Deputies on this side of the House brings out exactly what our concern is.  On the Second Stage I mentioned the sweeping fluctuations which had taken place in the price of land because of different factors operating. At one time there was a downward trend which helped to bankrupt a lot of farmers.  We are trying to get some stabilising factor into a definition of market value in order to check fluctuations in either direction.  I think the Minister should get away from a mere technical discussion of the difference between market price and market value and consider that factor to which he himself referred in his concluding speech on the Second Reading.  He pointed out the fluctuations in price over a number of years and he gave the House the impression that he was going to take that factor into consideration in the subsequent stages of this measure so that there would be some <Col N="1000" /> stabilising factor introduced into the fixing-up price.  What is in the mind of the Minister is practice.  We know that the practice of the Land Commission has been that the inspectors go very conscientiously into all the details of the value of property and that then the matter is considered by the commissioners and so on and ultimately by the court.  That is the practice.  It is not good public policy to leave a clause in a Bill that will lead to doubt.  I suggest it would make very little difference, from the Minister's point of view, if he would at least add the words &ldquo;in the view of the commissioners what would be an equitable price having regard to market value&rdquo; or something like that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Market value is subject to fluctuations.  I am trying to get away from the controversy as between market value and market price. Deputies on the benches behind the Minister have proved conclusively that the two were the same.  The Minister holds otherwise.  I am not going to attempt to word it myself but the idea is that you should get the factor of equity into the definition as a yardstick and help to the commissioners in forming their opinion and in trying to check fluctuations which take place from time to time in market price.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand how it is that we have three ex-Ministers for Lands sitting on the Opposition Benches at the present moment, because some one or other of them was responsible for the 1939 Act.  A discussion has ranged round the difference between market value and market price <Col N="1001" /> here all day and yesterday as well. Surely the responsible Minister in 1939 who brought in that Act realises what market value means.  That leaves us on this side of the House under the impression that the remainder of his colleagues over there are not serious about the main idea behind this Bill, which is the solution of the problem of congestion.</P>
      <P>I should like to make a few remarks on the question of market value and market price.  I do not want to see anyone getting an inflated price for land.  Where I would mention market price would be, for instance, in relation to the purchase of a farm of land in this country by a non-national who would be in a position to pay a huge sum of money for it.  What he would pay would be market price.  But does anyone suggest that the Land Commission should turn round and pay him market price&mdash;the same as he gave for that land&mdash;when they are acquiring it from him?  He should only get what we have in this Bill&mdash;market value. That, to my mind, is the difference between market value and market price.  I think it should be borne in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the section is clearly set out in the section. We do not want the State to be mulcted on the double in relation to certain expenditure which the State has already undergone&mdash;in other words, that the State, having gone to certain expenditure on, say, bogs or other <Col N="1002" /> types of land, will not be asked to pay again for improvements which it has carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it from the Minister that the idea of introducing this section is to deal with bogs which have been improved by being taken over by county councils, and that have been drained, during the emergency? Is that what is behind the section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The idea is that where the State has improved something, particularly during the emergency, and thereby enhanced the value, the State, acting through the Land Commission, will not be asked to pay an enhanced price for the enhancement which the State brought about by previous expenditure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to the section.  It is quite possible that a good deal of State money has been spent on a particular farm and that amenities have been provided as a result of that expenditure to meet a national emergency and to serve a great number of people&mdash;amenities which are altogether beyond the needs of the farm as a farm.  Is it the intention, in this section, when the price is fixed&mdash;market price or market value&mdash; to deduct the cost of the expenditure and to make an assessment of the value of the work done to the farm? Are you going to deduct from the price fixed the full State expenditure or are you going merely to allow that the result of the State expenditure has been a certain benefit to the farm as a farm and not consider it as a bog which supplied a great number of people during the emergency?  There is a big difference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>

I suspected that it was&mdash;this matter of improvement work done on bogs&mdash;on reading the section, but I was not quite sure until the Minister <Col N="1003" /> informed the House.  Deputies, and particularly Deputies from the West, will remember that where bogs were compulsorily taken over under Emergency Powers (No. 310) Order, 1944, the tenants' rates were increased, and their valuations were increased, ranging from a rate of 5/- increase in some cases to £25, depending upon the increased letting value as a result of the county council taking over these bogs.  These unfortunate people, in many instances where they had bogs&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg the Minister's pardon.  I doubt that he will find, on consulting his officials, that he is correct.  The valuation is based on the letting value.  Their valuations have been increased throughout the length and breadth of this land as a result of their bogs being taken over and of their getting money out of the bogs during the war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that they could appeal against their valuations, but this is a section which says that they are going to be deprived&mdash;that is, if these farms are taken over with bogs that have been developed during the emergency&mdash;of the increased market value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am telling the Minister that these people have been paying in their rates for that increased value.  They have been paying, if their bogs had been improved, in increased taxation since the bogs were taken over.  It is quite true that if the bogs are not let they can appeal against the valuation put upon them during the emergency, and it will probably be reduced but what is the principle of depriving these people of whatever benefits of developments there were, because these people <Col N="1004" /> have been paying for it as the Minister well knows, particularly in County Mayo?  It is true, of course, that under the last section the Minister has left the question of market value in the air, but surely if a man has a bog that is a valuable asset to him he should be entitled to compensation for it under whatever definition the Land Commission will now give market value.  The tenant has been paying in rates for this development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The development was the result of some drainage done where the county council entered and cut more turf on his bog.  They were paying him so much on the amount of turf they cut out of his bog.  In addition to developing his bog, they took quite a lot of his turf away.  In many cases, as a matter of fact, they went too far. Again I would point out to the Minister, and the Minister should know it himself, that where county councils took over bogs they were trying to carry out a particular job at the moment.  They were not doing it in a methodical or planned way.  They went into that portion of the bog which was most accessible and in a number of cases they destroyed the bog because their object was to produce as much as they possibly could within a limited time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to reconsider the section.  As a result of the county council going in on these bogs the owners had to pay increased rates and, if there was some drainage done, they should not be deprived of the benefit of that now.  I do not want the Land Commission to go on the principle, when a price is being determined, however it is going to be determined, that they can deduct from the purchase price to be paid to the unfortunate farmer, the amount of money expended by the State five, six, seven or eight years ago on the development of that bog.  I think it would be grossly unfair if that were done and I should like the Minister between now and the Report Stage to consider inserting some safeguard against such a possibility.  There may be some <Col N="1005" /> other matters which the Minister's advisers have in mind in connection with this section but the first thing that strikes me is the question of the bogs in the county from which both the Minister and I come.  If it applies to this section only the Minister would be well advised to withdraw it.  Otherwise it may create a hardship on people from whom land, including bog, is being acquired.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately the bogs in Mayo are practically non-existent at the moment as the Deputy must be well aware, at least bogs available for Land Commission purposes.  He must be well aware of the clamour that exists in that county for bogs from which turf can be produced for household purposes. The whole area from Cong to some miles north of Castlebar has been for the past few years practically without any plot from which a farmer could get his annual supply of turf.  I do not know whether the Deputy is aware that this section merely converts into permanent legislation an Emergency Powers Order passed by his own Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not putting it in here because it is something that is convenient and handy but, mind you, the Deputy, when his Party was in power, was not quite so vocal on this matter as he is to-day.  I want to be fair and just to the taxpayers and on the other hand to the people from whom we are acquiring land.  In cases where the Land Commission will be acquiring bogs, on which huge sums of money were expended, and where these bogs are allowed to go back again into the position where they are not being used, I do not know what about the justice of spending a huge sum of money in development by the State and then asking the State to pay an enhanced value for them.  I cannot see any justice in that.  The Deputy has not convinced me that the insertion of this section in the Bill is wrong.  I shall certainly consider between now and the Report Stage if something can be done about it but at the moment he has not convinced me that it is wrong <Col N="1006" /> to adopt this line of action.  I think the Emergency Powers Order was right in the first instance.  I do not want to say anything now that would be unfair or injurious to any group of persons in the State but we must remember that the State consists of a number of citizens, such as the Deputy and myself upon whom taxes are leviable in various forms and we are entrusted with the responsibility of seeing that these moneys are expended for the public good.  Deputies certainly are not empowered to squander these moneys by any means.  They must observe common justice and common sense in dealing with them.  Most of these bogs were improved and the rates were increased on them during the emergency under the Valuation Acts.  The valuation was increased according to the income of the owner, not according to the amount of improvement carried out.  The increased valuation was based on the income of the owner.  If the valuation was unfair, the owner of the bog could get a reduction if he could prove that his total income from the bog was less than that assessed by the Commissioners of Valuation.  It was not on account of the improvement work carried out on the bog that the valuation was increased; it was based on the actual income or the assessed income.  I am not convinced that there is anything wrong in the section.</P>

      <P>There was a complaint that certain people from whom land was acquired by the Land Commission actually owed money to the Land Commission when the transaction was completed. That complaint was made about one farm in County Meath.  The Land Commission purports to take over a farm with a bog attached on which certain moneys have been spent by the State during the emergency. Are all the moneys expended by the State to be deducted from the price of that land when the Land Commission enters into a discussion for acquisition with the owner?  Are you going to deduct all the State expenditure on that farm from the price you will give the farmer when you are taking it? Remember, that will bring up a situation such as existed in County Meath. <Col N="1007" /> It is a simple question and we should get an answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister misunderstood the whole point of my argument. I did say that the valuation of these bogs would be increased on the basis of their increased letting value during the emergency, but that is not the point.  The point is that these people paid increased rates for the bogs while they were so let.  Since they were so let, Bord na Móna did not continue with the lettings and the people are back to where they were before turf production was taken on as a national project.  Many of these bogs are vacant now.  My difficulty is that the Minister deliberately refused to define market value and here we have a section which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;in fixing the price or compensation on the acquisition or resumption under those Acts and notwithstanding any other provision of this or any other Act, no account shall be taken of, or compensation allowed in respect of, any such increase in value.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The position will be that the Land Commission inspector or auctioneer or valuer will come down, because, I take it, the system is going to be the same. This gentleman whom nobody knows will come down and examine the land to be acquired by the Minister.  He will get his figures cut and dry from the county council office or Bord na Móna, whoever was operating the bog, and they will say that the development of the bog cost £2,000 or £3,000 and his compensation will accordingly be reduced in proportion to the capital expenditure laid out by Bord na Móna or the county council during the emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the difficulty under this section and I do not see why the section should be here at all.  I questioned the Minister if it referred only to bogs. If it does refer only to bogs and deals with bogs taken by county councils during the emergency, then I suggest the Minister should reconsider the matter before the Report Stage.  It would be absolutely unfair to an owner in 1950 or 1951, the man who is now <Col N="1008" /> back on his bog since Bord na Móna gave it up, if his land is being acquired, that some such sum should be deducted as will represent the amount expended from the point of view of expediency in the main during the emergency by Bord na Móna or the county council.</P>
    <P>If this section remains that amount will have to be taken into consideration by the Land Commission valuer and the definition of market value being left in the air, we will be back to the practice of the Land Commission valuer being sent down and this is one of the matters he will have to inquire into when inspecting holdings.  He will have to ask was this bog taken over during the emergency, were there roads made and was there drainage carried out. He will have to find out the capital expenditure and he will promptly deduct a proportionate share of that from the figure which he will report to the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>Then why is this section here?  If this section deals only with land acquired under the Emergency Powers Order of 1944, if it deals solely with bogs, will the Minister justify this section being in the Bill?  By whom will these matters be taken into consideration unless by Land Commission inspectors for the purpose of deducting from the owner some portion of what would be otherwise given as value?  I do not see any justification for the section.  If the Minister says it deals with other matters, I am prepared to accept that, but if it deals with bogs taken by county councils during the emergency then that section should not in justice and equity be in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I wish to correct the impression that I think Deputy Moylan has wrongly drawn from the section.  As I understand it, its purpose is, with regard to any land or bog acquired under the particular Emergency Powers Order mentioned, if any public moneys have been spent on that property during the period covered by the Order and if, as a result of the expenditure, the value of the land has gone up by X. pounds, when the land is acquired now under this Bill no <Col N="1009" /> account will be taken of the enhanced value of the X. pounds.  It does not mean, as Deputy Moylan seems to think, that from the compensation price there shall be deducted the entire money spent.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy O'Higgins has got my point.  I want to ensure that whatever consideration is taken of the enhanced value of the farm or bog, the owner will not be put in the position that we have had in some cases recently, where the owner of the bog, when the Land Commission acquired it, owed money to the Land Commission.  If all the expenditure was deducted from the compensation that might well be so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Morrissey) Daniel Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Morrissey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Bill be now read a Second Time.  It has two main purposes, one the making of further advances to Mianraí, Teoranta, for work on the Slievardagh coalfield, and secondly, to provide for the payment of money to the company to enable them to purchase land and mineral rights in an area where an approved scheme of minerals exploration is being carried out at present at the expense of the State.  Deputies are aware, of course, that the company is at present financed to a maximum of £50,000 under the existing legislation, and that during the war they were producing coal at Ballynunty.  The coal was of rather inferior quality.  In February, 1948, the company decided to cease production at Ballynunty.  They then decided to open up at a place called Copper, near Ballingarry.  They felt that, in that new area beside the village of Ballingarry, there were better prospects, and they carried out boring operations, which were designed to test the extent and quality of the coal in that part of the coalfield.  They obtained expert advice, and after certain local inspections and borings, they were satisfied that there were pretty good prospects in that particular area. It was estimated that the cost of bringing the mine there at Ballingarry to <Col N="1011" /> full production of 100 tons of anthracite a day would be about £50,000.  We were advised that the proposition represented a fair mining risk.</P>
      <P>The Government considered the proposal, and they decided to authorise the company to proceed with the opening of the new mine.  When work commenced on the 1st September, 1948, about £6,000 had been advanced to the company for expenditure in cleaning up the old workings at Ballynunty, leaving a balance of £44,000 available under the Act of 1947, for the new operations.  It was estimated by the company that, through the use of plant from the old workings, the balance of £44,000 would suffice for the workings at the new area.  They also estimated that coal production from the new mine should commence in July, 1949, and that a production of 250 tons a week should be reached before the end of 1949.  Unfortunately these expectations were not realised.  If they had been the company would have had revenue from the sale of coal by the end of 1949, to supplement the amount available under the statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plan of operations at Ballingarry was to drive two tunnels, a distance of about 250 yards through rock to reach the coal seam, but unfortunately the company, in driving these tunnels, encountered extremely difficult and unfavourable conditions underground. It will be appreciated that in mining operations such as this it is difficult, if not impossible to foresee what the underground conditions are likely to be.  In any case the unexpected difficulties which were encountered not only delayed the company in reaching the coal seam until September, 1949, but substantially increased the cost of the work.  Consequently, the company informed me that the balance of the moneys available under the Act of 1947 would not be sufficient to enable them to bring the mine at Ballingarry to the point when they anticipated it would be profit-earning.  They have estimated that they will require the limit on advances laid down by that Act to be extended by a further £38,000 to enable them to meet the cost of work at the new mine until the 1st <Col N="1012" /> September, 1951, by which date they expect the mine will be self-supporting. Part of this additional sum will be used to purchase capital equipment for the mine, including a coal-washing plant, the use of which would render more readily saleable the coal raised from the mine.</P>
    <P>The directors of the company have assured me that the expenditure of this further sum of £38,000 will suffice to bring the Ballingarry mine to the stage when it will be profit-earning.  Production of coal has commenced, but it will take the company about another 18 months to bring the mine to the stage of full production when the output will be about 100 tons of anthracite a day. The House will appreciate that until production on this scale has been reached and maintained over a period, it is difficult to say with certainty whether receipts from sales will exceed the over-all cost of production so as to leave a margin of profit.  The quality of the coal, prevailing wage rates, the cost of raw materials, and the general supply position of anthracite are, of course, the main factors which will affect production costs and selling prices when the mine is in full production.</P>
    <P>These factors cannot be determined precisely at present, and, in the circumstances, I do not think that the House would expect me to give an assurance, at this stage, that the expenditure of this further sum of £38,000 will enable the company to put the Ballingarry mine on a profit-earning basis which would secure repayment of the advances made from the Exchequer.  It should not be assumed from my reluctance to give such an assurance that I am in any way pessimistic.  I want to stress the fact that in this, as in all mining undertakings, there is a large element of risk, and to point out that if there was a guarantee, or even a reasonable expectation, that profits could be earned by mining coal at Slievardagh, private enterprise would probably undertake the risk themselves.</P>
    <P>The company have already achieved an output of 100 tons a week.  They have spent so far about £44,000 on the work.  There are now no funds left, <Col N="1013" /> under the Act of 1947, which could be advanced to the company to allow them to continue the work and they require a further £38,000 to bring the mine to the stage of full production.  I think that it is only reasonable to allow the company to complete the job it was given to do.  The only alternative to providing additional funds would be to close down the mine.  I was not prepared to recommend that course to the Government, and therefore I am bringing in this Bill.  There are at present about 85 men employed at Ballingarry, and it is anticipated that the company will employ from 220 to 250 men when the mine is in full production.</P>
    <P>I am advised that at present money may not be paid to the company under the Minerals Company Act, 1947, for the purchase of land and mineral rights.  Section 3 of this Bill is designed to amend sub-section (2) of Section 5 of the Act of 1947 to permit of the payment of money to the company for this purpose.  This amendment is necessary in order that the company may be enabled to purchase mineral rights, etc., in the areas where substantial expenditure is being incurred on exploratory work, and it is desirable that the company should have secure title in order that any benefits resulting from the exploratory work embarked upon at State expense should accrue to the State.</P>
    <P>The Bill covers these two points, the main point being to extend the provision of £50,000 to a sum of £88,000 the £38,000 extra being required to enable the mine at Ballingarry to be brought into full production.  As I say, I expect that will be reached in about 18 months' time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very disappointing to learn that the company has not been able to bring the Slievardagh colliery to a profit-earning stage with the expenditure of the £50,000 capital provided for it under the 1947 Act.  The difference between the amount considered necessary then to develop the mine at Copper and bring it into full production and the amount now estimated can hardly be satisfactorily explained merely upon the basis of the delay in starting operations there. <Col N="1014" /> Either the original estimate was wrong, and it was the company's own estimate, or else their operating costs have been higher than was calculated in 1947.  The delay in starting work was, no doubt, a contributing cause of the unsatisfactory situation.</P>
      <P>I gather from what the Minister has now said that some £6,000 of the £50,000 was, in fact, used in cleaning-up operations, presumably mainly intended to keep the staff employed during the period before the work at Copper began.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  It was in cleaning up and disposing of a residue of coal and removing a lot of machinery from the Ballynunty to the new mine at Ballingarry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from expressing disappointment that the capital cost of this development is substantially higher than was anticipated and at the rather pessimistic view of the Minister as to the likelihood of the company's getting to the profitable working stage before 1951, if then, we have no objection to the new provisions of this Bill.  I think, however, that the Dáil should have from the Minister some more definite indication of his attitude to this enterprise. That there exist at Slievardagh workable deposits of coal appears to have been established by a number of expert investigations.  Away back in 1934, when the Slievardagh coal deposits were not being worked at all, a firm of mining engineers from Great Britain were employed by the Government to investigate and report on them. The intention, then, however, was to complete the investigation and to make the results of it available to any private interests which might be concerned with the possibilities of investment there.  It was not considered desirable that the State should itself engage in coal-mining activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies who study the Statute Book will know that I have not got any strong theoretical objection to State enterprise in fields where it is necessary to secure useful development and where private enterprise is not likely to be either interested or successful. But that is not the position as far as <Col N="1015" /> coal mining is concerned.  The State is engaged in coal mining as one of the smallest operators in an industry in which there are substantial private interests and, normally, that would be regarded as an undesirable situation. During the period in which this company has been in existence there has been, for one reason or another, a scarcity of coal and, consequently, little element of competition between the coal-producing concerns.  If, however, that situation changed, if circumstances should arise which would bring the Irish coal-mining companies into competition for a restricted market, then clearly the private concerns which are operating without Government subsidy would feel they had a grievance if they lost their market to a company which was backed by the State and had available to it the unlimited capital resources which the State can provide.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the hopes which we entertained in 1934, 1935 and 1936, when the investigations at Slievardagh were proceeding, were not realised. It is true that the expert mining concern, which carried out the investigation, reported that there was available in the Slievardagh area a reserve of some 5,000,000 tons of good quality coal capable of commercial development. Their report, together with the information which they furnished concerning the deposit and their recommendations for its development, was made available in the geological survey section of the Department of Industry and Commerce to any private interests that might be attracted by it.  However, no such private interest materialised and no development took place at Slievardagh until after the war began.  It was in 1941 that the first Slievardagh coal-mining company was established by an Act of the Dáil and it was regarded as an emergency measure.  The coal scarcity, which was very acute all during the war, had begun in 1941 and it was considered desirable then to utilise every possibility of increasing home production. The most immediate possibility was at Slievardagh where there was this known deposit of good quality anthracite coal unworked.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1016" /> The State, therefore, went into this coal-mining business as an emergency measure and the development of the coal measures at Slievardagh was directed with the object of producing the maximum output of coal in the shortest possible period of time.  I explained to the Dáil at that time, and subsequently, that if a private commercial concern undertook the development of these deposits in the manner which would be dictated by good mining practice they would proceed, as recommended by the expert firm which had investigated the area, according to a plan which would not yield any coal for some two years or so after operations commenced.  I took on myself the responsibility of telling the Slievardagh coal-mining company that their task during the war was to get as much coal as possible and told them they could forget about long-term development, even though it was recognised that the method they would use in maximising coal output in the shortest period of time might to some extent militate against the successful commercial development of the deposit on a long-term basis.</P>
    <P>The workings at Ballynunty and Lickfin were begun during the war and, if my recollection is correct, some 60,000 or 70,000 tons of coal in all were produced and marketed as a result of the operations there.  When the war was over the desire of the Government then was to get out of the coal-mining business as quickly as they had got into it, because it was assumed that normal conditions would reappear and we disliked a situation in which the State was engaged in any commercial enterprise in competition with private interests.  We were the more concerned to get out of the coal-mining business because we then contemplated the State undertaking exploratory work in relation to other minerals on a much larger scale than had been attempted previously.  The colliery at Slievardagh was, therefore, advertised for sale and every effort was made to attract private firms to consider the possibility of acquiring it.  However, no acceptable offer was received for the colliery and in 1947 it had to be decided whether the emergency workings there should be terminated or whether the State <Col N="1017" /> should continue operating the collieries for a further period.  The decision was to continue and the decision to continue was based upon the report of the company directors that, with a further investment of £50,000, they could close up these emergency workings and open this new shaft at Copper, which further expert investigations had indicated was likely to be productive of good coal, capable of being mined and sold at a profit.  The report from the company directors decided the Government to provide the £50,000 and, in providing it, it was made clear that the idea was to put the colliery on to a profit-making basis in the hope that at that stage it would be possible to hand it over, on terms satisfactory to the State, to some private firm which would then continue it in operation.</P>
    <P>I think the fact that the seam at Copper has not yet been fully developed and that it is not yet possible for the Minister to say definitely that profitable operation there is possible makes it incumbent on us to continue with the 1947 plan, even though it now means that a further £38,000 has to be provided.  The amount of money already invested by the State in Slievardagh is not of very great significance.  A large part of the amount spent there during the war must be classed as emergency expenditure.  I answered criticism of the cost of production by Mianraí, Teoranta, of coal, phosphate rock and pyrites during the war by pointing out that it was almost impossible to calculate what these essential supplies meant to us during that period and explained that if, in fact, in 1947, we allowed Slievardagh to charge for the coal it was then producing the price which we were paying to get similar coal from abroad, it would not have shown a loss at all.</P>
    <P>In 1947 we wiped out the losses arising from wartime operations and the company started off in that year with a capital liability to the State no greater than the ascertained value of its assets.  The only provision in the 1947 Act for further capital advances to the company was the £50,000 for the Slievardagh development, the £50,000 which has now become £88,000.  I presume that the Minister is satisfied that <Col N="1018" /> the company is working at Slievardagh in the best possible manner; that it has in view the necessity of getting to a stage of profit-earning as early as possible; that they understand it is not practicable for the State to contemplate the continuous investment of money in that enterprise unless a stage can be clearly visualised where the revenue from the sale of coal will equal the cost of mining it.</P>
    <P>It has always been difficult for me to understand what has delayed us getting to that stage.  I again remind the Dáil that there is, according to expert opinion, a substantial reserve of coal there, capable of commercial operation. It is true that the coal proved to be unusually friable&mdash;that is to say, that with the methods of working employed during the war it was difficult to extract it in lumps and a large proportion came out as slack.  That, however, should not be an insuperable difficulty. Coal-mining technique has been developed throughout the world to meet all kinds of mining conditions and, while during the war the company had to work with make-shift methods and with a large staff of mainly unskilled workers, that stage has now been passed.  The workers have now acquired skill and there should be no difficulty in getting the most suitable equipment for working the type of coal available there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

      <P>Does the Deputy assert that the percentage of slack is entirely due to the method of processing?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That friability was peculiar to one portion of the seam, I understand.  I think the prospects held out for the Copper mine were quite good.  I assume from what the Minister has said that nothing has happened during the course of the operations last year to discredit the optimism with which the company undertook its development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are agreeable to the provision of the additional capital but we should like to feel that the concern is fully conscious of the fact that there is a <Col N="1019" /> limit to the amount that can be provided; that there is special obligation on it to get to profitable working as quickly as possible and that all its officers and directors are exerting themselves energetically to that end. It is necessary to keep emphasising that any mining operation is a gamble. Nobody can know with confidence what success a mining enterprise may achieve.  Because it is a gamble, the profits that come from successful working are usually higher than those earned in normal industry.  But they are probably quite small in relation to the total amount invested in all mining enterprises, successful and otherwise. When a private citizen goes into a mining operation he estimates the capital risk involved.  He provides that amount of money and he goes ahead. If he cannot get a profit when the total estimated expenditure has occurred he stops because his money is gone.  It is that limitation upon private enterprise that often involves it in a loss that might have been avoided if larger capital resources had been available. In the case of the State, however, the risk is the other way around.  There is no limit to the amount of capital the State can provide.  When a mining enterprise is undertaken and proves to be more costly than was at first anticipated, there will always be an irresistible argument in favour of putting more and more money into it in the hope that, as a result, the total amount invested will be recovered.  That knowledge that there is no necessary limit to the amount of money that may be invested by the State, operating amongst the directors and executives of the concern, has an enervating effect unless it is counterbalanced by pressure from the Government to get speedy results.</P>
    <P>To sum up the position, therefore, there is, so far as expert opinion can establish it, a substantial reserve of good quality coal at Slievardagh. Private enterprise has not been attracted to its development, presumably because there are at Slievardagh difficulties of operation that do not exist elsewhere.  The State undertook its development as an emergency <Col N="1020" /> measure during the war and because of the war.  They tried to get out of it when the war was over but they failed to get out of it because the effects of war-time working did not appear to suggest that private enterprise could engage in it there profitably and perhaps for some other reasons.  We therefore decided to put more money into it in another effort to bring it to a stage where it could be profitably worked.  That amount of money has not proved enough.  We have now to provide a substantial additional sum. The Minister was cautious in forecasting that that additional sum would be adequate to bring the concern to a state of profitable working.  We hope it will.  We are prepared to take the risk in approving of expenditure but we want to feel assured that the company have a keen appreciation of their obligations to the State in the matter&mdash; particularly the obligations to work energetically to get to the profit-earning stage quickly and that it is carrying out these operations with competent technical assistance which will minimise the prospects of loss.</P>
    <P>Another section of this Bill deals with the main activities of Mianraí Teoranta.  That company was formed by the amalgamation of the original Slievardagh Coalmines Company and the Minerals Exploration Company which was before the war engaged in the production of pyrites and phosphate rock.  They were amalgamated for reasons of economy and efficiency. However, when the change was made in 1947 it was decided that Mianraí Teoranta would have no other commercial responsibility at all.  The development of Slievardagh was left with it for the purpose of convenience but it was always contemplated that Mianraí Teoranta would concern itself solely with mineral development work and endeavour to locate and develop mineral resources to the point at which they could be leased to private concerns on terms which would recover to the State the amount invested in the exploration and development work.  A plan for mineral development was prepared and the cost of that plan was estimated.  It was hoped to complete it in a fixed period of years and, working <Col N="1021" /> at a uniform rate of development, its cost was reckoned to be £85,000 a year.  The legislation, therefore, provided for non-repayable advances to Mianraí Teoranta of £85,000 a year to complete that mineral exploration and development plan.  That mineral development plan was one of the first things that came under the economy axe of the Minister for Finance when economy was the order of the day and the £85,000 was not provided for the work of the company in 1948.  Later in that year, for whatever reason it does not matter, the Minister for Industry and Commerce intimated that the Government had reviewed that position and was investigating the desirability of proceeding with a much more limited plan confined to the area of Avoca, County Wicklow.</P>
    <P>Avoca, County Wicklow, is a locality in which mineral operations have proceeded with varying fortunes in different periods of history and where it seemed likely that the more highly developed technique of mineral extraction now available would make economic operations which, with the methods of older times, had proved to be uneconomic and where experts had reported that there likely were substantial reserves of ore which the old-time workers had not reached.  In 1949 it was intimated that a decision had been taken upon the future activities of Mianraí Teoranta&mdash;that they were to be confined in their work to the Avoca area and that a plan for the exploration and development of Avoca had been prepared which would involve a total expenditure, over whatever period of time operations were continued, of £120,000.</P>
    <P>There was a further delay in starting that work, due, it was stated, to the difficulties of obtaining equipment and so forth, but presumably the work is on.  I take it, therefore, that any problem that has arisen, necessitating an amendment of the legislation in relation to the acquisition of land or mining rights, exists at Avoca and that the decision taken by the Government to confine the activities of the company to Avoca still holds and that it has no authority or funds to undertake mineral exploration work anywhere <Col N="1022" /> else.  We know that a Swedish company, acting under the authority of the Department of Industry and Commerce, is engaged in exploration work in the gypsum area of Monaghan, but it was never contemplated that Mianraí Teoranta would concern themselves there.  That was the position in 1947 and I understand it is the position still.</P>
    <P>I do not know if we are in order on this Bill, only one small section of which amends the 1947 Act concerning the activities of Mianraí Teoranta in relation to exploration, in discussing the limitations which have been put on its scope and in urging upon the Minister the desirability of giving further consideration to that decision.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair knows that discussions on Estimates are most unsatisfactory, particularly discussions on the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce, which has such a multiplicity of activities, none of which can be discussed adequately.  I would urge that the Minister should bring before his colleagues in the Government the matter of extending the activities of the company into other fields.  It has often been represented as the viewpoint of Deputies on this side of the House that we urged mineral exploration mainly with the idea of laying the ghost of our mineral wealth.  It is true that there are exaggerated views held by some people as to the mineral resources of this country and so long as they are held, there will be an urge to have investigations carried out.  It is not true, however, that the decision to embark upon a substantial programme of development was merely due to a desire to dissipate any such illusions. There is good reason to believe that there exist in various parts of the country mineralised areas which are capable of being the foundation of successful workings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that the reports of the geological survey and other investigators of a similar character cannot be <Col N="1023" /> conclusive.  The geological survey works on surface indications and other inconclusive methods of exploration, and can only point out to the development company the places which should get its attention.  The only effective method of mineral exploration is by boring under ground and it was to do that work that the Mineral Development Company was set up.  It is particularly necessary for us that some State organisation should do that work, if we are to have any mineral development. Our mineral wealth is not very great.  It is not likely to attract the capital which is available for mineral development in other countries.  The big risk which private enterprise undertakes in any mineral development activity is that the bulk of its capital resources will be exhausted in the preliminary exploration and development stage and that the resources employed at that stage will never be recouped. We have, therefore, always taken the line for a number of years that private enterprise should be helped in mineral development work by the State, originally through the form of grants and latterly, it was intended, through the working of Mianraí Teoranta&mdash;helped in meeting the cost of that exploration work, site preparation and development of deposits to the stage at which mining could begin.</P>
    <P>In the years before the war, a considerable amount of mineral activity, not of a very important kind but giving not inconsiderable employment, was promoted by means of grants for site clearances and grants for the removal of overburden.  It was made available through the Employment Schemes Vote.  A number of slate quarries and other stone quarries were opened, most of which, though not all, survived.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately not the slate quarries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  I think that the problem which affected these quarries was not so much that deposits of slates were not found to be there but that they yielded a slate so small in size that the amount of timber to roof a house with them was very much <Col N="1024" /> greater and, consequently, more expensive, than with slates of normal size. Of course that shut them out completely during the war when timber was the scarcest of all building materials.  Even then, in the case of some of the smaller slates there was a possibility of an export trade because, whatever objection there was to them on the ground of cost, there are many architects who think they are by far the most attractive type of roof and their durability is excellent.  I mention that by way of illustration of the benefits that might accrue.  In that particular case the State was not altogether concerned with the prospect of long-term development, as the result of its expenditure.  If we were providing money for unemployment relief schemes, it was felt that that money could be spent as usefully in that direction as in certain other directions, and if there was a prospect of permanent employment under that long-term development for the locality, that was an added advantage.  That type of expenditure is not being undertaken now.  I say that Mianraí Teoranta should investigate these known mineral deposits and do that type of development work that would bring them to the stage where private enterprise might be interested.  It would thus hold for the State the financial benefit of any successful exploration work which it was able to undertake.</P>
      <P>If that job is going to be done, it will not be done within the financial limits now fixed.  Avoca may be explored within these limits.  It may be that there are private mineral rights in Avoca which it is desirable to acquire now so that the problem of title will not arise, if the exploration work is successful and the Department has to attract private interests to the development of the deposit.  We have no objection to the Minister having that power, but I want to take advantage of the occasion on which he asked it to urge on him and the Government the reconsideration of its whole attitude to this matter of mineral development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were appalled by the original decision of the Minister of Finance to stop it.  We were not entirely relieved by his later decision to permit it to <Col N="1025" /> resume on a limited scale.  If there is any case in logic for continuing to work at Avoca, there is as good a case for continuing it in the other known mineralised areas throughout the country, in Cork, Tipperary and Sligo in particular.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to give us some indication now or on his Estimate that the Government is looking into the matter again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I must be a very ingenuous sort of individual, because I constantly find myself amazed at Deputy Lemass's capacity for surprising me, and his approach to this very short and simple measure, I must confess, did surprise me.  The cautious and almost parsimonious attitude that he brought to his examination of this measure was one which I would have been, were I a reader solely of the <i>Irish Press</i>, inclined to associate with, say, Deputy McGilligan, the Minister for Finance.  I do not think that that cautious approach, while there may be ample justification for it, is one which we in this country can afford in examining questions like this.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed at Deputy Lemass's failure to balance the advantage of retaining at home the men who are employed at present in the Slievardagh coalfield and those who may be employed in the future against the sum proposed to be expended.  I do not think that that is an attitude of mind that we can afford in this country.  It amazed me to hear it coming from Deputy Lemass.  I must confess I have found myself in agreement with criticisms coming sometimes from that side of the House as against undue caution on the Government's side.  Deputy Lemass was the last one I would have expected to bring that attitude to bear on this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this is the type of Bill that should be welcomed from all sides of the House.  The only criticism I would make of it is that it is a very minor Bill about an undertaking engaged in in a very minor way.  The criticism was made&mdash;I do not know whether one would be right in calling it a criticism &mdash;by Deputy Lemass&mdash;it was one of his <i>obiter dicta</i>&mdash;that this was not the type <Col N="1026" /> of undertaking in which he thought the State should engage.</P>

      <P>Even on that broader plane I join issue with the Deputy.  I am no believer in a slavish imitation of what is being done elsewhere, but I think there are occasions when we can learn.  I think the development of our fuel resources, coal mining or otherwise, is a programme which should properly be undertaken where possible by the State rather than by private enterprise.  I know that probably there are very few of us in this House who are not always ready to man the breach in defence of the sacred rights of private enterprise.  Private enterprise is deserving of all the encouragement we can give, but, in so far as coal mining or any other field of industrial activity is concerned, I do not see how we in this House are compelled to place before ourselves the maxim, &ldquo;No, no, the State must not interfere there; perhaps at some future date some benevolently-minded people, some well-intentioned people or commercially acute people, will come along and develop privately that particular field of industry&rdquo;.  However, let me pass from that.</P>

      <P>Let us take it at the lowest.  I am basing this on the potential employment figures that have been given.  I am assuming that the weekly production can be doubled.  Can the Minister give an assurance to the House that there will be no failure on the part of his Department to ensure that a market will be readily found for whatever coal is produced?  To my mind, it is idle to talk of the development of our mineral resources and of the development of coal mining, whether in Arigna or Slievardagh, or the machine-winning of turf unless we are going to ensure that whatever is produced is going to replace imported fuels.  I would be glad if the Minister could see his way to enlighten us on that when replying.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass said that good mining practice was ignored in favour of a short-term development policy. That is understandable in the conditions which then obtained.  I would urge the Minister that no considerations of showing results either to the public or this House should deter him from approaching this on a long-term basis.  The Minister should not be any way shy about coming to this Dáil to ask for additional sums of money for development if such additional sums are, in his opinion, necessary.</P>
      <P>I am not quite clear whether the advances that were made to this company have been made at any given rate of interest, whether it has been a commercial rate of interest or a lower rate. Certainly, money advanced for purposes of this nature should be advanced at a lower rate, because I think we are always entitled to take into consideration not only the purely book-keeping aspect of an undertaking of this nature but the human and the national aspect of it: that we are doing something which is helping to keep many of our young people at home and provide employment for them without compelling them to emigrate to obtain it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the fact that the mineral exploration scheme was not merely for laying the ghost of our mineral wealth.  I am not qualified to <Col N="1029" /> express an expert opinion on whether our mineral wealth is a ghost or not. In so far as I have an opinion, it is not. It would be good business, if that were a ghost, to investigate it thoroughly and lay it once and for all.  I am quite satisfied that it is no such ghost, and that a proper exploration of our resources will show that there are substantial mineral resources here capable of being commercially developed.</P>
    <P>A reference was also made by Deputy Lemass to which I take exception.  He referred to the nature of the coal.  I may be completely wrong in this, but I think we in this country have taken all our standards in these things from the other side.  In other words, good coal to us is not good coal unless it is best Orrel or best Wigan.  The American people have been using soft coal with a much greater degree of friability.  As far as I understand, in the United States the varieties of coal mines are very numerous.  I do not think it should be a criticism of the potential value of this scheme that one particular seam or any portion of the mine field contained coal of an unduly friable nature.</P>

The people in charge of such work, where they have State resources behind them, will naturally find rather more difficulty in achieving efficiency and securing speed than a private company.  That seems to be something inherent in State projects, or projects which are supported by the State.  I just mention this matter now in order to remind the Minister that, in voting a sum of money for this company, his responsibility does not end there.  He should take an interest thereafter in seeing that the purpose for which this money is voted is vigorously and energetically prosecuted, and efficiently so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as coal development is concerned, the voting of money and the developing of a project known to the extent to which this project is known, as the Minister has said, is unobjectionable and, in fact, is commendable and for that reason, this Bill is to be welcomed.  There is, however, a further side to the situation&mdash;that there is, perhaps, a certain urgency in the present situation about the development of such resources.  At any rate, we do know that there is coal there. There is difficulty perhaps in certain regards.  The anthracite may be difficult to extract and there may be wastage due to slack, etc.  It is not only important to get the full benefit of that development at the moment, but it is <Col N="1031" /> also important from the point of view of the future.  It is important from the point of view of the future no matter how you prophesy in regard to the future.</P>
    <P>If there is a period of stability before us as economic circumstances are, having regard to our present sources of coal and the financial situation of England, etc., quite apart from the question of employment already referred to, it is obviously advantageous to us to develop our coal resources such as they are to a pitch where they can be economic.  Even if that cannot be done, it is worth trying now from the point of view of external trade, from the point of view of making ourselves self-reliant in our economy and, to that extent, making the problem of balancing things very easy.  It is important from considerations arising from the conditions of our principal supplier of coal.  From all these points of view, whether we are going into an era of stability or instability, these considerations justify the Minister in what he is doing.  But there is something more to it than that.  Supposing, as many people see it and certainly the indications are there, that there may be a seriously critical time before us in which the supply situation can become difficult, then, when you add that to these other considerations, there is an unanswerable case to getting ahead with this job as quickly and as efficiently as possible.  In fact, not only is it necessary in my view to prosecute what the Minister has directly in mind to a conclusion and to its fullest extent, but it is also necessary to keep in mind the possibilities of being thrown back virtually completely upon your resources in this regard, and that indicates further exploration, further forethought, further planning; it indicates the getting of mining equipment, such as is necessary, in advance.</P>
    <P>I have in mind a matter of mineral development which is relevant to this company directly but, for certain reasons, I prefer not to discuss it at the moment.  But, from information that I can consider as reliable, it is <Col N="1032" /> apparent that one of the difficulties facing this company during the war in some of its mining operations, and even after the war, was the securing of suitable equipment even to enable the job to be done at all, but certainly to be done efficiently and in the most direct and beneficial manner.  That situation could arise again.  It could arise in a critical situation which is actually short of anything like war.  It could arise, for instance, in a situation that can develop in 1952, quite apart from postulating actual hostilities. Now, in such a case, whether it is from economic or financial or other reasons, if difficulties should arise it would be criminal for us when there is yet time not to provide as far as we can by forethought and getting the necessary plant and material for that development. In other words, not only should the Minister consider what he is doing here, this specific development for this coalfield, but he should also ensure that any other possible coalfields are explored and developed to the extent that will enable them to be quickly developed if required, even if it may not be possible economically to develop them in relation to ordinary peace-time standards.  You should see that the plans are prepared, that the necessary surveying and development are done and that plant will be available for that purpose so that there will be no time lag.</P>
    <P>Again referring to the matter which I do not want to discuss, it is apparent that in some of these mining activities during the last war since this company or its predecessor came into existence, there were unavoidable but serious time lags between taking over and going into production; in other words, between embarking on the project and a substantial output.  Lessons can be learned from all these things and now is the time to learn them and be in a position to say that, if the occasion arises, not only is the lesson learned, but that it can be demonstrated that we are in a position to obviate any difficulties that were met before.</P>
    <P>The Chair has ruled that this is not the proper occasion for a general discussion of our mineral resources.  The same remarks that I have made in regard <Col N="1033" /> to coal would, however, practically apply to a number of minerals. We have not extensive deposits.  I am afraid that I cannot be as optimistic about our resources as Deputy Lehane. On the other hand, there are valuable resources there.  Whatever their peace-time potentiality may be, their value as an emergency resource or in times of stringency is inestimable.  They vary from such things as metal to lead and copper; even, if you are put to it, a certain amount of iron&mdash;very uneconomic, of course.  But, certainly there appears to be some lead and copper there and also some phosphate and coal as well as pyrites, which is a very interesting question and is in point under this Bill.  During the war the question of sulphuric acid arose.</P>

      <P>It is because there is a reference to Avoca in it and this deals with Avoca.  Avoca pyrites were available.  There were, however, considerable difficulties in making immediately available plant for producing sulphuric acid.  Sulphuric acid is a very important industrial chemical.  It is a very important chemical in the manufacture of fertiliser and it is, therefore, of paramount importance to the country.  Again there is a lesson to be learned from our experiences during the war years and our efforts to meet the deficiency that existed from our own resources.  At that time there was not a sufficient development or a sufficient supply available.  We should ensure now that, if such a situation arises again, these materials will be available, apart altogether from the obvious advantage of relying on one's own materials and using one's own labour in their development rather than importing them from abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is accepted as it stands. The only criticism, if any, to be made is that it does not go far enough.  I would urge upon the Minister to ensure that such moneys as are voted now are in fact adequately, properly and efficiently expended so as to give the best return in the shortest possible time.  The Vote of the House should represent the first stage in action taken. Votes, speeches and explanations <Col N="1034" /> matter not a jot.  The important thing is to get the job done and we join our exhortations to the Minister to see the job is done.  Viewing the problem from the point of view of insurance against a possible emergency and the potential value of our own assets at such a time, apart altogether from ordinary economic and financial considerations which might impel us towards mineral development, I ask the Minister to see that this urgent matter receives not only prompt and vigorous attention, but a vigorous attention with a driving force behind it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSheehan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that we are all anxious to see the mineral resources of the country fully developed. Deputy Lemass told us that the experts hold that there is a deposit in the region of 5,000,000 tons of coal at Slievardagh.  The Minister said there might be 140,000,000 tons.  Even if there are only 50,000,000 tons a similar quantity imported from England to-day would cost something in the region of £30,000,000.  If that amount of money was spent on Slievardagh it would be money well spent.  Any money in circulation in the country is money well spent.  Deputy Lehane appealed to the Minister to ensure that there would be a ready market for this coal.  There is a ready market.  It is impossible to get similar coal from England since the end of the war.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister should bend all his energies to encouraging both private and State enterprise in the development of our mineral resources.  I am a coal merchant in the City of Cork.  In the last three or four months we have found it very difficult to get coal in Cork.  A cargo came in last week which was made up of several different types of coal.  The Minister should explore the position.  Money spent inside the State on the resources of the State is money well spent.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sheehan referred to a cargo of coal which came into Cork last week.  That cargo had to be divided over a number of coal merchants.  It is impossible to get coal from England at the moment and I understand we have to pay dearly for what we do get.  We should not be fearful about spending money on the development of our mineral resources. The time has come when we must take a serious view of any lack of encouragement towards mineral development.</P>

Where there is a possibility of mineral development and where there is a possibility of establishing an industry which will help us to provide our own essential commodities and employment, that development should be assisted and subsidised to the fullest extent.  I agree with Deputy Con Lehane that that type of development cannot be left to private enterprise.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sweetman said that this section was to provide that every £ of increased valuation due to the activities of the State under Emergency Powers (No. 310) Order, 1944, was to be taken into account by way of reduction of the market value of farms to be taken over by the Land Commission.  There is one apology due by the Minister and one by Deputy Sweetman and by other Deputies who supported a Bill by the then Deputy Mulcahy&mdash;now the Minister for Education&mdash;a couple of years ago to ensure that the valuation of bog lands of this kind would not be increased.  They objected very strenuously to bog lands, taken over by county councils for the duration of the emergency, being increased by the operation of the county councils requesting the Commissioner of Valuation to revalue the lands. Revaluation by the Commissioner of Valuation would only result in a very small percentage of the annual rent being taken from the farmer who let his lands under this Order to the county council.  But the Coalition <Col N="1037" /> Government of to-day have so changed their minds that, instead of ignoring the increased valuation, as they then wanted, they insist, as Deputy Sweetman said, that every £ additional valuation created by the State should be taken back.  I think that some apology is due from the members of the Coalition Government who supported Deputy Mulcahy on that occasion for the action that they then took and not only an apology to the House but an apology to the country for the manner in which they deceived the people.</P>

It will be very interesting for those who are interested in taxation generally to know if we are again going to have a repetition of the piling up of compensation for damages, compensation for disturbance, market price and market value and the cession of annuities.  Is this the last lap?  Are we going to have this acquisition of land as the final transaction or when we have acquired this land and given it away to an allottee, is it proposed again within a dozen years to take that land from him and give it to somebody else?

      <P>I want to be quite generous, like the Minister, with the people who are afflicted by congestion. I also realise, as a practical man, that this heavy commitment of taxation which we must undergo in our endeavour to solve that problem must have some finality.  We cannot be for ever taking land from one allottee in one generation, giving it to another, and repeating the process in another generation.  If we are going to solve this problem of congestion inside 12 years, will this land which is now to be taken over be subject to another acquisition within another dozen years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I reply shortly to the points raised by the Deputy? The Deputy asks if there is ever to be finality in the acquisition of land.  If we are ever to be serious about solving the problem of congestion&mdash;and I think all sides of the House are serious, while Deputies might have different views as to when finality is to be reached&mdash;it is clear that it must be reached some time.  The problem of congestion arose as a result of a system under which this country was misgoverned for a couple of hundred years.  That has resulted in overcrowding in some parts, the parts which we call congested districts, and any Government that engages in the work of easing that pressure is doing excellent work.  Let me say that it is work of social benefit.  That is fact No. 1.</P>
      <P>The question then is asked: Can land be bought, rebought, and rebought again?  It is not anticipated that that will happen but it is quite possible that it may.  Let me say that it is possible but very improbable.  I wonder what Deputy Moylan had in mind in putting down this amendment, because I take it the amendment is intended as a safeguard against something that may happen under this Bill or against something that has happened under previous Land Acts.  Let me assure Deputy Moylan that there is nothing in the Bill proposing to do what would be a very silly thing&mdash;that is, to impose on incoming allottees of land acquired under this Bill an annuity which would be unfavourable to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1042" /> I think I said on the Second Reading of the Bill that the cardinal principle to be followed in determining an annuity is what the land will bear in a bad or a good year.  The bad year is taken as the level because it is quite obvious that to fix an annuity which the tenant could pay easily in a good year but could not pay in a bad year, would be nothing short of madness.  You have no business putting on any man's back a load greater than he can carry.  He will fall under it.</P>
    <P>If there was any attempt to interfere with the annuity&mdash;and it is not the desire or the intention under this Bill&mdash;it would result in one or other of two things happening.  You would have a pile of arrears mounting up in the Land Commission which the tenants, in all honesty and fair play, could not meet, and the Minister would be forced, having to face such a problem, to revise the annuities if the Dáil was foolish enough to allow an increase; or you would have the allottees who got land and who were able to pay the annuities in the good years finding themselves faced with depressing years and they would fling the land back to the Land Commission and say: &ldquo;Keep your land.&rdquo;  In that event you would also have to revise the annuities.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention, and it is not the advice of the Land Commission officials to make any attempt along the lines which Deputy Moylan's amendment is worded to prevent.  I can tell the Deputy plainly that this is a superflous amendment.  Any Minister who would stray from the path observed all through the years by the Land Commission and who would seek to impose a greater annuity than what allottees who have been getting land are subject to, would be quickly brought to his senses if a depression came along.</P>
    <P>There is no need for the amendment. It is not my intention to do anything like that.  Allottees under the new legislation will get the land at the same favourable annuity as in the past. Reference was made to the taxpayers. I admitted on the Second Reading that we will pay an increased price for acquiring land, and not redeeming the annuities will mean a greater loss on resale than occurred in the past.  But <Col N="1043" /> I said when I was replying that congestion is an evil for which this House, since its formation, has established a Department of State to set right, and I am sure that Deputy Moylan is aware that during the period of office of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government and later of his own Government, the loss on resale has gradually grown up to the sizeable figure which it is now.  I am not concealing that this Bill will aggravate that loss, but whether it will be a serious loss or not I cannot say.</P>

      <P>Yes, and I will explain that.  In the case of any land bought now, you will have to take the market value into consideration, define it any way you like, and it will be bought at an inflated price.  In addition to that, in the creation of new holdings this point has to be considered.  On the new holding a dwelling-house and out-offices have to be erected.  I take it the Land Commission estimate the cost of the erection of the house and out-offices and, according to the present-day cost of the erection of even a medium house, the erection of a Land Commission house and out-offices will be in the region of £1,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone with experience of the Land Commission will understand quite well that the house and out-offices were erected in many instances and the Land Commission figured out that a certain amount of the advance would be placed into that amount to the extent which they considered the holding was capable of carrying.  If the new buildings are to cost over £1,000 and if £300 of that is by way of advance, that will carry with it an annuity at the rate of 4¾ per cent. Will that not bring it to something over £13?  That is not subject to revision. That will not be halved and it has to be taken into consideration with the annuity.  The annuity on the land will be subject to revision, but not the advance that is made and in that way anybody who gets a holding under the present and even under past legislation will not be at all in the favourable position that allottees were in in 1939; they cannot be, and that is why I consider the amendment by Deputy Moylan, the sub-section he wishes to have inserted, is a very sensible and reasonable one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that I do not quite understand what Deputy Moylan had in mind when he put down this amendment.  I do not understand what he means by existing allottees. Does he mean people who purchased under recent Land Purchase Acts?  I would like the Deputy to explain exactly what he means by existing allottees.  We know there are some people whose redemption value is very small.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephTimoney" hpid="Mr. Timoney Mr. Timoney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case then the new sub-section would be meaningless, <Col N="1045" /> because what the Deputy wants in the terms of the section is:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When the land has been acquired under the terms of the section the contractual terms covering the redemption of the land annuity or any other advance by the Land Commission shall not be less favourable to the incoming allottee as those already operating in the case of existing allottees.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is an almost infinite variety of conditions operating in relation to existing allottees.  Some of them are free of annuity altogether; some are nearing the time when the annuity will be paid off, and others have a long way to go.  Therefore, if he is going to take the whole body of them the sub-section, it seems to me, has no meaning at all.  I think if we were to adopt that sub-section there would certainly need to be much greater precision in the wording of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is quite clear and the principle behind it is quite clear.  What I am sure Deputy Moylan and many members of the House have in mind is this, that whatever price may be paid for land the State presumably will subsidise it and give the holdings to the incoming tenants at a rent they can pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That the land can bear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a distinction without a difference.  The point is that when a tenant comes into a holding and he is going to work it, he will be able economically to pay the rent. If the Minister or the Land Commission propose to give the market value of any land that may be acquired under this Bill, it might very well mean that the incoming tenant would not be able to pay the amount when capitalised that he would be required to pay for this acquired land.  Apparently, the practice has been to fix the rent of tenants on the capitalised value of land that has been acquired.  The principle behind this amendment is that, irrespective of what the land may cost, whether an estate costs £5,000, £10,000 or £20,000, the incoming tenant will not have to face his proportionate share of <Col N="1046" /> that amount, but rather that a rent will be fixed which will be fair to him and which he will be able to pay.  We all know that if inflated values for land prevail, it might be uneconomic for an incoming tenant if the whole amount of the capitalised value were put on him. We want to ensure that the incoming tenant will get as fair treatment as he got before this Bill was passed.  I do not know whether the Minister admits this principle or not, but surely there is as much reason in the State subsidising the clearing up of the land slum problem as there is in subsidising the clearing up of the housing problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>We have put down this amendment to ensure that incoming tenants on land acquired under this Bill will not be mulcted in a very heavy rent.  I take it the House is agreed to the principle that congestion is going to be relieved, and that State money is going to be provided for that purpose. We are anxious to ensure that tenants getting a portion of land acquired under this Bill will not have the whole of the costs pushed on them and that they will be placed in a position in which they will be able to meet their rents.  We do not want to have the cost of the acquisition of an estate capitalised and worked out, as it formerly was by the Land Commission, and then made repayable by the tenants by means of an annuity in accordance with the price that was paid for an estate.  I hope the Minister will accept the principle in the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

      <P>What I have gathered from the Minister through all stages of this Bill is that the intention is that land will be allotted at a rent that the land can bear, and so will be a fair rent to the particular allottee. After all, we must take that as being the intention of the Government and <Col N="1047" /> of the Minister, and that it will be the basis on which the Land Commission will work since the Minister has stated that.  Deputy Moylan's amendment seems to prescribe exactly what the Minister says, in fact, will be the case. That being so, I think the amendment is hardly necessary.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moylan put a very serious question to the Minister when he asked him if he intended that this Bill should represent finality.  I do not think the Minister answered that question.  I am sure the Minister intends it to be a final solution of the land problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>However, that is the Minister's idea, that this will be final as far as he is concerned and that it will solve this whole land problem. I think myself that the Minister, however good his intentions are, would be well-advised to consider that this is only a palliative because, even if the Minister is successful in reaching his objective, there may be, as Deputy Moylan has said, a further demand that land allotted under this Bill may be acquired for further subdivision and allocation in the near future.  That is one of the difficulties that confronts us in dealing with this section of the Bill. At the moment, there may be a temporary demand for the division and subdivision of land.  That is a demand that cannot continue, because the more we divide up land the smaller we are making the farms and the less economic they become&mdash;the less able they are to bear the strain of competition or of making a contribution to the nation's economy.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture is providing all kinds of machinery and is educating the people to employ machinery on the land.  A couple of years ago he said that he would like to see the end of the horse.</P>

      <P>I am endeavouring to relate it to our discussion.  The more the combined efforts of the two Ministers succeed in the establishment of what I may call a machine system of agriculture, the less useful these small farms are going to be in the national economy.  That is why I say to the Minister that, however well-intentioned he may be in thinking that this Bill is going finally to solve the land problem, it may have a temporary value for a short period, and that both himself and the Land Commission should consider all the implications there are in the modernisation of agriculture.</P>

      <P>My mind was directed towards this matter by the very sensible question which Deputy Moylan asked in proposing the amendment, and I am sure that Deputy Moylan considered it relevant at the time.  I can see that the Minister is endeavouring to give what I may call a break to the new allottees, to give them a chance.  I think that he must face up to this situation however much of a break he may give them and in the long run I am very doubtful whether it will be helpful or not. However, I think the section includes everything that Deputy Moylan suggests in his amendment and for that reason there is no necessity for the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an old book which most Deputies know which gives a very fair picture of rural Ireland and that is <i>Knocknagow.</i>  A couple of sentences from that book remain in my mind in relation to this particular <Col N="1049" /> amendment.  A Fenian named Phil Morris used the words: &ldquo;I would rather have a good lease under a bad landlord than no lease under the best landlord in the world.&rdquo;  I think that is very sound sense.  The Minister's intentions may be the best in the world, but what objection is there to embodying in the Bill a promise to incoming allottees that they will get a square deal?  I see nothing wrong with it.</P>
      <P>The Minister, I think, accepts in principle the view embodied in the amendment; I think Deputy Cowan does anyhow.  If we do accept it, and I think we should, we are now proposing to resume acquired land from men who have already secured an advance from State funds towards the purchase of that land and we are not asking them to repay such advances. We are going to make a much greater advance, if the Minister's intention runs in line with my proposals.  It is a merry-go-round which cannot go on for ever.  We cannot continue every decade taking land from men who have already got a State advance, forgive the repayment of the advances and make further advances to put other men on the land.  I want to do as much as we can to solve the congestion problem.  Some people, however, have too high hopes about the solution of congestion.  I do not think it can ever be really solved.  We must do as much as we can for it, but, remember, a continued disturbance of farm economy is bad for the country and I think that we ought to have an end to it at some particular time.  We shall give the Minister every help and consideration we can and any money the country can afford if he can solve the problem in 12 months.  Even though he said that, it was merely the polemics of the hustings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but the job of any Government is to try to do as much as possible in the shortest time to help out people living under these rural slum conditions.  I admit that this Bill sets out to try and speed up the work of the Land Commission by bringing more land into the hands of the Land Commission because of the fact that market value of market price will be paid for it and people who have large tracts of land will surrender it <Col N="1051" /> more quickly than if forced to give it up at a lower price.  I can assure the Opposition that during the progress of this Bill I had as much worries about incoming allottees as any Deputy over there had and was also afraid that this extra money which will be paid at the market price or market value of the land, for the redemption of the annuity and for disturbance will all be thrown on the back of the incoming tenant.  If that were the case, migrants from the West coming into a holding of 35 or 40 statute acres with this burden on their backs, having very little money in many cases, then it would be better for them to remain where they are and to go on migrating to England to earn a living, as they have done in the past.</P>
      <P>From conversations with the Minister and during the course of the Second Reading I understood that it was never the intention of either the Minister or the Land Commission to throw this immense burden on the backs of the incoming tenants.  I still understand that the idea is to fix a fair annuity, such an annuity as the land can bear and one that a good industrious hardworking tenant will be able to meet.  We have an assurance from the Minister on that matter and, having that assurance, I think there is no longer any need for Deputy Moylan's amendment.  If that assurance had not been given I, too, would have put down an amendment similar to Deputy Moylan's.  The assurance has been given and there is no need for Deputy Moylan to worry unduly as to how the incoming tenant will be treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One will, of course, have the type of allottee who may not be industrious and on whom the annuity fixed, no matter how small it may be, may cast a very heavy burden.  That is a matter which neither the Land Commission nor the Minister can be expected to take into consideration.  That is not their fault.  It is the job of the Minister and the Land Commission to provide as many economic holdings as possible at as fair a rent as possible.  We know perfectly well that the State must bear some burden because land which will be acquired after the passing of this <Col N="1052" /> Act will be much more costly to the State and the taxpayer than land which has already been acquired and divided.</P>
    <P>Every year in the Estimates a certain amount of money is voted to the Land Commission.  Unless more money is voted in the future for the purchase of land for resale and resettlement the Land Commission will not be able to proceed very far.  That is my grave worry.  I would like the Minister to give us some clarification on that matter before we pass from this section. I am in complete sympathy with the Bill and with the Minister's honest efforts to solve the problem of our rural slums.  He knows how terrible the conditions are in his own constituency and in my constituency.  But I sound this note of warning: more money will have to be provided in order to make available the same amount of land as was made available in the years gone by.</P>

The Minister's intention and Deputy Commons' intention may be excellent but the fact remains that there is nothing here in black and white in the Bill.  It is what is in the Bill that counts.  I would like to remind Deputy Commons that in the Estimates for the Land Commission different amounts of money are set out under different heads and the Land Commission is confined to spending that money under the specific heads on the specific purpose for which it is voted.  Unless we get an assurance from the Minister by way of an amendment to the section, no matter how good his intentions are, <Col N="1053" /> how are we to know that the incoming tenant will not have a burden cast upon him, which he would otherwise not have to shoulder, under the law as it will be when this land is acquired?  I think it is only reasonable that the Minister should reassure the House by accepting this amendment or by undertaking to introduce a similar amendment on the Report Stage, in order to safeguard the position.  I accept the Minister's word when he says he does not intend this; but many things happen outside Ministers' intentions when a Bill passes into law.  I think it would be very inequitable if, with the increased prices of land and the present market value, things worked out so that the incoming tenant would have to shoulder a disproportionate share.  We all know that allottees, and migrants in particular, are very poor people.  Every small addition imposes a heavy burden on them.  Generally they are very hard pressed for money.  Unless the annuity is economic and within their capacity to pay it will be impossible for them to carry on.  I am sure that even Deputy Commons is not prepared to let this Bill go through without having a definite assurance from the Minister that what we are trying to prevent will not happen.</P>

      <P>First of all, the Minister does not determine annuities.  The determination of the annuities is a judicial matter for the commissioners. I have just as much to do with the fixing and altering of annuities as I have in the buying and disposing of land.  To be quite candid, it does not matter two hoots whether or not this amendment is in the Bill.  So long as it carries the implication against my word that there is a danger that new allottees will be mulcted, to use Deputy Moylan's word, it completely changes the picture as far as I am concerned. This amendment will not make any difference to the fixing of annuities and I am sure Deputy Moylan knows that.</P>

      <P>I am sure Deputy Moylan has seen paragraph (e) of Section 10 which is exactly word for word with Section 6 of the Act of 1933.  I <Col N="1054" /> gave an assurance here on the Second Reading.  I give it again now.  It is not the intention that the annuities will be altered in any way.  The system is not being changed.  Before the system could be changed it would be necessary to introduce legislation. Until that time comes, if it does come, no one need worry.  Deputy Moylan, Deputy Derrig and Deputy Aiken should know that.  An alteration in the annuities would require an Act of Parliament.  This amendment, therefore, is so much waste paper.</P>

The Minister is chairman of the Clann na Talmhan Party.

Is that not all the more reason why we should have this assurance embodied in the Minister's legislation?  He has said that he has nothing to do with the fixing of these annuities&mdash;that it is an excepted matter for the Land Commission.  If he is sincere in his assurance, he should embody the principle in the legislation. What are his objections to telling us how the annunity is fixed in these cases?  I have asked him how it is applied in relation to estates taken over by the Land Commission but he has not replied to my question.

Mind you, there are very queer rules in the Land Commission and many Deputies of this House&mdash; even thinking over legislation that has been passed through this House&mdash;find different rules and regulations in the Land Commission, to their surprise on many occasions.  Why should the Minister not embody certain rules for the Land Commission in this legislation that will ensure that the incoming tenant will not be mulcted?</P>
      <P>It is very simple and, therefore, why not accept it?  If Deputies who are sitting behind the Minister are worried about what may happen surely, now that they have heard the Minister point out that he will have no say in the matter, they will agree that the House should be assured in the appropriate way and that is by the acceptance of this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be desirable if the Minister could briefly inform the House how the particular duty of determining land annuities is performed by the Land Commission. What are the rules that govern it and what are the considerations which bind them in regard to determining what the annuity is to be on the incoming tenant?  Notwithstanding everything that has been said by Deputy Moylan about the conservativeness of my outlook, I am in general agreement with the terms of this particular amendment. It may not be acceptable to the Minister in its present wording but it seems to me that if the Minister's intentions are exactly the same as those embodied in the amendment he might consider the desirability on the Report Stage of inserting some safeguard to ensure that an excessive annuity would not be imposed upon the incoming tenant.  I think that that is what the House desires generally and that that is what we all have in mind in regard to this whole question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were anxious to ensure that no injustice would be done to the former owner of the land and we are equally anxious all the time that the rent fixed on the incoming tenant will be such as he can reasonably pay.  Therefore, there ought to be no objection on the <Col N="1057" /> part of the Minister to agreeing to reconsider this matter and, should he find it necessary to do so, to embody in the Bill some additional safeguard for the incoming tenant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister was going to give us some indication as to the method by which the annuity is determined at present or the statutory rules governing the decisions of the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons why I object to the Minister's attitude is the stupid reasons he gives for his decision. He said here that he could not accept this amendment which would give a direction as to how the price was going to be fixed on incoming allottees because it was an excepted matter.  We all heard him say that. He could not touch it because it was an excepted matter.  But he introduced earlier Section 5, which fixed the price to be given to the people from whom land is to be taken&mdash;and that is an excepted matter.  Surely the Minister should try to be a little bit logical and give reasons to the House for his attitude which have some hope of carrying conviction.  We know that the Minister knows very little about the Bill.  That is already apparent.  At least he should make some effort to make it up and not give stupid reasons to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I wish to emphasise the extraordinary impression that is being created by the attitude adopted by Deputies Moylan and Aiken in this matter.  I understand, because, <Col N="1058" /> being a new Deputy in this House I can only go by the records, that both of these Deputies have been, in their turn, Minister for Lands.  At any rate, they were responsible for these Departments. I shall not say that they knew nothing about them but I am afraid it is more than evident that their knowledge of what excepted matters are in the Land Commission is nil.  Otherwise how could we have the extraordinary position here to-night of two of these ex-Ministers asking the present Minister, under a previous section, to explain what market value was&mdash;something they introduced themselves?</P>

      <P>The second question arises in connection with the amendment proposed by Deputy Moylan.  As he was Minister for Lands himself, I am sure he understands what excepted matters are.  If he does not, it is too bad that the present Minister for Lands has to deliver a lecture at this hour of his life to two ex-Ministers of Fianna Fáil on what they should have learned 16 years ago.</P>

      <P>The Deputy who is sitting beside me did not hear it either. The question that has to be answered is whether it is necessary to give this extra direction to those who are going to settle the annuity, namely the commissioners. Under the rule, as it at present stands, there is nothing additional in it.  If it is of such a character that it can be influenced by the extra price that will have to be paid for land under this Bill, it is quite obvious that this amendment is necessary. The whole question depends on what answer is going to be given by the Minister.</P>

      <P>Is it the position that when a question is asked in good faith, in order to decide a certain matter, the Minister refuses to answer it?  I want to decide definitely myself whether this amendment is or is not necessary.  The fundamental part of the information is required to indicate to the statutory authority that rules the action of the lay commissioners in determining the annuity but how is it to be fixed?  If it is of such a character that it is not going to be influenced by the increased price, let that be quite clear that that is the Minister's justification but if it is of such a character that the commissioners would feel bound to take into account the increased price that has to be paid for the land and to pass that over, however little or much, to the new allottees, it is clear that it is necessary to put in the amendment.

    <Title>Private Deputies' Business. - Milk Prices&mdash;Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOReilly" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following motion standing in the name of Deputy Cogan and myself:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that, having regard to existing costs of production, the prices paid to the producer for milk supplied to creameries and also for milk sold for human consumption are inadequate and ought to be increased so as to bring about an expansion of the dairying industry and consequently an increase in the cattle population and an improvement in the supplies of milk and butter available to the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset, I want to make it clear to the House that I propose to confine <Col N="1065" /> myself to the question of the price of milk which is supplied to creameries. This is the particular line in which the farmers in my county and in the surrounding counties are concerned.  I leave to other Deputies the task of dealing with the price of milk which is supplied to cities and towns.</P>
    <P>I think that the present price of milk supplied to creameries was fixed in mid-April, 1947.  At that time agricultural wages were 44/- per week.  That was the fixed minimum wage at the time.  Shortly after that, in a month I think, those wages were increased to 50/- a week, and on the 15th March, 1948, they were further increased to 55/-.  On the 4th April, 1949, they were increased to £3 a week.  In addition to that, in the intervening period, both national health and employers' liability insurance were increased by, I think, roughly 27½ per cent., so that if we add the increase under both these heads to the wage of £3 a week, we get a total of £3 2s. 7d. a week.  Naturally, one would think that a very large increase in the agricultural labourer's wage, even though everyone in the House will agree that it is too small a wage for the agricultural labourer.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, and considering that very heavy increase in wages, one would think that the price of milk supplied to the creameries would have been increased, but it has not.  We are told by the Minister for Agriculture that there is no necessity to increase the price of milk supplied to the creameries, that supplies are increasing at such a rapid rate that there is no necessity for it, and that that is sufficient evidence that the farming community is well satisfied with the present price.  I do not think I mentioned what the present price is.  It is 1/2 per gallon for seven months of the year and 1/4, I think, for the other five months.  The Minister appears to be satisfied that that is an adequate return to the farmer for the milk he produces and sends to the creamery.</P>
    <P>Since this motion was tabled, considerable changes have taken place. The land of Ireland after continuous cropping and without sufficient manure, either farmyard manure or artificial fertilisers had become poor in producing food for other sections of the <Col N="1066" /> community when very little food&mdash; probably none&mdash;was to be had from outside.  With the extremely bad winter of 1946 and Spring of 1947 the milk yield of cows has gone very low. Naturally, with the return per cow from the price prevailing at the creameries during the summer of 1947 the farmers were dissatisfied and said it was not adequate.  But since then, through the mercy of God, the weather has become more favourable and, with the availability of fertilisers, the grass lands which the Minister recently described as fear gurta have improved, with the result that the milk yields have considerably increased in the intervening period.</P>
    <P>Another factor is that, owing to conditions which arose outside this State, the price of store cattle has increased very considerably with the result that there is a better price for dropped calves than there had been.  But, even taking into consideration these two factors, the higher milk yields as a result of better feeding grass, more feeding for the winter through better crops and also the application for artificial fertiliser to grass, I still maintain that an increase in the price of milk supplied to creameries is overdue and should be put into force immediately.</P>
    <P>That leads us to the question of what would be an adequate price for farmers to get for milk produced on their farms and supplied to the creameries.  I suppose if I mentioned any particular figure it would be challenged from all sides of the House.  I think it better, therefore, to give the figures supplied recently by others with regard to milk costings.  Last week, Deputy Keane stated that they had figures in Cork to show that milk could be produced at 11.94d. per gallon.  He did not tell us where those figures were available.  I have not seen them; I do not know if any other Deputy has.  He did not tell us on what these figures were based, what allowance was made for the various items that go into the costings of milk.  Therefore I think that is a figure which no one can stand over unless it is put before the public and analysed to see if adequate sums are allowed for the various items of costings. <Col N="1067" /> Therefore I think that I may dismiss that from consideration.</P>
    <P>Then I come to the figures disclosed by the Minister for Health in reply to a parliamentary question on the 21st of last month.  These figures were in connection with the costings of milk on the farm attached to Grangegorman Mental Hospital.  In round figures, he said that the milk costings for the year 1948 were 3/1 per gallon, and that an estimate of the costings in 1949 would be 2/10½ per gallon.  I am not going into the decimals which the Minister gave.  Nevertheless, these figures are in striking contrast with the figure that Deputy Keane alleges was produced in Cork.  What is the cause of the wide gap between these two figures?  Obviously, the figures given by the Minister of Health were based on actual costings, the cost of food, the cost of labour, the cost of veterinary expenses and a few other items which he gave in reply to a parliamentary question yesterday.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health was questioned yesterday as to the basis on which these costings were arrived at and replied that on the 1948 figures the food of the cows cost 20.37d. per gallon; labour, 7.02d.; health maintenance 2.34d.; veterinary fees and expenses 1.17d., and miscellaneous expenses, 6.40d., making a total of 37.3d., or 3/1 per gallon.  If we exclude the cost of food, which is, roughly, 1/8½., or slightly less, per gallon, it leaves for labour, herd maintenance, veterinary fees and expenses and miscellaneous expenses 1/5 per gallon.</P>
    <P>Whatever the cause of it, the cost of producing milk on that farm attached to Grangegorman was considerably more than the price the farmer gets for supplying milk to the creamery for manufacture into butter.  These are actual costings arrived at on hired labour.  They were so represented to me and I have no reason to doubt the fact.  These are actual costings based on a high agricultural output.  How then can the figure which Deputy Keane gave of 11.94d. per gallon be justified?  Going further than that then, Deputy Fagan said last week that <Col N="1068" /> he had been speaking to a farmer from County Limerick and that that farmer told him that he had an average return in the past year of £51 per cow for milk supplied to the creameries and that he got £9 apiece for the dropped calves, making a total of £60 per cow.  We have no reason to doubt what Deputy Fagan told us.  Nevertheless the House has no proof as to the accuracy of those figures and cannot, therefore, accept them as accurate.  Unless there is definite proof of particular figures, the House need not accept those figures.</P>
    <P>I propose now to give figures for another area.  These are figures that can be authenticated.  These are figures that can be checked in the Department of Agriculture.  Killeshandra Creamery is the biggest creamery in my county. It gets its supplies of milk from three provinces, Ulster, Leinster and Connaught. It should, therefore, be a fairly representative area.  The supplies to that creamery in 1947 totalled 2,841,134 gallons; in 1948, they increased to 3,167,834 gallons; and in 1949, they increased to 3,939,227 gallons.  That represents an increase of practically 25 per cent. over three years.  But there are qualifying factors.  In the first instance, as I mentioned at the outset, the poverty of the land and the poor feeding qualities of the grass in 1947 naturally left a very low point from which to start.  It was not much more than half the supplies of milk received by the same creamery in 1939 so that there was a rather low starting point and the 25 per cent. increase on that is not so very impressive, although it is something for which to be grateful.  But there are other factors entering into the picture.  That area covers approximately 25 miles each way.  It is fairly well catered for by auxiliary creameries or collecting stations.  Yet, there were a number of farmers who would not supply milk to the creameries for one reason or another.  The number was not very large because it is the custom of the farmers in that area to supply milk to the creameries.  When the subsidy on home-made butter was removed in 1948 those farmers who did not supply the creameries found that the price for home-made butter <Col N="1069" /> was unremunerative and they then began to supply milk to the creameries. That was one qualifying factor.</P>
    <P>Another important factor was that in the harvest of 1948 and the early months of 1949 the co-operative creamery commenced to provide fertilisers on credit terms to its milk suppliers. Under those credit terms payment did not begin for the fertilisers until the following July and August of 1949.  The result was that something approaching 1,000 tons of North African phosphates were distributed to the farmers and spread on the grass-lands in that area.  I think myself that was largely responsible for the increased supplies of milk in 1949 as compared with 1947 and 1948.  Possibly some people may look upon the money returned to the milk suppliers from 1948 to 1949 as a net gain.  Those who understand farming know that that is not so.  We must not forget that this 1,000 tons of phosphates had to be paid for eventually and that must be taken out of the gross return from the creameries. In addition, there was an increase in the rates of from 6/- to 8/- between 1947 and 1949.  That, too, must represent a costing item in the production of milk.  When these things are taken out, the net return to the farmer is not so very great.</P>
    <P>I want now to make a comparison with the figures for these Limerick cows about which we know nothing.  We do know that the grass-lands of Limerick are superior to the grass-lands in Cavan where milk production is concerned. But we have not been told the type of cows they have in Limerick.  Are they cows that have been bred over a long period for milk alone?  We have not been told the breed of the calves, a matter which would have an important bearing on the ultimate value of the calves.  I propose to give for comparison purposes the figures of the number of cows in the Killeshandra creamery area and the cash returned from the creamery for these cows.  I have not got the total number of cows for 1947. In 1948 there were 13,506 cows, supplying 3,167,834 gallons of milk, an average of 235 gallons per cow.  In 1949 there were 14,862 cows supplying 3,939,227 gallons of milk, a total of 265 gallons per cow.  That represents an <Col N="1070" /> average increase of 30 gallons.  Let us take the 265 gallons per cow in 1949 and calculate the return at 1/2½ per gallon.  The House may possibly wonder how I arrive at that figure.  I am sure the farmer Deputies understand it.  The price from the creamery is 1/2 per gallon for the summer period and 1/4 per gallon for the winter period.  The amount of milk supplied during the winter period and sold at 1/4 per gallon would be much less than what would be supplied during the summer period.  Therefore, we could not strike an average of 1/3 per gallon.  I suggest then that we take 1/2½.</P>
    <P>I suggest that 1/2½d. is a fairly good average and that it would compare very favourably with all the creameries all over the country.  At 265 gallons per cow&mdash;1/2½d. per gallon&mdash;the yield is £16 per cow.  How does that compare with the £51 a cow in County Limerick? But, not wanting to take advantage of any figures to bolster up my case, I would suggest that we might add 25 per cent. more to the number of gallons each cow gave to be accounted for by the amount of milk we claimed at home and consumed in the home and on the farm over the year.  If we take 25 per cent. of £16 it brings us up to £20 per cow.  If we take into account the increased value of the dropped calf for the last two years I would say that £3 of an increase in price over the two years would be a big figure to add on. We would then have taken all the factors into consideration that would go to explain the increased income as the result of better grass and better drained fields for cows during the Winter period, and so on.  On these figures, I suggest to the House that an increase in the price of milk supplied to creameries is now due.  It has been due for a considerable time but it has been withheld.</P>
    <P>I put the case for the farmers of my county and, I might say, for the farmers of the country.  I commend this motion to the House and I feel that in justice to the farming community an increase should be given.  If other sections of the community had any sense of justice they would have no hesitation in agreeing that an increase is due to the farming community.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Reilly has made a case for the farmers in County Cavan and he made it very well on certain points.  I do not pretend to take the view of the Minister for Agriculture on this&mdash;he is in the Seanad at the moment&mdash;but I have to approach this matter in the way in which it has been presented.  Deputy O'Reilly has informed the House that he is speaking on behalf of the farmers of Cavan. There is somebody else in the House who also comes from Cavan and who assures us that he knows all about conditions in Cavan.  Yet he has taken the line that he has taken for a very long time&mdash;he has become mute; he has nothing at all to say.  This House can decide this question without any great difficulty.  Deputy O'Reilly has made a case on the costings of farmers.  The motion is a very simple one.</P>
      <P>On what grounds does the Deputy base his case that the prices are totally inadequate?  He asserts that a number of cows that he knows of in Cavan produce 265 gallons, approximately. He then told us that he was gracious enough to allow us 25 per cent. for the amount of milk consumed at home. Will anybody tell me who kept cows like that in this country?  They should all have been executed at birth.</P>

I do not think that is a fair line at all to take.  I do not <Col N="1072" /> know the circumstances under which Grangegorman has produced milk but I know that in a publication called <i>Dublin Opinion</i> they have a Grangegorman correspondent and I am just wondering who makes that report.  Be that as it may, if that is the price Grangegorman has to pay for the production of milk, well, God help the ratepayers who have to support it.</P>

      <P>I think it is a shocking state of affairs.  No farmer in Ireland would look for that price because if he did what would the cost of butter be in Dublin to-day, in Longford, in Cavan town?  What are the ratepayers of this country paying to keep the price of milk at its present level and to keep the price of butter at its present level?  It is all right for the Deputy to get up here and argue and quote figures.  Sir, I want to be quite candid.  I never wanted to see the farmer badly paid for anything he ever did.  I have been arguing for 17 years in the wilderness, telling the former Government here that the farmers were very badly paid and very badly compensated for their labour. That view was not accepted.  This Government has come in and it proposes what?  To leave the people of the country a reasonable living, not as the Leader of the Government then said, with hair-shirts but with good shirts.  Let me pass on to this point. I know a little about farming though not much.  I am a better blacksmith, I suppose, than a farmer.  Deputy McGrath is smiling.  He is anxious to become Tánaiste to me, as leader of the Master Farriers Association, but he will never get it.  The fact of the matter is that the farmers to-day for the first time in their history are getting reasonable prices for their produce.  The Minister for Agriculture, for whom I am deputising unworthily at the moment, suggests that our farmers should not keep any cow that is under the 500 gallon mark.  I had a great old friend at one time, Father Paddy Higgins, God rest him, of Shannonbridge and he told me that he was able to buy calves in the open <Col N="1073" /> market and bring them up to be 1,100 gallon cows.  They were ordinary shorthorn cattle.  If that is so, what is the use of keeping something that is no good?  You can increase the yield by breeding the right strain.  No good ever came out of anything badly bred. Therefore I suggest to Deputy O'Reilly that he should go back to Cavan and bring Paddy Smith with him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Apparently he did not advocate it.  I suggest to Deputy O'Reilly that he should adopt the point of view of the present Minister for Agriculture, introduce milk testing, get the proper type of cow and raise the milk yield from 300 gallons&mdash; he said 265 gallons&mdash;to 500 gallons, 600 gallons, 700 gallons or even to 1,000 gallons.  Then perhaps he could get to the point where we would get another figure of the exact value to a farmer of a milch cow.  May I go further and say that if a cow is well <Col N="1074" /> fed and well treated, her yield will be further increased?  There is a question, I admit, of whether you will feed her with maize or some other type of food. You can do it if you wish by walking the produce off your own farm.  It appears to me that the farmers of Cavan want the whole thing put on a plate for them.  They want the Minister for Agriculture to go down himself and tell them what they should do. That is why we got rid of the last Government.  The last Minister for Agriculture said he was going to line the hedges and the ditches with inspectors to make the farmers do something.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Agriculture in the previous Administration, and now Deputy Smith on the other side of the House, found himself in the position that he was going to line the hedges and the ditches with inspectors to make the farmers do this, that and the other thing.  The farmers of Ireland took a poorish view of that. There is a Minister for Agriculture here to-day who has taken a different line, namely, that the farmers should be allowed to travel their own road, in their own way, without any compulsion being put on them.  He advises them what they should do.  He tells Deputy O'Reilly and Deputy Smith that they should keep, not the 300-gallon cow but the 700-gallon cow, and that in that way they would make much more money for themselves.  He also appeals to them to use the produce of their own farms in feeding their stock. I subscribe to that view fully.  In my opinion, the farmers will be best served by adopting that line and by supporting the present Minister for Agriculture in carrying out the advice he has given them, but not under any compulsion.  I notice the Minister for Agriculture has come into the House and perhaps at this stage I might hand over to him so that he can take up the cudgels where I have laid them down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather funny that the Minister for Justice and myself should be discussing, within the space of three quarters of an hour, intoxicating liquor and milk.  What a difference <Col N="1075" /> in price there is between them. If the appeals that were made by Deputies over there to the Minister for Agriculture in 1946 and 1947 had any honesty or any truth in them, there should be at this stage an uproar amongst those over there who pretend to represent the farmers in regard to the price, not alone of milk but of other agricultural products as well.</P>
      <P>I gave in this House very many months ago, away back in May, 1948, costings then made by Professor Murphy of University College, Cork, in connection with the cost of production of milk.  There is an enormous difference between the cost of production of milk with summer fed grass and the cost of production of milk over what you might call the seven winter months of the year&mdash;a wide difference.  Professor Murphy found that during those seven months of the year, without taking into consideration the cost of management, the interest on the capital involved, or the insurance against disease, it cost 22.70d. to produce on the farm a gallon of milk.  It cost 1/10.70 to produce the gallon.  The Minister found fault with me because I added to that a sum for farm management, for interest on capital and for insurance.</P>
      <P>Since then costs have increased enormously, particularly any costs involving tillage.  I might point out that a joint committee, again presided over by Professor Murphy, found that since costings were taken on beet, the labour costs on an acre of beet had increased by £4 7s. 6d. per acre.  That will give Deputies some idea of the increase in cost of a ton of mangolds or turnips, which were then valued by Professor Murphy at a guinea a ton.  In order to get the 22.70d., the turnips used by the cattle were valued at a guinea a ton; the hay was valued at £5 a ton; the ensilage at £2 a ton, and the price of beet pulp then was £5 odd as compared with its present price of £7 15s. 0d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those were not the 250-gallon cows alluded to by my colleague, Deputy O'Reilly; those were cows milking somewhere around 550 or 600 gallons&mdash;<Col N="1076" /> Deputy Lehane will correct me if I am wrong.  They were well fed, well looked after, and it was costing 1/10¾ to produce a gallon of milk on the farm without paying the farmer anything, without allowing him anything for the cost of farm management, without allowing anything for capital, or insuring his cattle against disease.  Surely, if the milk producers of Cork and of the creamery areas at that period were able to persuade a hard-headed northerner like Deputy Smith here that the price was only a fair one and should be increased, is there any justification to-day for the Minister holding milk at the same price as it was in early 1947?</P>
    <P>The price fixed by the last Minister for Agriculture is still the price of milk. There was no change, no improvement, despite the fact, as Deputy O'Reilly stated, that farm wages have gone up by 18/6 a week, counting wages and insurance, despite the fact that rates have gone up somewhere between 10/-and 12/- in the £, and despite the fact that feeding-stuffs also have gone up. I wonder how many extra gallons of milk will you get from the cows when you feed them on Argentine oats at 31/-a barrel or on the North American maize meal at 23/6 per cwt.?</P>
    <P>I have a very definite objection to the idea that seems to be creeping in, not with the Minister exactly, but in the Minister's Department, that you can turn a cow over in one day, that you can convert completely the policy of a Department which has spent 25 years, practically, working to reduce the milk yield of cows.  They have spent 25 years working on beef and they expect that you can convert a cow that is brought down to Deputy O'Reilly's figure of a couple of hundred gallons to a milking strain within six months.  It takes three years to get the calf and four years before that breed is changed and before you put a bucket under the first cow produced under the new deal.</P>
    <P>Those are facts the Minister should consider.  I am not speaking here in any harsh terms; I am putting up what I consider is the fair case of people who, in my opinion, are unjustly treated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1077" /> I do not wish to go back too far by reading statements which were made in this House in 1944, 1945 and 1946.  I would not like to read a statement that was made by Deputy Halliden in regard to the uneconomic price of milk at that period and the absolute need there was for an increased price. Neither am I going to read other statements made by the Deputy at various meetings down the country as to the price of milk, or statements made by my friend, Deputy Madden, who is not present.  I think the Minister ought to judge this case on its merits.  I think there is a fair and an honest case for an increase in the price to be paid for milk supplied to the creameries and for human consumption.  As I have stated, there are farmers who go in for the policy of producing milk during the Summer months which they send to the creameries.  During the Winter months they throw them a sop of hay.  I have pointed that out to my colleague when passing up through Limerick.  You can see the cows in four feet of mud in a small field and a sop of hay thrown to them.  That is how the cows live from October to the following May.</P>
    <P>If we are going to continue in milk production we must have some hard and fast policy.  The farmer will have to know at some stage where exactly he stands.  There is no use in having a fast and loose policy in regard to agriculture, but unfortunately that policy has been going on for the past two years.  It was that fast and loose policy as regards oats that compelled us to go to the Argentine this year and buy oats to bring here.  The Minister said it was a scandal and I agree with him.  It is a joke to think that we have to import oats.  The farmers found themselves so well scalded the harvest before last in the matter of oats that they decided, for good or ill, that they were not going to be caught any more.  They grew some other crop and kept away from oats.  If we are going to have that kind of a twist around policy in regard to everything, then agriculture is going to be brought back to the happy days, if one might call them so, of the 500 acre farm and the man and the dog.  But nobody wants to see that. <Col N="1078" /> I speak as one who has 50 per cent. of his land under tillage, emergency or no emergency.  The Minister may tell us that there is increased production of milk.  There has been an increased production of many things owing to the amazing seasons that we have had of late.  We had grass in the fields this time 12 months and a good summer before us.  There has, however, been a definite reduction in the number of people remaining on the land.  The farmers in my district find it practically impossible to get a man to do anything on a Sunday.  The cow is not like the six-day licensed publicans. She has to be milked on Sunday as well as on Monday, and somebody has to do it.</P>
    <P>As regards farmers who keep dairy cows, it is not a question of the minimum wage but rather a question of getting men to milk cows.  A farmer would pay men anything in order to get them to do it.  If you employ five men at present, four of them will tell you that they are not going to milk cows and have no idea of doing so on a Sunday.  A neighbour of mine who had three men employed on Saturday last discovered on Sunday morning that they had gone.  He had to take a bucket and milk 27 cows himself.  There was nobody else to do it.  The men he had left to take work on the building of the new sanatorium under the scheme of the Minister for Health at a wage of £4 7s. 6d. a week, plus overtime. They finish their work on a Saturday at 2 o'clock and need not bother any more about cows.  I am sure men who get into positions of that sort are not going to take on the work of milking cows on a Sunday.</P>
    <P>These are problems which are facing the people who at the present time keep dairy stock.  These are the problems which, I am sure, actuated Deputy O'Reilly and Deputy Cogan to put down this motion.  As a matter of fact, since the motion was put down conditions, as I am sure members of the House will agree, have become worse rather than better.  I am sure the city Deputies like to get their milk supply on a Sunday as well as on a Monday.  If the trade union conditions which apply in the cities, where men knock off at 2 o'clock on Saturday, <Col N="1079" /> are to be insisted on in the country areas, it will mean that the city people will have no delivery of milk on a Sunday morning.  I am sure they would not like that.  But that will be the only result very soon as far as the rural community is concerned.  If we succeed in closing the pubs on Sunday they would be very dry.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, a fair and honest case has been made for an increased price for milk, for some inducement to the farmer to continue on the job.  If trade union conditions compel my colleague, Deputy Sheehan, to pay increased wages to his workers or, if he has to pay an increased rent for his premises, then the price of his coal will go up accordingly.  That is business. But here is one section of the community carrying on the largest industry in this State.  When their costs go up, they are held there against the wall.  They are told: &ldquo;There is to be no increase in your price, but you have to give holidays to your workers, to increase their wages by 18/6 per week and to pay 10/- in the £ increase in your rates.  You must do all these things out of the &lsquo;fat&rsquo; that you got when Deputy Smith was Minister for Agriculture.&rdquo;  There has been no increase since.</P>
    <P>The good old days are now gone although we have a Farmers' Party in the Government who are supposed to look after the destinies of the rural community.  I often wonder how long they are going to stick it or how long their constituents are going to let them stick it.  I have been in this House about 23 years and I have seen five sets of unfortunate Deputies like these farmer Deputies over there. They have my sympathy.  They will not, however, have my sympathy always unless they assert themselves and tell the Minister for Agriculture: &ldquo;We are keeping you here and, unless you do something to change the condition of affairs for the farmer and see that the farmer is at least in as good a position under your régime or our régime as he was under that bad Fianna Fáil Government we used to talk about we will have to put you out.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The farmer who is engaged in dairying has built up his dairy herd over a number of years.  When he finds himself in the position that, because of the manner in which he is treated, he can make no profit and that he even makes a loss over a period, he is still not going to sacrifice ten or fifteen years of selective breeding, trying to build up a dairy herd to give a decent milk return, in twelve months.  He is always hopeful that the day will come when those who represent him here will do their duty.  He is always hopeful of a change of heart on the part of the Minister.  He has nothing in his head but the happy hope that some day a new Minister for Agriculture will come into office and give him justice.  He is not, therefore, going to change over in a day.</P>
      <P>I want to warn the Minister about one matter.  If a farmer goes out of dairying he will never go back into it again.  He will find it a far easier and a happier job carrying out the grass farming recommended by the present Minister and his advisers from Australia. He will find it a far easier and a far happier job to ramble round the fields once in a while.</P>

That is a far easier and a far nicer job for him.  That is a job that does not carry all the annoyance, the torture and the worry that dairying carries.  The farmer need not get up in the middle of the night and ramble out to see is the old cow calving.  He need not rush out at 5.30 in the morning in order to see that the gentlemen in the city have fresh milk for their breakfasts. All these worries fade away immediately once he goes out of dairying. He weighs all that up in the balance and weighs up on the other side the hard-hearted manner in which he is received and in which his appeals are met week after week that he has spent knocking, begging at a door that is apparently locked and bolted against him.</P>

It is all right for Deputies like Deputy O'Leary who can remain happily lying in bed in the morning waiting until the unfortunate farmer's son or farmer's boy knocks at the door with the milk to colour his tea so that he may have his breakfast in bed.

I now intend to devote myself to the other side of the question, namely, the price paid for milk used for human consumption. I have dealt with grass-fed milk.  In this case the milk producer must have the same quantity of milk at Christmas as he has in the month of July. That is a tough, hefty problem for him. For that reason he must go into the question of the purchase of cows or the rearing of heifers to calve at some period between 1st September and Christmas.  If he goes in for heifers he will undoubtedly get pretty good heifers that will milk a reasonable quantity of milk.  If, on the other hand, he is compelled to go to the fair or the market and purchase there a cow or a springer he will find himself up against the beef-quality of this country.  He will find himself paying £40 or £50 for a springer or a cow of the pattern described by Deputy O'Reilly, the 200-gallon to the 250-gallon cow.  I wonder what would be an economic price for that cow's milk?  Each year the farmer has to buy several of those beasts.</P>

I want the Minister to tell the House what prompted him to send inspectors to the Dublin County Council to, if I may use the word, dictate to them what persons were to get houses and what persons were not to get houses.  The Minister implied in his reply to my question that certain people had complained about the way the houses were given out in County Dublin.  My experience of the officers of the Dublin County Council and of the doctors is that they were impartial in doing their job.  I agree that if only ten houses were available, and there were 30 or perhaps 50 applicants similarly circumstanced, the doctor could only allot houses to ten people. The Minister may have received complaints, and I do not doubt that, but the fact remains that his attitude in instructing the county medical officer of health in his duty in a matter of this kind is only making the last position worse than the first.  It means that in future a housing officer in County Dublin, or the county medical officer of health, will not have the same confidence <Col N="1085" /> in making a recommendation. The doctor makes his inspections, along with his inspector.  He is not influenced by anybody.  He takes into consideration a bad house, the conditions of the family and the health of the family.  He makes a recommendation accordingly to the housing director and he, in his turn, will allot the house to the most deserving person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received some letters from people who were allotted houses and who now, as a result of the inspector's visit, will not get them.  I am all for seeing that the agricultural worker, the lowest paid worker we have, should be housed first.  The position in County Dublin now is that a number of very deserving people who have applied for houses will, as a result of the Minister's direction, become nobody's children.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider the decision which I understand he has given.  I am informed by correspondents and I have gathered from reports in the newspapers that certain categories have been turned down from getting houses.  I understand that I may not mention the names of the people nor of the categories here and that I may not advocate legislation on an adjournment debate.  I would point out, however, that the Minister by his instructions is definitely committing a serious injustice in my constituency.  I know people who are living under very bad conditions, and who have an opportunity of getting a house now&mdash;all things being equal&mdash;and I know that the doctor, who happens to be the judge or the doctor as the case may be, along with the housing officer have agreed to give those people a house.  I would urge the Minister to consider these people. It is obligatory on the Government of this country to see that everybody is housed.  This is an obligation on the Government and on the county council. There are people living in my constituency and they can go out on grass if they like or under any shelter but it would seem that they are not to get a house as the law stands.  I sincerely ask the Minister to leave the matter, as it was heretofore, to the discretion of the medical officer of health and the housing director of the Dublin County Council.  If he does that there will not <Col N="1086" /> be as grievous a wrong perpetrated as will be the case if he allows his instructions to the housing director, that certain categories shall not be eligible for houses, to stand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to your ruling, Sir.  I again ask the Minister to leave the matter as it was heretofore. I welcomed that section in the Act.  I thought it was very fair that a man who had a good case, a man who had a family and who was in occupation of a bad house, would be considered as a citizen of this State for a house&mdash;that he would be considered without any public or political influence of any kind and that he would get the house on the merits of his case. Under the present situation certain people will get houses and certain people will be treated as outcasts.  I am concerned now with the outcasts and, indeed, I am concerned with everybody who wishes to get a house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a good deal in this House during the last few days about the definition of various points of law that have arisen in connection with other Bills.  Will the Minister now specifically define the meaning of the <Col N="1087" /> term &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo; and will he tell us definitely who, in his opinion or under the Act, is entitled to get a house?  I would ask the Minister to give a ruling on it.</P>
    <P>I discussed this matter with members of other county councils for the last few days because I have here a sheaf of letters of complaint.  I do not want Deputies to imagine that I am raising this matter to gain any political kudos for myself; I am raising it for the sole purpose of asking the Minister and his Department just to keep out of these matters, to leave things as they were in the hands of the members of the Dublin County Council and the officials of that body.  I am given to understand that reports have been made to the Minister in connection with this matter from the Dublin County Council and the officers concerned.</P>
    <P>There are many matters to which I could refer, if the debate had a wider scope but I have given an assurance that I will not discuss these matters because I am told that I cannot agitate for legislation on this point.  I should like to point out to the Minister however that there is one law superior to the law of any country and that is the law of common understanding and goodwill, the law of natural justice as between one man and another.</P>
    <P>In this case we must ask ourselves are we being fair or unfair.  Irrespective of Party, I always maintained that housing was a national matter and that the people who are most deserving should always get houses irrespective of what they believed or with what Party they were associated.  That has been my outlook and will continue to be my outlook so long as I am in public life.  I can only describe the attitude of this Minister and his Department in dealing with the affairs of the Dublin County Council as sailing very close to the wind.  I would even call it pin-pricking because it has upset the customary outlook of the Dublin County Council and of the medical officer of health in the matter of housing.  They believed they were acting rightly in these matters and that they had the confidence of the people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1088" /> As I have already stated, it is only natural that when certain people are disappointed they will write letters to the Minister and the Minister must take cognisance of that fact.  I would, however, ask the Minister and the officers of his Department to realise that where you have a number of similar cases in a district and where you have not sufficient houses to meet all the needs of the people, it is only natural that people who are left without houses should be very displeased and that they will take the first opportunity of writing to the Minister or to somebody else in authority expressing the view that one or other of their neighbours should not get a house.  The only way we can avoid that is to try to provide houses for all our people. The Minister may tell me he was justified in taking the action he did take.  I will concede this to him, that no matter how perfect our laws may be cases will arise from time to time into which the human element enters.  A medical officer of health, a housing director or even a Minister of State may slip up at times.  I will concede that we, human beings, are all subject to certain frailties but in this case I cannot see you are going to serve the people in County Dublin by interfering with the discretion of your officials at the present time.</P>
    <P>I have got certain reliable information from other county councils as to the manner in which they have allocated houses.  I know that the 1941 Act which vested certain powers in the medical officers of health, swept away to a great extent the corruption that existed prior to that.  As a result, it was not necessary in order to get a house that one should know a councillor or a T.D.  That is as it should be.  Now we are going to disrupt and destroy that system and trample on the opinions of the medical officers of health in each county.  If we are going to do that, if we are going to tell A and B that they are untouchables while C can get a house, how will it be possible for any county medical officer of health to attend to the health needs of his district?  The medical officer of health will say: &ldquo;What is the use of my condemning houses, if my recommendation <Col N="1089" /> regarding the occupants of these houses will not be acted upon?&rdquo; I do not want to see the feeling of confidence that existed heretofore destroyed. The Minister has a golden opportunity of rectifying the position before it gets any worse.  I suggest that the Minister should respond to the appeal which I make to him to-night to allow the system to continue as it was operated heretofore, and to let the medical officer of health carry out the functions entrusted to him, in this regard.  If the medical officer of health in the Minister's opinion makes a genuine mistake or if the housing director makes a mistake that is a matter that can be dealt with Departmentally. I come now to the definition of an agricultural worker.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, I will confine myself to urging that everything possible should be done to facilitate those who qualify, in accordance with the requirements of the medical officers, for houses in the county. Everybody realises that it is in the order of merit that these people are chosen, having regard to the housing conditions that exist.  The housing position has become so very bad that at this stage the Government are faced with the necessity of departing from the provisions of existing housing legislation in order to ensure that the difficulties in which many families find themselves can be overcome.  For that reason I say to the Minister that the Housing Acts, the Labourers Act and the Housing of the Working Classes Act do not go far enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are families in the county to whom those Acts do not apply and that is one reason why the difficulties facing those people have become so acute in this county.  In those circumstances, I hope that the Minister will give all aspects of this situation his sympathetic consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Keyes) Michael Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Keyes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The following question was addressed to me yesterday by Deputy Burke:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Local Government if he will state why arrangements have been made whereby Department inspectors are instructing the County Dublin Medical Officer of Health as to the type of people to be granted council cottages.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I gave the Deputy the following reply:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Following the receipt of a large number of complaints regarding lettings in Dublin County, officers of my Department made enquiries some <Col N="1091" /> time ago in the offices of the county council and pointed out that certain classes of persons to whom lettings were made or proposed to be made were not legally qualified therefor under the Labourers Acts.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that the functions of the medical officer as regards the letting of cottages are confined to the submission of a report on the existing housing accomodation of each applicant and as to the degree of urgency of his need for alternative accommodation.  The actual lettings are made by the county manager and my Department has a supervisory responsibility in the matter in connection with the financing of the scheme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke has mentioned that he received many letters of complaint.  He was not the only recipient of letters of complaint; we received them also in the Department and our letters were from applicants who claimed to be in the category entitled to get labourers' houses, being honest to God agricultural labourers who could not get these houses while other people who were not held out to be in that category did get them.</P>
    <P>My inspectors had a consultation with officials of the Dublin County Council.  They did not instruct anybody. They merely referred to the provisions of the law.  This attitude was not contested by the county council's officers.  The Minister has no power to set the law aside any more than anybody else.  There is a 60 per cent. subsidy and a grant involved and the Minister is responsible to see that it is properly expended and that the houses are retained for the people for whom they are meant.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked me for a definition of agricultural labourer.  It is very wide, but it is not limitless.  There is some limit and this has been exceeded in some cases by the Dublin County Council officials.  They admitted that when their attention was drawn to it.  The definition of an agricultural labourer goes back as far as the 1883 Act.  That definition has been brought along in various Acts of Parliament since.  As I have said, the expression &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo; was <Col N="1092" /> defined in the 1883 Act.  The Act of 1886 set out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The expression &lsquo;agricultural labourer&rsquo;... shall mean a man or woman who does agricultural work for hire at any season of the year on the land of some other person or persons...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the Irish Land Act of 1903 the definition was:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The expression &lsquo;agricultural labourer&rsquo; in the Labourers (Ireland) Acts, 1883 to 1896, and this Act, shall include any person (other than a domestic or menial servant) working for hire in a rural district...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Act of 1919, as amended by the Labourers Act, 1936, had this definition:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... any person (other than a domestic or menial servant) working for hire in a rural district...</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... any person not working for hire but working in a rural district at some trade or handicraft without employing any persons except members of his own family.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We find in the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1941:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 93 of the Irish Land Act, 1903, and of paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of Section 1 of the Labourers (Ireland) Act, 1919, a person who is working for hire shall not be prevented from being an agricultural labourer within the meaning of the Principal Acts solely by reason of the fact that he is not working for hire in a rural district.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All these definitions visualise residing in the rural district.  That last definition extended it in that he was not compelled to be working in the rural district.  If he has to get work in an adjoining urban area, it does not debar him.</P>
    <P>The definitions are fairly wide, but there is a limit under which the law prohibits them being put into occupation of these houses.  Deputy Burke says there are people who are nobody's children, but I think that is not so. The fact that they are in other occupations rather indicates that.  Some of the <Col N="1093" /> classes not entitled to get in under the Labourer's Acts are entitled to be housed under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts&mdash;in houses erected in urban areas by the housing authorities.</P>
    <P>I suggest, with the steps that are now being taken&mdash;and this is my hope as well as Deputy Burke's&mdash;that in a very short time&mdash;as reasonably short a time as we can make it&mdash;everybody who is seeking a house will have a house.  But while there is a shortage&mdash;and I think Deputy Burke will agree with me in this, and he has mentioned it&mdash;priority should be given to agricultural labourers, such as they are.  That is what I have been doing and there has been no dispute between my officers and the officers of the county council.  The confidence that Deputy Burke suggests is being shattered, is not being shattered. That is not so.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned that certain people were going to go into those houses, people who did not conform to any of the definitions of an agricultural labourer. It was mentioned that some of those people were in good circumstances, having incomes above those contemplated when houses were being constructed for the rural labourers.  It was stated that some of those houses were given to the exclusion of the agricultural labourers.  If that were to continue, I am sure Deputy Burke would not like it any more than I would.  You cannot give houses to people in the category of the working classes if you try to meet the needs of the people for whom those houses were intended.</P>
    <P>The general position as it was found by my inspectors was satisfactory. There were some isolated instances&mdash; only a few, really&mdash;but these were automatically <Col N="1094" /> rectified.  I stated, in reply to Deputy Dunne and Deputy Rooney, who addressed questions to me on this subject a few days ago, that I hope to make a further clarification and, possibly, an extension of the classes in the course of future legislation, but until such time as we get that, we shall have to obey the law.  For that reason, I think Deputy Burke will be satisfied when I tell him that there is no inquisition carried on by the officers of my Department.  Their attention was drawn to what was considered to be an anomaly amounting to a hardship.  They inquired into the circumstances, as they were bound to do&mdash;that was admitted by the officers of the county council&mdash;and the position has been rectified.</P>

      <P>Take it that all agricultural workers in a particular area have got houses and take it that some of the people I cited here make representations, could you then go so far as to consider them, because they cannot be considered in an urban area as they are living in the county council area?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is merely a hypothetical question.  I hope the day will soon arrive when there will be adequate housing accommodation to meet the requirements of all the agricultural labourers.  If they are at the moment living in the rural area and working in the urban area, they are not debarred from getting a house, but we find people residing and working in the city who get these houses.  That is not covered by the Act.</P>
