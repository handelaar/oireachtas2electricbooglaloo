      <P>It would not be feasible to give precise figures for the calendar year 1949, as the rationing periods do not correspond with the calendar year. Covering the period 29th January, 1949, to 27th January, 1950, licences were issued to hotels and other catering establishments for the purchase of 9,265 cwts. of butter at the non-subsidised price of 3/5 per lb.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can well understand that there should be uncertainty amongst creamery suppliers as to the possibility of maintaining for any extended period the prices at present being paid for milk supplied to creameries.  I am not able to guarantee the maintenance of present prices beyond this year; but I have recently <Col N="156" /> outlined a plan which, if accepted by the dairying industry, would provide for the co-operative creameries an assured minimum price of 290/- per cwt. for all the butter that they produce over a period of five years, without prejudice to the opportunity of converting milk supplies into any other product, such as cheese, chocolate crumb, dried milk or cream, as opportunity may arise, thus making it possible for suppliers to receive in many areas over 1/- per gallon for milk and ensuring that in no area will they receive less.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the proposals which he has submitted to the creamery suppliers amount to an ultimatum inasmuch as he has told suppliers that if they do not accept a reduction this year they may have to accept a greater reduction in the years to come?  How can the Minister guarantee a price of 1/- per gallon for five years if it is not possible for him to guarantee 1/2, as is suggested here?  Surely the same calculations must be made and surely the same uncertainties as to the future must arise in relation to guaranteeing a price for five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dairy Disposal Company, at my request, recently undertook a comprehensive survey of the whole of the Cahirciveen peninsula. As a result of this survey, the conclusion was reached that the Emlaghmore district is reasonably well served by existing creamery facilities, and that a travelling creamery stop could be provided in that district only at the expense of other districts less favourably situated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to say what other stops, if any, would have to be abandoned.  The Deputy understands the number of travelling creameries available is limited.  The area which each of them can cover is limited.  Therefore, if you add a stop, and all the travelling creameries are at present working to capacity, you must at once survey that creamery area in order to eliminate some other stop.  I do not know what other stop would have to be eliminated, but certainly one or more would have to be eliminated if Emlaghmore was catered for.</P>

    <P>The Labour Court investigated this dispute and made their recommendations on the 24th February, 1950. <Col N="165" /> These were not accepted by the men's representatives.  In the hope of relieving the deadlock the chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann made certain suggestions subsequently as a basis for the resumption of work, but without results.</P>

      <P>Local authorities generally endeavour to obtain sites for housing by agreement, and it is only in cases where negotiations fail that recourse is had to compulsory acquisition.  The procedure governing the exercise of compulsory powers is laid down in legislation and is designed to secure that the rights of property owners will be duly safeguarded.  The number of cases in which appeals are made to the courts does not form a very large proportion of the total number of acquisition cases.  While I favour a review of procedure which would reduce the time involved in the acquisition of land by local authorities, I would regard it as contrary to public policy that the rights of citizens to appeal to the courts in such an issue should be withdrawn or restricted.  Proposals for the consolidation of the law in relation to the acquisition of land are in the course of preparation.</P>

All housing authorities, including the Cork County Council, have already been urged to consider the possibility of erecting cottages by direct labour as a supplement to the contract system where circumstances warrant, and some schemes have, in fact, been carried out in West Cork by this method.  The question of extending direct labour operations is a matter primarily for the council, having regard to local conditions.</P>

      <P>I agree that it is disappointing that more progress has not been made with this project, but that is not due to any lack of effort on my part to get the local authority to agree to the provision of a hospital giving satisfactory accommodation for the patients and at a reasonable cost.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the estimated cost of the hospital on the basis of the sketch scheme prepared was about £125,000.  For a 34-bed district hospital this was unreasonably high.  On a re-examination of the plans I felt that a number of economies could be secured while providing a reasonable standard of accommodation and services for the patients.  I had these suggestions conveyed to the local authority and urged them to have a revised sketch design prepared.  I regret that the local authority were not prepared to agree to a number of the more important economies suggested.</P>

    <P>The office of commissioner is a most important one, and to stress its significance <Col N="182" /> the age limit of Circuit Court judges was given as the retiring limit for commissioners.  I agree there is a change needed in the position that exists, because I understand that if members of the Appeal Tribunal cease to be members of it they can still continue for ever as ordinary commissioners.  Therefore, it is desirable that there should be some limit put on the retiring age.  I suggest that 70 is a reasonable retiring age.  There should be some significance given to the position of commissioner to indicate its importance, and the fact that civil servants are not in the same position or grade as commissioners.  I think it is wisdom to utilise, as far as possible, the garnered experience of years.  You will have men who have had years of experience in the Land Commission, and who at their retiring age of 65 might as a result of that experience be most valuable as commissioners. I do not think it is wise to cut the age down to 65.  I want to stress in some fashion the judicial significance of the post of commissioner, and I would appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I find that I have reached the same point of view as Deputy Moylan.  Whether we like it or not, there is a distinction between the ordinary civil servant and the lay commissioner. I am not in favour of the age of 72, as might be suggested, because it is the retiring age of some judges.  This is not the time to comment on that.  Perhaps the Minister would address his mind to this point, that 65 might be too young, and there might be an intermediate stage between 65 and 70, so that there might be some way in which he could exercise the power if necessary to retain people of an age that would be in excess of 65 if that were found to be in the interests of the service and of speeding up the work of the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to look into the matter as to whether or not he is not in a way seeking to defeat his own purpose.  The lay commissioners are slow enough, and if he has to be constantly trying to train up new lay commissioners, he will only slow up the <Col N="183" /> job which is an involved one.  It has taken the lay commissioners years to acquire the knowledge that they have acquired.  Whether they have acquired a masterly knowledge of it yet is problematical. I would suggest to the Minister that possibly he might consider putting those people in a slightly different category from that of the ordinary civil servant.  I think there is a good deal of merit in Deputy Moylan's suggestion, that what is proposed would make the office more significant than that of the ordinary civil servant who does not carry quite the same autonomous powers or the same semi-judicial functions as lay commissioners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say that 65 came into my mind because it is the retiring age for civil servants and for commissioners in other Departments&mdash; for example, the Revenue Commissioners and the Board of Works.  I want to say that I am not tied to the age of 65.  The one consideration that did enter into it was that the commissioners, in the matter of the acquisition or resumption of land, are the only body in this or any other country that have the right to take a man's property from him.  They are one of the most important bodies in the State.  I do not know that there is in any other country any similar body with as wide powers as they have.  For that reason, it occurred to me that it might not be fair to those from whom their property is being taken to leave that power in the hands of men in whom the natural process of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is not the time to give one's views on that.  I would ask Deputy Moylan to withdraw the <Col N="184" /> amendment and I will see what I can do before the Report Stage.  I am not giving a guarantee that I will make it 70.  I can see the point of Deputy Collins and Deputy Moylan that it is wasteful, so to speak, to lose at the age of 65 all the experience that has been acquired during the years up to that.  I fully realise that the commissioners have acquired a great knowledge of the land laws, and that that cannot be got overnight.  In the case of the appointment of new commissioners from the ranks of the higher officials in the Land Commission, those officials will undoubtedly have a good deal of previous experience. I will consider the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would urge on the Minister that, whatever about the new commissioners who may be appointed or the age that might be fixed for their retirement, he would not in a precipitous way cut off the expectant life of the commissioners who are at present serving.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important matter from the general point of view and it is desirable that in the consideration of it the Minister should have all the assistance that can be given to him.  There are two points of view.  One is that where you have a man of experience in what one might term a difficult and complicated position such as this his services should be retained as long as possible, that, in fact, this is one of the cases where age is a help.  The other aspect is that in a matter of this importance it is essential that there should be a new and virile outlook and that as often as possible new blood and a virile mentality should be introduced into the operations of the Land Commission.  There was some reference yesterday to fossilisation and that one of the dangers with men in that particular position is&mdash;it is a strange thing that it is only men we seem to think about; no one has thought of a woman yet, why, I do not know&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a commissioner. We have been talking about men, and <Col N="185" /> one of the dangers that I can see is that men may be enmeshed in the routine of the job and be more concerned with the routine than with achievement.  That is one of the problems which we have to face up to in a general way and very soon.  Arbitrary retirement at 65 years of age, as in the Civil Service and in a great number of commissions, may have been at one time considered a proper thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to raise it.  Naturally, I must relate it in this way.  When they retire, they retire on a pension.  I take it that the Land Commissioners when they retire will retire on substantial pensions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyway, they will retire on pensions.  It has to be considered from the general point of view of the State whether, when a person is fully alert and alive to his responsibility, he should not be actively working for the State rather than sitting at home drawing a pension.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That aspect of it has to be considered.  There ought to be a proviso that if the age limit is extended it should depend on capacity, both physical and mental, to do the work.  We do not want to have the position with which some of us are familiar, of a person physically unfit to do his job filling the job.  I would not like to think that a land commissioner should be carried into his office and hoisted up on a chair by two or three officials.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am saying that I would not like to see a land commissioner in a position where he would have to be carted round and placed up on his chair and insist on <Col N="186" /> remaining there whether he was doing the work or not.  That is why I thought it necessary to submit my observation in regard to that.  I do think that a vital principle of importance is involved and that when the Minister, and I presume the Government, come to consider this matter it is right that they should have the assistance of Deputies.  If there is any extension of the age limit, that must be subject to physical and mental efficiency.  As has been said, there may be fossilisation, but we ought to avoid that if we can.  I am quite sure it would be the Minister's idea and the idea of Deputy Moylan, and certainly of every person in the country concerned with the work of the Land Commission, that these persons should be capable of doing their work efficiently.  If that is accepted there should be no objection to the extension of the age limit, because to reduce the age too much may mean that the State would lose the services of very valuable personnel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing worrying me and I want to impress it on the Minister.  I feel that we might be a party to grave injustice if the potential life that a lay commissioner should have expected as a commissioner was by this Bill arbitrarily taken away.  I urge upon the Minister between this and the Report Stage, whatever he may consider about the possible extension of the age limit, to ensure that those who are at present lay commissioners will not suffer from a sudden axing of their potential life as lay commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing that I am sure every Deputy would like to see protected is the complete independence of the commissioners as a judicial body.  If we do anything to undermine their independence, they will cease to be a judicial body, will lose their independence, and become little less than a joke.  If the Minister could by any means dictate to them or get them into his power, or any other body, the moment they lose their freedom and independence we should not have them at all.  That is where I foresee the difficulty which Deputy Cowan has pointed out.  We shall fix the age at <Col N="187" /> either 65 or 70, but there must be no handles to it.</P>

I am afraid we cannot submit them to an efficiency test or a medical test in the same way as we would civil servants.

I think there is a good deal in Deputy Cowan's point that the five years between 65 and 70 are five years during which good service can be given, and if the age is fixed at 65 that service and experience would be lost to the State.  The only danger is that health and efficiency might be impaired.  I shall have the matter examined between this and the Report Stage to see what can be done.</P>

      <P>Whether the age is fixed at 65 or 70 a person ought to be fit to do his work.  I do not think there is any interference with the independence of the Land Commissioners in insisting that they should be capable of doing their work.  If the Minister does not make provision now in that respect we may run into headwinds later on.  We should avoid that.  I do not think it could be considered interference with independence to have a provision that a person must be physically and mentally fit.  I am not so worried about the physical aspect of it as I am about the mental aspect.  When the Minister is reconsidering this matter he ought to consider it particularly from the point of view of the capability of the individual in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it should be 65.  I do not think we can compare the commissioners with the judiciary. The law is a permanent institution and I see no reason why a lawyer would be impaired between 65 and 70.  In fact, his experience in those years might be most advantageous.  In the Land Commission a certain job of work <Col N="189" /> has to be done in a certain time.  In order to get that work done we need an energetic and virile approach.  No one will deny that the younger a man is the more inclined he is to go ahead with the job.  For that reason, I prefer 65 to 70.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to urge my point of view upon the Minister once more.  The Minister proposes in this section to make a very significant change.  He has admitted that he is not, as it were, married to the proposal. I think a middle course would be the best solution.  Instead of changing from a life tenure to a retiring age of 65 he might reasonably leave the retiring age at 70.  Of course, if we introduce the two factors of virility and feminity into the Land Commission, as suggested by Deputy Collins, we might have a mess that even the Deputy has not anticipated. I think it would be wise if the Minister accepted the suggestion of 70.</P>

      <P>In line 6 to delete the word &ldquo;four&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;five&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commissioners must discuss the very intricate business of the Land Commission and make decisions thereon, and I think it would be unwise to have a number which might not, in the case of disagreement, result in a majority one way or the <Col N="190" /> other.  I think four is an inadequate number for the reason that the Land Commission, in spite of what the Minister said when introducing the Bill, have a good deal more work to do than the Minister has actually agreed they do.  In the report of the Land Commission for last year ending 31st March, 1949, there came before the Land Commissioners 226 applications, objections and petitions.  Now these various petitions, objections and applications cover a rather wide field. There were objections to the acquisition of untenanted land; petitions against resumption; applications under Section 44 of the Land Act, under Section 14 of the same Act of 1931, and under Section 53 of the Land Act, 1939; objections to vesting orders and 17 miscellaneous matters other than these.  All these are specialised matters, and all of them are difficult and intricate.  A court that handles 226 cases during a particular year seems to me to be a court that, instead of needing a diminution of its members, would really need a strengthening.  As far as I know, all the courts in the country&mdash;for instance, district courts and circuit courts&mdash;have been strengthened in their personnel, and this is one of the busiest courts in the country.  I would suggest that, instead of a diminution of the number of people acting on it, it should be strengthened.  Apart from that, I would particularly like an odd number of members, so that we might have a majority on one side or the other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to direct the attention of Deputies to what the House has passed under Section 11 of this Bill, and in particular under Section 11 (4) which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a decision is made or given by a majority of the lay commissioners concerned therein, the dissenting minority of such lay commissioners shall be deemed, for the purposes of the foregoing subsections of this section to concur in such decision, and the word &lsquo;concur&rsquo; and &lsquo;concurrence&rsquo; shall in those sub-sections of this section be construed accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="191" /> If you have four lay commissioners&mdash; two of them one way and two of them the other way&mdash;who is going to concur with which?  Which two are going to concur with the other two?  The minority will be required by law, under Section 11, if they disagree, to concur with the majority.  In this measure the maximum number is four. Presumably, four is the number the Minister has in mind.  That is what he has in the section.  If the situation arises that two vote one way and two vote the other way, which two are going to prevail?  Whose decision is going to be upheld?  I suggest that the Minister take the figure of three or five.  If he leaves the matter as it is, I can foresee various difficulties arising in the work of the commissioners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is possible that we are at cross purposes on this amendment.  I think all that Section 15 lays down is that the number of commissioners shall not exceed four. I think there will be no difficulty about the Minister's fixing the question of a quorum for a court as being three.  I think that possibly we are at variance without really being at variance.  We are confusing what, actually, the number of commissioners will be as distinct from what might constitute a court of lay commissioners.  I do not know the Minister's attitude in this regard.  However, I think that certainly Deputy Moran's argument on the issue of four people sitting as a court is a valid one. We have already had experience in this country of the complete lack of cohesion that exists when four people sit on a board, constitute a court, and divide equally.  I would urge the Minister, between this and the Report Stage, if only to meet the wishes of the Opposition, to extend that section to say that the maximum number of commissioners shall be four and that three of them shall constitute a court for the purpose of carrying out the work.</P>

      <P>Excellent work.  I venture to say that if he got an opportunity of dealing with the problems of the Land Commission he would solve them much quicker than the four commissioners. However, that is not the point which we are considering now. When I saw this amendment I had some doubts as to whether it was in order, because it seemed to be imposing <Col N="193" /> a charge on public funds; but apparently it is in order.  There are, apparently, six commissioners.  This Bill deals with four.  Apparently the court consists of three and I understand that the court can consist of two &mdash;the Minister will put me right on that.</P>

Most of us would like to see the necessity for the two safety valves.  I do not think there will be that much steam blown off at all.  If the amendment were accepted it would mean that we would have to have an extra commissioner.  An extra commissioner is going to cost extra money; he will mean extra liability to the State in pay and in pension.  With the cost of administration as high as it is at the moment, there is no justification for adding an additional penny to it.  Therefore, I oppose Deputy Moylan's amendment.</P>

It is most important that you have proper machinery for that work.  Everybody who is concerned with that particular branch of work in the Land Commission <Col N="194" /> is aware that there have been and are tremendous delays for the very reason that we have not had a court capable of functioning often enough, and that they were not able to deal with the business in as expeditious a manner as should have been the case. I do not mind whether the Minister appoints three or five.  I understood that the Minister had in mind four, but the position I have in mind as arising in the case of two commissioners, would just as well arise in the case of four.  In particular, I want to point out that there is a specific direction already given in sub-section (4) of Section 11 of this Bill whereby a dissenting minority must concur with the decision of the majority of the lay commissioners, if there is a majority decision.  What will be the position under Section 11 of the Bill if you have four commissioners and they are divided evenly in regard to any matter? That is a matter that I think the Minister would be well advised to think over between now and the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>We have had four lay commissioners for years and we shall have four for the future.  Does that not answer the Deputy's whole point? There were two Appeal Tribunal Commissioners and they could not touch ordinary work if there was a danger of anything appealable in a case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The two Appeal Commissioners relieved the other commissioners of a good deal of work.  They relieved the Judicial Commissioner of a good deal of work, because they prepared all the cases and went through them before the Judicial Commissioner ever saw them.  Otherwise, he could not have got through the work.  You are not having four commissioners sitting in Dublin waiting to deal with particular cases.  Last year they held courts in Galway, Castlebar, Cork, <Col N="195" /> Tralee, Limerick, Ballina, Sligo and Letterkenny.  All that entailed work. I think that it is definitely necessary to have the extra personnel.  The question of economy does not arise, because the amount of money paid in commissioners' salaries, as compared with the total expenditure of the Land Commission, would be infinitesimal.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, again, the Minister should not prevent the Land Commission and himself from getting through the work that he is so anxious to expedite.  I do not think he is wise in refusing this amendment.  For instance, if we are thinking of economy, how many commissioners have been appointed to the new Industrial Development Authority and how many commissioners are on the News Agency?  Personally, I am not concerned one way or another as to what the Minister will do, but I am trying to advise him and I think he should accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Adding one commissioner to four will not make things any easier.  As I understand the Deputy, he thinks that the work may become too heavy for the four commissioners. The only way to deal with that difficulty would be to have a sufficient number of commissioners to establish two courts and have the two courts running simultaneously.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter of opinion.  The Appeal Tribunal Commissioners take a certain amount of non-appealable work from the lay commissioners. This Bill has lopped off <Col N="196" /> a great deal of small matters from the commissioners' work, matters that will be handled by the upper grades of the staff, and it will not be a worry to them any more.  I think that that will be a greater help to the commissioners than the work that the Appeal Tribunal could do.  I am quite satisfied that four commissioners are ample.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Moylan mentioned, and I accept his figures, that last year the commissioners dealt with 226 cases.  If that is a correct figure, it certainly has no relation whatsoever to the work done by the judiciary.  I know one district justice who deals with more cases than that in a morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no analogy between the cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that there is not, but nevertheless 226 is a very small number of cases.  I am very disappointed if that is the measure of their activity.  A team of four commissioners makes provision for one reserve.  In other words, the team is three with one reserve to come in in case of injury.  I think that is reasonable. The volume of work to do is very small, and a team of three gives room for a majority decision.  The reserve can step into the gap in the case of an emergency.  That being so, I think the advice the Minister got is sound.  In view of the state of the public finances, and the heavy Estimates we are facing now, I think that there would be no justification for increasing the number and thus increasing the expenditure on the administration of the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder would the Minister indicate to Deputy Cowan the difference there is between a case heard by the Land Commission and an ordinary &ldquo;drunk&rdquo; case which comes before the District Court? For the general benefit of Deputies present, would the Minister indicate, particularly to Deputy Cowan, the type of case the Land Commission have to hear, the intricacies of that case, and the length of time it is likely to take?</P>

      <P>I do not know whether Deputy Moylan has ever been at a Land Commission court.  I presume he has.  Certainly if he did take time to attend a sitting of the commissioners, he would realise how very short it takes them to deal with the case.  They break off suddenly in the midst of evidence, to consult one another and give a decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only pointing out that there is no need to worry at all.  They will not be overburdened. The length of time they take to decide a case is nothing like the length of time taken to decide a case in the ordinary Circuit Court. There is no summing-up of evidence or no statement by the commissioners, as in the case of a judge, and there is no jury to be lectured on what or what not to do.  The procedure in the courts has been extremely short, so far as I can understand it.</P>
      <P>The Minister is right&mdash;four of them are more than sufficient, so far as I understand the whole business, but the trouble is that without some hard and fast rule as to the number of a quorum, there may be some difficulty.  If three are to form the quorum, then let it be three.  If you have two concurring with two, who is to be the decider?  The Minister can lay out the number of commissioners who are to act.  Three could do the circuit and hold the court &mdash;I think that would be sufficient.  Then we will have more work taken off the hands of the others.  The commissioners will have the final sanction of schemes for the rundale and congested areas.  That will leave them with much less work to do here and they will have more time for semi-judicial work. That is how I see it.</P>

      <P>Therefore, if the Minister, with this magnificent machine of the 1950 Act at his disposal, is going to go full steam ahead, having all the power he requires, surely the amount of arguments before the Land Commission will be intensified?  Last year you had 226 applications.  Deputy Commons has stated that the commissioners get up in the middle of evidence and have a consultation and decide. They are able to judge a case much more swiftly than an inexperienced man will.</P>
      <P>There were 226 cases last year in a most abnormal year, when the amount of land acquired was small.  Next year, with this magnificent machine devised by the Minister for the completion of land division in Ireland, we will have maybe 5,000 cases.  Why should we not have an adequate judicial tribunal or group of commissioners to handle the objections?  We have a machine that will keep pace with the Minister's speed.

That happened in these five cases.  That error was discovered, with the result that these cases were excluded.  Sub-section (1) of Section 16 refers to a holding which has at any time been vested in a purchaser under the Land Purchase Acts, and is subject, in conjunction with any other land or any incorporeal hereditament to a superior interest or charge.

There was a procedure before this section was introduced whereby one could apply and get a particular sub-tenant declared by the Land Commission to be a tenant of his own particular portion of land.  It had been sub-let to him.  He then became a tenant direct to the Land Commission and so the middleman or the absentee man was cut out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to know what is the intention of the Land Commission behind this?  What is puzzling me is this: If the procedure that I have referred to is not to continue, how is an individual <Col N="204" /> who is paying rent for two fields to John Brown, who is in America, going to get title to these two fields when there was a letting prior to the passing of the 1933 Land Act? He is still paying this rent, and has not yet got an application through under that particular section?</P>

I should like to know what is the intention of the Land Commission in connection with these applications, because these applications affect the part of the country which the Minister and myself come from.  In practice, there are very many of them.  I should not like to see them curtailed in any way.  What is the idea of introducing this section?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the section is merely to give power to refuse if it is in the best interest of the country to do so, no more and no less.</P>

      <P>This expression in the first part of the section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;it is found that, having regard to the character or user of the parcel of untenanted land and to all the circumstances of the case, it would not be in the interest of the country to grant the application, the application shall be refused,&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>is shoved in here as something new in connection with these applications.  I should like to know what is meant by &ldquo;the interest of the country&rdquo;.  Let us say John Brown sublet a farm in 1925 and went to America and there is somebody working that farm.  Under the law as it stands, that man could apply to the Land Commission to become the tenant direct of that portion of land.  The object of sub-section (1) of this section is to limit the procedure under the law as it exists by setting out that, if it is in the interest of the <Col N="205" /> country, the application shall be refused.  If the application is refused, the position would be this.  The original owner of the land is still in America and the man to whom it is sublet is still paying him rent.  If the interest of the country does come into this, surely it would be to see that the man on the spot is either put out of or into the farm, or for the Land Commission to take it over.  But you leave the matter high and dry here.  I do not know in what circumstances it would be in the interest of the country to refuse the application where you have a subletting existing prior to the passing of the 1933 Act.  It is certainly some kind of narrowing down of the original power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be in the best interest of the country that the Land Commission should take up the land for the relief of congestion in the locality, and this is merely giving them power to refuse such an application.  At the very worst, that would leave things as they were.  It is merely giving power to refuse such an application if the commissioners think that, in the best interests of the country, the application should be refused.  In some cases, such an application might mean a most undesirable sub-division.  The commissioners may want the land for the relief of congestion or clearing up a bad spot of rundale.  This is merely giving them power to refuse the application, or giving them a wider discretion.  If the Deputy looks at Section 40 of the 1939 Act, he will find a similar section dealing with other cases.</P>

      <P>This special type of application was most useful in the west. Hundreds of people were making such an application to try to eliminate the man to whom they were paying rent under the section of the 1936 Act.  It was a matter of getting title to these particular portions of land.  What I have in mind is that possibly in most of these cases now when an application is made under that particular section, the Land Commission will say to the lay commissioners, &ldquo;We might possibly acquire these lands at some time for the relief of congestion,&rdquo; and the application would be flung out and the Land Commission might come along in 100 <Col N="206" /> years' time to deal with these three, four or five acres.  It is unwise to limit the working of that section of the previous Act in the way now attempted.</P>

      <P>Where a person is in America and somebody pays to that absentee landlord, if you like, a grazing rent, I think it is unfair that that person should be allowed to become the tenant of the two, or three, or four, or ten acres.  I am in agreement with the relieving of congestion and I think the proper thing would be for the Land Commission to take possession of that land and divide it up amongst a group of tenants.  It is human nature for a person who has been paying grazing rent to try to get the land.  Why should such an individual who makes an application get title to that land?  I think it should not be allowed.  It will be creating another congest within a group of congests.  I am not quite clear as to the procedure which governs the matter, but I think the commissioners, or whoever has charge of this, should move very cautiously.  If some such individual applies for title to a small portion of land, it should be refused definitely until the locality is examined. In 99 per cent. of these cases it will be found that the land would be more useful to the Land Commission for the relief of congestion than to anybody else.  I think the Land Commission should be very cautious, no matter what claim is put forward.</P>

If the economic system of the country drove a tenant to abandon his holding and emigrate, surely it is very unfair that some person who found himself in better circumstances should, after a certain term, acquire the land which this unfortunate tenant had to abandon owing to the economic system existing at the time he emigrated.  As Deputy Commons said, if any person is to acquire these lands, who has a <Col N="207" /> better right to do it than the Land Commission for the relief of congestion in the area?</P>

      <P>All I have to say in reply to Deputy Collins and the Minister is that the introduction of this sub-section will stop a number of these applications being granted. I would also like Deputies to remember that we are dealing with cases which occurred prior to 1933 where, for many long years, there may have been lettings in existence.  We are dealing generally with cases where the owners of these lands were absent.  In most cases this would only arise in the congested areas, and applications in the main were granted because it was an addition to the applicant's particular holding.</P>

Take, for instance, where a person, through force of economic circumstances, leaves the country for the purpose of making money to enable him to come back later, stock his land and make improvements on it; suppose that man rents his holding to a neighbour during his absence, if that neighbour makes application does the section here give power to the Land Commission to refuse that application?</P>

      <P>I think that is a desirable power and a necessary one, particularly in those areas where the people go abroad to work and subsequently come back and become very sound and useful citizens.  It is not a question of taking over land for subdivision in the ordinary way, because the holdings are small holdings.  They may have been in the hands of particular families for many generations, and each generation may have absented itself from the country for a number of years for the purpose of making good.  If this section results in removing any danger of such a farm being acquired by a neighbour who was working it at a rent, I think it is a very useful section.</P>

It consisted of words all right, but to hang them together and get a meaning from them passes my comprehension.  Here are pages and pages of references to various Acts from 1891 to 1946.  It looks very simple, of course, because this section only amends two sections; but in order to understand the two sections, one must plough through a whole volume of law. It would save a lot of time if we could get some condification of that.  I do not think anybody could clarify it, but it does look as if the Minister gives power for vesting in the Land Commission.</P>

When one turns from the Act to the section it purports to amend, one finds that section has already amended a section of a previous Act, which section amends a section of a still more previous Act, and so on <i>ad infinitum.</i></P>
      <P>I think the time has come when we should, in a responsible way, put on the records of this House an urgent plea for some kind of a volume on the Land Acts to be produced whereby, in a clear, codified form, we will be able to get a ready reference that will be some way intelligible to all of us.  I agree with Deputy Moylan that, with the best intentions in the world and with the most adroit effort in the world to get a grasp on the full significance of some of these sections, you find, in the course of the amending legislation, that there are conflicts of interest and conflicts of meaning, and you are left at the end with a doubt yourself as to what might be the full import or impact of the amendment. I should like the Minister to indicate in more than a general way the necessity for retrospection envisaged in this particular section&mdash;particularly in view of the fact that he can be so adamant in regard to other aspects of retrospection.</P>

      <P>In connection with the vesting of certain types of land&mdash; particularly fee farm grant cases, long lease cases and tenancies established since 1923&mdash;the method of vesting was the same as that adopted for the tenanted land cases.  We are advised that there may be a question of doubt as to the validity or legality of that.  Therefore, that is the purpose of the amendment, and that is the cause of the retrospection.  In <Col N="211" /> other words, in respect of the post-1923 Act tenancies, long lease tenancies and fee farm grant tenancies which were vested in the ordinary way under the procedure of vesting tenanted land, a doubt is raised that that may not have been correct.  We are setting what we have done in the past right, and this section, as well as being retrospective to cover the cases vested, and to set them right and to legalise the position, is giving us adequate machinery to cover this type of case.</P>

From that point of view and on the principle, I certainly would oppose the retrospective effect of this legislation.

Surely, however, if there is any substance at all in the doubt, we are purporting in this section to pre-judge what the merits of that doubt may be. It may be, as the Minister suggests, in the main, something that is going to help a person who believes he has a title to have a good title. A case could possibly arise where it would be a hardship.  I want an assurance from the Minister that, in so far as this restrospection applies, there is no danger of its operating as a hardship or a bar to whatever legitimate objection there may be to somebody's title and that it is not going to be used as a weapon to evade the result of what may have been unnecessary errors by possibly now defunct members of my profession, as <Col N="214" /> well as now defunct officials, in the interpretation of the land code.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowan said that possibly after a few hours' study of the Bill he would probably understand what it is all about, and he added that this section would probably clear the air.  I think we are doing a very useful job this evening discussing this section, apart from any effects it might have on the Minister's proposals.  To operate this section we should probably require no fewer than 12 commissioners, because any group of commissioners who would have presented to them a scheme under this particular section would have to plough at least through a dozen Land Acts, back to 1891.  Then, as the Minister claimed during this debate that the law was not quite clarified by the actual statute but rather by what the Minister said during the debate, they would also have to plough back through the Reports of the Dáil Éireann Debates and of Hansard, back to 1891.  I do not understand the section, because it involves so many Acts of Parliament which I have not even seen. It would take me ten years to understand them.  It is too late for me to worry about this now, but I do put it to the Minister that one clear thing stands out.  Retrospective legislation is bad.  What is the justification for going back to 1931 and 1936?</P>

      <P>I thought I explained all that&mdash;in case there is any doubt, to include all the cases that had been admitted by the 1931 Act.  If any one case is doubtful, then they are all doubtful.  I cannot see what is wrong in making the procedure for the future correct.  If there is any doubt about cases handled since the passing of the 1931 Act, what is wrong in making them right so that the vesting will be legal?  I referred particularly to fee farm grant cases, long leases and tenants under the 1933 Act.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider this aspect, that it would be better to say in the Bill what the Minister has said now?  It would be better to say what it means rather than to say that something is deemed to have meant something which, in fact, it did not mean at the time.  There are four Acts involved in two sections&mdash;the Land Act of 1931, the Land Act of 1933, the Land Act of 1935 and the Land Act of 1936.  The Bill says that this section shall be deemed to come into operation on the passing of the Land Act, 1931.  It did not come into operation on the passing of the Land Act of 1931, or there is some doubt as to whether it did or not. These doubts could be resolved by a section that would cover all that, rather than by saying, whether it came into operation under the Land Act of 1931, 1933, 1935 or 1936, it will be deemed now to have come into operation under these Acts.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Moylan is perfectly right in drawing attention to this matter.  In two sections, Sections 19 and 20, we have four Acts referred to. In Section 19 (2) we have the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Sub-section (1) of this section shall be deemed to have come into operation on the passing of the Land Act, 1931.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In another sub-section we have the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Sub-section (3) shall be deemed to have come into operation on the passing of the Land Act, 1936.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Again in sub-section (2) of Section 20:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Sub-section (1) of this section shall be deemed to have come into operation on the passing of the Local Loans Fund Act, 1935.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>and in sub-section (5) of the same section we have the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Sub-section (4) of this section shall be deemed to have come into operation on the passing of the Land Act, 1933.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister will agree that that is a most undesirable form of legislation.  I would say, speaking for <Col N="216" /> my own profession, that it is going to cause a tremendous lot of headaches, and it is going to make it more difficult for the ordinary person to receive the correct advice for which he pays.  I think if the Minister were on any bench other than the bench on which he sits at the moment, there would be no stronger critic of this form of legislation than the Minister himself.  I would ask the Minister to go into these sub-sections before the Report Stage, and to say precisely what he means in a comprehensive section that every person will understand.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Every provision made by or under the Land Purchase Acts which is applicable to holdings included in such a list shall apply to the parcel in so far as such provision is not inconsistent or at variance with any particular provision which applies to the parcel.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we set out to make a smokescreen in this House, I do not think we could make a better job out of it than the particular wording of that section.  We have the same provision in paragraph (b) of sub-section (3) of the section.  I do not know who drafted these and I do not know whether the Minister understands them.  I do not believe there is anybody in the House who understands the implications of these two provisions or what is their significance. It would be completely impossible for anybody to know what is meant by them or to interpret them. I think that the Minister should reconsider the whole section, particularly having regard to the fact that we are dealing with retrospective legislation. The only justification the Minister gives to the House for the section is that there is some question of doubt in regard to registration in the Land Registry.  I should like the Minister to state what is the question of doubt. What is the point that arises on registration under the Local Registration of Titles Acts, 1891 to 1942?  What are the doubts?  If there are doubts, let <Col N="217" /> us hear what the doubts are, if there is a case to be made for this section. But merely telling us that there is a question of doubt in connection with registration as between the Land Commission and the Land Registry does not make a case for this very extraordinary and peculiar section.</P>

      <P>If that is so, or if there is a particular gap to be closed up, I will be quite with the Minister in doing it, but here he is taking powers that might be used by many people who may have cases pending before the Land Commission and, if the members of this House knew the effect of them, they might not be prepared to give them to the Minister.  On a section passed here last night, a saving section, which we opposed, the Minister went very far in protecting the action of the Land Commission, its officials and himself, with regard to anything conceivable.</P>
      <P>Here we are giving certain powers and nobody seems to know what the purpose of them is.  If there is a case to be made about these titles&mdash;fee farm grants or long leases and the question of registration&mdash;if there is a question raised on their validity, well and good, but is the question raised as between the Land Commission and the owners, or is this section put in at the instance of the Land Commission to be used against the interests of the owners of land?</P>
      <P>These are reasons why the House should know what are the doubts that give rise to this section.  If the Minister is prepared to re-examine the matter and give us a full statement on Report, perhaps we may agree, but otherwise we shall have to oppose it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 55:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 23 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash; 23. (1) Wherever any holding or parcel of land is offered for sale by public auction or private treaty the Land Commission shall be empowered to prohibit such sale or any transfer of title until an examination of such land is carried out and a report made as to the suitability of such land for the creation of migrants' holdings or the rearrangement of rundale or intermixed plots.</P>
      <P>(2) Sub-section (1) of this section shall apply to all land whether vested or unvested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I move this amendment, which may seem very wide in its scope, is for the purpose of helping out the Land Commission in their efforts to get more land into the land code.  We have had in this country for a considerable time, particularly over the last ten or 12 years, the practice arising that when the Land Commission set out to institute proceedings for the acquisition of a certain holding, parcel or farm, the owner immediately puts the holding in question up for sale and this results in some buyer purchasing the land in question and snapping a very useful article from under the Land Commission's nose.  The Land Commission reserve the right to institute <Col N="220" /> proceedings and follow the new owner for this land, but in only one case out of 50 do they ever succeed because the new owner may farm the land, using proper methods of husbandry, thereby snapping his fingers in the face of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>This applies only to vested land.  In regard to unvested land the Land Commission rarely allow a sale until they examine conditions in the locality and make sure whether the land should not come into their own hands to be used for the relief of congestion.  Whatever else we may argue against an amendment such as this, we should give it some consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it would.  Only in one case out of perhaps 100 do they do this.  Where an owner decides to sell or transfer title he is willing and anxious to get shut of the land and put it on to somebody else.  That is all very fine outside congested areas, but inside those areas in particular I think it would be very wise if the Land Commission put a stop to the sale of any title until they examine the local conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with the motives operating at the back of Deputy Commons's mind, but I do not think that his amendment will achieve his purpose, and I am not at all sure that it would be a desirable amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Commission has sufficient authority under its compulsory powers to deal with the situation which is envisaged here.  I think the Deputy, as well as Deputy Moran and others who represent the areas where congestion is pretty severe, have this safeguard that people will not be able to do this kind of free selling of plots that might be immediately beneficial in the solution of congestion as easily as Deputy Commons thinks.  I think that Deputy Commons and Deputy Moran would be like two Kerry Blue terriers after the Minister if a situation were to arise whereby a possible <Col N="221" /> solution of congestion in any district with which they are familiar was interfered with in this way.</P>
    <P>I suggest to Deputy Commons that this is an amendment which should not be pressed.  He has made his point, which we appreciate.  I do not think the giving of this power would make for the goodwill and co-operation which is necessary between the Land Commission and the congests, as well as the people who have any land in the area.  That type of goodwill will not exist if you give the Land Commission wide powers of prohibition.  I think this would be an unpleasant precedent and power to introduce into legislation.  I agree that it is necessary to have a good deal of compulsory powers conferred on the Land Commission, but I do not think that what is proposed is a desirable extension of them.  I do not think that the section itself would succeed in doing any practical good.  I think that the Deputy has already a sufficient safeguard in his own vitality in this House with regard to the problem of congestion, as it presents itself in his constituency, aided by Deputy Moran, to make this amendment unnecessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Commons might have gone a little further.  We have had it stated by the present Government and the previous Government that all the land available will not give us a satisfactory solution of the problem of congestion.  Therefore, we can assume, in view of that statement, that any land offered for sale is land which must be necessary for the relief of congestion.  In view of what the Bill establishes under Section 5&mdash;that is market value which is a new principle&mdash;what I want to put to Deputy Commons is, that any man from whom land is taken by the Land Commission gets market value for it. If he does, he has not any grievance even if the Land Commission were to prevent him from putting the land up for sale.  If the Land Commission says to a man: &ldquo;You are going to sell your land; we want it for the relief of congestion and we will give you market value,&rdquo; that man cannot make the case that he has lost anything.</P>

He would make the welkin ring and say that the people who stood for and died for the three F's. would turn in their graves if this were done.  I am sure Deputy Commons will agree that this is a very far-reaching proposal.  I doubt very much if it would help to solve the problem he has in mind.  It would probably create a mild revolution in parts of the country if it were put into operation&mdash; the proposal that no farmer's son or neighbour could in the future buy a perch of land except through the Land Commission.  That is what the proposal amounts to.  It would apply to vested land as well as unvested land, and would hold up sales probably for years.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill, described as the Social Welfare Bill, 1949, is a simple and self-explanatory Bill. The main object of the Bill is to clear the ground for the implementation of the wider social security scheme.  When the Department of Social Welfare was first established, it was recognised that its function would be to merge and integrate the various social activities which up to then were administered by separate Departments and administered in an unco-ordinated way.  As a result of the activities which led to the setting up of the Department of Social Welfare, all these activities in the form of unemployment insurance, unemployment assistance, old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions and children's allowances were all brought within the scope of the Department of Social Welfare.  The only social service which was not then included in the Department of Social Welfare was the National Health Insurance Society, that is the society which administers the National Health Insurance Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should imagine that those concerned with perfecting the organisation of the Department of Social Welfare at that time realised that that was a regrettable deficiency in the setting up of the structure now known as the Department of Social Welfare.  It was then realised, and I think my predecessor recognised the fact quite frankly, that <Col N="224" /> it was only a matter of time until the National Health Insurance Society would be integrated in the Department of Social Welfare, because at that time it was visualised that the continued existence of the society was an impediment and would continue to be an impediment to the smooth implementation of a scheme of social security.</P>
    <P>This Bill, therefore, is designed mainly for the purpose of dissolving the National Health Insurance Society and transferring its functions and its liabilities to the Department of Social Welfare.  In any case, the National Health Insurance Society must be absorbed in the Department as a preliminary to the introduction of the wider social security scheme and it is obviously better that the society should be taken into the Department at this stage, which is ripe for its absorption, so that the society can form part of the foundations on which it is hoped to rear the wider structure of social security.  It is necessary, therefore, to integrate the society in the Department, so that the society and its machinery can be welded together with the other activities of the Department and thus form the basic framework on which the new structure will be reared.  It will be necessary, as those who have given any consideration to the problem have realised, to build an efficient administrative machine in order to operate the new scheme and that machine can best be planned if, at this stage, the Department has within its own control the various social activities which will call for expansion under the new scheme.  It is proposed, therefore, in this Bill to dissolve the National Health Insurance Society and to transfer all its functions to the Department of Social Welfare, it being considered, especially by those who have given careful consideration to the matter, that that is a necessary preliminary to the clearing of the ground and the building of the administrative machine for the wider social security scheme.</P>
    <P>Part 2 of the Bill provides that the existing position of the Exchequer in relation to National Health Insurance will be maintained until the new <Col N="225" /> scheme comes into operation.  In other words, the each-way payments by the Exchequer and by the National Health Insurance Fund have been stabilised pending the introduction of the new scheme, when these payments will again come under review.</P>
    <P>A necessary corollary to the dissolution of the society and the transfer of its functions to the Department is the transfer of the staff at present employed by the society.  This Bill, therefore, provides that the staff of the society will be transferred to the Department of Social Welfare, except in so far as two or three members of the professional and technical staff are concerned. The society has at present a staff of approximately 600.  This consists of statutory officers such as the secretary and treasurer, and also the administrative and clerical staff and certain other miscellaneous staff and field agents.  All these, with the exception of two or three of the professional and technical staff will be taken over and transferred to the Civil Service.  Those who are pensionable at present in accordance with their employment in the National Health Insurance Society will be taken over, and become established and pensionable civil servants.  Those who are non-pensionable will be taken over, and will fall into their appropriate classes in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>So far as the headquarters staff of the society is concerned, that is the officers, the administrative and the clerical staff, I will, in due course, seek authority to assimilate them into the general service grades.  As pensionable officers of the society they will become pensionable officers of the Civil Service and will be given the benefit of the Civil Service Superannuation Acts which, I think, are better than the terms provided by their existing employment.</P>
    <P>Section 21 of the Bill is important inasmuch as it makes provision to enable the funds of the National Health Insurance Society, which are at present invested in various investments, to be used for investment in the purchase and equipment of premises to be used by the Department of Social <Col N="226" /> Welfare; but provision is made in the Bill which will enable repayment to be made by the State of not less than the income at present received on the moneys now invested by the society and which will be used for the purpose of investment in new premises for the use of the society.  That section of the Bill, therefore, will ensure that there will be no loss in earning power compared with existing investments and that, in fact, under the arrangement which is being made, the balance in all probability will lie in the direction of giving us a higher investment yield than that which is secured to-day.</P>
    <P>Anybody who knows anything about the Department of Social Welfare knows that its various activities are at present scattered over approximately ten separate buildings in the City of Dublin.  The Secretary of the Department and the Minister with their small staff are in one building in Merrion Square and the other offices of the Department are scattered all over the place.  It is not possible to have a conference of the higher officials of the Department without collecting them from the variety of buildings in which they at present work.  I do not think it is necessary to emphasise the patchwork and unsatisfactory relations involved in the present disposition of the staff over so many and so inconveniently situated buildings.  That inevitably leads to a lack of co-ordination and to an absence of smooth administration.  In particular, it leads to a lack of those personal contacts so essential to the smooth administration of a Department.</P>
    <P>In order to overcome all these difficulties, in order to co-ordinate the various activities of the Department and in order that these activities may be housed in the one building, giving all the efficiency which necessarily goes hand in hand with the closer integration of staff, it was decided that the Department should acquire for its own use a central building capable of accommodating the entire staff.  As the House is aware, the premises which have now come to be known as the &ldquo;Store Street&rdquo; premises were offered for sale by Córas Iompair Éireann, and, as they were offered for sale, it <Col N="227" /> was decided to purchase these premises for use as a central headquarters for the Department of Social Welfare. Negotiations are at present proceeding with Córas Iompair Éireann to complete the transaction.  I hope that these negotiations will be brought to a satisfactory conclusion at an early date.</P>
    <P>The acquisition by the Department of the Store Street premises will enable the Department for the first time to have a central headquarters in which all its staff can be accommodated. That, in turn, will enable the Department to shed its tenancy of many buildings at present occupied by the Department in various parts of the city, thus making these buildings available for other public purposes.  I hope in that way we shall do something to arrest and, if possible, reverse the tendency so noticeable for many years past of acquiring private houses for the accommodation of Government staffs. The acquisition of a central headquarters will facilitate that process.  It is bound to make for greater efficiency both in the control of staff and in the working of the administrative machine.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, it is a simple and self-explanatory Bill.  Apart from these main features, the rest of the Bill deals purely with machinery designed to implement the main provisions to which I have adverted and we can perhaps, therefore, agree to discuss the machinery aspects of the Bill on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I cannot see any objection to the principle of this Bill but I do not agree that it is a perfectly simple and straightforward Bill.  The taking over of the National Health Insurance Society and merging it in the Department of Social Welfare is a step with which we all agree.  It is a necessary part of a comprehensive scheme of insurance and is a principle to which we must subscribe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be remembered that the Most Rev. Dr. Dignan put forward a scheme of social welfare.  At the time that scheme was published the Fianna Fáil Government made it quite plain they did not agree that it <Col N="228" /> was either a suitable or a workable scheme.  The Opposition Parties at that time gave it their unqualified approval and for years the Fianna Fáil Government suffered a veritable barrage of opposition because they did not adopt the scheme.  Every Party in Opposition, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Clann na Poblachta, gave it their approval.  In the Clann na Poblachta address to their electors in 1948&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>May I make a submission? I do not want to deprive the Deputy of an opportunity of discussing the merits or the mechanics of social security.  I hope to provide him later on in the year with a full opportunity of doing so, but at this stage we are not discussing social security as such, its virtues, its weaknesses or its mechanics.  We are discussing the acquisition of the society and the purchase of a particular premises.  I understand the Deputy is in full agreement with that.  I submit it is hardly relevant to discuss the mechanics of social security, and perhaps the Deputy would agree to defer his contribution on that matter to a more appropriate time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is relevant to this Bill. May I preface my remarks by saying that the other Parties gave, not only their unqualified support, but kept up a persistent barrage against our Government for years because we refused to adopt the scheme?  The principle underlying that particular scheme was that the National Health Insurance Society would take over all social services. In other words, that the committee which up to that time had been controlling national health would also control thenceforward unemployment, widows and orphans' pensions, children's allowances and health services generally.  The Fianna Fáil Government decided the scheme was unworkable <Col N="229" /> and unsuitable.  The Opposition Parties of the day, the Parties now forming the Coalition Government, stumped up and down the country blaming our Government for not adopting that scheme. We knew at the time that these Parties did not believe in the scheme.  There is ample proof now that the Coalition Parties will support the Tánaiste in this Bill.  I agree it is a proper principle to put control of national health under the Department of Social Welfare instead of taking the advice tendered by Dr. Dignan and giving social welfare over to the National Health Insurance Society.  We shall see an about turn on this question and the Coalition Parties will now vote in favour of a policy different from the one they advocated during the election. We know the reason why they went to the country advocating Dr. Dignan's scheme.  It was published by a Catholic Bishop.</P>
      <P>The simple reason was that they did not believe in the scheme at all, as they are going to prove now, and that they wanted to confuse the issue and to give people to understand that the Fianna Fáil Government were flouting a bishop; that they were anti-clerical, anti-Catholic and so on.  As far as they could work that stunt they did it to the best of their ability.  Now they are going to vote the other way. I think a statesman once said that religion is the last refuge of the ruffian. I hope the Parties on the other side will remember that now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This unified society has been in operation since 1933.  Deputies who were in the House at that time will remember that the Fianna Fáil Government had a very hard fight to get the Bill, that was necessary to set up the unified society, through.  The debate went on here, I believe, for two days.  The Government was opposed by the Fine Gael Party and, in particular, by the Independents.  It was supported in the vote at the end by the members of the Labour Party of that time, including the Tánaiste, who <Col N="230" /> is now introducing this Bill.  It is well to remember that we had the very bitter opposition of Fine Gael in bringing in that Bill and that we are now able to report, after 17 years, that the unified society was a complete success. The operations it carried out during these 17 years were very creditable. The financial provisions, as laid down in the Bill of 1933, were wide, and the society was put on a very good, sound basis.  Not only was it able to pay its way, but it was able to give extra benefits after practically the first two years and from then on down to the present time.  Our thanks are due to these people who are changing over now.  Our thanks are due to the committee who managed that society and to the staffs, both indoor and outdoor. Probably the Tánaiste will be asked some questions with regard to the provisions that are being made for the staff, when we come to examine this Bill in more detail.</P>
      <P>I have said that this Bill is not, as the Tánaiste has tried to give us to understand, a simple measure by any means.  I think everybody in the House will approve of the Bill in principle but there are certain aspects of it on which we must at least get some more information. I am not satisfied with some of the provisions but I admit that I may be mistaken.  For instance, there are references to the Act of 1911 but I find it impossible to lay hands on it. As a matter of fact I do not think it is to be had.  In a case of this kind, and especially when we are legislating by reference to an Act that is not available to the ordinary Deputy, I think it would have been well if the Minister had given us some explanation in a memorandum&mdash;at any rate wherever the 1911 Act is mentioned.  I feel that wherever changes are made in the Act of 1911 Deputies should have a memorandum telling them what the changes are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be glad to make all the information I have on this subject available to the Deputy before the Committee Stage.  I assure him that they are only routine alterations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say, however, that we are in a position to examine the <Col N="231" /> 1947 Act, the 1943 Act, and so forth, but we cannot lay hands on the 1911 Act.  It is quite possible, I admit, that they are only routine or formal changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We would be glad if the Minister would give us a note on the matter before the Committee Stage. I have been asked to-day, in connection with this Bill, if it would not have been better to postpone this measure and to bring it in as part of the comprehensive scheme&mdash;in other words, part of the Bill which, I presume, will be a fairly extensive Bill, dealing with the comprehensive scheme.  Probably the Minister has a good reason for that but I should like to hear why he is bringing in this Bill now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that last year on my Estimate he himself indicated that he thought it would be better to introduce the measure before the comprehensive scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably I would do so again, if I heard some arguments in relation to the matter.  However, I mentioned it because that question was put to me to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The financial provisions are not very clear.  I quite admit that in most Bills the financial provisions, when they are in legal form, are not so easy to understand.  Take, for instance, Sections 14, 16, 17 and 19.  Section 14 refers to the investment of surplus sums in the fund.  As far as I can see, it is laid down that the funds of this society, when it is wound up, will go to the Minister for Finance, to be used by him for the ordinary purposes of the Exchequer.  However, it lays down that a certain amount of working capital, as it were, will be left with the society&mdash;enough money to meet current expenditure.  I would point out that that does not seem to fit in so well with Section 21.  It is difficult in a case like this to read through whole sections and to explain what I have in mind.  However, I would ask <Col N="232" /> the Minister to take a note of the fact that Section 14 and Section 21 do not seem to tally.  If he is going to give us a memorandum before the Committee Stage I would ask him to give us in it some more minute information in regard to these financial provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Any funds handed over to the Minister for Finance will be handed over to him in a trustee capacity.  They will not be for general purposes at all.  They will be held on behalf of the fund, in the same way as he holds part of these funds at the moment.  As Minister for Finance, he will hold them all, but purely in a trustee capacity.  I assure the Deputy that that is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  I thought I saw in the Bill &ldquo;to be used by the Minister for Finance for the purposes of the Exchequer&rdquo;.  Then take Section 16.  I have prefaced my remarks by saying that it is not easy to follow these financial sections but, as far as I understand the section, the Exchequer will contribute £215,000 towards the expenses of running this society.  I should like to know if that will be taken in lieu of the amount voted every year up to this?  For instance, the highest amount voted for national health insurance was voted in respect of the year 1947-48 and the sum was £727,000.  In the present Estimate the amount is £481,000.  If the Minister for Finance is getting away with it, as it were, in that he will not have to ask the Dáil to vote these moneys any more, and is, instead, going to give £215,000, it seems a very good bargain from his point of view.  I should like the Minister to explain further the position under Section 16 if he intends to circulate a memorandum before the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 17 deals also with expenses of administration.  I was looking up some old Acts and, as far as I could gather, a certain amount of money comes to the National Health Insurance Society as a windfall&mdash;stamps not used, and so forth.  It is like unclaimed balances in the bank or bank notes that are lost.  In the same way, in respect of the National Health Insurance <Col N="233" /> Society, people purchase stamps, apparently, and never use them.  Of course, that is a gain to the society against which there is no liability whatever.  As the law stood up to this, the first £15,000 of that was diverted in one direction and anything above that went in another direction.  It appears that under Section 17 now the first £15,000 will be taken for national health insurance and anything over that will be taken for the Exchequer. Again, it appears to me the Exchequer has the advantage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again under Section 19, so far as I can read it, these additional benefits will be payable up to and including the year 1952.  It appears that they will then stop.  If the contributions and benefits were to remain as they are at the moment, there would be a surplus for additional benefits.  If the contributions and benefits are to be increased it is quite possible that after a few years' experience there would be a surplus which would in the ordinary way go for additional benefits.  If this Bill is implemented as it stands, it appears to me that the surplus if any would go to the Exchequer after 1952.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that will not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  I am only asking for information.  The Tánaiste will give us that information in the memorandum.  The next point about which I want to ask information and to protest against, perhaps, is that so far as I can read Section 20 it gives the Minister very wide powers. In fact, it gives him power to alter the Act, if it is necessary, to make things fit in, and I do not know if that were done before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was done in another Act not so long ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to be ruling by decree as it were.  If the Minister gets power to alter legislation, if the legislation does not suit the new arrangement, then he can alter Acts <Col N="234" /> so as to make them fit in with his idea of what the new situation should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy no doubt has read sub-section (3) of Section 20?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Order will be laid on the table of the House, but when the Minister was speaking over here in opposition, he always said that that was no great safeguard. An awful lot could be done under an Order before it came up for discussion in the Dáil.  These are the main points I have to make with regard to finance, modifications and adaptations.</P>
      <P>There are some smaller points which I should like the Minister to make a little more clear when he is winding up.  For instance, in Section (6) the meaning of the section so far as I can see is that this Bill when passed will apply not only to insured persons but to others.  I do not know what is meant by that, because if a person is liable under the law to insure for national health, both his employer and himself are bound to see that that is done.  I do not know what can be meant by that section, because it says that it shall apply not only to members of the society but to all insured persons. Are there people insured for national health who are not members of the society?  If there are it is understandable, but I did not think there were.  I thought that everybody who was insured for national health was a member of the society, and that when we transferred the society we transferred the members.  Who are these other insured persons?  Perhaps the Minister could explain that at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to Section 7, I think that in sub-section (3) (b) we are embarking on a new principle.  I thought it was quite obvious that the employees of the society would be made civil servants. The provisions laid down cover them by making them civil servants straight off by bringing them under the superannuation fund, but when we come to those on probation paragraph (b) says that on the completion of the period <Col N="235" /> of probation, and if then deemed satisfactory by the Minister, they will be admitted as civil servants.  I think that is a new principle.  I do not think there is any instance where a Minister can decide whether a person is qualified to be a civil servant or not.  It is a very dangerous principle.  Possibly again the Minister will be able to explain this in such a way that it will turn out not to be so serious as it appears to be at first sight.  Unless he is able to explain it in that way I think we should resist this provision, because we have succeeded in this country in building up a Civil Service which is above reproach and we ought to try to keep it so and keep the appointment of personnel outside the control of Ministers.</P>
    <P>The Minister explained to some extent sub-section (5) (b).  He referred to it in his opening speech, but I think he might have proceeded to tell us why it was not necessary to take in these professional and technical people.  I do not know how many there are, but we should like to know what is the explanation of this provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming to Section 8, sub-section (6) has given me a little trouble. Perhaps something the Minister has already said may explain it.  I may be under a misapprehension about the funds handed over, because each spring if the Minister for Finance is going to get the funds it does not matter if he is given first what is detailed for superannuation and the remainder of the funds afterwards. The Minister probably may be able to explain that what is due to the superannuation fund by the society should be fixed up first before the remainder of the fund is handed over. I should like him to take note of the necessity for explaining what exactly is meant by that particular sub-section. Again, sub-section (3) appears to me to <Col N="236" /> be rather strange, because it speaks about &ldquo;existing liabilities&rdquo; and &ldquo;contingent liabilities&rdquo;.  So far as one can read this legal language, it says it would have been paid over were it not &ldquo;for this Part of this Act&rdquo;; but if it were not &ldquo;for this Part of this Act&rdquo; the thing would not arise at all.  I would like to have some enlightenment on that, so that a layman could understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the precise point the Deputy is interested in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 8 (7) says, &ldquo;any sum, which, but for this part of this Act&rdquo; would have been paid over.  If it were not &ldquo;for this part of this Act&rdquo; the thing would not arise at all and therefore I want to know if the Minister could explain in some plain language the meaning of the sub-section.</P>
      <P>The Minister in introducing this Bill said that the employees when they are taken over as civil servants will be treated as well as they are treated at the moment.  What I take it he has in mind is that if they are on a scale at the moment that scale will operate, if not something better, and that the pension rights will be as good.  These pension rights are very tricky and I would like the Minister to give us a little more precise information with regard to what the pension rights were in the society and what the superannuation rights will be when they come into the Civil Service.  As we know, there are two systems of superannuation in the Civil Service, one, the old system, and one which was introduced back in 1930 or about that time.  I would like the Minister to tell us which type of superannuation will apply to those employees when they come in from the society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other point relates to new premises.  It was mentioned by the Minister that there were certain funds available and he was quite frank in telling the House what his intentions are.  On the Vote on Account I referred to decentralisation.  I mentioned that when I was Minister for Social Welfare I thought there would be an opportunity of applying this principle of decentralisation and I could not see <Col N="237" /> much difficulty in having the Department of Social Welfare housed in Cork, Galway, or somewhere else.  It is a Department that practically runs itself so far as administration goes.  There are no very big decisions for the Minister at the administrative end.  There are certainly decisions for the Minister in regard to legislation and that type of business, but not at the administrative end.</P>
    <P>This National Health Insurance Society has run very successfully for some years and we can presume that it will run just as well for years to come.  Having that in mind, I thought it would be possible to have this Department placed in another town rather than in Dublin.  In fact, the secretary of the Department when I was there had some conversations with the authorities in Cork or Galway with a view to finding out if there was an available site and if the housing problem of a large staff being moved down there could be got over.  So far as I could learn the thing was feasible, and I think it should be pursued further.</P>

We talk about decentralisation but you may be sure, although we are asked to decentralise, that there will always be some difficulties put up.  I believe that in this case the difficulties are no bigger than they would be in relation to any other proposition that might be put up.  This Department is one that could easily go to some other place, because administration in it is a thing that does not require very often a decision from a high level.</P>

      <P>No, it is not necessary. When I was Minister for Social Welfare I thought the idea was feasible and the secretary had discussions with at least one of these authorities and, as far as that city was concerned, they thought they could provide a site and cope with the housing situation necessary. It is a pity the idea could not be pursued further.</P>

      <P>There was agreement as far as that goes.  The Minister told us he proposes to purchase Store Street. I notice a provision in the Bill which leaves the Minister free for a few years to come in making the purchase of a premises for headquarters for his Department.  It will be much more easy for the Minister concerned than for the Minister for Finance, because the Minister for Social Welfare is in a rural constituency and there are no complications arising as between Store Street and Smithfield, and he can make his purchase without the slightest hesitation. But it is a great pity that he should do this.  There has been a great deal of discussion about Store Street.  I do not know much about the merits of that case at all, but my appeal to the Minister would be to consider again the arguments pro and con decentralisation, and placing this Department in another city before he proceeds to purchase a premises in the City of Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there are many people in the country who will agree <Col N="239" /> with me that this Bill has been somewhat hasty.  I believe the right thing to do would be to absorb the society in the comprehensive social welfare scheme which the Minister has promised. I am rather disappointed at the Minister's speech.  I believe that he should have in that speech paid a compliment to the headquarters staff of the society who certainly deserve from any Minister or Deputy or any other person in this country the highest credit for the great job they have achieved since 1934.  At that time they took over bankrupt and semi-bankrupt societies, many of them reeking with fraud, and, after making a microscopic examination of the whole position, they put the National Health Insurance Society, which this Bill now proposes to annihilate, in one of the soundest and strongest positions imaginable.  If there is one institution that the Fianna Fáil Government can be very proud of it is the National Health Insurance Society.  Therefore, I say I had hoped that the Minister would apologise for the execution of that great instrument of State.</P>
      <P>The Bill clearly indicates that the headquarters staff, and others, will become civil servants.  I would like to ask the Minister if there have been any discussions between the Minister and the representatives of the Civil Service Clerical Association.  Has there been any agreement, or any assurance, that those people will be welcomed into the Civil Service?  If there has not, then for the future you are going to have even the most junior civil servants looking down their noses at these people for the rest of their lives.  I would like to be assured that that is not going to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fail to see anything in the Bill to assure me that the conditions governing the rules and regulations of the society, in so far as the members are concerned, will not be worsened.  I would like to have an assurance that the rates of benefit and all other conditions governing the society will not be altered to the detriment of the insured person.  Has the Minister made sure that the position of the staff will be bettered as from January, 1950, <Col N="240" /> under Section 22?  I wonder is the Minister aware that there are automatic increases in the payment of many employees?  I hope he is not going to prevent those who are entitled to increases as from January, 1950, getting the increases.  Last year, perhaps, an argument of that kind would have been much more necessary.  This year, we know that the membership of the society has decreased.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard in this House during my time and long before it many arguments advanced in favour of democracy.  This Bill can scarcely be described as one which will extend democracy, for while on the one hand we have the committee of management abolished, on the other hand we have been told that the power taken under the County Managerial Act must be given back to the people.  Again the members will find difficulty, as time goes on, because the National Health Insurance Society will now be administered like the Civil Service.  That will certainly mean that many members will have to get accustomed to Civil Service regulations instead of those obtaining up to now.  That will make a difference to them.</P>
      <P>I think that, on the whole, this Bill could have remained over until the Minister was prepared to absorb it in the proposed scheme.  It looks as if the Minister is not going to produce that scheme very quickly.  Perhaps he was anxious, under Section 21, to get hold of the £7,000,000.  That will save the Minister from going to the Minister for Finance and saying that he wanted £1,000,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, under Section 21, clearly indicates that he is going to spend some of that money on the purchase of premises in Store Street.  I think he also made it very clear that, if he did not spend some of the £7,000,000 in reserve, he would have had to ask the Minister for Finance <Col N="241" /> for £1,000,000 and another £500,000 for alterations, furniture, and so on.  However, that money is the members' money.  I hope that will be borne in mind at all times by the Minister.  The reserve fund is certainly the property of the members of the National Health Insurance Society, and whether the Minister considers the purchase of new premises is a good investment or not I do not know.  Time will tell.  I believe that that money should have been invested in the best possible way, but the purchase of buildings can hardly be described as the best possible way in which to invest it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like Deputy Ryan, feel disappointed that this Bill was not accompanied by an explanatory memorandum. The Minister claims that it is a straightforward Bill.  I cannot agree that any Bill which contains references to Acts going back some 40 years, as well as to Acts passed in the intervening period, can be a straightforward one.  I think it is only fair to say that Deputies should have been supplied with an explanatory memorandum to enable them to examine the Bill properly.  I am not sufficiently conversant with the problems related to the administration of the National Health Insurance Society or to the Department of Social Welfare proper to decide whether this amalgamation, or take-over, will provide a better administrative machine for the Department.  On general principles, I believe that such a scheme will make for better administration generally.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that there was a staff of something like 600 men and women in the society from the secretary and treasurer down to the ordinary clerical grades and field agents.  I take it that the staff they will now be joining will be something like three times as great as that 600.  I believe that many of the 600 people who are now going to be civil servants proper will find that their conditions will have worsened, possibly not from the point of view of immediate remuneration, but certainly from the point of view of their opportunities of promotion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give the Deputy at least one instance that I know of personally. The Deputy will appreciate what a section leader means in the Army and I believe there is something corresponding to it in the National Health Insurance Society.  He is something like a staff officer who has immediate control of six or eight people.  The Deputy will appreciate that there is no corresponding office in the Civil Service.  The Minister has stated that the staff will be taken into the general service grades. I should like to elaborate further on the suggestion I have made that their opportunities of promotion will be worsened.  I take it that out of a staff of 600 there would possibly be a falling off by death and retirement of about 60 per annum.  Therefore, the immediate opportunities presented to these men are about one in ten.  They are now going into a vastly bigger Department and, from that point of view, their opportunities of promotion will decrease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should remember that about 300 of the 600 are outdoor agents, the bulk of them part-time, and that once they are agents they are always agents for whom there is no promotion at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not make it clear in his opening speech that half of the 600 were only part-time. Section 7 provides for the taking over of the staff.  The section is arbitrary, even though in sub-section (5) it purports to give a person who is not willing to be taken over as a full civil servant an opportunity of refusing. But what is his alternative if he refuses to become a full civil servant?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the purpose of the remarks I am making.  I know that there are members of the staff of the society who are not as keen to become civil servants as Deputy Cowan thinks.  First of all, as civil servants and as a consolidated group of employees, they are being deprived of a very valuable weapon in procuring for themselves better conditions of employment&mdash;that is, the strike weapon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying I will vote against the Bill.  I am trying to point out that I consider the staff of the society should be provided with more safeguards than there are in this Bill.  It is not a matter for a joke. I know that there are members of the staff of the society who are not very anxious to become civil servants. I believe the Minister has had some consultations with representatives of the society, and I presume that he has given them some assurances, if not ample assurances, that their conditions will not be worsened under the amalgamation. But, if he did have these consultations, he should have elaborated on them to some extent in introducing the Bill, as one of the big features of it is that men who undertook a contract of service ten or 20 years ago will now find their contracts compulsorily altered, and I think that is an important principle. Whether my fears are justified or otherwise, I think the principle is there and the Minister should have given us a more complete picture of the negotiations which took place before the Bill was introduced.</P>
      <P>There is one sad aspect of the Bill, and that is that by its introduction the provision of a central bus terminus for the people of Dublin and the country is further put off.  The Store Street premises almost certainly will be housing an army of civil servants, premises that were never designed for that purpose.  I am not going to elaborate that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have submitted that I am in order, but I am not going to elaborate on it to any extent.  The Minister has glibly said that the premises are available for purchase. That is putting it very mildly.  He might reasonably have used the term which we often hear in connection with land acquired by the Land Commission or under the Housing Act&mdash;compulsorily acquired.  The Minister has also pointed out that the premises which are now to be vacated by several other branches of his Department will be available for other public undertakings. I should like to know if there are other Departments looking for premises at present.  It seems to me that at the moment most civil servants are housed within the ambit of their own Departments or within the scope of supervision so far as possible.  If these premises are to be taken over for sections of other Departments, it will be only creating another evil in trying to cure one, and whatever Departments will take them over will have their staffs diffused all over the city.</P>

If this Bill represents anything it represents the complete abandonment of the Dignan plan&mdash;a slap in the face, if one might so describe it, to a member of the hierarchy who had almost been elected as a patron saint by the members <Col N="249" /> of the political Parties now forming the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Among them was no less a person than the Minister for External Affairs.  The House will remember that the principal proposal in Dr. Dignan's plan was that the National Health Insurance Society would administer unemployment assistance, widows' and orphans' pensions and even the normal health services and hospitals of the country as well as national health insurance.  For that purpose its powers of indirect taxation by way of weekly contributions were to be extended and, correspondingly, the powers of the Government in relation to these social services were to be contracted.  Among those, as I said, who were breast high for that proposal was the Minister for External Affairs. As proof of that I should like to quote a statement which he was reported to have made and which was published in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the 24th January, 1948:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Side by side with policy of full production and employment, it is proposed to institute a comprehensive scheme of social security on the lines recommended by Most Rev. Dr. Dignan, whereby adequate provision will be made for those who are unable to work through illness, old age or family duties.  Again, here it will be necessary to base the benefit on the cost of living.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I held, after full and careful examination of Dr. Dignan's proposals, that they were, in our State as we have organised it on a democratic basis, completely impracticable.  That, as Deputy Dr. Ryan has told the House, was denied by the Minister for Social Welfare, by the Minister for External Affairs and by practically every other member of the present Government. They stumped the country.  As Deputy Dr. Ryan has told you, they stumped the country&mdash;using the Bishop of Clonfert as a political weapon in order to do what damage they could to the credit of the then Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

      <Col N="250" /> This Bill is, as I have said, an example of the political somersaults of the Parties opposite since they took office.  There is something more than that in this Bill.  Section 21 of this Bill is, in itself, an admission of the wisdom of the Fianna Fáil Government in planning to provide the people of this State with an economic and efficient Civil Service by housing them economically and efficiently.  The Minister has told us a sorrowful tale about the present position of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>He said that it is quite impossible to get a conference of higher officials without a considerable waste of time on their part and a considerable waste of time on the part of the subordinates who sometimes have to accompany them.  He said that there is a lack of co-ordination between the various sections of the Department of Social Welfare, a lack of co-operation, a lack of personal contact, which makes for inefficiency and misunderstanding and delays and, of course, a great deal of aggravation and annoyance on the part of the public who have to deal with these officials.  That was recognised by the previous Government.  All these grave disadvantages which arise from the dispersal of public departments all over the city and the housing of them in buildings that were never intended to be used as offices but which were, as the Minister for Social Welfare has himself admitted, originally designed as dwelling-houses, were recognised long ago by the Fianna Fáil Administration&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the justifications for it is section 21.  The Minister for Social Welfare, in introducing this Bill, referred to the fact that it was necessary to grab Store Street in order to bring together his scattered Department. He has tried to ascribe to Fianna Fáil responsibility for the fact that the Department is dispersed.  I propose, as the Minister for Social Welfare, when introducing this Bill, referred to the matter, to deal with that point.  It is quite true that the Department of Social Welfare is scattered all over the city.  We are not responsible for that.  We are responsible for the fact that we set up a Department of Social Welfare to co-ordinate these various sections of the social services that were previously administered by a considerable number of other Departments.  The Minister for Social Welfare, who now blames us because he finds the sections of his Department scattered all over the city, was one of those who, with the Labour Party, opposed the setting up of the Department of Social Welfare to co-ordinate all these services, to secure co-operation and to bring together these officials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 56:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 12, lines 5 and 6, to delete &ldquo;granting new holdings to migrants&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the provision of new holdings for migrants or to facilitate rearrangement of lands held in rundale or intermixed plots.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment must be obvious.  It proposes to give power to the Land Commission to purchase holdings which may be non-residential or unoccupied in villages, townlands or areas about to be rearranged.  At the present time, we are aware that many owners of such holdings are willing to sell but we have to go through a slow, cumbrous procedure of acquisition or resumption.  I think that the amendment covers the following amendments Nos. 57 and 58.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The general intention in the section is to purchase holdings that may be suitable for migrants in any part of the country.  The intention under the amendment is to purchase, as I described, vacant holdings which may be useful or necessary in facilitating rearrangement in townlands or areas where rearrangement is necessary, or is being undertaken by the Land Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the amendment, Deputy Commons and myself seem to be as two hearts that beat as one.  The Minister omitted from the Bill certain powers which we thought should be in it.  While I disapprove entirely of the section, I thought it was necessary if the section did go through, that it should contain these powers and that it should be directed towards its full use for the facilitation of the relief of congestion.  As the section stood, it was not sufficiently specific in relation to the question of rearrangement of holdings.  That was the reason that I <Col N="255" /> put down my amendment, and I think it was for the same reason Deputy Commons put down his.  The Minister's amendment seems to cover both, and I am quite willing to withdraw my amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 57 and 58 not moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 59:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 7, after the word &ldquo;purchase&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;by private treaty&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I move this amendment for the purpose of getting the Minister to give a better explanation to the House of how he proposes to acquire land at a public sale.  As I said on the Second Stage, I think it is a dangerous method of acquiring land and it is a power that will lead to all kinds of trouble in the future.  That is why I suggest that the Land Commission should acquire land by private treaty and not by public sale.  Having officials of the State attending public sales all over the country will lead to other problems which the Minister cannot foresee now. You will probably get public opinion up against the State and against officers of the Land Commission in different parts of the country.  You will have small farmers and farmers' sons who want to acquire land and who believe they have as good a right as the State to purchase a farm in any part of the country when it is put up for sale, but the general feeling will be that if the Land Commission want to purchase that farm there is no use in a private individual standing up against it.  For one thing. they will not have to pay the 5 per cent. stamp duty which a private individual will have to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the Minister should confine the activities of his <Col N="256" /> Department in purchasing land to making offers privately.  That should be sufficient without entering into competition with small farmers and farmers' sons and other types of people who purchase land at public sales.  I believe myself it will lead to all sorts of abuse.  The Minister is unwise in putting his public officials all over the country to purchase land in that way, and that is why I move the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>So that Deputies should know exactly what is intended by the section, it is only fair that I would expand a little bit over what I said on the Second Reading.  First of all, this is a new departure, and, secondly, it is purely exploratory.  The section starts off by saying that the Land Commission may purchase for cash.  At any time, if any evils or malpractices develop, the Minister can at once prohibit the Land Commission from purchasing land under this section.  The whole section is framed so that should evils arise, should some circumstances in connection with the purchase in the open market for cash arise, let it be inflation, deflation or any other evil or serious malpractice, the Minister can at once prohibit the Land Commission from proceeding further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Where are the Minister's powers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>In Section 10 (2).  They are there set out very clearly.  I have examined this whole question.  First of all, the Land Commission will not need one-tenth of the total amount of land which is on the market each year.  A vast quantity of the land that is offered for sale may not be suitable for their purpose.  Every day questions are tabled asking if the Land Commission will acquire such-and-such a farm. Already they may have examined such a farm and refused to proceed further, for the simple reason that the land does not suit their purpose.  On the other hand, there is land available, land that they would not be interested in.  If we want to settle the land question, it is the best land that should be taken, naturally enough.  If anything <Col N="257" /> serious does arise, the whole thing can be dropped there and then.</P>
      <P>As regards the compulsory powers the Land Commission have, they are very slow and many suitable farms go on the market that the Land Commission want but, because of the Land Acts, those farms are sold and the new owners are installed; they live on them and work them and are, therefore, protected under the 1939 Act.  That type of land is lost to the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>Deputy Allen has raised a question which I thought of too, and that is, the Land Commission going into competition at a sale with a farmer's son or any other person.  In a congested area that needs resettlement the Land Commission have power to acquire land by compulsory methods.  If it is wrong for them to go into competition at an open sale with someone who wants to buy a holding, it is equally wrong to acquire a farm because somebody else wants it and might buy it.  That argument will not hold water.  Take a farmer's son who goes to a sale. Perhaps he might outbid the Land Commission.  It cuts both ways, because the price to which the Land Commission bidder will go is predetermined by the commissioners. Again, a holding that may be acquired may relieve three or four congests; it might relieve seven, eight, ten or 12 congests.  It is a case of whose need is the greatest.  Is the need of the seven, eight, ten or 12 congests greater than the need of the man who would buy?  If the problem of the relief of congestion is to be properly tackled, as I hope it will be under this measure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is an alternative method by which the Land Commission can come into possession of land.  I think, for the information of Deputies who may not be fully aware of it, that it is necessary to explain why I am asking this power under Section 23.  It was for that reason I transgressed and wandered off into the present powers of acquisition.  I think there is no danger so long as the Minister can at any time stop the Land Commission from proceeding further with the rest of this section, and while that power is there Deputies need have no fear.</P>
      <P>It was stated that exorbitant prices may be paid.  They will not.  The Land Commission predetermines the price a farm is worth and every precaution will be taken to see no abuses arise.  Surely it is within our competence to see that abuses will be avoided as much as possible.  If they are insurmountable, we can only stop the Land Commission in this method of acquiring land.</P>

      <P>I cannot entirely share the fears expressed by Deputy Allen in regard to the working out of this section.  I can see a considerable amount of advantage in the Land Commission having power to short-circuit all the routine there is in regard to acquiring land under the present system by going out in the ordinary way and purchasing land offered for sale.  Deputy Allen's fear is that no ordinary citizen could compete with the Land Commission in the purchase of land put up for sale.  That would be absolutely true if there was not a <Col N="259" /> governing consideration on the part of the Land Commission that the price of the land will be predetermined as the Minister says.  The land will first be valued and a definite decision taken with regard to price, and that decision will be adhered to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is always a danger, however, as we all know, that such a decision might be overstepped.</P>
      <P>Many a farmer, for example, goes to an auction with the intention of paying a certain price for land, but in the competition that takes place for it and with, perhaps, the encouragement of people like Deputy Allen, he exceeds the figure which he had in mind originally.  I think the Minister should take adequate precautions to see that the Land Commission, in their desire to get a holding and in their bidding against other competitors, will not pay a price that would exceed its market value.  The Land Commission will have the backing of the finances of the State and there is always that danger in their case.  I wonder if the Minister could meet Deputy Allen by putting a safeguard into the section to ensure that the price which the Land Commission will pay will have to be predetermined and so will be on record and cannot be overstepped.  I do not think Deputy Allen's amendment is any safeguard because even in the case of a sale by private treaty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

His position must be taken into consideration&mdash;the ordinary person who competes against the Land Commission for the acquisition of land.  Such people have rights, too.  They may be people who are urgently in need of an additional holding, people such as the second or third sons of ordinary farmers.  We have got to be fair to everybody.</P>

      <P>While I think Deputy Allen in moving this amendment was inspired by a genuine desire, it does not, in my opinion, meet the purpose he had in mind.  I think that from his professional experience he should appreciate the fact that if we were to confine purchases to purchases by private treaty we might get into a type of country where it would be impossible to exercise control.  There, surely, would be infinitely more room for abuse there than there would be in the case of sales on the public market.</P>
      <P>I am afraid Deputy Cogan suffers from a slight degree of over-optimistic colouring.  He, apparently, thinks that the Land Commission are suddenly going to lose all common sense and reason in their desire to bid up the price of land.  In my opinion what the Land Commission really suffers from is a high degree of conservatism.  I do not think Deputy Cogan was in earnest in suggesting that the Land Commission would bid above the market value. I think that at times he is rather keen on listening to himself pontificating. Deputy Allen has raised something that seems to him to be of real danger.  I think that if the Deputy was to accept the Minister's statement, that the Land Commission in going into the open market, would be subject to a predetermined price beyond which it would not go, then my opinion is that the Land Commission will very often find itself defeated bidder.  That may be a healthy thing.  It may stir up the Land Commission in its ideas with regard to the value of land.  Some of their computations in that regard leave much to be desired.</P>

      <P>It has been suggested, I understand, that an official of the Land Commission, before going to a sale of land, will have his instructions as to the final figure to which he can go.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Whoever fixes the price, presumably the agent who attends the sale, will have instructions from somebody in the Land Commission as to what he is prepared to pay.  An aspect of this matter which must occur to <Col N="261" /> anybody who has had any dealings in land, particularly in a congested area, is this: that once an official of the Land Commission appears at a sale by public auction, he is going to frighten off all potential purchasers.  They will say to themselves: &ldquo;The Land Commission are interested in this farm, they are going to take it under the powers vested in them; if they do not take it one way, they will take it in another.&rdquo;  That means that the vendor's market in his holding is destroyed.  He will have to accept whatever the offer is that is made by the gentleman from the Land Commission or else he can sit back and wait for a notice to be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> declaring that his farm is needed for the relief of congestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, before a holding is put up at public auction, a Land Commission official, as Deputy Allen has suggested, goes to a vendor, makes an offer and endeavours to buy the holding by private treaty, no harm will be done.  If they come to an agreement, well and good. But once an official of the Land Commission appears at a public auction, particularly in a congested area, he is going to frighten off intending purchasers. Many people can speak from experience on this.  They purchased land and the Land Commission stepped in and served notice to take it over.  The <i>obiter dictum</i> has been expressed by a judicial commissioner that anyone purchasing land in a congested area should have known, before doing so, that it was a congested area. That means that an individual would not be safe in purchasing a farm of land in County Mayo in view of the fact that the Land Commission have the power to take over that farm from him for the relief of congestion.  There is, certainly, this fear for the individual who is going to sell his farm, of the Land Commission coming into the open market and frightening everybody else away. For that reason and from the point of view of doing the job the way it should be done, I do not see why the Minister, in order to safeguard both the Land Commission and the vendor, should not accept this idea that the individuals should be approached privately by the Land Commission <Col N="262" /> in order to try to make a deal with them.</P>

      <P>I have listened to this debate for a long time and it strikes me that we are more frightened of our own people than we are of people from other countries who are buying land in this country.  Is there anything wrong in a Minister's buying land for congests even if he is only paying a certain price?  How many farms of land have been purchased by outsiders in the last few years by private treaty?  I have not heard any protest from anybody in this House about such sales taking place.  But, because our own Minister on behalf of the Land Commission is to go in and buy certain farms for the relief of congestion, we are all perturbed about it, while no notice is taken of outsiders buying land in this country by private treaty, and they are buying the best of the land.</P>

I think I heard some Deputies opposite some time ago saying that the problem of congestion would never be solved, that there was not enough land to go around.  I am a very young Deputy, and the only experience of the Land Commission I have is what I got in the hard school of experience in the short time I am here.  But I have made it my business to devote a good number of hours, whenever I got the chance, to the study of a number of Land Acts and I find that the more I look at them the more I am puzzled.  It is a slur on the intelligence of this House, and it is not fair to Deputies who are expected to make laws, that we should be faced with some of the sections in a Bill like this.  We have to do research work, we would nearly have to employ a firm of solicitors, to find out something in connection with certain Land Acts.  On this particular section, I maintain that the problem of congestion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that the purpose of this section will be negatived if the amendment is accepted. This section as it stands, without the amendment being embodied in it, means that the Land Commission have an opportunity of practically creating a further pool of land for the relief of congestion.  What is wrong with the Land Commission bidding in the open market for a farm of land?  What is wrong with putting a good, hard-working congest on that farm?  People here say that it is dangerous, that a farmer's son, who, of course, is entitled to a farm of land as well, is not going to get a fair chance if the Land Commission go into the public market for land; that as soon as the Land Commission official is seen at that public sale other buyers will be frightened away.  If there is actual need for that land for the relief of congestion, it is no harm that the Land Commission should obtain it in the public market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all seem to forget that we are trying to solve a big problem and that, in the solving of any big problem, quite a number of people will have their toes trod on.  We cannot expect to have legislation to suit everybody. If this legislation is passed, and enacted even for a limited period, within that period a certain number of congests will be fixed up satisfactorily. Is not that an achievement in itself? <Col N="265" /> There is nothing to stop a man who wants to sell a farm of land approaching the Land Commission and telling them they can buy the farm by private treaty.  In these circumstances, there is no necessity for this amendment.  If he does not feel like doing it by private treaty or by approaching the Land Commission, I do not see why the Land Commission cannot step into the open market and purchase the land.  The main thing to remember is that the really important problem is congestion. The longer we sit here discussing it the more inclined we are to forget the real purpose of the Bill.  If I did not believe this Bill will help towards ending congestion, I would not support it.  I have no great love for the Bill as a whole, but I think it will help to solve that problem and for that reason I do support it.</P>

I do not think the principle is <Col N="266" /> a bad one.  What I do seek is to prevent officers of the State competing against individual small farmers.  The small farmer, with four or five sons, and with ten or 20 acres of land, is just as much a congest as are the congests in other areas.  I often wonder how congestion will end.  I often wonder will it ever end.  I would ask Deputy Commons how it is that the economic laws have never operated against congests.</P>

      <P>I propose here that if the Land Commission buy land in the open market, they should pay the State the same stamp duty as the private individual is compelled to pay.  I do that from two points of view.  The first, which is the minor, and I suppose I may as well get rid of it first, is that if the State is going to go into this new business of purchasing land on the open market, the people should know exactly how much it is costing the Exchequer.  Some people may not be very anxious about the state of the Exchequer&mdash;Coalition Deputies may not be very anxious about it.  They are now in the hundred-millionaire class&mdash;they have gone over £100,000,000.  At least, if we are going to spend another few millions on this game we should know that we are spending it and we should not be giving a concealed subsidy to the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>He could give us no idea of what the effect of it was going to be. But whatever the effect of it is going to be on the social life of the community, at least we should know what it is going to cost the taxpayer.  That is reasonable.  If we are going to prevent land from changing hands normally&mdash;small farms from changing hands normally from one individual to another&mdash;we should know to the last <Col N="269" /> penny what that is going to cost the State and we should not have a concealed subsidy of 5 per cent., because a private individual would have to pay 5 per cent. stamp duty over and above what he would pay in the open market&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;apart altogether from incidental expenses.  The Land Commission, if they are going to go into competition with the private individual, should be subject to the same liability to stamp duty.</P>
      <P>The second is how far we are going to go with this business of the State interfering with the normal exchange of holdings throughout the country. One Deputy said that the Minister was going to create a pool of land for the relief of congestion.  I am afraid he is going to create a whirlpool of land. There is no stop to this.  The Minister must know as every other Deputy in this House knows that there is always pressure on the Minister for Lands, when a farm goes up for sale, asking him to get the Land Commission to step in and to take that land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If that continues and if it is in any way successful, you are going to reach the point where the method of relief of congestion to which Deputy Allen referred, the congestion on the small farm&mdash;a farmer who has several sons cannot make economic farmers of them all and he therefore tries to relieve the congestion on his own farm by buying a neighbour's small farm when it comes up for sale &mdash;is going to be killed.  The small farmer who, by his own industry and by that of his family, often the unpaid labour of his family, who has acquired a few hundred or a couple of thousand pounds, normally relieves the congestion on his own farm by buying a neighbour's farm.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it is payable by the individual who is in competition with the Minister or the Land Commission. That is what I object to.  I object to the Minister killing that competition or putting a 5 per cent. disability on the small farmer who is trying to relieve his own congestion by his own money.  The tendency will be, if this goes on, to sit back and wait until the Minister and the Land Commission come in and spend State money to relieve congestion.  When the small farmer does it himself he does it at his own expense.  When the Minister relieves congestion he relieves it at the taxpayer's expense.  The small farmer has to pay the full amount plus the stamp duty for relieving his own congestion.</P>
      <P>The Minister, when he relieves congestion, will pay no stamp duty and he will also give the incoming tenant the land at half the price.  It will be much less than half the price because not only will the price to be fixed to the incoming tenant be the same as the old price, I take it, but the incoming tenant will have to pay somewhat less than half the price which the Minister will pay under this.  I think it is a bad business deed from the State point of view and I think this experiment, as the Minister calls it, will have very bad social consequences.  Whatever consequences it has, I think we should know what these financial consequences are and I think we should insist that the Minister would pay the 5 per cent. just as his competitor, the small farmer, would have to pay it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Aiken has very successfully cut a very large stick with which to beat himself.  He stands up and says that the taxpayer has to meet the debt that is going to be incurred by the Land Commission in acquiring these farms.  In one breath he is olagón and in the next breath he wants the taxpayer to suffer <Col N="271" /> a further impost of 5 per cent. for the State's activities.  Deputy Aiken has had considerable responsibility and considerable experience as Minister in the management of certain Departments in this country.  One of these Departments was the Department of Finance.  Surely he is not seriously suggesting, as an ex-Minister for Finance, that he wants the Minister for Lands and the Minister for Finance to go through the book-keeping transaction of paying tax to each other? That is what it amounts to.  The tax ultimately falls back on the person who has to carry the complete burden&mdash;the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>Deputy Aiken is envisaging a competition that is unreal.  A tax does not become leviable until the purchase price is determined.  Deputy Aiken is suggesting something which, of course, he knows to be absolutely unreal&mdash;that all normal transfer of holdings is going to cease because the Land Commission is going to go into the market.  He knows, as well as I do, that the Land Commission is not going to stop the type of relief of congestion that is brought about by the thrifty farmer who buys further farms for his sons. That is not the particular type of land that would be attractive to the Land Commission for the purpose of relieving congestion in the normal way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that Deputy Aiken is in earnest; I do not believe that the amendment in his name is worthy of earnest thought&mdash;that the Department should levy on itself and pay another Department, stamp duty.  It would be only what would be at best a book-keeping transaction.  It would put a further impost on the taxpayer in general, if the Minister for Lands had to give back to what has already been described by the Opposition as a too stringent Minister for Finance, 5 per cent. of the amount which he had advanced to them for the purchase of land like this.  Deputy Aiken will have to make up his mind whether or not it is the taxpayer will ultimately meet the bill.  In one breath he says it is and in the next breath he says it is not the taxpayer who will have to pay this further impost.  Is it rational or reasonable <Col N="272" /> that, once the purchase price is fixed, the Department should be asked to go through the fiction, the farce and the complete codology of taking money out of one pocket and putting it into another, transferring it from one Department to another when we want&mdash; and I think it is the unanimous wish of the House as I am sure it is the genuine wish of Deputy Aiken himself&mdash; the Minister to get as quickly as possible suitable lands to help to relieve this appalling and recurring festering sore of congestion.  I think it is our ambition to put as few impediments as possible in his way.  To impose on the Minister the necessity to pay stamp duty would be to put the brakes on the operation of a Bill that, imperfect as it is, it is hoped will serve as an impetus to the ultimate solution to the congestion problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just like the House to examine what has been described by Deputy Collins as a codology proposal.  If this is a codology proposal, it was a codology proposal to increase the stamp duty to 25 per cent. in order to stop certain persons purchasing land.  The net effect of this sub-section is going to be that not alone will the Land Commission be favoured by 5 per cent. but they will be favoured by about 10 to 15 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Land Commission are bidding in the open market with Pat Murphy, who wants to buy a farm, Pat Murphy knows that perhaps he has £1,000 available to buy that farm but that it is going to cost him 5 per cent. additional in stamp duty, 3 per cent. for legal fees and possibly more if there are searches.  Furthermore, if it is registered land, he has got to pay the Land Registry fees, which are extremely heavy.  Therefore his additional outlay is not 5 per cent. but it is more likely to be from 10 to 15 per cent.  In this Bill the Land Commission have abolished any fees which may be payable by them to the Land Registry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, indeed, we have. The Minister has already taken power to abolish any fees payable by the Land Commission to the Land Registry so that when he finally comes along to buy a farm he is in the position that he has 15 per cent. less to pay than his competitors.  In other words, where it would cost an ordinary country man interested in purchasing a farm a certain price, the Land Commission are in a position to outbid him by 15 per cent.  By taking these powers the Minister is putting himself in a completely unfair position as against his opponents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I give my view of what is the effect of the Minister's going into the open market.  The Land Commission are starting off with the advantage that in determining the price they can always say that, given the market value of a particular farm, it will cost any other man 15 per cent. more to buy it.  That is the main objection outside the objection from the taxpayer's point of view mentioned by Deputy Aiken.  It should also be remembered that they have their own legal department and they will have no legal fees to pay.  They are providing, furthermore, that no land registry fees will be payable.  They put themselves in a very special position, to the extent of 15 per cent., <i>vis-a-vis</i> the ordinary country farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very poor way of arriving at the market value of a place offered for sale which the Land Commission proposes to purchase. Admittedly the Land Commission will not have to pay the stamp duty which the ordinary purchaser will have to pay.  They will not have to pay legal expenses but the ordinary man in the street does not keep a private solicitor in his house for conducting his legal affairs.  We have to do that.  I do not see why we should not have the benefit of the arrangements whereby we have <Col N="274" /> to keep solicitors permanently employed to conduct our legal business. Deputy Moran's argument therefore that we could purchase with the advantage of 15 per cent. over the ordinary purchaser does not hold.  I told Deputy Allen already that the fact that one has plenty of salt is no reason why one should spoil one's dinner.  The predetermination of the price or of the market value of the holding will have nothing to do with the fact that stamp duty or other legal expenses will not be payable by the Land Commission. I should like to hear the Deputy's remarks if the Land Commission should try any such tactics.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I should like to ask Deputy Aiken, who was Minister for Finance, did he really put down this amendment or did somebody put it down in his name as a joke?  Does he mean calmly to suggest to me or to the Land Commission that the Land Commission would ask the Minister for Finance for £500 or £1,000 as the case might be, plus stamp duty, and that later, after he had given that money to the Land Commission, the Minister for Finance would ask them to hand back to him the stamp duty on the farm?  I think if such a joke were perpetrated in any Government Department it would be high time to expose it and kill it.</P>

      <P>The Minister argued here that he was not going to be in a position to give 15 per cent. more, as Deputy Moran suggested, than the ordinary person; that he was not going to be at a 15 per cent. advantage.

Does the Minister want to kill the exchange of holdings that goes on in most parts of the country?  This might be news to some Deputies from Mayo and other parts of the West. They do not know what the Land Commission is beyond that it is an organisation that sends out a bill for the land annuities.  There is a natural economy going on.  The stage is reached when we would like to see if by some means we could extend our area of land where there would be enough land for sale to satisfy local demands.  The activities under this section will make every parish Land Commission conscious, not only in relation to its land annuities but in relation to the powers under Section 23&mdash;that it can buy land at a public auction and it will keep going because there is no limitation, and the land can come into the Land Commission's hands through this process and can be sold to a new tenant, a new allottee.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is foolish policy to have one Government Department asking money to solve the congested problem and then refunding to the same Department a section of the money that has already been allocated <Col N="277" /> to it.  It is a sort of book-keeping transaction which is merely a waste of time and means delaying tactics as far as the Land Commission is concerned.</P>
      <P>I have listened to Deputy Aiken on the subject of relieving small farmers. I agree that there are plenty of farmers who, ever since the Land Commission set out to relieve congestion, have endeavoured through their own good efforts to relieve their own congestion by purchasing a piece of land beside their own holding or in the locality. But human nature is human nature, and if it comes to the notice of those people who are entitled to land from the State free, gratis and for nothing, as part of land resettlement, that a certain holding is being put up for sale in a congested area, and if it is known that the Land Commission is interested in that farm, then Deputy Aiken need have no fear&mdash;certainly I have not&mdash; that any farmer will go out to buy something out of his hard-earned cash that he will get in six months' or a year's time from the Land Commission as part of a resettlement scheme.  That is the way I look at it.</P>
      <P>In regard to stamp duty, I think the transferring of money from one Government Department to another would be a very foolish policy and I am in full agreement that the Minister should not accept Deputy Aiken's amendment. There may be some argument for Deputy Aiken's suggestion that a person with a holding having, say, a valuation of £10, who adds a little more to his fairly small acreage, might be penalised. He might be penalised a bit, but we have to consider the very great number of people who still have to exist on less than £10 worth of land. We would be only delighted and so, I think, would the Minister, if we could scrap the Land Commission altogether and let people who had money buy all the land that would be on offer&mdash;that is, if there was sufficient land to go around.  We know there is not. Therefore, we have to be very guarded as to what is the best way of handling it.  I think that, as regards the payment of the stamp duty, care should be taken that when the money is in one Government Department it should be kept there and utilised to the best value.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>He also denied that Deputy Dillon or any of them were against it.  We will see.  This is a completely <Col N="279" /> new business.  The principal point that I stressed was that it was putting the Minister and the Land Commission into a position to compete with the ordinary citizen to the latter's disadvantage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment by Deputy Aiken is an indication to the Minister and bears out what has already been said, that when the Minister's officer goes into the open market for land he has to pay no stamp duty, and so will have an unfair advantage against the small farmer or the labourer who wants a bit of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already said that is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is so.  It is sticking out 100 miles.  Any man who goes out to a public sale, or privately or otherwise, to purchase a piece of property will ask what will the costs be.  Now, there is a 5 per cent. stamp duty which the Minister proposes to wipe out here. But there is more than that on the purchase price if the land is subject to an annuity.  What I want to point to is the stamp duty payable on the redemption value of the annuity that is outstanding, as well as on the price of the holding.  If a holding costs £1,000, and there is still £1,000 outstanding, then the stamp duty charged on the redemption price may be 7 per cent. or 8 per cent.  It is never under 7 per cent. and goes up as far as 9 and 10 per cent.  If they are 1923 Land Act cases, the stamp duty on the purchase price and on the redemption value of the annuity outstanding are added and are charged by the Revenue Commissioners. That has to be remembered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it is said here that the Minister's officer has an advantage of at least 15 per cent. it is no exaggeration. It may go higher than that.  I want to put that to Deputies who sit behind the Minister, such as Deputy Fagan and Deputy Madden, who understand this. Are they satisfied that when the Minister sends out his officer, he has a 15 per cent. advantage at least in the stamp duty to compete against the ordinary small farmer or against any other type of person who wants to <Col N="280" /> acquire a holding?  There is one thing certain and it is this, that free sale of land and all the rest do not operate any longer.  This is socialising the whole question of land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Two important considerations arise in regard to this amendment. The first is that we should have the right to know exactly what price the Minister will be paying for land. That should be recorded.  If it is not the Minister's intention to accept the amendment, and personally I cannot see much point in transferring money from one Department to another, I certainly think that the saving to the Land Commission in not having to pay stamp duty should be recorded for book-keeping purposes.  In the case of rates, under local authorities, the amount is always set down in regard to property owned by the county council.  That is necessary for accurate book-keeping.  I think the same should apply here.</P>
      <P>The second point is this question of unfair competition between the State and the private individual who may be seeking to buy land.  I think that could be solved by a fair estimation of the price that the Land Commission are prepared to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion at present is confined to stamp duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that the Minister should assure the House that he would meet Deputy Allen on these two points, first of all that the saving resulting from the non-payment of the stamp duty should be recorded and, secondly, that the fact of the non-payment of the stamp duty should be taken into consideration in fixing the price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The saving will be recorded.  Is not Question Time in the Dáil one of the most powerful weapons that Deputies have for keeping in day-to-day touch with the affairs of any Government Department?  There is no question of concealing anything.  With <Col N="281" /> regard to Deputy Allen's statement that the Land Commission will enter into competition with private bidders with a 15 per cent. advantage on their side, I want to ask him this: if he were Minister for Lands, would he operate the Land Commission or allow it to operate in that way?  I would like to have a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; answer to that.  If he were Minister for Lands and if he were to answer &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; then I want to tell him that he would not be fit to be Minister for Lands for five minutes.  It all boils down to this, that if the Land Commission buys land and saves 5 per cent. stamp duty, there is a saving to the State in that way. If a private individual buys it, he has to pay the stamp duty and the State gets it anyhow.  What is the difference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that there is an extraordinary difference on the question of accounts as between one Department and another.  Deputies who scout the idea as being nonsense that one Department should pay money to another even though there is a counter account should take up the Book of Estimates and they will find it running through a great many of the different Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it Appropriations-in-Aid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  Take, for instance, the Post Office.  In the Book of Estimates you will find that the Post Office charges certain matters against all the Departments.  In fact, the Post Office would not pay if it were not for the charges made against other Departments.  I can hardly believe that Deputies would put forward the argument that it is foolish to say there should be counter charges between Departments. I think that argument does not hold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly the argument with regard to the Post Office does not hold as an ordinary business proposition.  I presume the Deputy is referring to telephone and other services for Government Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all&mdash;counter accounts that occur in the Book of <Col N="282" /> Estimates where one Department actually is charged by another Department, even though that Department may itself be earning money.  I merely got up to remove an impression that might be misleading Deputies.  It is not nonsense to talk about having charges and counter charges between Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I come from a constituency where we have not a lot of dealings with the Land Commission.  But I have been listening for about two hours to this discussion, especially on Deputy Aiken's amendment.  I am one of those people who are prepared to stand behind the Minister in his endeavour to retain this sub-section.  I believe that the Land Commission should have an advantage in the purchase of land for the relief of congestion.</P>
      <P>Some Opposition Deputies protested that this advantage, as they described it, is an advantage over small landowners who themselves would be desirous of acquiring land to enlarge their own holdings.  I rather assume that the Land Commission will interfere, if one likes to use that word, in sales in districts where there is congestion and that, rather than reacting unfavourably on congests, the interference of the Land Commission will be to the advantage of these congests, because the land will be purchased by the Land Commission for these people and, I imagine, will be distributed amongst them.  If the Land Commission has this advantage in respect of the duty chargeable, it is an advantage that they should have, not as has been stated over congests, but over other people who have sufficient land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Congestion in the west and in other areas has been a problem for a long time.  Surely the State must have an advantage to try to relieve the congestion in places like the west.  Deputy Little gave an example where a State Department takes money from another Department.  I think there is a difference.  He quoted the example of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs sending a bill to all the other Department and collecting a certain <Col N="283" /> amount of money.  I agree that that is the practice.  There is this difference, however, that that is income for one Department, and the amendment proposes that there should be a tax on another Department.  There is a difference between a tax and an income in the case of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>

The fact is that the only person who can get land is a congest.  If a man's valuation is £25 1s., even though he has ten sons who are growing up and he wants some land for them, he cannot get it from the Land Commission; he must get it himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am on the stamp duty as closely as I can stick to it in view of the argument of the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary.  The Parliamentary Secretary argues that the State should have an advantage over the £10 or £11 farmer, as Deputy Commons points out.  I do not believe the State should.  On the other hand, the Minister says that the State has no advantage.  He told Deputy Allen that he would not be fit to occupy his position if he acted in such a way that the Land Commission would have an advantage over the £10 or the £11 or the £25 1s. man who is trying to relieve congestion in his own family.  The fact is that, under the proposals in this Bill, the Land Commission cannot help having at least a 15 per cent. advantage.</P>

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 23, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with Deputies McQuillan and Commons in this particular matter. The Minister hoisted the flag.  He had a cutlass in his hands.  He had a knife between his teeth, but his teeth were chattering.  He is a very timid revolutionary. He seems to be afraid now that there will be no success in the working of this particular section because he will be outbid by any farmer who has a few pounds.  If the Minister were Deputy Commons, or if Deputy Commons's form could be exhibited in a ministerial capacity, we would have a far better idea where we are.  If Deputy Commons did not suffer some change in taking office, he would at least be quite clear in regard to what he would purport to do and he would leave us in no doubt as to what he would purport to do.</P>
      <P>In regard to the acquisition of land under Section 5, actually the Minister has given himself certain powers under Section 10.  When he starts acquiring land under Section 5 for the relief of congestion and the rearrangement of holdings he will be able to nominate those who get the farms.  He will be able to say what is the amount at which these farms will be sold.  He starts to pretend that he has not taken these powers and now he tells us that he fears that he will not be able to acquire any land because there will be competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see no success that will attend the operation of this section for this reason.  Deputy Commons and Deputy McQuillan, according to what they say, did believe that the relief of congestion was so necessary and so urgent that they would, under the terms of the Bill, go out and get land at any cost. Even though to help them in his efforts to solve congestion the Minister has secured authority to pay the market value, yet he hedges here and says that market value is not market price.  If the Minister is not prepared to pay market price and hedges in any way in regard to the difference between market value and market price, he certainly is not going to get any land.  I wonder if Deputy Commons and Deputy McQuillan are themselves wondering if <Col N="291" /> the Minister is quite serious, and if they do not see some shadow of the white flag being raised in regard to this particular Bill?</P>
    <P>In the discussion on this Bill I have listened all the time with a good deal of interest to Deputy Collins.  He has been surprisingly reasonable and has tried to make the Minister show reason but he has great difficulty in doing that.  When he talks about his knowledge of land and the Land Commission from his second-hand experience, I begin to envy his father's happy home here in Dublin wherever it is, when, like the rest of the inspectors of the Land Commission, he goes home in the evening to discuss all the accumulated wisdom that is to be found in Merrion Street with his son.  I do believe what I am told and do what I am told here in the Fianna Fáil Party and, if I have any shadow of hope, it is that my constituents will do the same.  I do not think that Deputy Collins is quite as familiar with Land Commission procedure as he would lead us to believe, because when he is supporting the Minister in this particular section, I think that he has not grasped the difficulties that will be raised by the section.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan speaking on the section made a plea for codification. We discussed that particular feature of the Bill before and I am glad that Deputy McQuillan has again referred to the great need there is now for it. One particular item of information slipped from Deputy McQuillan.  He talked about farmers' sons getting land.  I want the Minister to be assured that we on this side of the House are not anxious to see farmers' sons getting land under the terms of this Bill.  We are anxious to see land rearranged and congestion dealt with but not the giving of land to landless men because that is not going to bring about the cure of congestion.  If that is in Deputy McQuillan's mind, as apparently it is, I think it is quite unwise.</P>
    <P>I spoke before on this section and vehemently opposed it.  I think it is an innovation that we cannot really afford and one that creates very definite <Col N="292" /> and distasteful interference with ordinary land economics.  I do realise that the powers in the Bill are highly desirable in regard to one particular difficulty that was raised for the Land Commission or rather not for the Land Commission but for certain Deputies from Mayo.  That was in connection with the cottage farm at Ballyhaunis. This was a farm, I admit, which the Land Commission might reasonably have purchased, but if the Land Commission did not acquire or resume that particular farm it really could hardly be described as the fault of the Land Commission.  The position in relation to the farm was that the people in the locality were inclined to let very well alone.  They were able to rent the farm for their purposes in conacre.  It was not until the owner suddenly decided to sell the land that they woke up to the necessity for the Land Commission to acquire it.  The Land Commission could not, and I hope will not ever, interfere with the free sale of land.  I think Deputy Commons did introduce an amendment here which might conceivably be the logical outcome of the acceptance of this section by the Dáil.  Deputy Commons I feel, like Gunga Din, is a brother man to the Minister.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1) Wherever any holding or parcel of land is offered for sale by public auction or private treaty the Land Commission shall be empowered to prohibit such sale or any transfer of title until an examination of such land is carried out and a report made as to the suitability of such land for the creation of migrants' holdings or the rearrangement of rundale or intermixed plots.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the logical development of this section which the Minister wants the Dáil to accept.  The section certainly introduces a new method of land acquisition and it may, if it works, simplify the work of the relief of congestion.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Land Commission will have to remember that they are not dealing with land; they are dealing with human nature, and with human nature in its acquisitive mood. This fact will, I fear, nullify all the powers that the Minister is getting throughout the whole Bill, and particularly <Col N="293" /> in this section, if the Minister proposes to acquire farms under this section.  Having listened to him when he was introducing the Bill, we discovered that what was in his mind was the purchase of farms as going concerns. Conceivably, in view of his needs, what he wants to purchase is the small or the moderate sized farm as a going concern.  This type of farm is the most highly sought after farm in the country by farmers who have made a success on their own, men who have sons and who want to make provision for them, men who have by hard work and thrift gathered a little money together and want to invest it for the benefit of their families.  These people wish to be no burden on the State. They are prepared to stand on their own feet and spend their own money. I think it is wrong that with all the powers the Land Commission have for land acquisition they should go into competition with farmers such as these who, to my mind, are the backbone of the country.</P>
    <P>Before the auction takes place, it is somewhere in Section 10 (1)&mdash;all these sections are as long as an answer to a Dáil question by the Minister for External Affairs&mdash;that there is a determination of the highest offer to be made by the Land Commission in the case of a proposed purchase under Section 23 of this Act.  Let us say a farm in Limerick is put up for sale, and maybe Deputy Madden would be interested and would write to the Minister. Anyhow, there would be some acquisitive genius in West Limerick who would notify the Minister that such farm was for sale, even if his own inspector was not sufficiently alert to discover what was in the auctioneers' bills on the walls.  The Minister, having been informed, would send his inspector down to County Limerick to have a look at the farm.  He would come back to Dublin and make a report on the farm to the Minister and to the Land Commission.  Then the commissioners would go into a huddle and argue up, down and across&mdash;the four of them; we will not have a majority on either side and the Minister will decide finally.  They will decide what the market value of the farm is.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="294" /> Of course, the Minister will not be so dumb as to send down one of his known land inspectors or any fellow with too highly polished boots.  He will possibly send some local fellow to make a bid for the land.  All that might lead, not to success, but to failure, because in the County Limerick people are clannish and it might lead to a good deal of intrigue and dishonesty. The local fellow might find insufficient the price that the commissioners fixed long before even the order came down from Dublin, but whatever he does the market value of that farm will be the price the County Limerick man is prepared to pay for it.  If it is around Abbeyfeale or in South Limerick, we will have acquisitive gentlemen coming over the Border from Kerry with a good deal of money made one way or the other and they will make the Land Commission put up the dibs.  Let the Minister take his courage in his hands if he wants to relieve congestion and let him pay the market price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is to be any success at all in the acquisition of these very desirable farms, which the Kerry men and the Limerick men would make very interesting for the Land Commission, the commissioners and <Col N="295" /> the Minister will have to alter their view in regard to market value.  The result of all this will be a definite inflation of land values, making it much more difficult for people who would buy and work land and who have been hardworking and thrifty enough to collect money for the purchase of land.  It will make it almost impossible for them to live. Not merely will their competition with the Land Commission increase the price, but their competition with one another, because this great pool of land that the Land Commission proposes to take up in this fashion is bound to create an inflationary tendency in the price of land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>This will be the case if everything is straightforward and honest, and if the pongo players of West Limerick in whom Deputy Madden is so much interested get in on the ground floor in this, there will be some interesting happenings.  There will be a lot of the tough boys who will be able to boost the price and put it altogether beyond the reach of the Minister or anybody else.</P>
      <P>I regard this as an unwarranted interference with the ordinary law of economics.  We used to talk about the digging out of the landlords, root and branch.  Tom Kettle put it &ldquo;brute and ranch&rdquo;.  Now, if we can attack the brute and ranch, as has been the fashion up to now and for which there is plenty of scope, the Land Commission has plenty of authority to cease from any interference with the ordinary law of economics and from trying to create a condition of affairs which must make things increasingly difficult for the small farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that something like 250,000 acres of land change hands every year.  That is not abnormal. That is the condition of things that makes way for a new generation, and it is a good thing that it so happens. It makes an opportunity for the coming generation.  In my opinion, the supply <Col N="296" /> of land never reaches the ordinary normal demand.  I think that the Land Commission cannot usefully obtrude itself into this position.  Its transactions will be costly and they will be ineffective. Instead of being a help to a migrant, they will place him in an intolerable position.  If there is a small farm for sale around Holycross or Hollywood in Tipperary and the Land Commission goes down and succeeds in buying it against local farmers, it will be pretty tough on the Mayo men who go into Tipperary.  I believe that this attempt to short-circuit the normal procedure will not bring the fulfilment of the Minister's hopes.  I believe it will bring results that will be evil and that will create jealousies and difficulties. I think that the Minister is altogether ill-advised in pressing the acceptance of this section on the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not share, and I thank God for it, the very gloomy outlook which Deputy Moylan, as the spokesman of his Party, has put forward on this section.  I presume he has put that forward as the view and outlook of his Party on the whole question of land purchase.  He has expressed great concern about the State interfering in the purchase of farms and holdings on the open market.  I do not see that.  The Government has taken its stand on this, that the land which the Land Commission requires for the relief of congestion should be paid for according to its market value. I do not see why there should be this desire to harp back to a system that was definitely unfair and unjust and that, to a certain extent, amounted to confiscation.  We do not stand for that, good or bad.  Great strides have been made towards the relief of congestion for the first time over a long number of years.  The full activities of the Land Commission have been diverted into the one channel&mdash;the relief of congestion.  Deputy Moylan agrees with me now, and I presume that the rest of the Fianna Fáil Party agrees too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not make any contentious statement.  All I am sorry <Col N="297" /> for is that that was not agreed on by Fianna Fáil when they first came into public life and before they wasted a great deal of the substance of this country, and by substance I mean the land.  As I say, I do not want to raise any contentious matters.  I am only regretting something that cannot be undone now.  I do not want to make any political capital out of this.  I do ask the House&mdash;the Opposition and the Government, to turn their faces with me in the direction that the Land Commission is facing, and that is towards the relief of congestion.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that a step forward has been taken in this Bill.  The Deputies who support it have everything to congratulate themselves on&mdash; on taking the State out of the role of confiscator.  There is no other word for it, because people in the past, from whom land had been acquired, did not receive a fair price for it.  I have no regrets.  I am proud of every section in the Bill.  I think that the giving of authority to the Land Commission to go into the open market to tap a hitherto untapped pool of land&mdash;land which comes on to the open market&mdash; is a step in the right direction.  I do not hold any gloomy views whatever about the future of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have every hope that Section 23 will be the success I intend it to be. The Land Commission wants land.  As I said on many previous occasions, they want it on a fairly big scale to relieve congestion and to bring about some finality to their own work.  That is the whole aim and object of the Bill. I do not hold at all to the view which Deputy Moylan has expressed and which I take to be the view of this Party.  I do not agree with these gloomy views at all or with the view that there is not enough land to go around.  There is not, because there would not be any land for the Land Commission to acquire to-morrow if everyone who owns land in this country lived on and worked that land, produced a reasonable amount of food from it and gave a reasonable amount <Col N="298" /> of employment.  There would then be no land for compulsory acquisition.</P>
    <P>All that this Bill does is to give additional powers to the Land Commission and to the Minister in some respects. It gives them a new method of getting land into their possession for certain purposes.  I do not agree that any of the abuses that have been mentioned will arise.  There will be a constant check.  Deputy Moran spoke of devaluation in the price of land as one of the effects of this section.  Deputy Moylan holds the opposite view and says it is going to cause inflation.  It will be the duty of the Minister and of the commissioners, if it produces either of these two effects, not to allow such a serious state of affairs to arise.</P>
    <P>There were great hopes held out by the Minister who introduced the 1933 Land Act.  Certain sections of that Act achieved the purpose for which they were intended.  Certain other sections of it were a complete failure.  I am not guaranteeing that the various sections of this Bill are going to be a complete success.  No Minister could do that, any more than I could foretell where I may be this day month or this day 12 months.  We are doing our best.  I have done my best.  I know the land resettlement question since I was a foot high, and I am doing my best in this Bill to try and meet that problem.  I have said before that the problem of congestion is one that no one living is responsible for.  It is just an evil that this State found itself confronted with when it was set up.  It is one that even a foreign Government had taken steps to try and do something about.  I do say, however, that, after 30 years of self-Government, more should have been accomplished during that time had better steps been taken.  I have no hesitation whatever in recommending Section 23 to the House.  It will not, I believe, cause the evils we are told it will cause.  If evils do arise, surely we can always depend on a Minister for Lands or a sane Government being there to check them.  It will be the duty of any Minister in charge of the Department to do that, otherwise he will fail in his duty.</P>
    <P>I could say a great deal on this but I will not say it.  I certainly hold that this will achieve its purpose, namely, <Col N="299" /> to tap a hitherto untapped pool of land for the Land Commission by a very speedy method.  We have agreed in Section 5 to pay market value for acquired land and not to redeem the annuities out of the purchase money. Having agreed to pay market value for acquired land, I do not see why we should not pay market value for land which is being offered for sale and which in most cases, I believe, will come into the possession of the Land Commission within one month from the date of sale.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister takes a lot for granted.  I take it it is agreed on all sides that it is the duty of the Dáil in passing legislation to see that there is nothing in it which will give rise to any abuses.  This section is definitely a dangerous section in some respects. The object of this section is to enable the Land Commission to purchase land for cash instead of for land bonds.  I do not see any objection to that. Whether they pay in land bonds or in cash does not much matter.  If it simplifies matters for the Land Commission to pay in cash rather than in land bonds, it is all the same so far as the cost to the State is concerned.  That is a principle with which we can all agree.  But, when we allow the Land Commission to attend public sales for the 3 or 4 per cent. of the land of the country that comes on the market every year, in addition to the potential purchasers already there, with all the resources of the State behind them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Of the 15,000,000 acres of land in the country, 3 or 4 per cent. of the total is all that comes on the market every year.  In addition to the potential purchasers of that land, small farmers' sons, middle sized farmers' sons and landless men, we will have the Minister represented by his officers bidding for this 3 or 4 per cent. of land which is for sale every year.  If that is not a dangerous principle, I do not know what is.</P>

      <P>I am pointing out what can happen under this section.  The Minister has not told the Dáil yet why sub-section (5) is in this section, why he considers it necessary to insert this provision: &ldquo;The powers conferred by this section are in addition to, and not in derogation of, any other powers which the Land Commission may have by law for the acquisition or purchase of land or resumption of holdings.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I can point out other things which will happen under this section.  We have had indications for many years and even quite recently of efforts being made to bring pressure to bear on the Land Commission to acquire this farm and that farm.  When the Minister has this power, does anybody think that any farm will go up for sale by private treaty or by public auction without questions being put to the Minister for Lands and the matter being raised on the Adjournment urging the Minister to acquire the farm?  Do we not know that wherever there is a farm for sale there will be local agitation to get the Land Commission to buy that farm?  Every one of us knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Minister's own interest and in <Col N="302" /> the Government's interest, I suggest that the provisions of this section are dangerous and bad and will do damage instead of achieving the purpose the Minister has in mind.  There can be no doubt about that.  Land hunger will be created in areas where it does not exist at the present time.  It is a very easy matter to create land hunger here.  In the last 25 years I have seen land hunger for a particular farm in areas where congestion is scarcely known.  I have seen agitation to force the Land Commission to acquire a particular farm.  I have seen that happen in the Leinster counties.  I have had to resist that many times as a public representative.  This section will create land hunger.  Having the Land Commission coming in to purchase land in competition with the ordinary buyer will create bad feeling.  The Minister should think twice before he forces this section through the House.  As already pointed out, the Minister has a 15 per cent. advantage over the small holder or the person with a few hundreds or a thousand pounds with which he wishes to purchase a holding. The Minister will not pay stamp duty, the ordinary legal registration fees, a solicitor or anyone else.  He has at least a 15 per cent. advantage in some cases and in some cases it will be even higher than that.  That cannot be denied.  There does not appear to be much use in appealing to the Minister in his present mood.  He will charge bull-headed at this power and take it irrespective of the damage it may do to the fabric of the State.  It is just another step towards socialising the land.</P>

      <P>I made it perfectly clear on the Second Reading that I support this Bill in the hope that it will bring land more speedily into the hands of the Land Commission.  I believe, as do most Deputies, that the Land Commission already has sufficient powers to solve the congestion problem. It has compulsory powers to acquire or resume land.  The fact of the matter is that it is not using its present powers as rapidly as it should. That is what worries Deputies who represent the congested areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="303" /> Deputy Ruttledge, a former Minister for Lands, said it was not Land Acts that were required but a reorganisation of the Land Commission.  I think such a reorganisation would accomplish more than this section or any other section will accomplish.  If we could only get a decision within a reasonable period of time we would know what the position was.  Irrespective of whether the decision was advantageous or disadvantageous, the people in the congested areas would know the true position.  If it was decided that a particular problem could not be solved by the acquisition of a particular farm in a particular area, the people would then know that they would have to look for relief somewhere else.  That has never been the position up to this; there does not appear to be any reason why a delay of 20 years should take place before the Land Commission can give a decision.</P>
    <P>If we carry on in the same old way I agree with other Deputies that congestion will never be solved.  But the Minister has taken a new line in this measure.  He proposes to tap a new source of supply in an endeavour to get more land into the pool.  He is prepared to compete for the land put up for public auction.  The land put up for public auction may be more than the Land Commission can buy or more than it intends to buy, working at its speediest.  We have decided now that we will not lumber along under the old rotten system.  We have decided that we must get hold of some of this land that is there to be purchased by anyone with enough money to buy it.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been said about the raw deal the small farmer or his son will get under this Bill when the Land Commission goes into the open market to buy.  We all know that 99 per cent. of the land purchased is not purchased by the small farmer or his son.  Will anybody tell me how the ordinary small farmer with ten, 15 or 20 acres of land could amass enough money to purchase a reasonably sized holding for his son.  Certainly he could not do it out of what he earns on his holding.  It might be done if a particular member of the family emigrated <Col N="304" /> and made sufficient to come home again and settle down here.  We have, too, the gentleman who comes into the country and purchases 20, 25 or 50 acres of land in Co. Mayo and registers that holding as a stud farm and defies the Land Commission to take even a square yard of it.  I merely mention these things to show that the present system is rotten.</P>
    <P>When the Minister comes in here with a proposal which will bring more land into the hands of the Land Commission we should support him.  I do feel, like some other speakers, that this system of open purchase on the open market may be abused.  Deputy Moylan says the middle-class farmer is the backbone of the country, but Deputy Moylan did nothing during his term of office to put a little more backbone into the country.  If one of these middle-class farms should come on the market, surely it should be possible for the Land Commission inspector on the spot to decide whether it would be a suitable farm for the Land Commission to buy.  He can then report to his senior inspector and he, in turn, to the divisional inspector, and thence to the commissioners who will decide what the price should be.  On the information they get from the man on the spot they can decide what the farm is worth and the nominee of the Land Commission can then go down to the public auction.</P>
    <P>I claim that man goes into the auction under a great disadvantage. He may be allowed to offer only £2,000 for a farm which might be worth £2,300 or £2,500.  Despite all the time wasted in travelling, in valuing, in officials' expenses, in the determination of market value here, there and everywhere else, the Land Commission official or the man who acts on behalf of the Minister at this sale may find that, after it all, he is not able to come within a shout of the local bidder or of the local purchaser.  I think that when a Land Commission official is put to it or when somebody is put to do a job like this for the Land Commission, it is almost impossible to lay out a certain figure of money which he may spend.  If the Land Commission official is told by his seniors in Dublin that he has at his command an unlimited <Col N="305" /> supply of money and that the price he will pay for the farm is being left to his discretion, the individual who acts at the sale on behalf of the Land Commission may go beyond the limit and get flush with somebody else's money and pay a very handsome and inflated price.  Therefore, I think that purchase in the open market is a double-edged weapon because it can cut both ways.  It may stint the powers of the Land Commission to purchase the land or, if you allow them too much money, it may drive their hand too far and money may be wasted which might otherwise be used to very good purpose. If we decide&mdash;I assume that this section will be passed&mdash;that land is to be purchased in the open market we are, I admit, treading on very dangerous ground.  We can only try this out as an experiment.  It may be the worst Bill which has ever been introduced in this House and the most extravagant and we may find that out by this time next year but, on the other hand, we may find out that it is one of the best measures that could be introduced in this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen suggests that the Minister's hand will be forced by questions in this House when such and such a farm comes on the market.  I have pointed out here, time and time again, that it is not and should not be the duty of Deputies to raise land questions in this House.  It is the duty of the officials of the Land Commission. Their job is to relieve congestion and to pick up all the necessary land suitable for the relief of congestion.  That is not our job.  We are here to pass laws and legislation.  The civil servants, who are well paid by the State, will operate these laws.  But when you have such a series of red tape, of legal entanglements and so forth in land legislation, it is impossible for any group of men to carry on in the speedy manner in which we should like them to do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moylan was in a very good mood&mdash;he generally is, and I admire him for it.  He told us that if a farm is taken over in Limerick, Tipperary, Abbbeyfeale, Holycross and so forth, and is divided up, it is going to be pretty tough on the poor Mayo man <Col N="306" /> who will be migrated there.  Candidly, I do not believe it will.  I will say that where there is congestion in any county or in any part of this State it will be looked on with a certain amount of dissatisfaction if a migrant is brought in from another county while local congestion exists.  Anxious and all as I am to relieve congestion in Mayo, I feel that if there are congested areas in other counties, the people in the locality should get first preference.  However, we know ourselves that the congestion which exists in counties other than the Western counties is very small indeed.  The poor Mayo man who might be migrated to Meath, to Abbeyfeale, to Holycross and so forth should, I think, be as welcome as perhaps the Aga Khan, the Duke of Westminster or any of those people who can come in and purchase not 22 or 32 statute acres but 22,000 or 32,000 acres if the land is for sale on the open market.  Therefore, Deputy Moylan's argument is no argument to put up against the progress of the Land Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Moylan in a debate rarely omits to introduce the subject of the cottage farm in Mayo. If this Bill were an Act, the cottage farm would have got so much publicity that I have no doubt whatsoever that the congestion in that area would be solved in about 24 hours.  The sale could be completed.  You have, first, the owner willing to sell to the Land Commission.  Secondly, you have the tenants, if they were willing to pay up the extra money.  Agreement could be reached and 40 odd tenants who live on holdings of less than £10 valuation could be satisfied and the holdings brought up to reasonably economic holdings.  I think it is the duty of this Government and of any Government and of the Land Commission to look after those people.  After all, if we had no congested holders we would have no need for the Land Commission. If we had not small farms under £10 valuation we would have no need for the inspectors whose duty it is to relieve congestion or for the hordes of <Col N="307" /> officials who are required in the Department.  Therefore, in fairness to the present Minister and to the present Government, when they decide to go into the open market to purchase land, it is worth a trial anyhow.  We have an assurance that the extra money to be paid will not be put on the back of the incoming tenant&mdash;that it will not be charged to him by means of increased valuation or by means of any of the dozen other ways in which he could be fleeced to pay the extra amount.  Therefore, if we set out to acquire the land which is available for anybody who has the money to pay for it, we should not hesitate to give the matter a trial.</P>
      <P>We have had experience of the system of compulsory powers.  The Congested Districts Board had compulsory powers from the very outset within the congested areas.  I have often said that more is the pity the Congested Districts Board did not extend their powers over the 32 Counties of Ireland, which was then not partitioned. There would have been no need for the Land Commission to be established at all and the Congested Districts Board, with its thorough knowledge of the problems, would have made a much better job of it because they carried on that work with about 12 to 15 less Land Acts than we now have at the present time.  We know ourselves that over £8,000,000 worth of land passed through the hands of the Land Commission in the short space of seven years.  We know that very little more than £8,000,000 worth of land has been purchased for the relief of congestion within the past 32 or 33 years.  Therefore, we can realise that it is rather futile to be passing one Act of Parliament after another when we have no real foundation and no real solid principle to go on.</P>
      <P>Finally, if the Minister decides to introduce this Bill as a new step, we should support him in every way we can.</P>

      <P>When this matter was first raised in this House by a question from Deputy C. Lehane on the 14th March I must say that I was astonished when I read&mdash;I was not in the House when the question was put &mdash;that a document like this had come into the possession of the Deputy.  I am not going into the question whether such a document should be made available to a judge or not.  The Minister has his own views and I do not intend to raise that matter at all.  What I am concerned about, and what everybody in the country should be concerned about, is that when a confidential document of that kind is given to a judge, it certainly should not be brought into this House.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that it is a confidential document, a police report. If that is given to a judge, there is an obligation on the judge to keep that document and return it to the people from whom he got it, namely, the Garda Síochána&mdash;I suppose to the chief superintendent.  Probably a similar report was supplied in my time but the question was never raised. What I am saying is that the judge should keep that document unless he returns it to the police.  If he gave it to an unauthorised person, I say he was lacking in his duty as a judge and if I were Minister, I would deem it my duty to bring in a resolution here that the judge should be dismissed, if it were established that he deliberately gave the document to an unauthorised person. Either that happened or else somebody abstracted the document from the judge's chambers&mdash;in other words, stole it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I saw that Deputy Lehane stated that such a document would be made available, I took it for granted that it would be made available to the Minister and that the Minister would find out where the Deputy got this document which was handed to the judge.  Instead of that we find that the Minister, when I put down a question on the 23rd of March, said that he had not got the document and therefore <Col N="309" /> the matter of the inquiries which I asked him to institute as to how the document came into the Deputy's possession did not arise.  That was all right, but immediately after Deputy Lehane said, raising a paper in his hand: &ldquo;Here is the document; it is available for the Minister.&rdquo;  The Minister was speaking from the Front Bench and he apparently did not see it but several Deputies saw it.  We do not know what it contained but he said that it was the document in question and that it was still available.  I immediately put down a question suggesting that if the document was in the Deputy's hands, it should be available for the Minister and I asked the Minister would he find out how it came into the Deputy's possession.</P>
    <P>As it is as well to be accurate in the matter, I had better begin at the beginning. When the matter was raised on the 14th March the Minister admitted that these reports were given to judges and he added that they contained records of the persons to be tried.  It was Deputy Cowan who said: &ldquo;And their records.&rdquo;  To that the Minister replied: &ldquo;I do not know exactly.&rdquo; It was at this point that Deputy Lehane said, as reported at col. 1744 of the Dáil Debates for March 14th:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If I can satisfy the Minister that the practice exists in some areas of supplying a short summary such as that described by the Minister, setting out records and observations as to character by senior Garda officers, will he then consider whether it is a practice to be continued?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To that the Minister replied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If any such evidence is available I would be delighted to have it but I very much doubt it because that is a confidential report and I do not know how it could be got.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Lehane then put in:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I will undertake to make it available to the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Apparently it has not been made available yet.  I am not blaming Deputy Lehane as much as the Minister because I maintain that it is the Minister's duty, as Minister for Justice, to probe <Col N="310" /> this matter.  It should not be left to a private Deputy, whether on the Opposition Benches or on the other side, to urge the Minister to do a job which obviously is his duty.  As I said in my supplementary question to-day, if the judge gave it away he should not have done it, and if he did not do it, there is only one other way in which the Deputy could have got it.  There may be a third way of which I am not aware but otherwise it could only have been abstracted or stolen from the judge's chambers.  Perhaps there is a third way and perhaps the Minister will be more precise than he has been in the information already given to us.</P>
    <P>I think this is a very serious matter. I do not want to get too heated but it is a matter about which Deputies should be concerned, that a secret document of that kind, a State document, should be used in that manner.  If a Deputy thinks that there is some practice in existence of which he does not approve or with which he does not agree, he has another way of dealing with it.  He can approach the Minister either by writing to him or by a personal interview and tell him that he had discovered that this practice was in existence, that he objected to it and that he thought it should be stopped and that if it was not stopped he would take action in the Dáil to have it stopped.  But actually to flaunt what amounts to a stolen State document in this House is something without precedent.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House much further but it is perfectly obvious to me and to every Deputy that this is a very important matter.  We should like to know what the Minister thinks the effect of this business is going to have on the Garda Síochána, if they are not satisfied that a confidential report is going to be treated confidentially. I am sure the Minister gets confidential reports frequently.  I always got them and I never heard of their being made public in this way. I feel that if they were made public you could not expect any Garda to make a confidential report because he would say: &ldquo;How do I know who is going to get this and what are the consequences going to be for me of <Col N="311" /> making such a report?&rdquo;  Surely, when a document of that kind given to a judge disappears from his possession and is brought up here in the Dáil it is a matter of the utmost seriousness. Certainly it is something into which it is the Minister's obvious duty to inquire.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything more I can say on the matter.  I am sure every Deputy who is a responsible member of this House must realise the seriousness of a matter of this kind. I think it is without precedent.  I have been here since 1927 and I never remember anything like it happening before.  If for no other reason than that this will make it impossible for it ever to occur again&mdash;I think it is well worth raising the matter in the Dáil.  I should like to hear something more from the Minister than I have heard already.  We do not know where we stand now; we do not know how Deputy Lehane got the document because the Minister was not able to tell us if the judge had it in his possession and he does not say that he made any inquiries.  In that way we are left guessing.  I asked the Minister why he had not taken the elementary step of sending to the judge and finding out from the judge what he did&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Lehane deserves the congratulations of this House and of the public for drawing attention to something which no person knew existed.  Deputy Boland has referred to the particular document as being a secret State document. If such a document was produced by a Garda officer to the judge, it was an illegal document which ought not to have been given by the superintendent of the Garda to the judge <Col N="312" /> about to try the prisoner, telling the judge that the particular prisoner to be tried before him was a prisoner who had been, perhaps, convicted on a number of occasions, naturally prejudicing the mind of the judge in regard to that particular prisoner. Now, if, in the course of the trial, a Garda officer or a State prosecutor gave in open court information with regard to the record of the accused person, that would vitiate and nullify the proceedings.

      <P>Very well, I will not.  I think I have made the point I wanted to make, very effectively.  What is raised here is a question of considerable importance to Deputies.  If any Deputy in this House is aware of a certain practice which he might consider objectionable, it is the duty of that Deputy to raise that matter here. Deputy Lehane has done that.  The Minister to-day stated that that practice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am dealing with this question.  It is suggested here that if a Deputy refers to a document at Question Time the Minister is entitled to get that document from that particular Deputy&mdash;that the Minister is entitled to take some action, whether it is punitive or otherwise.  I say as a Deputy that the Minister has no power to do that, that there is no power in the Minister to take any action against a Deputy who tells the Minister or the House that he has in his possession a particular document.</P>

      <P>No, Sir.  To suggest a document is stolen is a very serious matter; to suggest a document has been handed over by the judge is also a very serious matter; to suggest that the judge who handed over the document is unfit to be on the Bench is a very serious matter.  I say that Deputy Boland, having given those alternatives, might have given another one&mdash;that the judge who received such a document should in open court have condemned the practice. That is another alternative that Deputy Boland has not mentioned.</P>

      <P>These are the observations that I wish to make in regard to this matter.  I think that every Deputy in the House is concerned in regard to that.  Can we, in the discharge of our public duties in this House, refer to a particular matter and state we have documents to prove it? The proof, in fact, was not required in this case, because the Minister has ascertained that the practice did exist and he has ordered it to be discontinued. I think every individual Deputy has a right in this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (General MacEoin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Boland put down a very important question to-day and I want to say I appreciate fully the duty he performed in putting it down.  That question was as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Justice whether, in view of the fact that a Deputy produced at Question Time on March 23rd what he stated to be a confidential police report, which had been supplied to a Circuit Court judge, and which he indicated he was making available to the Minister, he will now set up an official inquiry to discover how this confidential document came into the Deputy's possession.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I replied to that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the document in question is put into my possession I shall consider what action, if any, I will take on the matter.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Boland was not satisfied with that reply and he has raised the matter now on the Adjournment.  I am not going to follow either Deputy Cowan or Deputy Lehane, nor do I intend <Col N="315" /> to follow Deputy Boland in all the points he has raised.  I think some of them were not exactly in order, but, however, Deputy Boland, when he put down that question, and in the speech that he has made on the Adjournment, has not specified what sort of inquiry I should hold.  He reproaches me for not inquiring from the Circuit Court judge how the document left his possession.  How on earth would I find out what judge it was?  I do not know which of the judges lost it and the Deputy reproaches me for not inquiring from them how it left a particular judge's possession.  I am told that there is a document in the House, but I do not know what judge it was who parted with it.  Does Deputy Boland or anybody else, or does the Government, expect me to go down to the judges and say: &ldquo;Some of you did something&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>I told you to-day that I would do my duty, and I am not disputing that you did yours, but the Deputy could not address such a question to the judges.  I want to repeat now for the information of all Deputies what I said in the House to-day, that if a confidential document which should not have left official custody comes into the custody of a member of the House he should hand it over to the responsible Minister, whoever that Minister may be, but Deputies must be left to interpret their obligations in this as in other matters in accordance with their own view of what is right and what is fitting without any homily or lecture from me whatever.</P>
      <P>I would say, in conclusion, that I think both Deputies have served very well by putting down the questions that they have put down.  Deputy Lehane has stopped something which, I think, should not be done and which, I think, my predecessors were not aware of.  I was not aware of it until the question was put down.  Deputy Boland has brought a very important point to the mind of every Deputy in this House.</P>

I want to warn all Deputies that if a document like that comes into their possession they should remember that they have a duty to perform to the State by handing it over to the Minister &mdash;not waving it behind backs&mdash;and if I ask them how they got it they should tell me the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.</P>
