      <P>asked the Taoiseach, with reference to the reply to a question on 24th May, if he will state what machinery is available whereby the acquisition of land by non-nationals has been and is being kept under observation and if he is satisfied that this machinery is adequate for the purpose in question.</P>

      <P>As regards the period 1944-1950, the Minister for Lands obtained from the Land Commission inspectors details of cases where, to their knowledge, land was purchased by persons other than Irish citizens.  A summary of these reports is regarded as a reasonably reliable measure of such transactions for that period.  From 1st April, 1948, a record has been kept of all cases in which the 25 per cent. stamp duty imposed by Section 13 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947, has been paid, and in the future these records will be furnished regularly to the Central Statistics Office, where they will be summarised and kept under review.  In occasional cases where particulars of acreage are not available when the documents are presented for payment of the stamp duty, the required details will be ascertained by subsequent inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed record will be incomplete in so far as it will not contain particulars of cases in which purchases of land by persons other than Irish citizens are exempted from payment of the 25 per cent. duty by sub-section (13) of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947, <Col N="902" /> but it will, in my judgment, be adequate for the purpose in view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's records are not kept in a form to enable the precise information sought by the Deputy to be supplied without examination of a considerable number of individual records and I do not feel the time and labour involved would be justified.  I might say, however, that during the year ended 30th April last, 339 applications for unemployment assistance from Dublin were recommended for refusal by the Dublin court of referees on the grounds that the applicants were not genuinely seeking and unable to obtain suitable employment.  The recommendations were accepted in all these cases.</P>
      <P>The only applications for unemployment assistance from Dublin disallowed on the grounds indicated and not included in the figure given above would be cases where an application was refused by the statutory officer and the applicant did not appeal to the court of referees.  The number of such cases would be very small.</P>

They have held 77 meetings, of which ten were half-day meetings, 66 were full-day meetings and one was of one and a half day's duration.  I understand the commission does not propose to submit an interim report.

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will state the names of the countries with which Ireland has entered into treaties or agreements to afford special facilities to non-nationals to purchase property in this State and the dates on which these treaties or agreements were signed.</P>

      <P>Section 3 of the Aliens Act, 1935, provides that, subject to law, all non-Irish nationals without exception may acquire, hold and dispose of real property in Ireland to the same extent as Irish nationals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No special facilities have been afforded by treaty or agreement to any class of non-Irish nationals to purchase property in the State.  Only two international agreements have been made by Ireland with foreign states dealing with the right of aliens to acquire real property in this country, namely, the <Col N="904" /> Treaty of Commerce and Navigation with Germany ratified on the 21st December, 1931, and the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation with the United States signed on the 21st January, 1950, but not yet ratified. These agreements, which are of reciprocal nature, merely confirm the rights given by the Aliens Act and do not add to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.D. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not feel that it would be desirable to bring to the notice of those who are anxious to confiscate property held by non-nationals in various parts of the country the rights that they have under the Aliens Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is hardly any suggestion of confiscation arising in this question or out of the reply that I have given to the Deputy.  As a matter of fact, far from the question of confiscation being involved, non-Irish nationals are compelled to pay an additional tax if they purchase Irish land.</P>

      <P>As regards part (2) of the question, the injury warrant made under Section 1 of the Superannuation Act, 1887, does not deal with payment of medical or hospital expenses.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that, so far as these injured officers are concerned, all reasonable expenses will be met from State funds.</P>
      <P>As regards the last part of the Deputy's question, the warrant made in 1946 under Section 1 of the Superannuation Act, 1887, makes provision for special payments to civil servants seriously and permanently incapacitated as a result of injuries received on duty, and to their dependents, where the officer's remuneration is over £500 a year.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state whether American visitors to Ireland pay their hotel and other expenses in dollars or sterling; and, if the latter, if he will advise, recommend or order that such payments should be in dollars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="921" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no power to make regulations as to the form in which Irish residents accept payment from American visitors, and if I had such power I would certainly not contemplate asking Americans to undergo restrictions and formalities which are not applicable to visitors from other countries.</P>
      <P>An American visitor is entitled to discharge his obligations in local currency. In the normal course he has obtained such local currency by selling dollar currency, or negotiable drafts bought by him with dollars, and to an Irish bank or <i>bureau de change.</i></P>
      <P>Where the American visitor has made an hotel booking in advance, my information is that such advance bookings are normally made through a travel agency which pays the Irish hotel for the accommodation.  It is clearly necessary that an American travel agency which makes such a booking should pay the Irish hotel in dollars or their equivalent, and equally, that an Irish travel agency which has received dollars or their equivalent from its principal should pay the Irish hotel by local cheque or other local currency.  Where American visitors book through a British travel agency accommodation in Irish hotels as part of a tour of these islands, the British agency will usually (unless it arranges for payment in dollar form through its New York office) make payment to the Irish hotels in sterling in accordance with sterling area arrangements.  It would be out of line with our membership of the sterling area for the exchange control to insist that, in the case of these payments, an exception should be made to the general arrangements under which debts between Irish and British residents are paid in Irish currency or sterling as the case may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be understood that in those cases where accommodation in Irish hotels for American visitors is paid for in sterling via British agencies, the corresponding dollars are not lost to this country but will form part of our dollar earnings for which we can claim credit in the sterling area dollar pool. At the same time I would much prefer that such cases should be exceptional, <Col N="922" /> and I hope that so far as possible bookings will be made by American visitors and paid for in the alternative ways which bring directly to account through the Irish banking system the proceeds of this most important source of dollar income, the development of which can help so greatly to reduce our dollar deficit.  Irish hoteliers and Irish travel agencies can co-operate in securing these direct dollar payments to the maximum, and I am sure that they will do their best to achieve that result.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night at the Adjournment I made one comment which I should like to make again.  It is that the Minister has been able to show a substantial economy, if you like to call it that, in expenditure on food subsidies but he has only been <Col N="923" /> able to show that at the expense, particularly, of a certain class of people to whom I referred and that unfortunately the over-all expenditure of the Government can reflect no such economy.  In fact, there is a very big increase.  Therefore, it is questionable whether the procedure of the dual price system adopted by the Minister in this regard is equitable or desirable, particularly as it has the net result that opportunities for economy or for finding money, if you like, apparently pass without any net benefit to the Exchequer as a whole.  That seems to be the picture.  Here undoubtedly, and I think it was to be expected, was the opportunity, as time went on, for saving considerable sums of money that were necessarily expended during the war on food subsidies.  We have saved that money, apparently, but what have we to show for it?  State expenditure as a whole continues to increase. Those savings have been eaten up in that increase.  In connection with that remark, too, one naturally adverts to the trend of affairs in this country since the war.  We were one of the fortunately placed countries in Europe.  Trends here were naturally favourable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our criticism is that this Government, in its taking over, reversed many of these favourable trends, halted them, or did not take full advantage of them and that the effect of that is that many of the opportunities we have had in two years are lost.  If anybody wants to controvert me on that statement I can point to just a few figures succinctly.  There is, first, the question of opportunities for saving, lost with mounting expenditure.  There is, then, the question of employment.  After this Government came into office there was a serious increase in unemployment and the favourable trend which they took over was reversed.  To some extent that has been corrected, but the corrections indicated by the Minister in his speech are only part of the story &mdash;and unfortunately the over-all picture does not show as favourable a position as the Minister would seem to indicate.  In his speech in regard to employment the Minister pointed out <Col N="924" /> that the numbers engaged in industrial production had risen from 184,000 in 1948 to 206,000 in 1949 and that the comparable figure in 1938 was 166,000. One has to put on the other side, to balance the figures given by the Taoiseach on the 2nd May of this year in regard to employment on the land. In 1947 the total number employed on the land was 507,568; in 1948 the figure was 499,542 and in 1949 the figures was 452,500.  According to these figures, all of them given by Ministers, there was a decrease in the numbers employed on the land of 47,000, and there was an increase in the numbers employed in industry of 22,000 as between 1948 and 1949.  Now I admit that in making that comparison&mdash;and I safeguard myself from this criticism straight away&mdash;one may say that the comparison has to be adjusted by taking into account that some of those who left employment on the land may have been engaged elsewhere. That does not affect, however, the general contention which I am making that even though in a specific department the Minister is showing a favourable situation&mdash;we are glad to see it in that department&mdash;the trouble in the case of employment just as in the case of cost of living and of these food subsidies and the economies which I have mentioned is that while there is some improvement in a particular department in each case the overall drift or trend is unfavourable.</P>
    <P>A bare reference to the figures in regard to emigration is sufficient to show that they are patently unfavourable. I think the last figure was about 18,000&mdash;where there had been, to put it at its worst, a balance in the year before they took over.  There are 18,000 as against 12,000 for the year before and a favourable trend the year before that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>You took over a <Col N="925" /> favourable trend in regard to emigration. There was a net flow back to the country in the last year of the Fianna Fáil Government.  The Minister and his Government had 12,000 in their first year and it was followed by 18,000.  The figures have been going steadily up according to the official statistics since the Government assumed office.  That is the only point I am making.</P>
      <P>Now, in regard to unemployment, it soared after the Minister went into office.  It has been corrected recently. I am pointing out that the figures in regard to the land must be taken as a counterbalance to the figures which the Minister has given.</P>
      <P>As Labour Deputies have pointed out the cost of living has become a serious problem though it is rather hard to understand what Deputy Davin said yesterday.  He said that, although the cost of certain commodities had increased, the increase given to the workers had more than offset the increase in essential commodities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>So much for the past.  There are certain matters arising from the Minister's Estimate that are important and that can be disturbing.  It is more a question of over-all planning and looking ahead than of specific detail.  We should be conditioned by two general ideas.  One of them is that we know from experience that the best approach to our problems is the self-reliant approach; that the best general policy for us economically is one of relying on ourselves and on our resources to the <Col N="928" /> greatest extent possible and to develop these resources.  We know from experience that that is probably the best thing for us; we know from the experience of a past emergency and from what common sense tells us, that that particular policy would be the best for us in case of emergency.</P>
    <P>We know that we have, by and large, as in every country, a defence problem in the sense that a crisis could conceivably come and its repercussions would be felt here.  That is a matter which has ramifications in practically every Department of Government, but in regard to this particular Minister it is all important both from the normal peace-time point of view and the defence point of view that our industry be organised on as self-reliant a basis as possible; that it is organised so as to leave us as little dependent on outside as possible, and that it is properly distributed and co-ordinated with other activities and with possible defence requirements.</P>
    <P>That general approach is valid whether one looks at it from the long-term, peace-time point of view or from the point of view of defence.  One of the things one notices in surveying our industrial economy is that, whereas over a period of 20 years we have been making efforts, with some success, at developing industries and at distributing industries over the country, many of these industries are not the sort which contribute to that self-reliance to the extent that other types of industries possibly could. Admittedly, in the starting of industries, one finds it difficult to pick and choose.  One has to take opportunities as they offer.  Now the time has come where we have the experience and where we should be able to make a serious effort to establish certain basic industries related to our problem of living, whether in peace or war.</P>
    <P>As a specific example, take the production of fertilisers.  I referred to this on other occasions and perhaps I will be allowed to do so again.  The production of fertilisers, particularly nitrogenous fertilisers, would naturally have a lasting value for us as an agricultural country.  We should have a market at home.  We do import considerable <Col N="929" /> quantities of these substances. We know that during the last war a very serious shortage of these substances arose because of import difficulties. It should be possible for us to develop and industry here to produce these fertilisers, to produce them basically and not merely process raw materials that come in.  A certain percentage of raw materials will have to be imported, but some contribution could be made basically at home.</P>
    <P>In particular for nitrogen fertilisers the raw material is literally fresh air, if you have got the power.  We have certain reserves of phosphate, but probably not enough completely to meet our requirements over a long period.  We certainly have a sufficient amount to ensure that you will not be starved of phosphate in a time of shortage, if you have made adequate preparation for its use in advance. You have a strong case for developing such an industry.  It is an industry that would give employment.  Counting the agencies of distribution, it would be an asset from the employment point of view as well as a saving of foreign currency.  It would certainly be a means of obviating the need for spending money abroad for those substances as well as leaving one relatively secure in a time of crisis.  The Minister admitted it is an important matter.</P>
    <P>That particular industry has another attractive feature for us.  In these modern days a chemical industry is practically a <i>sine qua non</i> for any civilised country.  We have been particularly deficient in that.  Here is the place to start.  You could have a chemical industry around a fertiliser industry.  You could make a start in that regard also, and so minimise our total dependency not only in regard to fertilisers but also in regard to certain essential chemicals.  The Minister said on the last occasion when I questioned him that this matter was before the industrial authority.  I hope it is. This problem was receiving some consideration to my own knowledge at the end of the war.  Almost four years have elapsed and surely we should now be in a position to know something definite about that problem. <Col N="930" /> My information is that before the war the problem of nitrogen fixation had almost got to the contract stage, but it was upset by events on the Continent in 1938-39.</P>
    <P>If this authority is going to do anything, if it is going to be an active force in industrialisation as the Minister mentioned, surely this is one of the activities where we could expect a quick result.  That authority has been criticised here mainly in regard to its powers and functions.  It was criticised also because there seemed to be no promise that it would effectively achieve industrial development.  Here is a particular task that this body could do if it is seriously applied to it. The building and development of such key industries against all the economic and other difficulties that would be in the way will require active Government intervention and a drive from Government quarters.  Here is a body which can be the Minister's agent.  It will have all the facilities necessary. Already a research organisation has been set up.  That is apparently somewhat slow in getting to the operational stage, but the Minister mentioned that facilities are being provided, and he hopes the institute will become an effective force in Irish industrialisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is any slowness there it is only fair to the research council to say it was not their fault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite accept that. I do not want to digress.  The point is that it could be a very useful force, an adjunct to this industrial body, if we are serious in our attempts to set up industries of fundamental importance such as the one I have mentioned.  These industries have a greater claim to priority than more easily established industries, industries which, in the last analysis, will be found to depend on the import of raw materials.  Some similar remarks could be made in regard to the iron and steel industries and in regard to cement.  The necessity for looking ahead in the planning of industries of this nature is apparent from our experience during the war. <Col N="931" /> Although I have no actual figures before me I am under the impression&mdash; and I think it is accurate&mdash;that many industries here which had been started and which had been relatively prosperous before the war, found themselves in serious difficulties because of a shortage of raw materials and because of difficulties arising from the war.  They were industries which depended ultimately, to some extent, on outside and when the war came they had to restrict their activities and some personnel engaged in these industries had to go abroad or become unemployed.  That experience alone would indicate a certain lack of balance in our industries from time to time. I think the time has now come, particularly as another crisis may be in the offing, to try and adjust that balance.  I think we should tend to concentrate on industries which can be maintained under conditions of isolation, industries which are important from the point of view of keeping the wheels turning here at home in times of isolation, and industries which are important for keeping other industries going and which will, if it can be at all achieved, supply the deficiencies which were so marked when we were cut off from outside sources of supply during the emergency.</P>
      <P>That is one aspect of the problem.  I have mentioned only one industry in that regard, the chemical industry, but there are many others that could be considered.  We are not, however, in an altogether unfavourable position, since the Minister's predecessor and the Minister himself have pursued the first requirement for any industrialisation, namely the provision of power. That has been properly pursued by the Minister and the Minister's predecessor. It must continue to be pursued because the whole basis of successful industrialisation will depend, to a great extent at any rate, on the availability of power at an economic cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all, we should have sufficient raw materials to meet certain basic needs&mdash;whether basic needs for agriculture, such as fertilisers, basic needs for industries which heretofore had to <Col N="932" /> import so often raw materials, and the basic needs of the community as a whole in time of possible economic isolation.  There will be difficulties.  As I say, it will not be sufficient to leave that problem merely to the initiative of private persons, it will need the active intervention and drive of the Minister and his Department in collaboration with this authority, if it is to be a live force and the Research and Standards Bureau which is already provided.</P>
    <P>Tied up with that is the question of our natural resources such as they are. So far as nitrogen is concerned, while we have power, that need not be a problem.  We have some small reserves of phosphate which should be a guarantee for an emergency.  We are short of metals admittedly but there are certain other substances which we should be able to get.  On another debate we had the question of mineral development.  That is a problem, approaching which one can be either too pessimistic or too optimistic but the point is we should have a proper survey and exploit what there is to exploit.  Tied up with that aspect and the other aspect I have mentioned, there should always be the one paramount aim, the aim to be as self-reliant as we possibly can in fundamentals. However, many people will realise that under modern conditions, with modern standards of living and all the other complex factors that come into the picture, complete self-sufficiency is hardly a realisable ideal.  No matter how one can plan, one will find oneself up against such problems as shortage of petrol supplies which was a very serious matter during the last war and in regard to which we could hardly have provided the deficiency from home resources even if we had tried our best for years beforehand. Even during the last war there were problems of storage for petrol and for other commodities.  These problems can arise again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  In spite of the fact that we can grow our own beet and make our own sugar, it seems that we are likely to have a possible <Col N="933" /> sugar problem too.  The point I want to make is that, by proper organisation and by tackling the problem now, in the relatively favourable situation we have, by learning from our experiences during the past war, we can go a long way by proper organisation of our industry to make ourselves self-reliant. Complementary to that, particularly if you are going to face a crisis&mdash;I admit that my approach to this is coloured by the fact that I fear we may have to approach a crisis, although I hope we may not&mdash;complementary to the industrial approach, we have the question of storage and the question of having adequate stocks on hands at all times in advance, in other words, the problem of being prudent. That, of course, will cost something, but one will have to put up with the expense.  During the last war, our storage accommodation for petrol, for grain, for many things was quite inadequate, and the lack of proper storage facilities was one of the great difficulties for the Department of which the Minister is in charge and for the Department which was a child of the Minister's Department in a sense, the Department of Supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now is the time to learn from the lessons of the past.  It should be possible for us to see that we have storage accommodation for petrol and for grain, that the stocks are kept up, that adequate stocks of raw materials are available to us and are kept on hands as long as there is a threat that a crisis may come.  That is of importance to us just as the industrial problem is of importance.  Whether we are involved in war or whether we are not, no matter what view you take, no matter with whom you are associated or with whom you are not, our own people will have to live and life will have to go on here at home.  In order to ensure that can happen with a reasonable degree of comfort and a proper degree of ability for our people to live at home, these two aspects should be examined in the light of the knowledge we have experienced in that regard in the past.  I have been tempted to labour that aspect of the problem by reading a letter which appeared in the <i>Irish Times</i> to-day from a past Minister of the United <Col N="934" /> States of America in this country.  The letter is headed &ldquo;Dangerous Delusions&rdquo;. In that letter he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In June, 1943, I recommended to my Government that it exert, jointly with England, a limited pressure by withholding raw materials for Irish manufacturers.  As Secretary of State Hull recounts in his memoirs this recommendation was under consideration until the following December when, on the advice of Mr. Eden, the English Government decided to take no action.  I regretted this decision at the time, and have increasingly regretted it as I have observed the development of Irish foreign policy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later on he referred to the fact that we were economically dependent on England.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the urgency of the problem is apparent to all.  I have appealed to the Minister to tackle the problem of the basic industries now that he has the problem of power well under control.  That was admittedly a priority.  The next step then is to see that there is adequate storage space, first of all, and then adequate stores of raw materials to fill that space.  I do not think it is too early to tackle these problems.  We must not forget that the Head of the present Government and the Minister for Defence have reiterated the policy that this State will pursue in the event of a crisis.  They have pointed out that that policy must be conditioned largely by the division of the country.  Be that as it may, that is the definitely stated policy and presumably the Government is sincere in its promulgation and its profession of that particular approach and that particular policy. But such protestations are useless; such protestations are a danger and a menace unless we do something actively to make the fulfilment of such a policy a reality and put ourselves in a position to pursue that policy.  The <i>sine qua non</i> for that is self-reliance in every possible aspect of our life.  It is iortunate that one can press that home and demonstrate the importance of it irrespective of decisions that may be made either in regard to neutrality or active participation.  We at least, as was pointed out on another occasion, have this fortunate fact in our favour; our approach in these matters must be fundamentally the same on either hypothesis and it is not necessary, therefore, to direct ourselves to arguments <Col N="936" /> as to the pros and cons of one course as against the other.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but the point is of such importance in regard to industry also I think it is no harm to mention it.  Whether we look at it purely from a peace-time point of view or from the point of view of preparation for an emergency, I would urge upon the Minister the paramount necessity of developing our basic industries. I refer to the type of industry such as fertilisers and allied chemical industries as against those&mdash;and they were mentioned by the Minister in his speech&mdash;which are not to be minimised but which depend completely on imported raw materials and are of such nature as not to contribute immediately to the essential life of the community. They are also in danger of dislocation or collapse should they become isolated from their source of supply. The Minister is in a position to implement the proposals I have made.  It is vitally essential that our basic industries should be developed.  It is also essential that there should be adequate storage accommodation and adequate stocks.  I would ask the Minister that his Department should in all these matters bear defence requirements in mind.  For example, there are already two power stations in Dublin practically beside one another&mdash;just across the river from one another.  I believe there is another power station which will not be very far from there contemplated. That is open to objection from a defence point of view right away.  I merely mention it as illustrative of the type of consideration I should like the Minister to keep in mind in regard to dispersal.  As regards our power stations, particularly, the more and the more dispersed we have of them the better from that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I promised the Minister that I would bring in the unemployment figures.  I have them here now.  I refer the Minister to the Statistical Abstract for 1949. In February, 1948, the change of Government took place.  What I said <Col N="937" /> was that there had been an increase in the unemployment figures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Soaring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, soaring, because the increase was maintained over a year.  If the Minister compares the figures given on page 109 of the Abstract with the figures given on page 52 of the journal for March, 1950 &mdash;the total live register&mdash;he will find that these figures month by month are up for 1948 over 1947.  That is what I said happened&mdash;that unemployment over the Minister's first year of office was up.  I said that the trend had been favourable prior to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the comparison between March, 1950, and February, 1948?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I was careful to limit it to the first year.  Admittedly, the figures at the moment are better. My point was that a trend which was favourable in that regard was reversed. If the Minister will look up what I said on the Vote on Account&mdash;I think it was a year or two years ago&mdash;he will find the figures which I then gave.  I regret that I have not got them by me now, but they were not challenged. The point was that the advent of the present Government was marked by an adverse dip in regard to these essential matters which I mention.  I have made the point and I want to make the point&mdash;I shall leave it at that.  The fact of the matter is that we have not made the best of trends which were fundamentally favourable to us then. I still say it, though the Minister may smile.  I think I can go a long way to substantiate that statement in figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When all is said and done perhaps the Minister and I could agree on this at least: That if he could tackle those two fundamental aspects of the problem I mentioned in an over-all way and get established here those basic industries which are needed, properly dispersed if possible, and get provision made for supplies, then much of our possibility for complaining about the present Minister or his Government or his Department would very definitely be gone.  Apart from that, I feel that <Col N="938" /> unfortunately there is a certain urgency in the situation&mdash;an urgency which I do not want in any way to magnify; an urgency which in the last analysis we all hope may be more apparent than real.  But we have no way of being certain of that at the moment and the signs are there.  Taking all the things I have mentioned there is only one line for us, a small people, and we have had very fortunate opportunities in the past of learning lessons without undue strain on ourselves. In the years from 1939 to 1945 there were God-given opportunities for learning a lesson without undue hardship or suffering to ourselves.  We may not be so fortunate if such a situation should arise again.</P>
    <P>Lastly, as I have said before, I should like to stress again that all my remarks apply equally on whatever view one takes of our precise position if such a crisis should come.  In any or all events, that particular approach seems to be the best one for us.  The thing is that words are not enough; it is the deeds that count.  I ask the Minister particularly to advert to this matter.  He said my statement in regard to fertilisers is under consideration. That was a month or a few months ago.  I should like to know what has been done in the meantime, what is the present position and what forecasts the Minister can make in that respect.</P>

In so far as the <Col N="939" /> present Minister can be saddled with responsibility, I think the figures which the Minister has quoted are a complete answer to the figures produced by Deputy de Valera.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so I am afraid I was not here when they were being quoted.  Surely, if we are to fix responsibility for any figures of employment, or unemployment, these are the figures the responsibility for which must be taken by the present Minister. However, it was one of the latter points made by Deputy de Valera, and I thought that I should deal with it lest perhaps it might slip my memory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this country had had a normal history and had centuries of economic, cultural and political independence behind it, Deputies would be able to approach the questions which arise on the various Estimates in a completely different manner from that which, is forced upon us by our history.  Of necessity we must approach all our problems from the point of view that we are a nation trying to restore a balance, trying to make up leeway, trying to correct the wrong biases that have been left to us by the past whether those be industrial or political. Therefore, to a large extent I find myself in agreement with the approach which Deputy de Valera brought to this Estimate even though I find myself in violent disagreement with many of the conclusions which he drew.  What the Dáil would be entitled to expect from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, introducing his Estimate here, can, I suggest, be judged by that <Col N="940" /> standard.  To what extent does the Estimate which the Minister has introduced and the case which he makes for it show wise planning to redress a wrong bias, to make up the leeway that is the heritage of our history?</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera stated in the course of his remarks that self-sufficiency is something which is not attainable. Absolute self-sufficiency is something of course which is not unobtainable for us.  It is probably even unobtainable for countries with much greater resources, a greater diversity of types of production, and with greater mineral wealth than we have; but our efforts must be directed towards achieving the maximum degree of self-sufficiency attainable. Judging the present Minister by that standard, while it may not be possible to embark on a spree of laudatory commendation, nevertheless, I cannot see that we have any real reason gravely to fault him.  I believe that that problem is before the Minister's mind.  I believe that, when he surveys the industrial field, he views it with the attainment of that ideal fixed before him to whatever degree it is possible to achieve it.  Deputy de Valera, I do not know whether advisedly or not, delivered himself in forceful tones here of a whole lot of statements and sentiments which are of course common case amongst Deputies, no matter on which side of the House they sit. I do not know whether Deputy de Valera sought by his forcefulness to suggest that it was only from the benches of the Fianna Fáil Party that these sentiments could be expressed with sincerity.  I do not want to impute that desire to him, but if that desire existed, let me repudiate it as strongly as I can for the Deputies who sit on these benches The Deputies of the present Dáil believe in continuing to strive for the ideal of economic independence. I believe that the vast majority of thinking Deputies realise that that economic independence has not yet been achieved.  I believe that the vast majority of thinking Deputies believe that it will require strenuous and unremitting work to achieve it, but that it can be achieved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="941" /> Deputy de Valera dismissed an interjection from Deputy Hickey with a disarming smile.  I would like to say that I do not think Deputy Hickey's interjection can be so readily dismissed. I do not believe that it is possible for us ever to achieve economic independence in the fullest possible degree while the control of our banking and insurance interests is, in the main, left in the hands of non-nationals.  I do not want unduly to widen the scope of the debate by dealing with our banking position.  It might be suggested, perhaps, that by doing so I was advocating legislation in view of the existing state of our law, but, without advocating legislation at all, I am entitled to deal with the economic stranglehold that foreigners have on our insurance undertakings.</P>

      <P>I think I am correct in saying that, as against approximately 14 Irish undertakings, there are 65 foreign insurance companies operating in this country, and 51 foreign syndicates transacting and controlling a far greater volume of business than is controlled or transacted by Irish offices.  Under the Insurance Act of 1936, provision was made for the setting up of a body to deal with reinsurance. I do not know whether the exigencies of the emergency period will be advanced as a reason why that was not done by the predecessors of the present Minister.  I do not know whether it has been pointed out to the present Minister.  It is something of which he must be aware, and it is something which, I would urge upon him, merits his early and his earnest consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy de Valera discussed the possibility of a world crisis presenting us with new industrial problems for solution.  He suggested to the Minister that he was in the fortunate position that, no matter whether he held the view that that crisis was likely to develop or not, the steps open to him were the same.  I do not believe that that is a view with which <Col N="942" /> I would find myself 100 per cent. in agreement.  I have always held the view&mdash;it is a personal view to which I have given expression in this House on another occasion&mdash;that for a country placed as we, we should have (a) a normal economy, but that side by side with that there should be (b) the framework of an emergency economy which we could operate in order to preserve for ourselves the bare minima of life during an emergency period.  In a world such as the world we live in to-day, that may be something which the Minister may think worthy of consideration or worthy of comment by him; certainly I believe it is a matter that should be examined.  Let me put it this way, that while we work and plan for an economy based on normal circumstances as we know them, and say that is the type of economy which we wish to operate, at the same time there should be the plan and framework of an emergency economy which could be operated in times of crisis and in times of isolation.</P>
    <P>On this Estimate last year reference was made by many Deputies, including myself, to industrial projects, about which we expected to hear from the Minister.  I would like to ask him what progress, if any, has been made, or what consideration has been given to the projected plans for an oil refinery. I would like to inquire to what extent the fleet of Irish shipping has been augmented since the occasion of the debate last year.  I would like to endorse what has been said by other Deputies about the necessity for proceeding with the plans for the production of ammonia and fertiliser production generally.  I would like to hear from the Minister what he proposes in connection with the development of Irish steel and the future of the Dublin dockyard, the Dublin graving yard, and what decision has been made, or if there is likely to be a return to the decision made in 1938 in connection with the manufacture here of cycle parts.</P>
    <P>I should point out to the Minister that most of these are matters concerning which questions have been frequently addressed to him and are matters on which comment has been <Col N="943" /> made in previous debates on this Estimate.  Many Deputies feel like I feel, that they would like to hear from the Minister something concrete about these various projects.</P>
    <P>I agree that our industrial development should, of necessity, concentrate on industries ancillary to agricultural industries for which we have the raw materials readily available.  I suggest that the Minister should take into account also the whole question of rendering us as self-sufficient as it is possible for us to be during a time of crisis.</P>
    <P>The great tragedy about our industrial history for the last 28 or 30 years has been that, instead of being approached from the point of view of a nation unitedly tackling a job of work, it has to a large extent been the plaything of Party politics.  That is something which in the past retarded our development industrially.  I think it is due to the Minister's predecessor to say this, that during portion, at any rate, of his time in office he did do a good job of work for the nation in giving an impetus to industrial development generally, and in getting people to realise that we were not necessarily a cabbage garden whose sole function was to export food to England.  That idea, I think, has been killed.  That idea is one with which we will not be troubled in the future.  The solution of our problems still requires, however, a united approach from all sides to this whole question of the planning of our industrial and economic future, and it is only by that united approach that we can get the maximum degree of achievement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass yesterday, in a manner that I thought was hardly worthy of him, sought to play politics on the question of wage increases for workers.  That he was playing politics was perfectly obvious from the tenor of his remarks and from the manner in which he reacted to questions addressed him from this side of the House.  I am not concerned with the politics of the thing.  I recommend to the Minister that in his approach to this whole question he should get back to fundamentals and realise, to quote a <Col N="944" /> distinguished churchman and sociologist of international repute, that,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;only few of the most reactionary exponents and servitors of capitalism have the hardihood any longer to contradict the theory that the way to economic recovery lies through increased purchasing powers for the masses who have the desire but lack the means to consume the products of industry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I cannot give the reference, but that is from a lecture by Monsignor John A. Ryan, a well-known American churchman and sociologist.</P>
    <P>I urge on the Minister that that should be his approach to this whole problem.  We are not going to get industrial recovery and we cannot build safely for the future if at any stage we attempt to make economies at the lower end of the stick&mdash;if we attempt to depress wages and reduce the purchasing power of the ordinary workers.  If industry has economies to make in order to co-relate expenditure and earning power, then it is not at the expense of the ordinary workers that those economies should be made.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say that the Minister should not be afraid of making mistakes.  I would commend to the Minister, while using all caution desirable, a policy of courageous experiment. If the Minister courageously embarks upon a policy of experiment, I believe that in 95 per cent. of cases, he will find that his experiments are successful.  If there are 5 per cent. remaining and he has to come back to this House and say: &ldquo;Well, we tried to increase production, we tried to accelerate development but it has not been quite the success we desired,&rdquo; I do not believe that he will find this House unwilling to say that he was perfectly right to try.</P>

      <P>This is a very important Vote, and it is noticeable that there are some striking variations in the Estimate for the present year.  Firstly, in regard to food subsidies, as Deputy de Valera pointed out, there have been very large reductions as compared with past years due to an improvement in international trading conditions, but the large economies, substantial as <Col N="945" /> they have been, have been more than swallowed up in the general increase in expenditure that has been going on in most Government Departments. The Minister is able to show a reduction of over £1,000,000 this year which is satisfactory, but when we come to look at the items, they are not perhaps so satisfactory as they might seem on first appearance.  Although the State is saving to the extent of £360,000 on subsidies, in fact the cost of living is rising.  We have heard a great deal during the debate about the Supplementary Budget introduced by Fianna Fáil when, owing to the extreme rise which had taken place in the prices level during the year 1947, a very large scheme of food subsidies had to be introduced, not alone subsidies for food, but also for fuel and fertilisers. I think apart from the millions that have been saved to the Exchequer through the reduction in food subsidies, there has been a very substantial saving under the other headings also.  If my recollection is right, the Minister, both in respect of subsidies on fuel and the advances for the miscellaneous turf production schemes, the county council scheme at any rate, must have saved at least £5,000,000 or £6,000,000.  Nevertheless, the withdrawal of these subsidies does not indicate that the cost of living has fallen.  On the contrary it has risen. In November, 1947, the cost of living index figure for food was 96; in mid-February of this year it was 98.  Clothing has risen over the same period from 100 to 106; fuel and light remain, apparently, at the same figure of 101. As has been pointed out, there is no provision in these figures for bus fares.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood a new index was to be prepared, that the Government now in office had promised to introduce a more satisfactory index based on present conditions.  As has been pointed out from these benches, if you take the simple working class <Col N="946" /> or any other type of family on the existing index, I think it would not require a great deal of research to see that the result which will be secured may not be at all the same as if you were to take the weekly household budgets of families as they actually stand.  Undoubtedly, due to the more plentiful supplies of commodities, people have more opportunities for spending, but I think it will be generally agreed that when they go to buy, prices are very often beyond their reach.  We spend a huge amount of money on the prevention of disease, on the erection of sanatoria and on schemes to cure disease but one of the greatest ways in which to prevent disease, I should say, is to see that the population is provided with adequate nutrition.  During the survey which was made some years ago of nutritional standards in the City of Dublin the general conclusion reached by those who examined the question in the case of the lower-income and lower-expenditure groups of the people&mdash;only sample cases, of course, could be examined&mdash; was that the diet was monotonous and that there was a great lack of variety. In respect of those who were on the lowest level and who would be normally catered for because for one reason or another they would not be in employment&mdash;they might be invalids, they might be widows or they might be people of other types who would not be in normal employment; being in the lowest level of income, we know that their income was largely dependent on assistance from the social services&mdash; this survey found that in respect of this particular class of people meat expenditure reached nearly one-third of their weekly income.  If you add in whatever fats they may be able to secure for themselves, the proportion of the total expenditure on food would be about two-fifths on meat and fats. Of course, in artisans' homes the proportion would be smaller, as there would be a wage income, but nevertheless I think it is agreed by everybody conversant with conditions, not alone in Dublin but conditions in the country, that it is almost impossible to purchase meat at present prices, at any rate, to the extent that such households require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="947" /> When the housewife turns to bacon as a substitute, she finds there is an increase there also.  If she goes to look for vegetables she finds that they are either unobtainable or the prices are simply out of all proportion.  It is no wonder, therefore, quite apart from the situation that has arisen through the announcement by the trade union congresses, that they propose to terminate the existing wages agreements, that there should be great dissatisfaction with regard to the present high level of prices.  The spokesmen of these unions charge that this situation is due to the exorbitant rate of profits.  I do not know whether that can be the case.  I think the Minister on one occasion assured the grocers that he was satisfied they were not making exorbitant profits.  In any case, when the Minister for Finance was on these benches&mdash;and I think I cannot entirely acquit the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;he charged his predecessors with failure to take action to cope with the exorbitant profits which they alleged were made, particularly in the distributive business; we were also charged with failure to provide what the Tánaiste described in his election address as an &ldquo;efficient and effective system of price control&rdquo;.  Of course, all that seems to have gone by the board now, and it is rather unfortunate for Deputy Davin that the matter should have been raised at this particular juncture.  Had it been merely raised on these benches, I am sure we would have been told that there was no foundation for the allegations that there was dissatisfaction with the present high prices and the unreasonable cost of living.  But Deputy Davin seemed anxious to retreat to-day from the position he so very foolishly got himself into yesterday when he suggested, in face of the public statements of responsible trade union spokesmen, that, in fact, the compensation that has been granted to meet the increased cost of living more than fully compensates for the increased costs.</P>
    <P>With regard to industrial policy, we have been reminded by those on whose generosity we are to a certain <Col N="948" /> extent dependent in present circumstances that in the long run our community must live and find its standard of living and its prosperity on what it produces itself.  On what we produce ourselves, we have not alone to provide that standard of living but, if we borrow, irrespective of whether we repay in devalued pounds or dollars or pay our own investors here at home who may invest in capital development projects, we have to pay for these things.  As the Minister for Finance stated in the many references in his Budget statement with relation to this question of a capital investment programme, it should be our object to endeavour to provide the necessary investment funds and the necessary financing from current savings.  He also referred in his Budget speech to the importance, firstly, of increasing output and, secondly, of increasing savings.  On either of these two corollaries the Minister had grave misgivings as to whether the policy could be effective in improving conditions. He gave many instances of the deleterious results which might ensue if a big capital programme were developed under inflationary conditions while savings and output did not substantially increase.  While we have received a good deal of valuable information from the Minister in his opening statement, we have not received particulars of what I consider the keystone of our appreciation of the improvement in industrial output and improvement in our general economy; I refer to the output per man.</P>
    <P>References have been made at various times to the necessity for keeping a close eye on that aspect of our development; and in the demands which the Trade Union Congress are now about to make for a review of the wage agreements there is no doubt that this question of the increased productivity of the workers must assume an important place.  I think it is essential, therefore, that we should have some figures.  I know it is difficult for the statistical bureau to produce all the figures that are required but, in the long run, the basic elements in the examination of any programme of capital development are the productivity <Col N="949" /> of the units concerned and the return on the investment made.  There is obviously a limit to the amount that can be invested.  As has been pointed out frequently in recent debates, when one borrows money one must pay for it.  We are paying for borrowed moneys at a rapidly increasing rate. Fortunately, there is a limit to the amount that can be borrowed, no matter how enthusiastic we may feel about the projects we have in mind. Some years before the war the former Government called in experts to examine this question of investment, banking and finance, and those experts came to certain conclusions.  Now, we did not agree with their conclusions, particularly in respect of the repatriation of sterling assets.  We felt then, as we feel now, that if these moneys can be employed more profitably at home and give a reasonable prospect of a return, while incidentally providing valuable employment or increasing our productive power, a strong case can be made for it; but I suggest that a distinction must be made, as was in fact made by those experts, between the projects in respect of which there is a reasonable prospect of a return and those enterprises which go some way to pay for their original cost and those in which there is no such prospect whatsoever.  If there is a limit to borrowing, even for productive schemes and to what one can physically do irrespective of how great one's plans may be, there obviously must be a limit also to the amounts that one will borrow for projects in respect of which there will be no return of the nature I have mentioned. It is because we recognise that in the long run one has to pay for moneys that one borrows and because there must be a determination as between particular types of enterprise on social grounds or profitable grounds, or otherwise, we think that a strong priority must be given now to those projects which are likely to repay to some extent the capital invested in them.  After that there is another type of project, such as Aer Lingus, which is somewhat experimental and involves a very large capital expenditure; in the hazards of the present-day world it may encounter sharp losses <Col N="950" /> over a period due to circumstances outside our control.  But, as the Minister has pointed out, even in that venture, which might have been described as somewhat risky when it was first established, great headway is being made.</P>
    <P>Although at the moment it is not able to pay its way completely it is very satisfactory that the losses have been so substantially reduced.  The Minister has referred to the charge on the company&mdash;the heavy contributions in respect of the superannuation scheme.  I have no objection whatever to the scheme but, as a matter of information, I should like the Minister to tell us, when he is replying, what exactly is the size of the contribution, having regard to the total income or profits of the concern.  They have had proposals in England from time to time for what they call full employment. I am sure there are Parties on the Government Benches that are fully anxious, as indeed we all are, to carry such a policy into full and effective operation if it is possible to do so. Senator Professor George O'Brien pointed out in <i>Studies</i> in 1945 that Sir William Beveridge, as he then was, laid it down that even in regard to a policy of full employment, as against slumps and depressions, the Government should avoid borrowing for the purpose.  Two reasons were given by the author of the scheme, apparently, against that.  The first was that you were creating a <i>rentier</i> class which would have to be paid interest although not adding, except by investment, to the productivity of the State. You would have a <i>rentier</i> class drawing a very heavy income.  As I said on the Budget, if you were to carry the policy to disproportionate extremes, you would find that a very heavy mortgage was now being placed on the future to pay that class.  The second reason was very interesting.  It was that if a Government could have recourse to borrowing for the provision of public works and for the financing of a programme of full employment, obviously, being politically minded, the Government might be tempted to indulge rather more than it should in borrowing&mdash;perhaps to the disadvantage of the national credit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="951" /> Obviously, if money can be raised and the Government is not going to raise it in the way in which it normally is being raised, by taxation, there will be an inclination to go further&mdash;I think that, with political pressure, that is obviously going to be the case&mdash;than they otherwise would go.  As Sir William Beveridge pointed out, there will be the danger that it is rather the political interest of the moment that may be the motive rather than the national interest in the long run. Therefore, I think we are right to be wary and cautious of pursuing a policy of borrowing on a gigantic scale. So long as we are satisfied that a good return is being given and that the projects in which money is being invested will give good employment and add to the productive wealth of the country and enable us to pay our way as a nation, there is everything to be said for it.  In Great Britain we have this policy associated with an extreme degree of planning.  It seems to me that one of the arguments against very extensive State planning in regard to industry is that the private <i>entrepreneur</i> or industrialist is placed at a serious disadvantage.  The whole weight of the power of the State is thrown into the State-controlled or semi-State-controlled enterprises and there is a tendency, as we know, in modern States to extend the scope of State control until it interferes to the extent of directing people in their daily lives&mdash;what occupation they should follow, where they should give their labour, and so forth.</P>
    <P>With regard to the official British Government White Paper dealing with employment policy I would point out that we have not yet seen how this economy that is being built up on a basis of planning will stand when the new competitors that are appearing after the war will contest in the world field with Britain&mdash;but at any rate the British Labour Government were not unmindful of the difficulties and dangers of this policy, the difficulties and dangers that might ensue if it were not carried out with prudence and care.  They pointed to the fact that the handling of such a problem and the <Col N="952" /> way in which the financing of it is dealt with is regarded outside the country as a test of the firmness and efficiency of Government policy. Whether we like it or not, our credit will be affected by the opinion outsiders have of us.  If they see us taking the easy road and refusing to meet our obligations as they occur by deferring more than is necessary the payment of debts to the future they will come to conclusions that are apt to be unfavourable.  The second calculation that the British Labour Government made was that continual progress in technical efficiency was the dominating factor in determining the growth of real national income.  Therefore whatever the scheme may be it was recognised in Britain, and to a lesser extent it applies to us here, that if we are going to maintain our position in the world, to secure a higher standard of living for our people, and hold our own wherever we have to meet competition, we shall also have to give greater attention to the problems of higher technical efficiency.  Therefore, since the Government now have at their disposal means for providing such efficiency and training in modern technology and more modern scientific methods, I think the fullest possible use should be made of it.</P>
    <P>I referred last year to the question of apprenticeship and pointed out to the Minister that in Great Britain it had been found that general national schemes of apprenticeship were found to work more satisfactorily, having regard to industrial conditions.  The system of apprenticeship we have here, and the Act, has met with only a moderate degree of success, and it applies only to a limited number of trades.  I have often wondered whether, in fact, there is not an opportunity, with the goodwill of the labour unions on the one side and of the employers on the other, of getting a scheme that will be more adequate and that will mean that young entrants to industry will be far better equipped and will have the advantage of going in to spend their lives in industry not having been trained in out-of-fashion methods, but having had the opportunity of seeing the latest machines <Col N="953" /> and the latest methods.  To the extent that the Ministry is in a position to enable teachers or executives or working men to go and see what is being done elsewhere, I think it will be all to the good.  Undoubtedly, in order to secure an improvement in efficiency, the co-operation of all those concerned in industry is required.</P>
    <P>Our adverse balance of trade is running very high at the present time. According to the Taoiseach, I think I am correct in saying that he has given it as his opinion that the only way in which the unsatisfactory position, as he finds it, of the present accumulation of sterling assets can be remedied is by larger imports.  If these imports are confined very largely to goods, such as machinery, they will help to produce in time goods in the nature of capital equipment.  That would be all to the good.  Obviously, if we are importing consumption goods and, at the same time, trying to build up our own industries, then we are trying to do something that is very difficult.  No matter what the expenditure may be by the public on consumer goods, it will be impossible I think for them to buy the complete output of our own industries, and at the same time finance the purchase of very large stocks of consumption goods from elsewhere.  As regards the policy of bringing back your assets, if the assets have to be brought back in the form of goods that may have a disadvantage if they are not the right type of goods which will in the long run produce more wealth.  If they are goods which are immediately consumed, they will have the further disadvantage of making things more difficult for our existing Irish industries.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="954" /> The Minister has made a change in regard to the repayment of advances for rural electrification.  The original intention was that from year to year, as this capital expenditure was going on, the State should pay, I think, roughly 50 per cent. of the cost.  The expedient has now been devised to transfer the cost to the Exchequer of the advances required during the initial period while the work is being carried on over a period of 50 years. I do not know why 50 years have been selected.  Perhaps the contention is that the benefits of rural electrification will extend over a period of 50 years. It seems to me that a much shorter period could have been selected, because obviously there will be still further expenditure over the period. There will be replacements.  It has solved an immediate problem for the Minister.  It enabled him to save £300,000, but here again the saving, while it is to the advantage of present day taxpayers, will not necessarily be to the advantage of future taxpayers. It is an example probably of the fact that everything possible is being done in all the Estimates to seek out items which can be deferred and the responsibility for which can be put on to the future.  Even the small amount of £20,000 in the advances to Mianrai Teoranta has been taken into the net of the Minister for Finance as a sum to be met from borrowing.</P>
    <P>If we are going to borrow on that scale, I believe a clear distinction should be made and that the Government should take steps to show the House what are the items which they expect will, in large measure, pay in the future for the capital expenditure incurred, and what are the items upon which, while they are not paying at present or will pay in the immediate future, will be expected in the long run to contribute so much to the national revenue that they may indirectly, if not directly, pay towards their cost.  I should also like to know what are the projects which are being undertaken solely because they are considered desirable and which it is not expected will be able to pay any of the cost of their undertaking.</P>
    <P>With regard to rural electrification, I think it has been found elsewhere <Col N="955" /> that if we are to depend upon the ordinary household consumer, and even the ordinary farmer, to take sufficient electricity not only for his household but for his farm work to help to pay the charges on that portion of the scheme which the State says must be met by the consumer, we will probably find that there is a big amount of leeway to be made up.  In Scotland, where an effort is being made in connection with the development of electricity in the Highlands to develop side by side with that local industries to help absorb a large proportion of the electricity, there is also the idea behind that of the decentralisation of industry&mdash;not to have it concentrated at a few of the larger points.  There is also the idea there of giving a great deal of employment with the prospect of the scheme paying for itself.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister can say whether the Industrial Development Authority has had any projects before it in connection with food processing, and whether, seeing that our agricultural industry appears to be our mainstay for the future, more attention should not be given to the processing of foodstuffs.  Now that power is being made available, I think it is only proper that there should be a big development in that regard.  In a neighbouring area there have been in operation for many years schemes by which free sites are provided for factories, and loans are given either for the acquisition of premises or the renting of premises, and inducements are offered in that way to industrialists, even from outside the country, to establish enterprises there.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister, in his statement, suggested he had no objection. Perhaps I am not putting it correctly, but in connection with the work of the Industrial Development Authority I think he said that efforts were being made to get industrialists, or those who might be able to assist from the technical point of view in establishing industries here, to come along.  There would be a much greater possibility of having development in that direction if some such inducements were given here as are being given elsewhere.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="956" /> A large number of the staff of the Department are to work under the Industrial Development Authority.  I do not wish to say now what I might have said on the Bill if I had had the opportunity, but I would like to ask whether there is going to be any report to the Dáil on the work of the authority or whether it is to be solely an advisory body reporting privately to the Minister. He has stated there have been 60 new lines of production started recently and the authority was associated with their establishment.  If it were the Government's policy to give fuller information as to its work and the results, we might be able to judge more accurately the value of these new projects in the way of the additional employment which they are giving, the capital that is invested in them and the particular lines for which they provide.</P>
    <P>There will be other opportunities for dealing with the matter, but it is rather an innovation that a body which is purely advisory and which has not yet got the authority of the House, under legislation, is to have a large staff accredited to it.  I take it this staff will be employed whole-time in assisting the authority in examining projects and proposals which come before it.  We would like to know what is the nature of the examination which is going on in respect of tariffs since the Minister took special powers for the authority to examine the effects of protective measures and to have proposals for tariffs referred to it.  If it is the policy of the Government not to give that information, well and good, but I think it would be of advantage to the public as well as to members of the House to have more definite and detailed information as to what is being done.</P>
    <P>There have been references to the tourist industry, and there is a Supplementary Estimate dealing with it.  As Deputy Lemass pointed out, it is a wrong conception of the policy that we proposed to follow to suggest that the intention was that the tourist board should continue to run the hotels which they acquired.  The intention was that they should ultimately be transferred to private <Col N="957" /> ownership.  The argument has been made, not alone now but for a long time, that there are certain projects which will not get ahead unless the Government take a direct hand in implementing them and taking responsibility for them.  Our attitude was that we may have gone too far, but at any rate the rather tardy interest which the Government is now showing in the development of the tourist industry shows that we were not entirely mistaken in our view that it was a matter of national importance that should be attended to.</P>
    <P>These hotels were to have been staffed by specially trained personnel, and were to establish a standard for the whole hotel industry here.  Of course, if you regard the hotel industry as some of our friends in the Government regarded it formerly, as public enemy No. 1, you will have a certain impression about it, but if you regard it from the point of view of most European countries at the present time, including countries like Scotland, you will feel that very serious attention ought to be given to it.  I feel and have felt that since our kith and kin in the United States and other countries are more influential and more prosperous now than ever they were before, and as presumably they may have more interest in this country&mdash;certainly they have more opportunities for visiting it than in the past&mdash;there is and has been for years past a great opportunity if we only seized it.  But we allowed a few years to pass, and we refused to do anything until apparently the administrators of Marshall Aid came along and told us we should attend to this matter.</P>
    <P>Now we have the Minister telling us that it is a most important thing.  In present conditions its real importance lies in its dollar-earning potentiality. There is no doubt that if you want to attract American traffic you must have first-class hotels.  One of the reasons the Scottish tourist industry felt that they did not do so well on those coaching tours, which appear to be the usual method of travel of the wealthier type of tourists, was that they had not a sufficient number of first-class hotels. <Col N="958" /> They have also been organising festivals and industrial exhibitions, and these have a certain attraction.  They have been able, as a result of the goodwill which has apparently attended Scotch whiskey, to sell it abroad without apparently having to reduce the price by reason of devaluation.  If we take a country like Switzerland, we find that, in addition to attracting a very valuable traffic&mdash;and, of course, they have special attractions there&mdash; they consider that one of the main values of the industry is the tremendous amount of local products, of high-quality products, such as clothing, wages, footwear and household goods, they can dispose of.  In that country, the emphasis at the present time is rather more on catering for the middle-class visitor, and particularly for the working-class visitor, since holidays with pay seem to have brought into the sphere of tourism a huge number of potential visitors who cannot afford very expensive hotels and who would be glad to get modest accommodation and to see foreign countries for themselves.</P>
    <P>The tourist board formerly had the idea of sending a certain number of young Irish people to Switzerland to be trained.  If we could provide that training here at home, in special training schools for hotel management, hotel catering and restaurant workers, it would be all to the good, but apparently all the Minister can tell us is that he hopes that, after some months' time, he will be able to bring forward proposals.  He has hedged and qualified his assertion of interest in the tourist trade with statements that the Government must be satisfied, apparently, that the expenditure which they will incur, if they are prepared to spend money in this industry, will give a return.  Having regard to the declaration that it is so important from the dollar earning point of view, seeing that we have, even for visitors from the non-dollar areas, peaceful conditions and good food to offer, I think that the Minister is adopting, to put it mildly, an extremely conservative attitude in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening Deputy <Col N="959" /> Lemass tried to associate as best he could the problems of wage-earners with politics, but we have to think of these problems more seriously than to allow them to be confused with political issues.  Let it be clear that Labour is more than a party of wage standards and social services.  We hold up before the nation an ideal that will call forth the best from our people, an ideal of life more abundantly, which can only be achieved by all working together for the common good.  On that line I should like to see Deputies discussing seriously this Estimate before us.  We were told also that Deputy Lemass and his Government were the best friend that the workers in this country could have.  If evidence can be produced to prove that assertion, I would be the first to admit it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In looking over the statistical records, I find that in 1935 there were 2,350 persons in this country who had to pay surtax and their incomes totalled £8,500,000.  In 1947 there were 4,233 persons who paid surtax and whose incomes totalled £13,736,202, which means that there were 1,833 new rich created in that period of 12 years. Their incomes were increased during the same period from £8,500,000 to £13,700,000.  For most of that period, particularly during the later years, workers' wages were pegged down to a maximum increase of 16/- per week over their pre-war wage by Emergency Powers Orders, which were only removed when the change of Government took place.  I should like to tell Deputy Lemass that the workers are not unmindful of what was happening in 1946 and 1947.  I know a case where men looked for an increase in wages in an industry that was earning huge profits and they met with a blank refusal.  Because they got that blank refusal, the trade union insisted on supporting the men in fighting that refusal.  Let me say, incidentally, that the Fianna Fáil Government at that time were going to issue an Emergency Powers Order providing that the men could not be supported by their trade union in looking for increases.  Were it not, however, for the strong attitude and the stand taken by the union <Col N="960" /> these workers would be kept down to the wage levels of 1946 and 1947.  Since then not alone have the workers got an increase of 6/6 a week but they got an additional 11/- increase in their wages.</P>
    <P>Let us see what all this control has led to.  In this question I am prepared to give credit where credit is due and on the other hand to blame anybody who is deserving of blame.  If the present Government are guilty of carelessness in that direction, I am prepared to subject them to all necessary criticism.  When we look up the reports concerning the profits of different firms which have appeared at various times in the Press, we find one firm alone whose profits in 1949 were £81,000 as compared with £113,000 the previous year.  They stated that they had increased their capital last year by £175,000 by simply offering a free £1 share to every person who held two shares.  That is typical of the way these firms sink their capital in new shares so as to avoid paying tax or paying decent wages to their employees. We see again in the papers a notice that cement shares had jumped 20/- on the stock exchange in one week and 5/- the previous week. If these shares can jump 20/- in one week and 5/- the previous week, I think that clearly shows that there is not effective control of the price of cement.  In the same week we have a report from another firm who are mainly concerned with the supply of housing materials, and they state that their profits have been increased from £39,196 in 1948 to £48,462 the following year.  Their report added:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The directors have recommended that the sum of £75,000 out of the general reserve be capitalised and applied in paying up in full £75 £1 B ordinary shares.  Such shares to be distributed to existing ordinary stockholders in proportion of one £1 B ordinary share held.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The ordinary units last changed hands on the Dublin Stock Exchange at 101. Then we come to another firm, which deals mainly in drapery.  Their ordinary dividend this year was, roughly, 17½ per cent. and they increased their ordinary capital by £150,000.  I maintain that there is no effective control <Col N="961" /> and the result is that the cost of living is increasing rather than going down.  I was surprised to hear the Minister state the other day that the price-control Orders had been reduced from 141 to nine.  I was further surprised to hear him say that, in addition to formal control by means of a price-control Order, &ldquo;prices are kept in check by arrangements between my Department and individual concerns&rdquo;. I have seen articles purchased in drapery houses in Cork City sold at 2/- less than the controlled price. That is proof that excess profits must be made and, nevertheless, these people can still sell these articles at less than the controlled price.</P>
    <P>I put down a question yesterday to find out what quantity of the 30,000 tons of imported goods consisting of three items was carried in Irish ships. I was told, in reply, that out of that 30,000 tons, not so much as one ton was brought in our Irish ships.  Now, if we had people who were really interested in our shipping I am satisfied that that 30,000 tons would have been brought in in Irish ships.  It would be interesting to know what percentage of all goods imported is carried in Irish ships.</P>
    <P>Recently I heard complaints about delay in connection with the Electricity Supply Board and the extravagant spending of money.  I put down a question recently in this connection, and I find that for the 20 years ending last March, out of £22,000,000 given to the Electricity Supply Board we have paid £12,059,396 on interest alone, and during the same period we have only repaid £963,000 of capital expenditure. I heard Deputy de Valera stress our dependence on outside.  Why should we have to pay over £12,000,000 in 20 years on interest charges alone in order to make electricity available to our people?  Is there any justification for that?  Is it not time that we took control of our own credit?  We know that many people at the present time have no better light than that supplied by lamps and candles.  I hope that situation will be dealt with satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>Slates may be regarded as a comparatively <Col N="962" /> minor industry.  It is regrettable, knowing the number of slate quarries we have all over the country, that we cannot get Irish slates for the houses we are constructing.  I inquired into the position recently and I was told that the existing quarries will take ten years to supply the orders they have at present.  I made inquiries as to the cost of covering a roof 30 feet long with rafters measuring 17 feet and I was informed that Killaloe slates would cost £126, Portuguese would cost £72 and tiles £37 8s. 10d. I was amazed to find we were importing Portuguese slates.  In 1948 we imported 1,055 tons from Portugal into Dublin and 103 tons from cross-Channel; in 1949 we imported 2,605 tons in nine months and 227 tons from cross-Channel.  I was more than surprised to discover that we were paying for Portuguese slates in gold. We have slate quarries all over the country, yet we are unable to supply our own requirements.  I am reliably informed that our biggest customers for our own slates are the Glasgow Corporation and the Dutch.  I made inquiries as to the number of men employed in the quarries in West Cork; in 1947 there were only 34 men employed; in 1948 there were 41; in 1949 there were 45, and in 1937 there were 125.  In Killaloe quarries there were 150 men employed in 1947; 160 men in 1948, and 150 men in 1949; for the latter portion of 1949 there were only 80 men employed.  I think our slate quarries should be taken out of the hands of private enterprise.  Men working in these quarries can earn from 63/- for unskilled labour up to 70/- for those at the top.  We set up commissions to inquire into emigration and we talk about the necessity of keeping the people on the land.  We have quarries that could be developed and could be made to give employment. The position is that, if these quarries get no fresh orders, it will take them 12 years to supply their present orders. Some time ago the question of developing the Valentia slate quarries arose and a request was made to have the possibility of their development investigated.  Who was sent down to investigate whether or not they would be a financial proposition?  I understand <Col N="963" /> it was the man who controls the Killaloe slate quarries.</P>

We talk here about controlling our industrial development.  We are not in control of our industrial development at all.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £150,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1951, for Grants-in-Aid in connection with Technical Assistance afforded by the United States Economic Co-operation Administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will remember that on the Financial Statement, when I was referring to extra expenses during the year 1950-51, I mentioned a scheme for which an Estimate of £150,000 would be introduced to encourage firms and <Col N="964" /> individuals to avail of technical assistance which is being afforded by the United States Economic Co-Operation Administration.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;procurement and furnishing of technical information and assistance&rdquo; is one of the forms of aid mentioned in the United States Economic Co-operation Act of 1948. The Economic Co-operation Administration has set aside for technical assistance to this country for the year ending 30th June, 1950; a sum of $100,000; a further $300,000 has been tentatively earmarked for Ireland for the American fiscal year 1950-51.</P>
    <P>Technical assistance is being afforded by the Economic Co-operation Administration mainly in two forms. People in this country having a particular problem may visit the United States to study how their problem is being dealt with there.  In such cases the Economic Co-operation Administration will make the necessary arrangements for visits to suitable centres and will pay the expenses in the United States of the persons concerned. United States experts may also visit Ireland to study technical problems and local conditions affecting them, and advise producers here on the best way of overcoming those problems.  In such cases the Economic Co-operation Administration will pay the experts' dollar fees.</P>
    <P>It would normally be necessary for the Irish beneficiaries of the Economic Co-operation Administration dollar aid in the form of technical assistance to pay the equivalent in Irish pounds of the dollars made available so that a deposit could be made accordingly in the Grant Counterpart Special Account in the Central Bank.  In addition they would have to pay their full travelling expenses to and from the United States or, as the case might be, the travelling, subsistence and other necessary non-dollar expenses of visiting United States experts.</P>
    <P>In order, however, to ensure that the maximum advantage is taken of this generous United States offer of technical assistance, the Government have decided to make money available in the case of approved projects so that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="965" /> (1)  It will not be necessary for participants to make any payment against the dollar expenses; and</P>
    <P>(2)  One half of the remaining expenses will be defrayed by the Government.</P>
    <P>The effect will be to make the Economic Co-operation Administration technical assistance available for only a fraction of the total cost.</P>
    <P>Technical assistance projects must be approved by the Government and by the Economic Co-operation Administration. Approval can be given only where the projects will contribute materially to the economic development of the country.</P>
    <P>During the past ten years great technical and scientific advances have been made in industry and agriculture, particularly in the United States of America, and much of the latest technical information is available only from that country.  Many firms and individuals have been anxious to bring their production methods and techniques up to date but have been hindered by the dollar shortage and by the cost, which is often beyond the resources of small concerns.  The Government hope that the subventions from this Vote will secure that the maximum use is made of the opportunities afforded by the Economic Co-operation Administration scheme.</P>
    <P>Suitable publicity for the scheme is being arranged.</P>
    <P>The provision of £50,000 in sub-head A of the Estimate is intended to cover 50 per cent. of the non-dollar expenditure arising out of approved projects and the £100,000 in sub-head B is to enable the counterpart of dollar assistance afforded by Economic Co-operation Administration to be lodged in the Grant Counterpart Special Account in the Central Bank as required by the Economic Co-operation Agreement with the United States.  Of the £150,000 to be expended by the Government under the scheme £50,000 will, with the agreement of Economic Co-operation Administration, be offset by a transfer of £50,000 into the Exchequer from the Grant Counterpart Special Account.  Both sub-heads are Grants-in-Aid, and provision is made <Col N="966" /> for transfer of the grants into deposit accounts so as to provide funds from which these subventions towards Economic Co-operation Administration technical assistance can be met after the end of the current financial year.</P>
    <P>The technical assistance provisions are only a part but a very valuable and significant part of the benevolences which America is affording to European countries and to this country in connection with Marshall Aid.  The Economic Co-operation Administration people themselves regard technical assistance as being of the highest importance.  If proper use is made of it, it should result in a considerable improvement in business methods and technique here and give a return which would undoubtedly be quite commensurate with the expenditure involved&mdash;and the country is likely to benefit by it.  Whatever provision has been made for technical assistance, that may be used&mdash;if it is used&mdash;to the maximum without in any way diminishing the amount of Economic Co-operation Administration dollars made available for the purchase of dollar commodities.  There has been quite an amount of assistance already approved by Economic Co-operation Administration.</P>
    <P>A number of officials, mainly from the Department of Agriculture, have already had the benefit of assistance of the type which I have mentioned in connection with such subjects as soil science, animal genetics, infertility and sterility in live stock, artificial insemination, pig diseases, poultry diseases, parasitic diseases of live stock and poultry husbandry technique.  These would be all, in the main, projects that have been developed by officers of the Department of Agriculture.  There is a project for attendance at &ldquo;open house for rural youth leaders&rdquo; sponsored by the United States Department of Agriculture.  The attendance will include an officer from the Department of Education and the secretary of the farmers' youth movement.  In connection with poultry husbandry technique and agricultural economics, certain officers have been approved and will be travelling in connection with these matters one of these days.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="967" /> I am sure Deputies know from Press reports, if not otherwise, that a mining expert is coming to this country to advise on the development of gypsum deposits.  That scheme has been fully approved by the Economic Co-operation Administration.  Schemes for which approval has been sought include the visit of certain engineers to assist Bord na Móna to help solve certain problems in connection with their work.  A delegation in connection with hotels has already visited the United States. Another visit of Irish hoteliers is projected for the autumn.  In return United States tourist experts are expected to visit and carry out a survey here.  There are other schemes which are being put forward but have not yet been fully approved.  Certain engineers of the Electricity Supply Board hope to visit America for technical assistance and certain Aer Lingus officials will also go there. There are other projects which have not yet reached the stage of being even tentatively approved.</P>
    <P>I mention these matters to show the scope and diversity which we may expect from this generosity on the part of the United States Government.  I believe that considerable benefit will accrue to the economy of the country from the expenditure involved in this. The departmental officers dealing with these matters have been greatly encouraged and helped by Mr. Carrigan, the Economic Co-operation Administration administrator, and his officers.  His great kindness and the expertness of his approach to everything makes all this work quite happy and easy.  We may expect to experience the same kindness in connection with the provision of technical aid from the American side.  The proposals that are put up here have to be screened from the American side and approved there.  So far from there being any complaint in regard to the projects not being met in the best way, undoubtedly there has been such a situation that I feel that I should mark some appreciation of it here and of the help that has been given to enable this country to reap the fullest possible benefit from all the moneys which are <Col N="968" /> being so generously distributed under the Marshall Plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that it would be more appropriate to discuss the details of this particular scheme when the Estimates for the various Departments are brought forward, and that the Departments dealing with the various branches of our economy will justify their recommendations to the Dáil. There is no doubt but that we are deeply indebted to the American people and the American Government for their generosity.  I feel sure that, if proper use is made of the technical assistance they have offered, good work can be done in the development of our resources here and in the improvement of our technique.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that already some officers from the Department of Agriculture have gone.  I take it that this money will enable officers of other Departments to go if they feel that their visits will be of benefit to the country and if the Americans approve of their visit.  I am sure that, on the various Estimates, we will get more details than the Minister can give at present.  I am sure, too, that we all approve of the Supplementary Estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I felt that the Minister, in introducing this Estimate in an apologetic manner&mdash;I got that impression&mdash;was doing something that he did not like to do.  The American legislation under which this provision is made was passed for the purpose of the protection of the United States. It was so declared in the American Parliament.  Looking at this in a broad way, we find there is provision whereby America is to assist us in our agricultural development.  They are to provide experts to indicate to us how we should develop our agriculture.  It has been stated&mdash;I do not think it has been contradicted&mdash;that the Economic Co-operation Administration administrator in this country has declared that our function in the world was to be an agricultural community and not an industrial community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understood for a while, when those great schemes of land reclamation introduced by the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="969" /> were announced at first, that those were schemes which the Minister for Agriculture himself had developed. I find now that, instead of those schemes being schemes of an Irish Minister for Agriculture, they are the schemes of the American agricultural adviser to the Government of this country.  Agriculture is our primary industry.  While I agree that certain technical advice is useful in agriculture as in everything else, I find that this is developing not only into agriculture but into Bord na Móna, into our gypsum deposits, into our tourist industry, into the development of our rural youth leaders&mdash;whoever they are or what they are I do not know.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry, who knows more about agriculture than I do, may be able to help me out on that. I want to know and the country wants to know clearly if there is any phase of our economic and political activity into which the Government of the United States has not thrust its nose. Even in the speech made by the Minister, the speech which I describe properly as an apologetic speech, is there any phase of our activity into which the Government of the United States is not pushing its finger?  Why are they doing this?  Are they doing this for our good or, as is stated in their own legislation and by their own legislators, for the protection of the people of the United States of America?  The Minister and Deputy Aiken have referred to the generosity of America.  Where is the generosity to us if they are doing something for their own purposes?  If their expert advice will lead to a complete change in our own programme of industrial development, what are we to be thankful for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister were to come in here and say that the United States Government, because of its aid to this country, as they term it, under the Marshall Plan, insists on doing those things, then we would know where we stood.  The people have a right to know where they stand.  We had, 700 years ago, the intervention of another country in the affairs of this State, <Col N="970" /> and it has taken us 700 years to remove that intervention from part of our territory.  I am quite sure that, in those days 700 years back, there were people who talked about the generosity of the English people.  In a world situation such as it is to-day, we ought to be very careful about what we do and, before we decide, we should think very clearly why we are doing it.  I believe, and the majority of thinking people in this country believe, that we are not free agents any more in this matter, that the Minister is not a free agent, that the Government is not a free agent.  The type of speech which the Minister made here and the type of speech which Deputy Aiken made, would indicate that we are not free agents in this matter.  We are part of a generation that has made tremendous sacrifices to obtain our own freedom and to preserve our own liberties.  Now, those are important matters, matters that should concern every responsible person in the country; and we cannot permit a situation of drift or slide to develop in which those liberties and that freedom would be imperilled or endangered.  It is being imperilled and endangered every day, not in our interests but in the interests of the United States of America, as set out in their own legislation.</P>
    <P>In this House I, apparently, am a voice in the wilderness.  However, I will continue to make that voice heard and, thanks be to God, we have preserved sufficient liberty in this country to enable even one voice to be heard. If we continue in the way we are going, the voice of a free individual will not be permitted in this country in the very near future.  That is the danger that I see; that is the danger to which I wish to draw the attention of the Irish people.  I spoke here in connection with the Marshall Plan a couple of years ago.  I was then a single individual.</P>

      <P>I said I was then a single individual&mdash;one against 145, the Chair being neutral&mdash;but in the two <Col N="971" /> years that have passed since then, a very substantial number of people have come to approve of the expressions I used in that discussion.  I can only issue a warning to the people, that they are being led along very dangerous and slippery slopes.  I say very clearly to my fellow-members of this House that a day may come in the very near future when they will regret, and sincerely regret, the fact that they have not taken sufficiently serious notice of this very dangerous position in which we find ourselves.</P>
      <P>Being opposed as I am to that dangerous drift in which our Minister, our Government, and our chief political leaders are not free agents, I can only repeat what I said here two years ago, that I cannot approve, by any vote of mine, either legislation or a Vote such as has been introduced here this evening by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot claim to be an expert in the interpretation of tones such as Deputy Cowan appears to be, but I did not detect any tone of apology, any note of apology, in the Minister's introduction of this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
      <P>I think it is a desirable thing that this free nation should co-operate with another free nation in advancing science and knowledge, particularly if it relates to increasing the productivity of our agricultural and other resources. I cannot see any great danger arising from our endeavours to secure from the United States that technical knowledge which is essential in the combating of disease among live stock, in the improvement of our soil, and in the development of our tourist and other industries.  I do not think that the experts from the United States who are sent over here to assist in the development of our mineral resources, for example, will carry away any of our valuable ores or any other deposits which may lie beneath our soil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a matter of this kind we should, as a free people, be willing to co-operate with other free people.  Very useful work can be done under this proposal.  It is essential, however, that the expert knowledge obtained will be <Col N="972" /> turned to the best possible advantage. It is essential that the people who go over to the United States to study these technical matters will be people with sound ideas, people of energy who are determined to carry progressive ideas into effect.  I do not think this is a matter which should be left entirely to civil servants.  I, therefore, welcome the proposal to send to the United States members of various progressive agricultural organisations and people engaged in industry or in the hotel business.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that in industrial and technical knowledge the people of the United States have travelled very far ahead of the rest of the world, in many directions at any rate, and there is no doubt our people could learn quite a lot from them.  To suggest that by such co-operation we may lose some portion of our independence is absolutely absurd.  At the present time our people are studying in the university known as the cinema.  What they see there comes mainly from American sources and if there is anything more likely to weaken our sense of nationality and independence it would be that particular type of study.  But to suggest that by an investigation of our resources, by the study of American methods in industry and agriculture, we are going to weaken our national position in any way, is absolutely ridiculous.  Perhaps it is a good thing that some member of the House should express the views which Deputy Cowan has expressed, just to show how ridiculous they are.</P>
    <P>As an Independent Deputy, I want to say that the 145 Deputies who supported the idea of Marshall Aid a couple of years ago and put Deputy Cowan in a minority of one were absolutely realistic in their approach to present-day problems.  I do not think Deputy Cowan would be leading this country in the direction of maintaining its independence by taking up an attitude of non-co-operation in relation to everything suggested by the United States; I have a feeling he would be leading us in exactly the opposite direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is necessary <Col N="973" /> to clear up one or two doubts that would appear to have arisen because, perhaps, of the emphasis laid on certain things.  Amongst the matters mentioned by me as already approved there loomed rather largely projects either of a Government type or a type sponsored by Government&mdash; a Government agency or a semi-Government agency.  Private individuals and private businesses would seem to be rather afraid of what their commitments might be until the situation is clarified.  I hope it will be clarified by what has been said here this evening and by the further clarification which will occur when the publicity I have mentioned will have been given to the scheme.</P>
      <P>Private business firms and organisations are beginning to show their appreciation, even with their limited knowledge and even with their natural fear with regard to their commitments. That is the position, if one can judge by the variety and extent of some schemes that are rolling in for consideration by the Government.  After they have been passed they are then ready for presentation to the Economic Co-operation Administration for approval.  The balance has been brought definitely on the side of Government agencies or Government-sponsored agencies, but I think there will be a balance the other way, a balance roughly between them and other schemes.</P>
      <P>I mentioned that certain projects have been sent forward for examination. It must be remembered that the initiative in these things rests with the Government.  Schemes may be sent in by outside people and they would fall for consideration by the Economic Co-operation Administration here.  I do not think they would be empowered to take up anything on their own and, therefore, the initiative must come through Government sponsoring, through Government blessing of a particular project which will then be brought to the Economic Co-operation Administration for their approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is almost an impertinence to refer to this, because it may cause doubts and suspicious, but there has <Col N="974" /> not been any question of dictation about this matter.  I mention that in order to allay the suspicions or the fears to which Deputy Cowan has given expression.  Nobody has thought of this in terms of dictation or pressure. That should be clearly understood.  In the agreement between the Minister for External Affairs and the American representatives it was resolved that the Economic Co-operation Administration approval must be given to a scheme, but it is not in their control to force any scheme and they have no thought of forcing a scheme.  I hope that is quite clear.</P>
    <P>So far as the matters to which Deputy Cowan has referred are concerned, it is, I suppose, true to say that in the majority of cases, in the greater number of instances, what is likely to be said on the technical side would have a bearing on agriculture. That is only natural seeing that this is mainly an agricultural country and that it is dependent almost entirely on the main industry, agriculture.  I did mention already even in connection with this list of matters already approved or at some stage of its advancement towards approval, the question of gypsum and the question of the visit to the United States of certain officials in connection with engineering projects under Bord na Móna.  I know that to the jaundiced mind that would only mean that agriculture has been put under the control of the American Government or that even such things as the deposit of gypsum or the engineering projects of Bord na Móna will come under the control of the American Government through their administration here. Deputy Cowan has said that this whole project is a project for the defence of America.  The Economic Co-operation Agreement between the United States and this country, of the 28th July, 1948, has this in its preamble:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Governments of Ireland and the United States of America, recognising that the restoration or maintenance in European countries of principles of individual liberty, free institutions, and genuine independence rests largely upon the establishment of sound economic conditions, <Col N="975" /> stable international economic relationships, and the achievement by the countries of Europe of a healthy economy independent of extraordinary outside assistance, ...&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Will the Minister read the preamble to the American Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can read that if he likes but this is the agreement that was signed by the representatives of the two Governments. The Deputy writes down all those who are engaged in this country in carrying out the conditions of this agreement as hypocrites of the first order.  Is there any justification for that suspicion which seems to lurk in the Deputy's mind in any part of that phrase:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...recognising that the restoration or maintenance in European countries of principles of individual liberty, free institutions and genuine independence rests largely upon the establishment of sound economic conditions, stable international economic relationships and the achievement by the countries of Europe of a healthy economy independent of extraordinary outside assistance, ...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Surely there is a recognition by the American Government that in so far as they were making available this extraordinary outside assistance to countries which had applied for it, to that extent the economic independence and national independence of these countries might be prejudiced and they state that their one aim was to help these countries towards a healthy economy, independent of extraordinary outside assistance,</P>
      <P>&ldquo;recognising that a strong and prosperous European economy is essential for the attainment of the purposes of the United Nations&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Then they call for a strong production effort and they speak of having enacted the Economic Co-operation Act of 1948</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;providing for the furnishing of assistance by the United States of America to nations participating in a <Col N="976" /> joint programme for European recovery, in order to enable such nations, through their own individual and concerted efforts, to become independent of extraordinary outside economic assistance&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Reading right through the whole of this agreement, that note occurs time and again.</P>
    <P>It is possible to take the aggressive attitude adopted by Deputy Cowan, but I am glad that I did not adopt it, even though I have been accused of going to the other end of the scale. Deputy Cowan says that he has somewhere or other learned that the economic administration in this country have decided in favour of agricultural production as against industrial production. I see no signs of that.  It is quite true that those who pay attention to this country must recognise the position of agriculture, and there again, if there is to be an extended effort, it is only natural to expect that there will always be emphasis on the agricultural side.  In one of the articles of this agreement under the heading of &ldquo;General Undertakings&rdquo;, the Government of Ireland says that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;it will use its best endeavours to promote the development of industrial and agricultural production on a sound and economic basis&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I know very well that from time to time both in Paris and here a certain exhortation has been given to the people of this country with regard to how they may improve their dollar-earning capacity, and stress has not always been put on the agricultural side of production in that sense.  I think Deputy Cowan can get it out of his head that there is any need for such suspicions as he seems to entertain. They are impudent really, and the atmosphere in which this Vote is being discussed shows that there is no necessity even to pay attention to such suspicions, but since they have been voiced, I took the opportunity to state what is known to me.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan has stated that I spoke in an apologetic mood.  I did not intend to, but there are differences in the tone one can use.  There is the aggressive tone that can be adopted <Col N="977" /> against people who make use of statements with which we do not agree.  One can also be apologetic, and there are occasions when one has to be apologetic, but I did not think this was an occasion for that.  I do not think that anybody connected with the economic administration in this country would expect people to come into this House in any abject or apologetic way, but there is a time when one feels bound to speak in terms of grateful recognition of a generous act.  That is, where one recognises a very definite act of benevolence by people who need not have been benevolent at all, and one has to give some expression of view appreciating that.  That is what I was aiming at when speaking here to-day, but I certainly did not intend to be apologetic.  The American Government need not have advanced along the lines of the provision of Marshall Aid.  If they did not, leaving out the long range view of what might happen five or six years or a decade hence, they could certainly have relieved their people of a tremendous burden of taxation which has been imposed on every American business-man, every private individual, every corporation in order to provide aid for Western Europe for a number of years and to provide it with amazing generosity.  I think it is hardly the correct thing that when you receive a special benevolence in that way it should be greeted in the way in which it has been greeted by Deputy Cowan.  He says he speaks with the approval of certain people. I have not met them among my acquaintances and I did not get any letters of that type.  I did not see any instances of popular opinion, any strong backing for Deputy Cowan in what he has given expression to in this House.  I am sorry he has not asked questions in this House indicating these suspicions as it would have given us an opportunity of clearing up any suspicions that may have existed in the minds of these people.  I think the people as a whole properly appreciate just what is being done by the United States for Western Europe and this country.</P>
    <P>The technical assistance aid is only a small part, but it is a very significant <Col N="978" /> part of American aid to this country. It seems to me that the viewpoint of Deputy Cowan is completely out of accord with the viewpoint of the Americans in this respect.  If they want to get a country like ours under some sort of economic domination, one of the best ways of achieving that object would be to keep the country under-developed and as ignorant as possible of the technical improvements along different lines made in America. So far from doing that, they have offered to receive people from this country with their own problems so that they may see how these problems are being dealt with in the United States, and come back here with a better appreciation of the solutions. They have also gone so far as to send over here people who are expert in certain matters in the United States so that they may see at close range here what are the difficulties inherent in certain phases of our life, and give us, on a near view, what they consider to be the appropriate way of getting over those difficulties.  In no respect has there been anything but an altruistic approach by America in its relations with this country in all matters appertaining to Marshall Aid. If Deputy Cowan says there may be something more than mere altruism in building up a strong Western European economy, since Western Europe and this country are faced with the greatest menace the world has ever been faced with, there may be some germ of truth and reality in that. But the Americans are paying a great price to make Western Europe, and this country, strong enough to be independent, economically and nationally, so that these free and independent communities may come together to meet the power that menaces their independence both economically and nationally.</P>
    <P>I would like to reiterate what I said in opening.  I do not intend to be apologetic and I hope that nobody will read one word of apology into my words.  I think we owe a great debt to America for all that she has done for Western Europe and for this country.  I think we have been specially lucky in having a representative of the Economic Co-operation Administration <Col N="979" /> group and particularly lucky in the people who came here with specialised expert knowledge of our conditions to see for themselves what our difficulties were so that they could freely assimilate what our problems were and aid us in the best possible way.  That aid and assistance have been given to us most generously.  I hope that my words will balance and at least weigh down what Deputy Cowan said in such grudging fashion about our accepting this aid.</P>

      <P>I would like to correct a statement I made before the adjournment of the debate.  I referred to an investigation made into the possibility of developing Valentia slate quarries. I understand that investigation took place four years ago and the present Minister is not responsible for having sent down the manager of the Killaloe quarries to make that investigation.  I maintain that our slate quarries should be developed in the same way as any other industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to industrial development generally, I do not think we have the proper degree of control.  In the manufacturers' journal for last month I find a striking complaint about foreign control.  In the <i>Irish Times</i> of 4th February, 1950, there was a statement about the dissolution of the firm of James Crean and Company.  That firm was taken over by a combine and they paid £3 for every £1 share.  At a meeting of the federation it was said that people would sooner sell stuff sponsored and supported by foreign <Col N="980" /> manufacturers.  It would be nice to have the Minister's views as to how we could rid ourselves of that domination. The Industrial Credit Corporation was set up for the purpose of assisting Irish industries.  According to a statement made by Mr. McEvoy at the last meeting of that body most of the money invested has been advanced to industries supported and sponsored by foreigners.  Until such time as we shake off the shackles of foreign domination and influence we can never successfully develop our own industries.  The following statement was made at that meeting:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A matter which is giving us more worry than the Control of Manufactures Act is the growing practice of transfers of trade marks by companies operating outside this country to companies operating here. If the present process is carried on to its logical conclusion, it will mean ultimately that we shall have nothing in this country but Irish manufactured goods carrying foreign trade names.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is also stated that in the majority of cases the international trade mark carried with its transfer a clause forbidding the export of products made here carrying that trade mark or name. That is a very serious matter.  Another statement made at that meeting was to the effect that before the war we had an Industrial Credit Corporation set up for the development of industry and the greater balance of the money subscribed by that body to industries was to industries fostered and sponsored by foreigners, and that seems to be the policy to-day.  I think the Minister should take note of these statements.  If we are to build up our industries we must build them up independent of outside influences. Deputy Major de Valera said this evening that our only hope was to make ourselves independent of outside influences.  That applies in particular to banking and credit.</P>

      <P>Ní theastaíonn uaim mórán a rá ar an Meastachán so ach amháin tagairt a dhéanamh do na cúrsaí a bhaineann le tionscalú na tíre seo.  Is dóigh liom go bhfuilmíd go léir ar an tuairim chéanna gur cheart an tír seo do thionscalú i dtreo is gur féidir le daoine slí bheatha a bhaint amach dóibh fhéin in ionad é a bheith orthu an tír seo d'fhágaint, fé mar atá fé láthair.  Do b'é an chuspóir a bhí ag Sinn Féin fadó ná gur cheart monarchain do chur ar bun sa tír seo chun obair do sholáthar do mhuintir na tíre agus gan ligint dóibh dul thar lear.  Go deimhin, do bhí an chuspóir sin acu le leas na tír do chur chun cinn, mar do thuigeadar chomh thábhachtach is a bhí sé tionscail do chur ar bun anseo i slí is nach mbeimis i dtaobh le tíortha eile thar lear chun slí bheatha a sholáthar d'ár ndaoine féin.  Dá bhrí sin, ba cheart dúinn leanúint de'n chuspóir sin.  Ba cheart go leanfadh aon Rialtas a bheadh anseo i mbun na tíre den chuspóir sin agus ceapaim go mbeadh sé fuar acu bheith ag brath ar chabhair ó na daoine ar feadh aon fhad ama muna ndeinid é sin.  Sin é an chéad rud a theastaíonn uaim a rá ar an Meastachán seo, ach sé an rud is mó atá ag déanamh buartha dom fén scéal go léir ná gur baolach go bhfuil faillí á dhéanamh againn i tionscal na móna.  Rinne mé tagairt don cheist seo cheana agus arís nuair a bhíomar ag plé an Bhóta ar an gCuntas, rinne mé tagairt dó.  Fuair mé locht ar an Rialtas mar nach raibh aon airgead gur fiú trácht air á sholáthar le haghaidh tionscail na móna.  Chím go bhfuil laghdú ar an Meastachán seo i mbliana. Im thuairimse, fé mar a chitear dom é, ceann de na fáthanna is bun le sin is ea gan sinn a bheith sásta dul ar agaidh le tionscal na móna fé mar ba cheart.  Nuair a bhí an tAire ag tagairt don rud seo, do léirigh sé don <Col N="982" /> Teach seo go raibh cailliúnt airgid mór ar an tionscal sin.  Is minic a bhíonn cailliúnt ar rudaí agus má bhímid ag cuimhneamh ar fad ar cheist chailliúna, ní mór an dul cinn a dhéanfaimíd.  Ní foláir dúinn bheith ullamh chun dul ar aghaidh agus féachaint chuige go ndéanfar an tionscal thábhachtach seo a chaomhaint i gceart.  Chím nach bhfuil ach £5 mar chomhartha Meastacháin sa leabhar seo.  Is dóca gurb é an fáth atá le sin ná nach bhfuil fhíos ag an Aire go fóill cé mhéad airgid a cuirfear ar an tionscal agus cé mhéad a thíocfas isteach.  Ach deireann sé go bhfuil Bord na Móna le breis agus £90,000 a chaitheamh ar an tionscal i mbliana. Deireann sé go mbeadh teacht isteach de níos mó ná £80,000 agus gur cailliúnt, mar sin, méid na difríochta idir an dá fhigiúir sin.  Ba mhaith liom a iarraidh ar an Aire an bhfuil sé chun Meastachán breise a chur os chomhair na Dála i mbliana&mdash;fé mar a gheall sé a dhéanfadh sé&mdash;agus an amhlaidh ná béidh sa Meastachán ach an méid a dúirt sé atá idir an méid a cailleadh ar an mhóin i rith na bliana so caite agus an méid a thiocfaidh isteach tar éis na móna atá idir lámha a dhíol.</P>

      <P>Having spoken in Irish, with a few interruptions, I shall say a few words in English, but not for long.  First of all, I desire to refer to the trend in employment in this country.  I am glad that there is an upward trend, even though it is small.  It is a pity that the Minister, in his opening statement, did not tell us to what extent that increase&mdash;I think of 12 per cent.&mdash;which he mentioned is due to the expansion of the old industries or to the establishment of new industries. I think the Minister said that 60 new industries were started during the year.  However, he gave us no figures to indicate the amount of employment that arose in connection with those newly started industries.  That would be very useful information to have, because it would give us an idea as to how far we were progressing in the direction of getting more employment for our people by establishing more industries as opposed to the expansion of activities in connection with industries that were already there.  The Minister said that there was an increase in industrial employment last year as compared with the preceding year of from 184,000 to 206,000 persons. Well, that is not so much, but it is something.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because, while there is a little increase in the number that have got employment in industrial activity, there has been more than a corresponding decrease in the employment of our people on the land.  I consider that a very unfortunate thing. We should all do our best and give every encouragement to the establishment of industries here, but if in doing that a position were to come about whereby people would leave the land and go into industry it would not be very good.  It would mean a continuation of the flight from the land.  Last year there was a decrease in the number of people employed on the land of no less than 47,000 as compared with the preceding year. In 1948 the number of people engaged in employment on the land was 499,542, while in 1949 the figure was 452,500, a decrease of roughly 47,000. That does not appear to be a healthy sign.  While everybody must admit that it is satisfactory to see more people being put into industrial employment, still, when we find when we look at the other side of the picture that for every one that is being put into industrial employment two are leaving employment on the land, I think that is a very bad state of affairs. As I have said, 47,000 people less were employed on the land in 1949 as against 1948.  The difference between 47,000 and 22,000 is 25,000.  I would like to know what has become of the 25,000.  I am afraid that a good many of them have left the country altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I would like to refer to harbour development because I consider that it is a matter of very great importance. It is now three or four years since plans were laid for the development of our harbours.  I am afraid that any great progress has not been made since.  I know this is a matter that could not be dealt with overnight.  Still, I would like to know from the Minister, when he is replying, what advance has been made towards developing the harbours of this country.  I am chiefly interested, of course, in the Tralee and Fenit harbour. There have been delays in connection <Col N="985" /> with that project.  I do not know who is to blame.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">

      <P>When speaking in Irish, I referred to the turf industry which is my chief bone of contention.  I see here a token Vote of £5 for the turf industry.  The Minister, in his opening statement, said that there was to be an expenditure of £94,000 on the turf industry.  Deputy Lehane interrupted me when I was speaking in Irish and wanted me, I think, to distinguish between hand-won turf and machine-produced turf.  The chief branch of the industry in which I am interested is the home produced turf.  I am sure Bord na Móna will be able to deal with the machine-won turf, as they have been doing for years, in a satisfactory way.  Every encouragement should be given to the producers of hand-own turf.  There is no use in talking about giving them encouragement until such time as we find a market for it.</P>

      <P>That is the worst of it. Even in certain institutions adjacent to the very bogs themselves, turf is not being used.  I suggest that it should be the business of the Minister and the Government to find out exactly to what extent turf is being used in our public institutions.  I have referred to this question on a few occasions and I have asked questions here of the appropriate Minister, if he could tell me in how many public institutions turf was being used as fuel instead of coal.  There were no figures available to give me any information about it.  That is one aspect of the matter which should engage the Minister's attention.  There may be other ways.  I do not see why turf could not be used in certain factories all over the country.  That possibility should be explored as well.  We talk about providing employment for people by starting industries but, in my opinion &mdash;and I can say it from my own knowledge&mdash;the turf industry would give more employment than 50 other industries if it were properly organised and if, as the Minister has said, there were a market for it.  Let us try and find a market.</P>

      <P>I have given one suggestion, anyway.  I could give more of them to the Minister and I may give them later on.  In his opening statement, the Minister referred to the fact that we imported £60,000,000 worth of goods during the year that could be manufactured at home.  That is a very big amount, and it would seem to me that the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign is not succeeding as well as it should.  I know, of course, that the Minister has been advocating the use of Irish-manufactured goods, but I think it is not enough to make a speech now and again about that particular aspect of the case.  We should go all out on a campaign to get the people to purchase Irish-manufactured goods.  It is a patriotic thing to do and it is our duty to do it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It was heartening to many of us during the past year to observe the efforts of the Minister for Industry and Commerce towards progress in Irish industry.  I followed his speeches with great interest and, if I might say so, with great sympathy because I realise what tremendous uphill work it is for any Minister&mdash; and this goes for the present Minister's predecessor too&mdash;to put into the people of this country a proper enthusiasm with regard to our industrial development here and supporting Irish industry generally. It seems that a lot of work has yet to be put into our industrial drive <Col N="989" /> here.  One would feel sometimes that the Minister would have to go nearly so far as to get a mallet to hammer into the heads of our people that it is in their own interests to support Irish industry in every possible way.  The odd thing about it is that the industrialists themselves&mdash;and I mean &ldquo;industrialists&rdquo; in the broad sense, people engaged in business and industry&mdash; show an extraordinary want of enthusiasm. If these people who are most closely concerned from the selfish point of view would only approach the question of the industrial revival properly the Minister's job would not be half as difficult as it is.  I am sure that the Minister in his efforts often felt disheartened at the poor response he got from people from whom he would expect a good response, people who, one would think, should need no push at all.</P>
    <P>I had an experience not so many months ago and I think it would be well to relate it&mdash;although there are few people here who are showing a lively interest in the debate&mdash;because it will show the attitude of some of our industrial firms to the question of articles of Irish manufacture.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I wanted to get a big bottle of jet black ink and I went into one of the big stationery shops here in Dublin.  I was offered a bottle of &ldquo;Parker Jet Black&rdquo;, as I think it was called.  I said to the assistant: &ldquo;I want a bottle of Irish ink.&rdquo;  She told me first that she did not know if there was any Irish jet black ink made.  I said: &ldquo;I think there is.  If you inquire you will find that jet black ink is made in Ireland.&rdquo; I said I would come back next week and that I was sure she would have a bottle for me.  She promised that she would.  I called back the following week and the assistant who was there then did not know whether an inquiry had been made as to whether or not a bottle of Irish jet black ink was available.  I decided to go further about it and I went to another of the big stationery shops in Dublin and asked for a bottle of jet black ink.  I was there presented with a bottle of &ldquo;Swan Documentary&rdquo;.  I said to the assistant: &ldquo;Look, could I have a bottle of Irish ink?&rdquo;  I was <Col N="990" /> told no, they only stocked &ldquo;Swan Documentary&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I think that is odd, but however I will go further.&rdquo;  I went to a third stationery shop and asked for a bottle of ink. I was again offered a bottle of &ldquo;Swan Documentary&rdquo;.  I said: &ldquo;Look, I want a bottle of Irish jet black ink&rdquo;, and I was told by the assistant in this particular shop that although they themselves manufactured ink they were just out of their own jet black ink at the time but that they would be able to let me have a bottle during the coming week.</P>
    <P>I asked: &ldquo;Why do you not stock Irish ink when you are out of your own?&rdquo; and I did not get a very satisfactory explanation.  I went to a fourth shop, having got the bit between my teeth by this time, and I asked for a bottle of jet black ink.  The assistant there offered me a bottle of &ldquo;Waterman's Midnight Black&rdquo;.  I said to him: &ldquo;Look, I want a bottle of Irish ink.&rdquo; And he told me that they had not jet black Irish ink.  I said to him: &ldquo;I think this is a shame.  This is the fourth big shop in Dublin which I have visited looking for a bottle of Irish jet black ink and in each one of them I have been offered a bottle of English or imported jet black ink.  In each case I have failed to get a bottle of jet black ink made in Ireland.&rdquo;  He told me that he, too, thought it was a shame.  I then pointed out to him that he was an employee of an Irish industrial concern depending upon the business which the people of Dublin and the people of Ireland gave to that firm for his livelihood and yet in a small matter of that kind I was unable to get from him an Irish-made article.  It would not be quite fair if I did not finish the story.  He promised he would get me a bottle of this jet black ink and post it to me, and I am glad to say that he succeeded in this, and that it was a very excellent ink indeed.  I do not think it would be right to start advertising the particular ink in this House, but in any event I can say that it is an excellent production and as good as any of the imported stuff.  I do hope that my small efforts in this matter in those four shops will do something to help the Minister in his drive to get people interested in themselves <Col N="991" /> and foster Irish industry in such a way that they themselves will reap the benefit.</P>
    <P>I have had a number of complaints about Irish sparking plugs.  I think that most of the Deputies here who drive cars will agree with my experience that the Irish sparking plugs supplied in the cars here are as good as the Lodge or Champion plugs which many of the garage people invite buyers of new cars to get.  I have had a very satisfactory experience with Irish sparking plugs in my own car.  I have been told fairy stories, as I believe them to be, about the miraculous change which drivers notice in their engines after throwing out the Irish and putting in Lodge or Champion plugs.  It might be no harm if I said that I have driven 26,000 miles on the one set of Irish sparking plugs and not one of them has been removed from the engine since I got it.  I think that is sufficient tribute to pay to them.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to direct his attention so far as he can to the placing of worthwhile industries in the Irish-speaking areas.  We would all agree that that would be well worth doing for many reasons which can be gone into on another Estimate and on which I do not intend to elaborate now. The Minister, however, should get the Industrial Development Authority to pay special interest to the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of newspapers and periodicals coming in here, I made an effort when the Estimate for the Department of Education was being discussed to raise the matter of imported newspapers and periodicals, and particularly Sunday newspapers.  The Leas-Cheann Chomhairle at the time thought it was not the appropriate Estimate and, after a short discussion, I said I would raise it on the Industry and Commerce Estimate and now the opportunity has arrived.  What I said with regard to these imported Sunday newspapers on that occasion was reported in the Press the following day and one result was that I got letters from quite a number of people who showed a very lively interest in the subject.  One of those who wrote to <Col N="992" /> me was Father Devane, S.J., who a short time before had written a booklet entitled <i>The Imported Press</i>, which sets out the case extremely well.  Father Devane sent me a copy of that booklet and also wrote me a letter in which he said he regarded this matter of the imported Press as one of very great importance.  I was, of course, very gratified to get a letter from Father Devane.</P>
    <P>There is a rather odd situation with regard to restrictions on newspapers coming in here.  The first odd feature is that Sunday newspapers come in here completely free of duty.  What directed my attention to this matter, in the first instance, was the fact that, during a visit to Collinstown a few months ago on a Saturday evening, I saw three of the Aer Lingus planes with the passenger seats out being converted into cargo planes and I was told that every Saturday evening these three planes fly to Manchester and come back, each bringing three tons of British Sunday newspapers so as to be in time to meet the people coming out from Mass on Sunday morning, even down in Deputy Corry's constituency. I was more surprised when I heard that the Department of Industry and Commerce had not done something about restricting the import of these newspapers and putting a tariff on them.</P>
    <P>The figures are interesting.  I think all Deputies were supplied with this booklet of Father Devane's.  I do not suppose that all Deputies read it, but it is very interesting reading.  The position with regard to the import of these newspapers and periodicals is astonishing.  It appears that under the Finance Act, 1932, a duty of a penny per copy was imposed upon all imported periodicals, wholly or mainly in the English language, with a preferential rate of three farthings in respect of periodicals from the British Commonwealth and the question to be asked about that preferential rate is: what happens the extra farthing?  We know that the buyer of the periodical has to pay a penny more than the price of it, of which the Revenue Commissioners get three farthings.</P>
    <P>The thing is not unimportant, because, according to the figures given <Col N="993" /> by Father Devane in this booklet, figures which he got from the Revenue Commissioners, we imported, in 1947, 4,571,556 daily newspapers.  The tax collected on that number of newspapers was £12,698, but the buyers of those papers paid an extra £6,439.  I suggest to the Minister that if the tariff is to be operated as a revenue producing device he might make it the full penny.  In that year, the Exchequer would have benefited to the extent of £6,300.  These figures, I should say, relate to daily papers which are subject to a flat rate of two-third pence under the Finance Act, 1934.  I was speaking in the first instance about periodicals, in respect of which the rate is a penny per copy, with a preferential rate of three farthings.  In 1948, the import fell somewhat.  The tax collected was £11,459 and the sellers of the papers or the importers got £5,729, because the buyers paid that amount in excess of the tax.  In 1949 the figure had gone up to 5,335,020, which yielded a revenue to the tune of £14,819 and again somebody profited to the extent of £7,409 which seems to me ought to have gone to revenue. That is a total of £19,500, in three years.  That is the position with regard to the daily newspapers.</P>
    <P>On the figures given, again by Father Devane, in this booklet, for periodicals, we get some striking facts.  In 1947 we imported 18,500,000 periodicals other than Sunday newspapers and daily newspapers.  In 1948 we imported 19,500,000.  In 1949 we imported almost 23,000,000.  The tax with regard to these particular publications is one penny with preferential of three-farthings. In those three years the number of farthings which the sellers of these newspapers got, which should have gone to revenue was very great and made a total of £63,000.</P>
    <P>I have left until last the Sunday newspapers.  In 1947 we imported free of duty 15,704,988 Sunday newspapers. If these had been taxed at one penny each the yield would have been £65,500 practically.  In 1948 the figure had gone up to 17,271,072 which, at a penny a newspaper, would have yielded a revenue of £71,962.  In 1949 we imported free of duty 20,268,360 Sunday <Col N="994" /> newspapers.  A penny on each of these would have yielded £84,500.</P>
    <P>It may be suggested that if a penny tax were put on these papers the number bought would be reduced, the people would not be prepared to pay the penny.  It would be well worth trying. I am not so much interested in that aspect of the matter and I am sure the Minister is not either, as in the type of matter that is imported.</P>
    <P>I pose this question: why were Sunday newspapers exempt in the first instance?  There was a device used in the 1932 Finance Act for exempting imported Sunday newspapers from the tax which was put on periodicals and the dailies were brought into the picture in the 1934 Finance Act.  All the time the Sunday newspapers were excluded. They got out of it in this way: there was an exemption in respect of those imported periodicals whose front page or cover exceeded 320 square inches.  It was an easy matter for the newspapers to arrange and so they got in free of duty.  All that time we had only one Sunday newspaper published in this country, from 1932 until recently, when the <i>Sunday Press</i> was published.</P>
    <P>I may be wrong but I am wondering if the Minister's predecessor was not influenced by that fact.  If he did put a prohibitive tariff on British Sunday newspapers, it would have the immediate effect of increasing the sales of the <i>Sunday Independent.</i>  I hope I am wrong in that but if I am right I hope the Minister will not be actuated by the same motives and that, although we have now two Sunday newspapers, one of which is professedly antagonistic to the present Government, the Minister will not let that affect his mind.  I press upon the Minister as strongly and as earnestly as I can that this is a matter to which he ought to direct his immediate attention. We have two Irish Sunday newspapers catering for people of every political point of view, one might say, in the present set-up in any event, and it would be a good thing if we had more.  I do not see how our newspaper industry can prosper as it ought to prosper in face of the terrific onslaught by cross-Channel publishers.  I am told <Col N="995" /> that recently the <i>Sunday Express</i> opened an office opposite the Independent office and that they are making tremendous efforts to increase the circulation of the <i>Sunday Express</i> here.</P>
    <P>It might not be a bad thing if I took up the time of this House in reading long extracts from Father Devane's booklet on the imported press but I do not intend to do that; but I certainly commend the booklet to Deputies who are interested in this very important branch of Irish industry, the newspaper industry and the publishing trade generally.  This matter affects very seriously the position of Irish writers.  Father Devane also made reference in his booklet to the very great number of children's papers that are being imported.  Irish writers have a limited market and from a monetary point of view writing in Ireland is a poor profession which does not yield the livelihood that it ought to yield.  It is the duty of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to ensure that these writers, who are people of merit, will be able to secure a decent livelihood in their own country.</P>
    <P>The mass attack that is being made upon the business of writing, the business of publishing, the business of printing here, makes it impossible, almost, for our Irish writers and printers or publishers to develop in their own particular spheres.  I know there is a multitude of problems facing the Minister for Industry and Commerce every day.  I can see it would be almost impossible to expect one individual to give due attention to all the different problems of industry and commerce which will arise here.  But, apart altogether from the purely material side of this question of the imported Press, there is the cultural side, there is the moral side.</P>
    <P>I am not very well qualified to speak upon the type of Sunday newspaper that comes in here because, perhaps fortunately for myself, I am not living in a town and we have not got the same facilities where I go to Mass on Sunday for getting these papers as the people in the towns and cities have; the market just is not there for them and they do not come there.  We have <Col N="996" /> to rely upon the local newspapers and the Irish Sunday papers.  If what I am told is true&mdash;and I believe it to be true &mdash;apart from the material aspect and apart from the effect on writers, publishers and printers, there is the moral aspect which, I submit, the Minister should take into consideration and give great attention to.</P>
    <P>Strictly speaking, that should be, and I am sure it is in the Minister's mind, the more important aspect of the case. I do not want to take up the attitude of making a sermon about this, and I believe I have said enough to indicate what my views are.  Looking at this question from any point of view, the absolute prohibition of these papers would be no loss to this country.  I would, of course, make an exception with regard to publications of an educational or cultural kind, of a scientific kind, papers which have some value; but the stuff I am referring to now is the kind of paper that goes in for sensationalism; it is what we know as the Yellow Press, and I think there would be no dissentient voice when I say that it would be no loss to this country if the Minister put an absolute prohibition on their importation.  Even if that did entail a slight loss in revenue, I believe nobody here would object.</P>
    <P>Speaking in regard to industry generally, everybody recognises now that the days of <i>laissez faire</i> are gone. The Minister for Industry and Commerce must necessarily have his finger in the pie, so to speak, with regard to every industrial undertaking and industrial effort in this country.  It is the same all over the world and I think I can fairly say this&mdash;and in so saying I have no intention or desire to flatter the Minister, and I use the word &ldquo;flatter&rdquo; in its literal sense&mdash;that since he took over the responsibilities of the Office of Minister for Industry and Commerce he has proved himself fully capable of handling the job.  I am glad to say that he has made a good job of it.  He has justified the experiment which was made and if he keeps going as he has been going and if he puts the same enthusiasm into his work as he has been putting, then he will serve Irish industry and commerce and he will serve Ireland well.</P>

      <P>In connection with this Estimate, I want to ask the Minister a question which I addressed to the Minister for Finance in connection with the Budget and which relates as much to his Department as to the general conduct of finance in this country. That question is: what is the attitude of the Government towards financing this country through an economic depression?</P>
      <P>The Minister knows very well that, roughly, there are two alternatives with regard to the future of world trade in the next five or ten years. If there is a war there will be no economic depression of the ordinary pre-war type.  There will be all sorts of stresses and strains imposed upon the community.  There will not be an over-plus of goods.  What steps will the Minister take in his Department to provide for that emergency?  Will he give to the House some idea of the steps he is taking to provide long-term storage for essential raw materials?</P>
      <P>Will he indicate whether he has made any plans or made any preliminary investigation with regard to the storage of fuel oil or petrol in the event of a war?  At the present time the number of agricultural tractors is rapidly increasing year by year.  Our dependence on agricultural tractors in contrast to horses is growing year by year.  Should a war break out, we shall be in a difficult position with respect to maintaining tillage if, as a result of the war, fuel supplies become short.  What steps is the Minister taking so far as his Department is concerned, in relation to that matter?</P>
      <P>Has anything been done in the way of preparing blueprints for the dispersal of repair facilities on our railways? The facilities that are at the moment being concentrated in two districts, Dublin and Dundalk, are desperately vulnerable to bombing of any type. Has the Minister made any plans for creating stock piles of essential raw materials?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If he does not think there is going to be a war, and if he has not bothered to make preparations for a war, has he considered what will happen if there is no war?  So far as I can gather, almost <Col N="998" /> inevitably the very high level of trade in this country and in Europe will decline to a certain degree.  The sellers' market will be over; there will be keener prices for agricultural products and, although we may avoid the kind of depression the world faced in 1931, it is hardly likely that the present level of trade will continue.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister for Finance whether he subscribed to Lord Keynes' conception of what should be done in a time of crisis.  He never gave me a proper reply.  I said: &ldquo;If you consider the speeches made by Government Ministers that in this country there is a boom, and if you believe that Lord Keynes' solution for unemployment in times of depression is to pump prime, to borrow more money for State schemes, to spend more money on State schemes for national development, to discourage private saving and encourage more capital investment&mdash;if you believe these things, what is your view in regard to the present level of borrowing?&rdquo; because, according to Lord Keynes, the principles which are so far as I know the ones held by every Government, except Communist Governments, are in times such as we have at present to finance everything out of income.  Now is the time to restrict borrowing to the maximum limit possible or at least we should keep some reserve which we can use at some later stage when the depression comes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I wished only to ask the Minister to consider that problem and I have not yet got an answer. However, I have dealt with that subject. Getting down to details in connection with the Estimate, I should like to ask the Minister to give us more information in regard to what is going to be done by the Tourist Board in connection with the tourist industry. I happened at one time to be a European director of a travel agency.  I was there for four years and learned a lot about the technical side of tourist development. When the Tourist Board was started here I understood that one of its most valuable functions was to be the development of tourist resorts&mdash; recommending to the Government the expenditure of moneys on improving resorts by means of the construction of breakwaters, shelters, concreted roads, lawns, gardens and so forth.  Many of these resorts have a charm for people who have a particular love for this country but they are still very bleak in their general amenities, judged by foreign standards.  I should like to ask the Minister whether he proposes to encourage the Tourist Board to go on with that work.  A great number of these resorts need that kind of development, which cannot possibly be provided by the local authority.  I should like him to tell us more about what his policy is in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The steps taken by the Government to encourage Americans to come to this country have been taken far too late. <Col N="1000" /> It is very pleasing to know that the Economic Co-operation Administration have made arrangements for some of our hotel proprietors to visit America to discover the needs of Americans in regard to hotel amenities, but I think myself the Minister should have been informed of that the day he came into office.  Everybody knows that Americans have higher standards than we in certain matters.  The problem is whether we can afford to provide them with the amenities which they seek in hotels&mdash;central heating, shower baths, bars, and certain types of food.  These were known to the hotel managers in this country for some considerable time past.  They were known before they were invited by the Economic Co-operation Administration to visit America. Building materials became available in plentiful supply about the year 1947 and since that time there has been an unwarranted delay in deciding what should be done and if anything could be done.  I may add that a considerable number of other types of visitors also looked for these amenities.</P>
    <P>The Minister has informed us that very few hotels took advantage of the loans made available under the original Tourist Board Act but it seems to me that the Minister could at a much earlier date have made the necessary alterations in the rules for obtaining these loans to suit our conditions. When we started the Tourist Board, the war came on and it was impossible to deal with the problem at that time. If the present method of offering loans for the improvement of hotels is inadequate, it seems vitally important that a change should be made as soon as possible.  Full regard should be had, naturally, to the needs of housing in this country and the possible absorption of labour materials which might be occasioned by too great an expansion of hotel development, but the trend at the present time, with the exception of certain areas, could not have the effect of reducing the rate of building so far as local authorities' housing is concerned.</P>
    <P>From what I know meeting foreign tourists in this country, a great deal more is required in the way of simple amusements in local resorts&mdash;a great deal of indoor amusement, provided <Col N="1001" /> not only by hotels but by other institutions, athletic amusements, etc., if this country is to be regarded as a delightful place to visit in all circumstances, and in the circumstances of our climate.</P>
    <P>Next I come to one more matter of detail, namely the publicity we do abroad.  In my time, I have read the tourist pamphlets of every country in Europe over a period of years.  The pamphlets issued by the Tourist Board represents a valiant effort to try to illustrate the various regions of Ireland of interest to tourists but, judged by standards abroad, they are grossly inadequate.  One of the most difficult things is to produce photographs of this country which will show something distinctive in the way of scenery to foreigners.  It is very easy for us to see photographs of Killarney and Kerry and to appreciate the beauty of these places but abroad you require the very highest class of publicity.  That is a matter which should have received the attention of the Tourist Board from the first day this Government took office.  This whole question of publicity for tourism is not co-ordinated in a general way and it needs far more attention.</P>
    <P>Anybody who doubts what I say should go and see the film of the life of the late W.B. Yeats in which is shown, I suppose, the most beautiful specimens of photography that ever have been taken in this country. These photographs have something distinctive about them.  The Minister for External Affairs can be congratulated for his efforts in producing that film. The Minister for Industry and Commerce can take an example from what his colleague did through the Cultural Relations Committee to see whether far higher standards could not be promoted in this country so far as tourist publicity is concerned.</P>
    <P>I do hope that the Minister will very soon be able to announce the Government's plans for stimulating industrial exports.  So far as I know, a number of alternative plans were prepared before our Government left office. There, again, during the war it was impossible to stimulate industrial exports on any considerable scale.  Materials <Col N="1002" /> were not available.  But, as far as I know, plans were in preparation.  I had considerable experience of trying to assist the stimulation of industrial exports at one time and I found that&mdash; I still believe it to be true&mdash;very, very substantial help would be required if a maximum effort is to be made, substantial help coming from the Government not only in the form of organisation but also in the form of actual grants.</P>
    <P>It should be possible for the Minister to have made up his mind in regard to certain matters long before the present time.  It is quite evident that a board of some kind is needed to collect data on markets, on the tariffs that exist in other countries, on methods of distribution in other countries and on the type of advertising required.  If that board does not do the work itself, it should give certain exploratory grants to industrial groups wherever it is considered exports might be possible. I remember examining that particular problem in relation to the woollen industry before the war.  I found that industry consisted of units, for the most part so small or so specialised that it was very difficult to persuade any individual manufacturer to undertake the necessary expenditure of a purely exploratory kind to investigate how he could conform, for example, with American fashions in tweeds, how he could relate something which was Irish and different to what suited American ideas.  I found it still more difficult to persuade groups of manufacturers to work together on that because they naturally work on an individual basis and a joint effort seemed to them at that time to be too great.  It seemed to me then that it was quite clear the Government should step in and give such a group very definite assistance for a short period and be able to say to them that they had now no excuse for not making the maximum joint effort possible.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the Minister needed the joint industrial development authority to give him advice on that matter.  I think he should have continued the work of his predecessor and invited existing organisations to <Col N="1003" /> discuss various plans with him.  I believe such a board could have been in existence if the Minister had given the attention he should have to the whole question.  The Minister informs us that the prospects for industrial development seem fairly satisfactory in his view.  He gave figures in regard to the number of new factories or extensions of existing factories that had been completed since he took office. I think it would be only fair if the Minister would give us more information about the employment in these various units: how many of the factories are employing at the present time, shall we say, over 100 people; how many are employing over 50 and less than 100; and how many are employing less than 50.  That would give us some idea of where we are heading in regard to industrial development.</P>
    <P>In regard to the future of industry, I should like to repeat what Deputy Lemass has already said.  We need to have a very special drive to complete our industrial development.  It would seem there again that the real field for examination is in relation to building materials, the heavy engineering industry, substitutes for wood, fertilisers and turf.  It would be interesting if the Minister gave us some further details in regard to investigations made by the industrial development authority in relation to these particular projects.</P>
    <P>One of the principal reasons for stimulating the production of cement, which has been very long delayed, is the urgent necessity of making more concrete roads.  From the point of view of national economy the Minister will be informed, if he asks the Department of Local Government, that over a period of some 16 or 20 years there is a very great saving through making roads in concrete.  Maintenance costs are much lower on them than they are on any other type of road.  That would leave more money available to improve the thousands of miles of county roads, most of which are yet unsurfaced.  If the Minister would expedite the production of cement we could have the main roads improved by using concrete.  The Minister could find out also from the Department <Col N="1004" /> of Local Government the amount that would be required for any particular programme over a certain period and he would find that possibly his present plans for the cement industry, when they do emerge and see the light of day, will be inadequate, if he considers the over-all importance of using concrete on roads, apart from housing or any other form of activity in which cement is used.</P>
    <P>I think it is essential in the course of this debate to refer to the fact that, whatever efforts are being made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to give employment or stimulate employment through continuing to a certain degree the Fianna Fáil policy in regard to tariff protection, and whatever employment has been given as a result of high agricultural prices here and as a result of Great Britain being forced to buy food produced by us at very, very high prices, the employment policy as a whole has been distorted and, instead of an increase in employment in industry, the Government have admitted now that 30,000 people on balance left this country in the past two years.  I invite the Minister's attention to that matter.</P>
    <P>It is not easy to find the cause of the flight from the land.  First of all, whatever the Minister has done, he has failed to provide a substitute for employment on turf and for the 15,000 people who were employed on turf when he came into office.  Secondly, so far as I can gather, he has not succeeded in carrying out the promises made by the smaller Parties in the Coalition to bring industry on a large scale into the Gaeltacht.  So far as I know, quite a high proportion of the new factories and extensions of existing factories are in Dublin.  When we were in office we succeeded, as far as I remember, in securing that one-third of the new factories would be in the provinces and two-thirds in Dublin. We thought we were doing rather well by measures that were short of actually compelling people to place their factory at a certain point.  I would like to ask the Minister whether he has been able to keep up that record in regard to prospective industrial development.</P>

I asked him, whether, in connection with the 60 extensions, he was able to keep up the record of the last Government, which, at a time of great difficulty during the economic war, insisted that one-third of all the factories should be in the provinces.  It should be much easier now because economic conditions are more stable and it should be possible now to improve on the record of the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Seán Lemass.</P>

      <P>Some people have asked the Minister whether he has been able to continue industrial devolution on that level.  Apart from that the Minister has not, I think, showed the necessary spirit of co-ordination with other Ministers of the Government in relation to telling them where he is failing to give employment, namely in the Western areas and in the congested areas.  On the one hand, there is the Minister's statement that some 200,000 people are now employed in industry and several thousands more than that in the previous year; on the other hand, there is the known fact that there are fewer grants of various kinds available for the small farmers living in areas like north-west County Leitrim, fewer grants available to them to repair their roads.  The farm improvements scheme has terminated. That gave employment to 14,000 persons a year.  The land rehabilitation scheme is not yet in operation and the employment that was afforded by the farm improvements scheme is not being provided in any other form.  As I have said, the policy of providing employment, such as exists in the present Government, is a distorted one.  It has the effect of creating good conditions in one area but of leaving the main problem of emigration from the Western and the congested areas untouched.</P>

      <P>This Estimate was not, as it has been tried to make out, an <Col N="1006" /> Estimate presented by the ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce.  One would imagine from some of the speeches delivered by Deputies on the Opposition side of the House that we were discussing an Estimate which had been introduced by Deputy Lemass. His name does not appear at all in this Estimate.  I am afraid that many of the Deputies on the Opposition side of the House have not read or paid sufficient attention to what the Minister had to say in his opening statement. Is it not about time that the Deputies opposite made speeches of a more cheery nature and put an end to gloomy forebodings and expressions of opinion to the effect that this country is bankrupt?</P>
      <P>When Fianna Fáil was in office and when some of my colleagues who were then on the Opposition side of the House said that the country was bankrupt and so forth I said: &ldquo;Nothing could bankrupt this country so long as the people work.  Get that into your heads.  You could not bankrupt the small farmers of this country.  They will exist and continue to exist when possibly nothing more will be heard of us who are now members of this House.&rdquo;  Therefore, for goodness' sake stop the gloomy talk that the country is bankrupt or that it is going bankrupt. It is the best and the happiest country in the world to-day and we should be proud to be able to say so. At least that is my experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that it is the duty of the members of this House to do what the Opposition in our sister country do in the case of a Minister who introduces his Estimate and who has done good work during the year.  The Opposition there always co-operate and they pay a tribute to the work done.  While the Minister in charge of this Estimate does not want to have bouquets thrown at him, at the same time he needs a little encouragement now and then if he is to carry out the very difficult tasks that lie ahead.  It is true, although perhaps a great many people would disagree with the statement, that, as far as the carrying on of the business of any country is concerned, it is much more difficult to carry on the business of the country in peace-time <Col N="1007" /> than it is in war-time.  References have been made by Deputies to the difficulties that beset this country in war-time. With the exception of a shortage of supplies there were no difficulties at all in so far as the Government of this country was concerned.  In fact, our only difficulty was to keep out the money because it was coming in so quickly.  Is that not so?  Now that things are coming back to normal, now that the countries who were engaged for six years in the manufacture of armaments and weapons of destruction are engaged in producing goods for their people which in the course of time will be on the market in competition with our goods, difficulties arise. Many of us shall soon have our eyes opened and shall have something more to do than to offer undue criticism here of the things which were accomplished by the Minister during the past year.</P>
    <P>Let us go through this Estimate briefly: there is no need to ponder on it.  There has been a decrease of 400 in the number of persons engaged in the Minister's Department and a decrease in the cost, amounting to £150,000, in respect of the provision of salaries and so forth.</P>
    <P>There is also a reduction in respect of subsidies for tea and sugar.  There is such a thing now as unrationed tea and unrationed sugar.  Many of the Deputies opposite think that that policy is not a good policy and that it has the effect of raising the cost of living.  Has it?  I do not think it has. Is the ration of sugar and the ration of tea sufficient for the individual needs of the people of this country?  Is it or is it not?  I find that it is.  Therefore, if there are people who want sugar over and above the ration, and if they are willing to pay the unsubsidised price for it, why not let them do so if it saves the State £30,000 or £40,000 or £100,000?  That money which is saved is not going into the pockets of the Ministers&mdash;it is going towards the general upkeep of the country.  Is there anything wrong in that?  Deputies talked about people having to pay so much extra for tea, and so forth.  Well do I remember a certain period in the history of this country when the people <Col N="1008" /> were glad to pay 30/- a lb. for tea and God knows what they paid for sugar. Those days are gone.  If the aggregate of the amount saved in respect of the non-payment of subsidy on unrationed tea and unrationed sugar is spent on the improvement of the general position of the people throughout the country I think that that is a good policy and one that in the long run will have very beneficial effects on the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>Another happy feature so far as I personally am concerned, and again I may not find support all round&mdash;not even on this side of the House&mdash;in respect of what I am going to say, is the reduction in the number of Price Control Orders from 141 to nine.  I hope to see the day when all price control is dispensed with.  My friends in the Labour Party may not agree 100 per cent. with me in that respect but they are entitled to their opinion and I am entitled to mine.  I am a fairly long time in this world and I am a firm believer in competition and in the old law of supply and demand.  I agree that in the present abnormal conditions there may be some reason for a certain amount of control but, taking the long view, I feel that the less Price Control Orders we have in this country the better.  That is my honest opinion.  I may be wrong and, of course, I may be right.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of turf production.  A great deal of criticism has been levelled at the Minister so far as his policy in regard to turf is concerned. There, again, Deputies do not seem to realise that our State is composed of 26 counties and that the outlook of the people and their mode of living both in respect to fuel and food is not general.  Take, for instance, the people who live along the eastern seaboard. There is no turf worthwhile talking about in those counties.  We know what we suffered in that connection during the six years of the war. God knows I do not want to see the same circumstances arising again, so far as the people of my constituency are concerned.  While saying that I wish the best of good luck to those counties in which turf is abundant.  If they think that by using turf they are <Col N="1009" /> going to give more employment than is at present available, then I say &ldquo;more power&rdquo; to them.  Do not blame the Minister because employment is not as great as it was during the war.  Surely Deputies must realise that conditions prior to and during a war are altogether different from those which obtain after a war.  Does not everyone know that wars make and unmake nations and peoples?  Some people become millionaires as a result of the outbreak of war while others become paupers.  One could not expect that the same number of people would be employed in the cutting of turf after the war had ended as were employed during the six years of war.</P>
    <P>With regard to turf production, some Deputies seem to forget that we have such things as harbours along the east coast.  Large sums of money have been spent on them, and most of the trade done in those harbours is in coal which comes from Great Britain.  I would say that, so far as turf production is concerned, the Minister is doing his best.  He has already stated that it is proceeding in many counties.  He hopes that, as a result of his efforts, the revenue derived from the sale of turf will about equal what is expended on its production.  Again, I would say that you cannot do everything overnight. The Minister must get time to do all the things that he is expected to do.</P>
    <P>Take the question of rural electrification. That is a scheme that will take time.  First of all, plans have to be made.  You cannot just run around and put up wires at random.  Various difficulties arise and it takes time to overcome them.  Notwithstanding all the difficulties which are confronting the Minister and, for that matter, which confronted his predecessor, good progress has been made in regard to this scheme as evidenced by the facts and figures which the Minister gave to the House.  I am afraid that many Deputies allowed this information to go in one ear and out the other, because not one of them referred to it.</P>
    <P>So far as rural electrification is concerned, I find that, in 1947, 432 miles of line were erected and 1,286 consumers connected.  In 1948 the mileage <Col N="1010" /> was 1,480 and the number of consumers connected 7,287, while in 1949 the mileage was 1,997 and the number of consumers connected 13,087.  The mileage increased between 1947 and 1949 by over 1,500, while the increase in the number of consumers connected between 1947 and 1949 was no less than 12,000.  If these figures do not denote progress, I do not know what does. As far as I am personally concerned, I would say the same with regard to this progress if Deputy Lemass were on this side of the House instead of being on the opposite side.  He would get the same compliments as far as I am concerned.</P>
    <P>The next thing the Minister dealt with was the Industrial Development Authority.  I am not going to weary the House on that, because I have a bitter recollection of the criticisms that were levelled when that authority was set up.  It is sufficient to say that it was born in a whirlwind of suspicion and distrust and was subjected to meaningless criticism.  What is the object in setting up this Industrial Development Authority?  To make it possible&mdash;and I want to emphasise this &mdash;with the co-operation and collaboration of those who are vitally interested to increase the efficiency of our industries, to enable people who are interested to start new industries, and to enable those already engaged in industry to extend and develop their industries.  I would be absolutely in agreement with many of the views expressed by members of the Opposition if I thought for a moment that the members of this Industrial Development Authority were going to go around poking their noses into every little business in the country, but, being sensible men, I believe they are going to work in harmony with our industrialists. I hope and believe that, in a short time, the two interests will work in harmony, and that as a result of the setting up of this authority there will be, as I am sure we all hope, an increase in industrial production.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given some figures. I find that during the last two years an extra 20,000 persons were put into industry. The numbers engaged in industry went up from 184,000 to 206,000 as against 166,000 in 1939.  Again, I <Col N="1011" /> want to give credit where credit is due, and to say that from 1933 to 1939 there was a considerable increase so far as the numbers engaged in industry were concerned, and that from 1939 to 1948 there was also a big increase in numbers.  I think that the members of the Opposition, instead of twitting the Minister and saying that he is carrying out the Fianna Fáil policy, should take credit for the fact that he has, to a large extent, to carry out their policy.  Surely, it is not held by anyone of commonsense that when a new Government comes in its first duty would be to change everything that the previous Government had done.  If that were to be so we could have neither law nor order.  If the Minister is carrying out part of the policy of the previous Government, or even a part of the policy which they had hoped to carry out if returned as the Government, it is credit and not criticism that he should get from the Opposition for the policy that he is pursuing at present. The only note of warning that I would like to sound, as far as industrial activity is concerned, is that we will have to hasten slowly.  This is a matter in which you can go just too quickly.  It is one thing to build a factory and another thing to keep that factory in operation.  Those with business experience, especially of factories or milling, or of any industry in this or in any other country, know the innumerable difficulties that confront those who have the responsibility of keeping factories going for 365 days of the year.  That is one of the things we must keep before our minds, that we could go too fast.  We must remember that we are less than 3,000,000 people and unless we are able to produce whatever articles we manufacture, at a price that will not alone meet competition here but enable us to export, our last position will be worse than the first.</P>
    <P>Do not forget, when you are talking of industrial production, that hand-in-hand with it must go agricultural production. We cannot buy the imports essential for the successful carrying out of our manufactures unless we export&mdash;in other words, we need money <Col N="1012" /> to buy what we bring in here.  That is one of the difficulties that confronted the ex-Minister and the previous Government and one which will confront the present Minister as well, in regard to industrial products.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister's remarks about cement.  Deputy Childers does not seem to have heard them, since he put certain questions to the Minister as to what steps he was taking in regard to the manufacture of cement.  As far as I know, the Minister stated he does not propose to erect a third factory but proposes instead to extend the Drogheda and Limerick factories to such an extent that the increased output of the two will be sufficient to meet the maximum needs of the building industry.  I think the maximum quantity of cement required to meet all our demands is in the region of 620,000 tons.  At the moment, our two factories are producing 450,000 tons, thus necessitating an import of roughly 200,000 tons, which costs us a little more than that produced locally. In the two together, the Minister hopes to have sufficient cement in the course of a year or a year and a half.</P>
    <P>There is another factor which I suppose has influenced him in coming to that decision, that is, that the erection of a new factory would cost something well over £2,000,000 &mdash; say £2,600,000&mdash;while extensions would cost in the region of £1,900,000.  There is a very big difference there.  Besides, cement would cost 10/- a ton extra as a result of the setting up of a new factory.  I think the Minister is doing the right thing in extending the two factories instead of erecting a third.</P>
    <P>There again I want to sound a warning note to anybody who knows anything about this business.  Surely Deputies do not think that the demand for cement will continue at its present rate?  There will come a time when there must be a slowing down in the demand and if we had four or five factories half idle, we would be in a difficult position.  At present we are making up the leeway lost during the war.  That is another factor which possibly weighed with the Minister when taking the decision to extend the two factories rather than build a third one.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1013" /> I regret that certain remarks were made here&mdash;I do not know whether the Deputy meant them or not&mdash;about the danger of the workers looking for increased pay.  Many Deputies are very careful in speaking of this&mdash;I do not know for what reason.  Whether Deputy Lemass really meant to convey to the workers that now is the time to look for increases I do not know. Why he should have done that or why he should have invited the Minister to take the initiative in having a conference with the workers, passes my comprehension.</P>
    <P>As a worker myself, having some experience of workers and knowing what hard work is, I do not think it is the Minister's duty at all to go out to meet trouble like that.  The leaders of the trade unions are very well able to look after the interests of their workers and there is no necessity for Deputies to make suggestions of the kind that were made.  There are certain implications in those suggestions which would not be for the good of the country.  If Deputy Lemass thinks it is good national policy to play politics in a thing like this, I want to warn him that he is playing with dangerous weapons.  I say this deliberately and honestly to all concerned, the workers especially&mdash;and I would love to be speaking to 30,000 of them now down in College Green and not here&mdash;that at the moment it will require the co-operation of them all to carry on our transport concern.  No one knows better than the ex-Minister that the very undertaking of which he was the head is in a bad position at the moment, not through his fault&mdash;and one just cannot change over the responsibility overnight to the present Minister.  The financial position of that concern cannot be denied&mdash;and no one has alluded to it in this debate when talking about increasing salaries or wages.  I would say to all those engaged in that undertaking, that it is in their interests to take its present financial position into account.  They must also bear in mind how long the people&mdash;the humble labourer in the bogs, the small farmer on the mountainside&mdash;can afford to put up an annual sum to the tune already mentioned here and which had to be provided by the Minister for Finance. <Col N="1014" /> If we bear those things in mind, we will think twice before we start to play politics in a matter of such major importance to the future of this country.</P>
    <P>The reason I speak so strongly on this is that I want to safeguard, if possible, the workers&mdash;and there are 15,000 to 20,000 of them.  I believe in the dictum that the continuity of employment is always more important than either wages or conditions.  We need that continuity and therefore I regret the tone of certain speeches in dealing with this matter.  It is too serious to be made the plaything of politics or the subject of challenges to the present Minister.  We need the co-operation of all concerned and, if that comes, please God we will be able to get over the difficulties that face us at the moment and which can be surmounted and solved only by everybody acting together.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Coburn misinterprets the whole approach to the subject by Deputy Lemass.  It was for the reason that the Trade Union Congress themselves demanded the lifting of the ceiling and the reopening of the issues with regard to wages, that Deputy Lemass asked the Minister if he had gone into this matter and commented on the fact that he made no reference whatever to it in his speech. He urged him to go into it very carefully and to go into conference about it, so that all those evils to which the Deputy has referred would be avoided. The attitude of the Government seems to be one of vagueness, of not making any statements on certain very vital questions like this.  The statement by the trade unions indicated their feeling that there is a rise in the cost of living although the Minister for Finance when pressed on the point on his Budget statement said that inflation was about somewhere or other but that it was not here.  His attitude was one completely vague and evasive.  The Government must themselves have known for months that there was always the menace of a further devaluation and a further rise in the cost of living.  They do not seem to have given any attention whatever to a study of commodity <Col N="1015" /> prices and I suppose really that the rise in commodity prices takes them by surprise.</P>
      <P>I am not going to pursue what to some extent has been the main issue in the debate because it has been very well put by Deputy Lemass and others. I rose mainly to speak about a few subjects which arise on the Estimate, one of which concerns very much my own constituency, that is, tourism. Although he is taking these Estimates at the same time as he is taking the Supplementary Estimate the Minister did not make any statement about exactly what will be done with the Supplementary Estimate and it leaves us in a rather difficult position.  So far the policy has been a very negative one.  I know that very much to my cost as a Deputy because Tramore has been completely neglected although it was picked out as one of the first places to be developed.</P>
      <P>A very considerable sum, over £13,000, was spent on draining and preparing large playgrounds there.  A company was started which I think has since disappeared, the property of which the Tourist Board owns at present but is has been completely neglected.  They purchased space not far from the railway near the shore which is to be a centre of amusment. They took over premises from people who occupied them and cleared them as well as a hall which was quite a nice hall for entertainments.  It has been completely neglected and the windows are broken so that it cannot be used by the people.  The body who look after Tramore, the Commissioners, offered to purchase some of the premises from them and were refused. The place has been left there and it must do great injury to Tramore for this season as indeed it did last season. I want to know what the attitude of the Government is and especially what they are going to do about Tramore.</P>
      <P>It may be that they are overshadowed still by the statements which were made originally by the Taoiseach and the Minister for External Affairs. Just before the general election in December 1947 the present Taoiseach said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1016" />&ldquo;The number of tourists and their total expenditure in the country must be controlled and reduced.  The tourist industry played an important part in their balance of payments and was of great advantage to the country in normal times, but until the danger of inflation was overcome and the cost of living substantially reduced the trade must be limited, as the expenditure by tourists played a large part in increasing the inflation and driving up the domestic price level and the cost of living.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs said something very much on similar lines in November 1947:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There are other methods of raising taxation.  One of the reasons for the increased cost of living, certainly in our cities, is the influx of tourists, of foreigners, who, quite naturally, come in here because they can buy more food and various luxury articles.  Why not tax the tourist traffic?  Why not have a purchase tax on luxury articles? Why not tax the exports taken away by these tourists?  I suggest that if a purchase tax were put on luxury articles it would yield a return more than enough to meet adequate food subsidies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was a complete misunderstanding because there is plenty of food in this country which tourists purchase and consume in the country and they provided the very best market for farmers to sell their produce to.  That must have little or no effect on the cost of living.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Government still seems to be overshadowed by that consideration although Mr. McMullan challenged them in his statement for making these attacks on the tourist trade and although American experts had such influence on the Minister for External Affairs in connection with Economic Co-operation Administration that he was forced to admit that it was the best dollar-earning trade that we have.  He admitted that both in January and in June, 1949.</P>
    <P>There is no policy regarding tourism. If there were it would not merely affect the Department of Industry and Commerce, <Col N="1017" /> although that would naturally be the centre for it, but also the Department of Education and broadcasting. The Department of Education is in charge of the museum and the art galleries and you could use broadcasting for the purpose of getting tourists to come and in developing all the cultural aspects which are so much developed in other countries.  Take even the publicity side.  The amount spent by the Tourist Board is about the same as would be spent by one city in Britain on trying to induce visitors to come to it.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter about which I should like to ask the Minister. He has not indicated what his attitude is towards the very strong representations which were made to him with reference to the whole traffic of daily and Sunday Press and publications.  It was pointed out to him that the total amount of imported papers is about 23,000,000, with the result that Irish publications are going out of existence altogether.  Over 5,000,000 daily papers are coming into the country; Sunday papers amount to 20,000,000, and periodicals 22,900,000.  Novels are coming in to the amount this year of 742,000.  There is a tax on daily papers. Does the Minister propose to quota these papers?  There is no tax whatever on the Sunday newspapers.  I suggest that if we are to keep anything like an Irish mentality in this country, some strong policy should be adopted by the Department in order to protect our publications in this country, such as they are.  In other countries of the same size as this country, there are far more native papers and publications of various kinds produced and we are overshadowed and crushed by the influx of these into this country.  The Minister himself, at a meeting of industrialists and trade union leaders on 21st April, 1949, drew attention to this factor in these words:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;One of the most difficult problems facing industrialists was to meet the high pressure publicity and advertising from British competitors.  It would be impossible for individual firms to meet that on their own. British manufacturers had an immense home market and they had the advantage of the publicity and <Col N="1018" /> advertising in British daily papers and in the weekly and monthly magazines circulating here.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>so that he is not unaware of the problem and it is very disappointing to find that he has not taken any measures to protect our industry here.</P>

      <P>The greater part of the debate on this Estimate has been devoted to a discussion of the recent announcement by the Trade Union Congress in relation to the demand of the workers for increased wages.  The attention of the House was focussed on this point by the statement by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.  It is a good thing that it should be discussed. Listening to the debate, it seems to me that the breadth and scope of the Estimate is so great that it raises what appear to me to be fundamental issues so far as industry is concerned, the payment of workers and the functions of the Industrial Development Authority.  It is perfectly obvious that we have in the House two minds on the question of the development of Irish industry.  Apprehension has been expressed with regard to the Industrial Development Authority from the point of view of those who fear what they describe as undue interference with industry.  Deputy Coburn indicated his view by saying that he believed the less control there was, the better.  I think the Minister in setting up this authority took a very effective step, so far as the promotion of Irish industry is concerned, and a step that was abreast of the times.  Deputy Timoney remarked that the days of <i>laissez faire</i> are gone, but I do not think that everybody appreciates that yet.  Very many Deputies are still living in that condition of mind created by what is known as the Manchester school of thought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view, industry in this country can prosper and go ahead only if it keeps in step with developments taking place in democratic countries in most parts of the world.  The concept of what is described as free enterprise appears to the minds of many as the untrammelled right of the employers to build their industries in whatever manner they think fit, without any regard whatever for the public good and with <Col N="1019" /> little or no regard for the rights of those who make the industry, the workers.  The attitude of mind which prompts that opinion is, in my view, completely out of date.  It represents no more than a reversion to the old capitalist dogma of the survival of the fittest.  The use of the phrase &ldquo;free competition&rdquo;, which is really an abuse, is very often no more than covering up of the merciless exploitation of workers.</P>
    <P>There must be control of industry in this country as of industry in every country&mdash;control for the public good. Employers in this country, because of their privileged position, must be made to realise&mdash;many of them do realise it, but very many of them do not&mdash;that their primary duty is to the nation, that they have the privilege of producing and manufacturing goods for the use of the nation and that their activities must therefore be subject to the national good.  To talk in terms such as those which were used to-night in statements to the effect that the less control, the better, reflects a complete lack of appreciation of what is happening at present in this country and in Europe generally.  Any examination of the condition of the peoples of progressive countries will show that standards of living can only be maintained by a degree of control on the part of the Government, and, in so far as the Industrial Development Authority will exercise that control, or will exercise direction and leadership in relation to industry, it will be a very good thing and a very much needed thing.</P>
    <P>I do not think that Deputy Lemass in his contribution to this debate served this country too well by suggesting that it was the function of this Government or any Government to give leadership, as it were, to the workers' movement.  I think it would be an impertinence on the part of the Government to usurp the legitimate functions of the trade unions.  We have had too much in the past of the policy of workers being told what the ceiling of wages is to be and how much they will be allowed to earn.  It is a good thing that the present Minister has not assumed the right to dictate to the <Col N="1020" /> workers what they should do in present circumstances.  The trade unions of this country are very well fitted to determine what is for the good of their members and the nation.</P>
    <P>The trade unions of Ireland are more representative of the nation than any other organisation.  They embrace persons of every degree of political thought and their object and ideal is the material improvement and welfare of those whom they represent.  I do not think it could be said that they are led by irresponsible people.  I am aware of the fact that, when they put forward the recent proposal to terminate the agreement whereby workers received an increase of 11/- within the past two years, they were fully appreciative of the consequences of their action.  They also understood that employers can very well afford to lift the ceiling without endangering in the least the national economy.  It is merely raising hares to suggest that there is any need for Government intervention in this situation.</P>
    <P>The question of the increase in the cost of living is a very debatable one. Before the advent of this Government, whenever opponents of the Government then in office made any attack because of the increase in the cost of living, or when trade union representatives appeared before the Labour Court in an endeavour to establish a case for higher wages because of the increase in the cost of living, they were invariably referred by spokesmen of the Government or representatives of the Labour Court, as the case might be, to the cost-of-living index figure.  The cost-of-living index figure has remained stable, it could be said, since the advent of this Government.  At the same time, those of us who have had close contact with the problem of the wages of workers in relation to living costs, are aware of the fact that in many respects the cost of living continues to increase, not to the same degree as during the years of the war.</P>
    <P>Fundamentally, Deputy Lemass's approach was wrong, in this respect, that he proceeded on the assumption that many people proceed upon, that the 1939 rate of wages, which is regarded as the standard by which <Col N="1021" /> present rates should be judged, was a living wage and that we should accept that as representing a fair standard of living.  In fact in 1939 the vast majority of the workers were not receiving a living wage.  So that when present rates of wages of workers are compared with the 1939 rates and the present cost of living is compared with the 1939 cost of living, it should be always borne in mind that in 1939, with the exception of some of the skilled trades and highly organised trades, workers were not in receipt of wages adequate to meet their living problems.</P>
    <P>I feel that, in present circumstances, trade unions are very well justified in seeking an increase, in seeking a revision of the agreement which has existed.  It must be remembered that that agreement was a purely voluntary agreement as between the unions and the employers' organisations.  It has been lived up to by the unions and has been honoured by them, much to the disadvantage of workers in industry.</P>
    <P>During the war, a very definite ceiling was placed on wages.  Machinery was in operation whereby employers, no matter how much profit they made, were given plenty of opportunity to evade the responsibility of increasing the wages of their workers.  The unions now, at least, are free to negotiate as best they can and, in taking the step they have taken, they are doing no more than their duty to the people whom they represent.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a number of other matters which have been mentioned by the Minister in his introductory speech on the Estimate.  The first is a matter that has been mentioned by many Deputies, namely, rural electrification. It is good to learn that the rural electrification scheme will be pushed in the coming year and that the policy of bringing electricity to rural areas will be pursued with vigour.  I would draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the cost of electricity to people in rural areas is almost prohibitive.  I have had cases of cottiers in County Dublin who are being asked to pay a cost per unit which is 100 per cent. more than the price city dwellers pay.  That is a hardship.  The cottiers to whom I refer <Col N="1022" /> are either agricultural workers or county council workers, whose wages are from £3 to £4 per week, whereas city consumers, being industrial workers or white-collar workers, have a very much higher wage or salary rate.  If rural electrification is to become popular and is to be regarded as more than a necessary evil, it is essential that something should be done in connection with the charge for electricity to people living in cottages in rural areas.  A similar case might be made in respect of many of the small landholders, who find it very difficult to meet the charge imposed by the Electricity Supply Board for the installation of this very much needed amenity.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the turf industry. It is well that he devoted a considerable part of his speech to the Government's proposals in relation to the turf industry.  On many occasions, in the House, I have endeavoured to bring the Minister's attention to what I consider to be a basic problem so far as this industry is concerned, that is, the question of wage rates in the industry. Now that all the tumult and the shouting has died in regard to the hand-won turf industry, now that it has been generally accepted by everybody, including the members of the Opposition, that the hand-won turf industry was foredoomed to failure, in any event&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that it was no more than an emergency measure at best, and now that the present Minister is pursuing a policy of bringing the maximum amount of mechanisation to the bogs, which is the only way turf can be produced economically in this country, we can discuss this thing, I think, in a less heated atmosphere than was possible a couple of years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The potential employment available on the bogs, in my view, is practically unlimited.  It is limited only, if it is limited at all, in so far as moneys provided by the State may be limited for the initial opening of the bogs and for <Col N="1023" /> the purchase of machinery for the working of the bogs.</P>
    <P>The history of turf production, in so far as the workers are concerned, has been an unhappy one.  We have not yet reached the position where we can say we have succeeded in convincing the workers that participation in turf production can be for them a beneficial experience, financially and in other respects.  We have not, in other words, succeeded in making it a popular occupation, an occupation that would be sought after.  Until we succeed in doing that, I do not think we will make a success of this industry; I do not think we will be laying the foundation of ultimate success for the turf industry.</P>
    <P>When I say this industry has had an unhappy history, I need only mention that in the heyday of the hand-won turf scheme, when men had no option but to go to Clonsast or Allenwood or Corduff South, or any of the other turf camps, and work there for 1/- or 1/1 an hour, when they had no rights in regard to wet time and when, in fact, they struck in defence of their rights to organise, efforts were made to starve them into submission.  In those days of the hand-won turf scheme on the bogs of Kildare and Offaly, where turf was produced in greater quantity than in any other part of Ireland, we had the example of one worker, whose name I will not mention.  His picture appeared in the <i>Irish Press</i> along with other pictures in a recruiting campaign to bring more workers to Kildare and Offaly.  That worker produced 598 cubic metres of turf in 48 hours, the equivalent of four normal days' work for any man.  He did four times as much work in one day as the other workers could do, and that was in the heyday of the hand-won turf industry. He kept six wheelers going.  The ordinary turf-worker would be put to his best to keep three or four wheelers going.  That man came back the following year, but he could not pass the doctor because his heart was strained.</P>
    <P>That is a serious indictment of the system of turf production which has gone on.  It is a piece rate system entirely and workers are compelled, by <Col N="1024" /> virtue of the fact that the time rate paid on the bogs is and has been so low, to go on a piece rate.  There has been an unhappy and an undesirable situation as far as turf workers are concerned ever since this industry was stopped.  I think it would be a good thing if more people went to see what has happened and what is happening on the bogs of Kildare, Offaly and elsewhere. It would be a good thing if people went down there in the bad times of the year, if they would choose a bad evening, because they could see the night shift going on from 12 to 8 o'clock in the morning.  Those men have to go out on the bog to work, with an east wind blowing.  People can see them sweating, no matter how cold it is, when they are working the De Smithsky and the Ackerman machines.  They are working on a piece work basis, with the result that only the best can survive and make good wages.</P>
    <P>So long as we have that situation existing we are not going to make a success of turf production.  I do not think it is fair that only the most perfect physical specimens, the best types in this country, should be catered for by Bord na Móna.  That is what is happening under the present system. I think there should be an adequate time rate paid to men working on turf production.  They are receiving 1/4d. an hour and that is not adequate; it is not even as much as is paid to farm workers in many areas, and God knows, farm workers are paid low enough.  I repeat that 1/4d. an hour to turf workers is inadequate.</P>
    <P>If we are to make a success of the turf industry something will have to be done about it.  The Minister indicated in reply to a question some time ago that 80 per cent. of the workers on the bogs are working on piece rates and are earning relatively good wages.  The question of the wages being good or relatively good is a matter of opinion. There is this fact to be remembered. that in order to earn substantial wages in the employment of Bord na Móna the workers are required to put out a far greater volume of work than they would be asked to do in any other industry in this country.  They are <Col N="1025" /> called upon to show a far greater degree of effort.</P>
    <P>I am aware that Bord na Móna has its difficulties, but I think the difficulties it has in relation to the cost of production are not insuperable.  I do not think, for instance, that it is fair that a figure of 39/- per ton should be acceptable to Bord na Móna as payment from the Electricity Supply Board for turf provided for the generating station.  It seems to me that that figure is not an economical one.  It does not afford the board an opportunity to provide the workers concerned with a fair wage.  In the long run it simply means that the man who is working down in Clonsast, or in Allenwood or Boora, or Littleton or Lyracrompane, or in any other part of the country in which he may be, is paying by his efforts and his sweat for the provision of electricity to people who in many cases may be far better off than he is from the point of view of material well-being.</P>
    <P>I think that matter should be looked into and some system should be found whereby, if the industry is unable to pay a higher time rate, some means of subsidisation should be introduced.  I suggested on another occasion that the Minister might consider imposing a tax, a nominal tax, upon coal imports. If a nominal tax, say a tax of 1/- per ton were imposed on coal imports, it would provide something in the region of £100,000 for the Exchequer.  I do not see why that could not be done without causing any increase whatever in the retail price of coal.  I think it could be done, without imposing any hardship on the consumer, by requiring the middle-men in the industry to pay that 1/-.  It would not break them and it would be a pretty big thing so far as the turf industry is concerned, if that amount of money could each year be devoted to the purpose of improving the lot of the turf workers.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister, when replying, will give some indication of how soon we may expect developments in so far as the provision of houses for turf workers is concerned because, allied to the question of wages for turf workers, there is the question of the provision of proper housing.  A hostel <Col N="1026" /> life is not a natural life for men.  We have been dependent for the production of turf on men who are accommodated in hostels and there are problems connected with such a life of which anybody who has seen anything of hostel life is very well aware.  It is not a natural thing to bring three or four hundred young men out into the middle of a rural area, remote from towns and from places which they are accustomed to frequent, many of them from towns or cities.  It is not a healthy thing and in time, if the industry is eventually to become part and parcel of our national set-up, as I believe it will, I think that hostel life will have completely to disappear.  By speeding up the building of houses, by building turf villages in Kildare, Offaly, Tipperary and elsewhere where we have hostels at present, the Minister will be taking a step in the right direction so far as the workers are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority as we know is also charged with the responsibility of securing the establishment of new factories in areas which have hitherto been undeveloped. In this connection, I should like to draw the Minister's attention to one problem which is likely to arise, because it has already arisen in County Dublin.  I think it will be found that demands will be made upon the authority and upon the Minister for the establishment of factories in villages or towns where services in the shape of water and sewerage are not available.  Adequate services of this kind are essential as we know to the promotion of industry and the establishment of factories.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister might consider the possibility of empowering the authority to grant or to allocate funds, or even to lend money, to local authorities to provide these services in areas such as I have described.  I have in mind the proposal to establish a factory at Swords, County Dublin, where the water and sewerage services are completely inadequate and where the cost of providing such services, if imposed on the local authority, would mean a very great burden.  I think something should be done, either partially <Col N="1027" /> or totally, in the matter of the provision of moneys for this purpose by the authority and the authority should be empowered to do it.  I have nothing further to add except to say that I hope my remarks, particularly in relation to the workers in the turf industry, will be considered by the Minister and that he will give, when he is replying, some indication as to whether anything will be done in this matter of the inadequate time rate paid to workers on the bogs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather strange, when we hear so much about industrial development and about new industries being started, that out of the £12,000,000 odd which is being borrowed in this country for capital charges, only £20,000 of that is being given to the Department of Industry and Commerce and that all this talk of new industries and the development of existing ones has a counterblast in the words used by the Minister for Finance towards me when I raised this matter on the Budget, that &ldquo;not one penny&rdquo; of that £12,000,000 will go to the development of industry.  I have in mind in speaking on this matter the position of a big industry set on foot by the ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, in the town of Cobh&mdash;the Irish steel industry.  That, as Deputies are aware, was just started and opened in 1939, a week before the war broke out.  It is at present giving full and decent employment to somewhere round 350 able-bodied men. Lying there side by side with the present mill is three-quarters of the machinery required for a sheet mill, to make provision for supplies of corrugated iron in this country.  It has been lying there since 1939.  There was no hope from 1939 to 1947 of getting the balance of that machinery.  I asked the Minister here recently if he had any intention of completing that mill and of installing the balance of the machinery as the mill would give employment to roughly from 150 to 200 more workers, who would be employed in producing something for which we have to pay the foreigner now.  If the Minister wants some suggestions as to the extension of industries, there is one for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1028" /> I think the Minister would be well advised if he took the full plans that were prepared for Irish steel and let the whole lot of them go through in order to give the employment that was originally intended to numbers of our able-bodied men.  There is a present of an industry for the Minister.  He will have no trouble at all with it.  It would be well worth the while of his Industrial Development Authority to go down and investigate the position and get the industry going.  The previous Minister had his own intentions with regard to it.  He had guaranteed the money for the completion of the sheet mill.  That was somewhere around November, 1947.  This is May, 1950.  The industrial-drive men with the new ideas have come in.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke here of putting industries in 17 out of the Twenty-Six Countries.  My thoughts immediately went down to Fermoy, to the condition in which that town is now and to the number of unemployed in the labour exchange there.  I wonder when the Minister is giving out his next industry whether he would remember the condition of affairs there and send the industry down there.  He should also cast his eye on Youghal.  That also wants a heavy industry badly.  He is aware of the need for extending the cement factories. Despite anything that may be said, I believe the Minister is right in extending the present ones rather than starting a new one.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne advocated some degree of control by the Government. I think a little control is a good thing, but there is such a thing as overdoing it.  There is another industry with which the Minister and I are very well acquainted, an industry that a colleague of his in the Cabinet was anxious to see going up the spout.  I refer to the beet industry and to the fact that we are at present paying £12 per ton more for foreign sugar to the Formosans and the Cubans than we could afford to pay to our own producers, either in the field or in the factory. This year we are bringing in 36,000 tons of the stuff that the Deputies enjoy when they go down to the restaurant here-a brown looking substance that is called &ldquo;sugar&rdquo;.  That substance is costing the Irish people £12 per ton <Col N="1029" /> more than would be paid for Irish sugar produced in our own factories.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the question.  I believe the Minister has some control. Did the Minister receive any suggestions as regards price?  If so, what was the result?  We are paying the Formosans to-day the equivalent of £6 a ton for beet.  Why?  With £7 10s. per ton for the same article produced by our Irish farmers I could bring into being the Utopia about which Deputy Dunne spoke a short time ago.  I could pay £5 2s. 6d. to every farm worker engaged in the production of beet if we got another 30/- more per ton for beet.  For that 36,000 tons of sugar £480,000 more is being paid than it would cost to produce the same quantity of sugar in an Irish factory from an Irish field with Irish labour.  There has been talk about the condition of affairs in Córas Iompair Éireann.  I make the Minister a present of this; there is room in the four sugar factories for to produce 80,000 acres of beet.  These four factories could handle that quantity every year.  At present prices the poor old farmer would get £4,063,000 out of it.  If you buy from the Formosans the same quantity will cost £7,200,000&mdash;that is £3,000,000 odd more.  These are the factories we are going to blow up; the beet will go up the spout after the wheat and the peat.</P>

Let us know where we are about Tuam and so forth.  However, we shall have an opportunity to discuss all that in a week or a fortnight's time when the Minister for Agriculture introduces his Estimate.  I am now dealing with the position under which you have to go abroad and pay to the foreigner £12 a ton more than you would give your own people.  Mind you, even at that you got it cheap because the sugar company sold one cargo of it and made £18,000 profit.  Then we talk about conditions here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard my friend, Deputy Coburn on the benches opposite, talk a while ago about the little bit of a black market that is now being indulged in &mdash;of course, it is on the Turkish style now, backsheesh&mdash;3/6 a lb. for butter <Col N="1031" /> and so forth.  I cannot forget that he said that anybody could live on the the ration except people who wanted luxury but there are other things which I cannot forget, either.  I cannot forget the moving appeals I used to hear in this House, day after day and week after week, from the Deputies who were then in opposition but who now sit on the Government side of the House.  They were for ever appealing to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that this class and that class and the other class should be given an extra ration of rationed commodities on account of the particular way in which they have to live.</P>
    <P>The road worker, the fellow working on the turf&mdash;those poor fellows who had to leave their homes early in the morning and take extra tea and sugar and butter with them because they would have no opportunity of getting home for a meal until the evening.  All these types were lined up and appeals were made on their behalf but what is their position now?  We have an extra price operating in regard to unrationed sugar and the grain of tea and the extra price of 3/6 per lb. for butter&mdash; and then the price of milk is going to be reduced.</P>

      <P>There seems to be a mixed grill in the Labour Party now. Deputy Dunne spoke here for the past hour and he said that the trade unions are right to look for an increase for these people.  But Deputy Davin, speaking in this House yesterday, said that Deputy Lemass might be right when he said that the cost of certain commodities had been increased, but increases given to the workers had more than offset any increase in essential commodities. I read that in to-day's <i>Irish Press.</i>  If that is so, what is all the shouting about in relation to trade union increases&mdash;or is Deputy Davin trying to lead a break in the ranks, or anything of that description?  Deputy Dunne, on the one hand, says that the workers will have to get a better do and, on the other hand, we have Deputy Davin saying how well off they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1033" /> I must also express agreement with Deputy Dunne&mdash;it is very seldom I agree with him&mdash;in his references to rural electrification and to the charges imposed particularly on what you might call the poorest class of the community&mdash;or as my friend, Deputy Lehane, would say, the depressed classes&mdash;the unfortunate farm labourer. I think the charges are too high and that it is impossible for a man who is working on the land to-day to dream of having rural electrification.  He has first of all to meet the capital charge for wiring and so forth, but he is not in a position to cope with that expense because of the low wage which, unfortunately, we have to pay him. That situation should be met.</P>
    <P>There was talk this afternoon, in connection with technical assistance about a team of experts being brought over here from America.  I am sure that these experts, if they were put on the job of making tea out of Deputy Dillon's Iraq barley for his cannibal queen would make a fairly good job of it.  Probably it would not drive up the cost of living as high as it is gone up at present in regard to bacon.  Undoubtedly this bad barley which has been imported and which is now used in the admixture scheme and fed to pigs is responsible for the fact that it is impossible to fatten them.  I do not know whether the Minister is responsible for the importation of grain or not.</P>

Deputy Hickey and my colleague, Deputy McGrath, get up here and they make the welkin ring asking why these unfortunate fellows will not travel around delivering milk twice a day instead of once after getting this increase of one-sixth of a penny which was fixed by the Minister.  Deputy Dunne has talked about the conditions of those who work on the bogs and of forestry workers and others.

I know that I would not be in order in dealing with the price of milk except in so far as it affects the cost of living.

It is that dependence on the foreigner that put us in the position of having to pay s/2d. a stone for oatmeal and that is compelling us to pay £12 a ton more for sugar to the foreigner than the price at which it can be produced here.

      <P>To what use was this £325,000 put last year?  The scoring down has gone beyond all hope.  That sum of money could be spent very advisedly in doing something for the cottiers, who find it physically impossible now to pay even the basic charge for putting in the line, not to mind the wiring.  Deputy Dunne complained about the unfortunate man with £5 a week wages, unable to do it, so how can anyone expect the ordinary agricultural labourer, with only £3 a week and six or seven kids, to find enough money to pay the basic charge for rural electrification and afterwards face the other charge for wiring&mdash;two capital charges on him?  One would think that some of this money would be devoted on that line.  Some of the money being saved on this Estimate should go in that way.  It would be far more essential in that way.  I do not wish to delay the House unduly, but this is perhaps one of the most important Estimates that we will have to deal with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMaguire" hpid="Dr. Maguire Dr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the Minister's reply to-day to parliamentary questions and various supplementaries, I am indeed not surprised that the attitude of the Department of which <Col N="1040" /> he is Minister should be such as he expressed it.  I do admit, of course, that irrespective of who is in power the impersonal attitude of the Department of Finance continues to be one of callous indifference to the difficulties&mdash;financial mainly&mdash;of the officers employed on the preventive staff on whose behalf I am speaking at present. It is an amazing thing that the biggest employers of labour in the State, namely, the Government, have hitherto proved themselves to be the least considerate when it comes to a question of compensating their employees following injuries sustained by them in their service to the State.</P>
      <P>I refer to the callous attitude of the Department and when I do so I may say that I am not unmindful of the difficulties confronting the Department in this matter.  But associated as I am intimately with the men of the preventive staff of whose precarious mode of life in the service of the State I am a daily observer, I simply cannot reconcile the Department's attitude with the risks daily incurred by these people in the carrying out of their duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an astonishing thing that in a number of cases the rates of compensation are left entirely to the Minister's discretion.  Surely since the Border became the curse it is to-day the Government has had ample opportunity of legislating for those people who are carrying out the duties of land frontier's men here.  In the past, prior to the division of this country, the coastguard men were empowered to use weapons in order to prevent smuggling and it is an astonishing thing that to-day&mdash;I am glad of it actually and so are the men&mdash;such provision does not exist.  I assert, however, that when these people are risking their lives on behalf of the State&mdash;as everybody must admit&mdash;if they decline to be armed and if it is not considered judicious to arm them at least they should be provided with an armed escort.  Particularly must one assert this in view of the fact that when members of the Garda Siochána consider that they are going to incur a certain amount of risk in the course of their duty they are in a position to demand a military escort.  I do not want to compare the position here <Col N="1041" /> with that obtaining in Northern Ireland where the police State empowers customs men there to be accompanied by an armed escort of Royal Ulster Constabulary men in the course of their duties.  However, one must surely come to the conclusion in view of what I have said that the time is being reached when, with the perfecting of smuggling methods and the devices of these ingenious people, the smugglers will use every effort to further their interests and eventually will stop at nothing to achieve their object.</P>
    <P>As I have said before in this House, living as I do straddle-legged across the Border, I have witnessed the departure from my town of patrols of customs officers, harmless decent individuals, who start off in their motor cars to patrol the mountain passes and lonely roads along the Border.  Hither-to&mdash;though I do not believe without exception&mdash;they regarded this as a quite harmless pursuit and thank Heaven until recently they escaped unmolested. What is to prevent them, however, without ever getting out of the car, from incurring dangerous risks due to the smugglers' ingenuity, say by cutting a trench in the road and ambushing them along various points in the mountain passes?</P>
    <P>Because of all this it really appears to me that the time has come when the State must decide either to protect those officers or else to hold out to them the reward of adequate compensation should their duties on behalf of the State involve them in temporary of total disablement.  The staff of the Customs and Excise in this country, as in other countries, do run certain risks, but surely no one would dispute that the land frontier's men are in the front trenches of our fight against the smuggling fraternity.</P>
    <P>Frankly, it has often occurred to me, even before this recent tragic incident of the assault on those frontier's men, that they appeared to have a nebulous type of job.  They seem to be nobody's baby.  They were unarmed and they were not protected by any force.  It always occurred to me that they were running a certain amount of risk and <Col N="1042" /> I am sorry to say that my fears in this respect were borne out.</P>
    <P>When one gets down to consider the question of actual compensation, it is an astonishing thing that, irrespective of whether an officer is so incapacitated as to be unable to return to his duties, or whether he is able to return to his duties in a modified way, there is absolutely no provision made for pain and suffering in his case.  Not only that, but, in the case of officers who come under the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1934, the medical fees payable do not exceed the sum of £5.  The Minister assured Deputy McGrath to-day that, so far as these injured officers are concerned, all reasonable expense will be met from State funds.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister for how long will he pay the medical expenses and hospital expenses from State funds.  When I recall the case of one of these injured officers at present in Monaghan County Hospital, suffering from what is called an extensive fracture of the skull, to say nothing of his other injuries, which rendered him&mdash;and he is a great friend of mine&mdash;quite unrecognisable to me, I wonder how long will this State benevolence regarding his hospital and medical expenses continue.  In my opinion, this man will never be fit to resume his former occupation.  In the case of the man Rafter in Dundalk, a customs officer who had an accident on the train, the Great Northern Railway won the case when an action was taken against them and the State won their case also.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMaguire" hpid="Dr. Maguire Dr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>What I desire in this case is to see the generosity of the State extended to this extent that the provisions made under Section 1 of the Superannuation Code will be extended <Col N="1043" /> to these officers now in receipt of a salary of £500 and under, and that the Minister will deal generously with them and see that they are adequately compensated.  I have his assurance to-day in that respect regarding officers with remuneration of over £500 a year, but I want it applied to officers under £500 a year to whom the Workmen's Compensation Act only applies, under which they are allowed only £5 for hospital and medical expenses.  I have interviewed a number of officials within the past week in connection with this business and it has cost some of them up to £50 in hospital and medical expenses.</P>
      <P>There is another section of these men to whom I wish to refer specifically and I would do so even had one of them not been one of these men who was savagely assaulted and is now one of the three patients detained in Monaghan County Hospital, a man who is a temporary and unestablished officer. I should like the Minister to be kind enough to tell me if I am correct in saying that, for the period during which this man is incapacitated, his pay will be two-thirds of his ordinary pay, less national health insurance, and that, after six weeks, his pay will cease.  If that is the case, it is hardly necessary for me to tell the Minister what I hope he will do in the circumstances. It is astonishing that these men who have given such valuable service to the State should feel themselves in such a vague and unsatisfactory position regarding compensation in the event of injury which is always imminent. Every time they go out they are liable to be assaulted, and frankly I cannot understand why the State should provide for them any less generous terms than are provided in the case of the Garda under the Garda Síochána Compensation Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my voice to that of Deputy Maguire in appealing to the Minister to deal with these men not on the principles of the workmen's compensation code but on the principles laid down in connection with the Garda Síochána under which the Guards can claim in respect of injury in the execution of their duty. <Col N="1044" /> I am sure that it came as a shock to the country and to Deputies to learn that there was no adequate machinery provided by the State for compensating men such as these who are injured in the execution of their duty.  I think the principles of the Workmen's Compensation Act should not be applied in these cases.  The State in dealing with these cases should apply the principles adopted in relation to members of the Garda who are injured in the execution of their duty.  I suggest that these men should be dealt with on the basis of the malicious injuries code which in respect of the Guards, has been taken over by legislation by the State.</P>
      <P>I know that I cannot advocate legislation on this adjournment debate, but these recent cases have brought it home forcibly to the House and to the country that provision should be made for these men, and the mere fact that the legislation is not at present on the Statute Book should not prevent the Minister from dealing properly and generously with these men.  If the Minister takes that attitude with regard to these cases, he will have the support of this side of the House, and, I am sure, the support of every Deputy on every side of the House.  I appeal to the Minister to deal with these men on that basis and not on the basis of the workmen's compensation code.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will not put me under any condition as to whether he will hear me or not.  I will speak as I am entitled to speak.  If he does not like it, he can clear.  I had to tolerate him.  He described this as &ldquo;callous indifference&rdquo;.  It is not so. That was an Order made in 1946, following an almost identical one in 1945, and it makes, I think, good provision for people who suffer certain injuries. The test is the impairment of physical ability.  That is the test applied in the workmen's compensation cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This particular Order applies to the whole of the Civil Service.  Why am I to make a distinction between customs officers and civil servants as a whole?  The civil servants are divided <Col N="1046" /> into two groups, those earning £500 or under £500 and those earning £500 and upwards.  There are better terms for those earning £500 and upwards and the workmen's compensation terms apply to those earning £500 and under. The code has been there.  It applies to the whole of the Civil Service and I do not know that there has been any demand made by customs officers, as such, for any improvement in the terms of this Order and its application to them.</P>
    <P>The Deputy, of course, is mistaken, as I tried in a delicate way to point out to him to-day, when he speaks of regulations made under the Superannuation Act and says they do not provide for the payment of more than £5 towards the cost of surgical and medical treatment of officers injured.  The phrase has no reference to medical fees, no limitation of £5.  What the Deputy was told or misinterpreted was that, under the Workmen's Compensation Act, when a person goes to the courts to claim his rights the hospital cannot enforce for him more than an amount of £5.  But, that does not mean that more than £5 may not be paid.  What I said in reply to a question to-day was that the Deputy could be assured that, so far as injured officers are concerned, all reasonable expenses will be met from State funds and I do not want that phrase to be taken as a limitation as regards time or a ceiling.  The only limitation, I take it, is reasonable expenses.</P>
    <P>A comparison has been made as between customs officers and the Garda Síochána.  If smugglers are going to behave in the way that customs officers are not merely subjected to risk of injury but are meeting those risks frequently, if what happened on the Border the other day becomes something more than a very abnormal circumstance, then, of course, we will take a new line with regard to that.  At the moment, this is an isolated incident.</P>

This is an isolated incident, so far.</P>

      <P>This is an isolated incident, as far as I am concerned, in this question of the Border.  It is the first time, I know, that there has been a serious affray of the type that occurred the other day.  Once that becomes more common, if we see that there is any sign of smugglers getting into that attitude, there is no doubt, the forces of the State will be used to put it down, and part of putting it down will be the making of provision for the people who help to put it down.  Smugglers who may look for opportunities in future will be aware of certain risks in connection with this trade, if they like to make it dangerous.</P>
      <P>At present, I suggest, the provision is a good one.  It is not callous indifference and, so far, I have no reason to separate Customs people from the rest of the Civil Service.  I have no case to make a change in the Order with regard to civil servants as a whole, no case to make a change in regard to the £500 and under men and the £500 and upward men.  We can observe this in relation to the circumstances as they develop and we will see that the law will develop in order to make it unsound for those people to create such incidents.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 1st June, 1950.</P>
