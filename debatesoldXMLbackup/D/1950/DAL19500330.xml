      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether, in order to obviate delays and to secure efficiency in administration, the Government will consider the advisability of the decentralisation of such Departments as Local Government, Industry and Commerce, and Agriculture.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply I gave in this House to a question by Deputy C. Lehane on the 24th November last.  On that occasion I pointed out that the decentralisation of Government administration is a matter in regard to which serious practical difficulties arise, but I added that the general object which Deputy Lehane had in mind was one with which the <Col N="318" /> Government are in sympathy and that, as the occasion occurs, the question of taking practical steps will be considered.</P>
      <P>Since then there has been no change in the Government's attitude to this question, but I would remind the Deputy that the transfer of the staffs of Departments of State from Dublin to other centres would raise important issues in regard to both office- and living-accommodation and would inevitably cause hardship to many individuals.</P>
      <P>Whether, in fact, such decentralisation would tend to obviate delays and improve the efficiency of administration is a question that would require to be very carefully considered: at first sight, there appears to be some ground for thinking that it might have the contrary effect.</P>

      <P>Payment of unemployment benefit was held up in this case for the reason that evidence came to light which suggested that on a previous claim the man concerned had obtained unemployment benefit to which he was not properly entitled.  On completion of the necessary inquiries a disallowance was imposed with retrospective effect and the claimant became liable to repay the sum which he had overdrawn. The current claim has been released for payment subject to the recovery by deduction of the amount the claimant was held liable to repay.</P>

      <P>Special grants are payable, subject to certain specified conditions, in respect of the instruction of girl pupils of national schools in cookery, laundry work or domestic economy. The expenditure on equipment for these branches is a first charge on the total amount of the grant payable in respect of the instruction and is paid to the person (manager or teacher) by whom this expenditure is incurred.  The balance of the total grant is paid to the teaching staff.  The grant is calculated at the rate of 8/6, plus 5 per cent. in respect of each girl in whose case the specified conditions are fulfilled. The present rate of grant has been in operation since the 1st April, 1938.  I regret I am not in a position at this stage to consider increasing the rate of grant.</P>

      <P>I have not yet received from either of the societies mentioned by the Deputy any reply to the letter which I have addressed to them on the subject of milk prices, but I see no reason why they should be perturbed by my recent statement at Dungarvan on the subject.  In the course of that statement I outlined what appears to me to be the immediate future of the dairy industry, and I urged dairy farmers to take the long-term view by consenting to a reduction in price now with a compensatory guarantee of stability for a period of five years.  The alternative is to maintain the existing price in the certain knowledge that sooner or later the operation of economic forces will inevitably bring that price down&mdash;to what level it is impossible to forecast&mdash;and also in the knowledge that continued expansion of butter production at the existing price of milk will, unless checked, place such a burden upon the Exchequer as will become impossible to meet.  The responsibility for making a final decision in this matter rests with the industry itself, and if my proposals are not acceptable to the industry, no change in price for the year 1950-51 will be made.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Deputy to consider carefully whether my proposal, or the creation of a surplus of butter or other milk products which cannot be disposed of owing to their high cost of production, is the more likely to bring about a reduction in the numbers of our live stock.</P>

      <P>The hospital authorities have submitted a scheme, which is estimated to cost £60,000, to the Hospitals Commission and the commission have reported to me on this scheme.</P>
      <P>The commission consider that it is possible to modify the scheme, without radically altering it, so that the cost can be reduced to £50,000.  I have requested the Hospitals Commission to discuss the problem again with the hospital authorities to discover whether it is possible to arrive at an agreed scheme.</P>
      <P>If agreement can be reached on a satisfactory scheme the necessary sanction will be issued without delay.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that, from the beginning, since this scheme came before his Department for consideration, this hospital has been kicked backwards and forwards between the Hospitals Commission and his Department like a rugby football? Is he further aware that the original scheme was estimated to cost in the neighbourhood of £75,000 and, as a result of a cutting-down process, it was brought to its present figure, which is the lowest sum the scheme can be carried out for if it is to be of any use? Will he agree, if this hospital requires from his Department or from the Hospitals Fund an additional sum of £10,000 to the £50,000 they have in hands, that it will be a very cheap gift from his Department that will accrue to the citizens of Dublin in the establishment of this much-needed outdoor dispensary?</P>

      <P>Curiously enough, this scheme, so far as I am informed, is one of many post-war schemes started in 1946 and the cost at that time was estimated in the region of £120,000.  It is now estimated that adequate accommodation of the kind required can be provided for £50,000.  From my knowledge of the finance of the Hospitals Sweeps Fund and from my knowledge of the finances of the hospital, if the hospital authorities can be persuaded that neither I, the Hospitals Sweeps Fund nor the hospital can afford an outpatients' department which will cost £60,000, we can then proceed with the very necessary building.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I reminded the House that the Deputies who now support the Government and the Parties which constitute the Coalition, having used the Dignan plan as a political blackthorn over a number of years, have now thrown it over the hedge&mdash;somewhat undignified treatment to give a prelate who has given considerable public service to the people of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of my remarks of that aspect of the matter, I think I was led to say something about the record of the Tánaiste and present Minister for Social Welfare in regard to the Department of Social Welfare.  I think I may say at once that I went rather further than records which I have been able to put my hands on&mdash;I make that <Col N="352" /> reservation&mdash;would justify, because the record of the Minister in respect of the Department of Social Welfare is like the curate's egg&mdash;it is not so bad in parts, nor so good either.</P>
    <P>The House will remember the vehemence with which the Act to set up the Department of Social Welfare was attacked by certain Deputies who now constitute the major portion of the Government.  Fianna Fáil was assailed on the grounds that it was setting up two new Departments, two new Ministries and that it was going to impose further burdens on the people. On that question a division was taken on the Second Stage of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill.  In the division lobby, strange to say, the Minister for Social Welfare, whose heart had been bleeding for so long for the destitute people of this country, was not to be found on the side of the Bill; and neither was Deputy Davin nor Deputy Keyes nor any other member of Deputy Norton's Party.  Not a single one of them voted against for this Bill on its Second Reading, and neither, of course, did they vote against it.  They were walking the tight rope, trying to face both ways at once.  Deputy Davin wanted to be able to go down the country and tell the farmers that he had not voted to set up this expensive Department, and Deputy Norton wanted to do likewise with the Kildare farmers, and so they were both absent with all their Party from the division.  That is why I say that in respect of this matter of the setting up of the Department of Social Welfare the Tánaiste's record is like the curate's egg&mdash;not so bad in places&mdash; and that is about all one can say in his favour.</P>
    <P>Now, Sir, to come, with your permission, to the principal purpose of the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal purpose of the Bill, according to the statement of the Tánaiste, is to provide office accommodation for the sections of his Department which, we are told, are now housed in ten separate scattered buildings and by centralising the <Col N="353" /> staff and administration in one building they hope to make for smoother administration.  That, of course, is a condensation of what the Minister had to say on it.  He expatiated at much greater length on the disadvantages which accrue to the public interest by reason of the manner in which the staffs of his Department are scattered all over the city.  He said there was a lack of co-ordination, a lack of cooperation, a lack of that personal contact between the higher officers which makes for smooth and efficient working and a considerable loss of time whenever a conference of the higher officials had to be called by the Minister.  But what applies to the Minister's Department applies to every other Department in this State.  The Department of Finance is in the same position; the Department of Local Government is in the same position; its headquarters are in the Custom House, but some sections of the Department are housed in Harcourt Street.  The same is true of every Department in the State.  Its officers, its branches and its sections are scattered widespread over the city. What is true of the Department of Social Welfare, and what has necessitated the introduction of this Bill in the case of the Department of Social Welfare must also necessitate some comprehensive plan being undertaken to house Government Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But, Sir, full justification of the foresight and long vision of the Fianna Fáil Administration has been furnished in this House by the statement made last night by the Minister for Social Welfare.  In that same statement he condemned and refuted the contrary statement which his colleague, the Minister for Defence, made in the City of Cork a few weeks ago.  We have now admitted, let me emphasise that again, the need to find better office accommodation for the Departments of State if we are going to have efficient administration.  And it is not a question as to whether it is going to cost £1,000,000, £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 or £11,000,000, as Deputy Con Lehane suggested; it is a question of trying to get the best possible accommodation we can for the most important work that can be done in this country, the <Col N="354" /> efficient administration of the public services.  It is not the size of the amount involved that should deter us, but it is whether the expenditure is absolutely essential and as to whether the money is going to be spent in the best possible way.</P>

      <P>And bring Stalin over to help.  It is quite clear that Deputy Cowan and other people who have been crying out about the alleged extravagance of Fianna Fáil do not want to hear the comments which I am making upon the admission of the Minister for Social Welfare.  They do not want to let the public know what the public and the country should be told, and that, of course, is why they are trying to interrupt.</P>
      <P>Arising out of what I have said, the need for a centralised block of offices to provide for the accommodation of the public administration is now recognised and admitted by the Government. We have introduced to us in this Bill a solution for an urgent problem in what I submit is the worst possible way.  The main reason for introducing this Bill is, as the Tánaiste himself has admitted, to provide him with funds which are to be used to purchase and adapt for use as public offices a building which was designed for quite another purpose.  That is why I say the solution proposed is the worst possible one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an alternative solution to it, however.  The plans for it exist, worked out in detail in the Office of Public Works.  There is an alternative solution to the problem which confronts the Minister for Social Welfare, and I say that alternative solution ought to be adopted by the Dáil, <Col N="355" /> instead of the proposal which this Bill is designed to facilitate, and which this Bill has been introduced in order that it may be given effect to.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste said, let me remind the House again, that the funds of the society which were at present invested in various remunerative investments are now to be used in the investment and equipment of premises to be used by his Department.  The first question, therefore, that arises is, whether it is necessary to use these funds in this particular way, to purchase a building for use as offices by the Department of Social Welfare which was designed for quite another purpose.  I say it is not.  I base that contention on the fact that there exist now in the pigeon holes of the Office of Public Works fully-detailed plans for the erection of properly-designed Government offices on a site where they would not aggravate traffic problems in Dublin. There is a considerable amount of vacant space within the confines of Dublin Castle yard.  Plans were prepared some years ago for the provision of suitable office accommodation upon the sites which were there available.</P>
    <P>When this present Government came in, in order that they might attempt to justify the canards and the slanders which they had been spouting from all the political platforms during the general election, they shut down on the development of these plans in precisely the same way as they shut down on mineral development, Aer Lingus and the short-wave broadcasting station.  But it was not long before they were driven to the conclusion, as the Tánaiste has been driven to the conclusion, that these plans should be proceeded with or some alternative to them adopted.  What do we find?  In order to retrace their steps and to cover up their own blunders&mdash;everybody knows it and there is no use in their trying to conceal it&mdash;they prohibited Córas Iompair Éireann from proceeding to complete the building almost completely erected which had been designed for the purposes and use of Córas Iompair Éireann and as a central bus station for the use, not <Col N="356" /> merely of the people of Dublin, but the people of every part of Ireland.</P>
    <P>What are the consequences?  Córas Iompair Éireann has been hampered and hamstrung by having to endure the same sort of conditions in relation to its staff as the Tánaiste has found unbearable in relation to the staff of his Department.  Córas Iompair Éireann has its officers and offices scattered all over the city.  The Minister for Social Welfare admits that his Department could not be economically or efficiently run because he has his staffs and his offices scattered all over the city.  But Córas Iompair Éireann, because the Government wanted to bankrupt it, because it wanted to discredit it with the public, was prohibited from proceeding with the construction of a modern office building adapted to meet not merely the needs of the railways but the needs of the growing bus traffic which is fast becoming the public transport system of the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare, in order to cover up that vindictive act of sabotage on the part of his colleague in the Government, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, comes along and says that he must have proper office accommodation and that he proposes to acquire the proposed central bus station in Store Street. Everybody knows, of course, that all this has followed from two things, the evil combination of two acts, the act of sabotage in relation to Córas Iompair Éireann by prohibiting the completion of the central bus station and the act of sabotage in relation to the public services of this State by refusing to permit the construction of the new office buildings in the Castle yard.</P>
    <P>Now, what is the position?  We are going not merely to have to occupy the congested centre of the City of Dublin with the building at Store Street originally designed for a bus terminal, but we are also going to have to utilise some more of the valuable ground and open spaces in the City of Dublin to provide an unsatisfactory alternative to that bus station, and the Minister for Social Welfare is going to utilise the funds of the society in order to <Col N="357" /> buy a building that the Government is too nearly bankrupt to be able to purchase for itself.  That is the reason why this Bill, which bears on its face every evidence of hasty and ill-considered drafting, has been introduced. That is the reason why this Bill, which the Minister could not explain to the Dáil when he was introducing it, has been introduced. That is the reason why we have this Bill without any explanatory memorandum, even though the Bill is full of cross-references to sections in British statutes which are most difficult to obtain access to, and which have been amended and revised by successive statutes, not merely of the British Parliament, but of the Oireachtas itself.</P>
    <P>I said that that was the reason why this Bill has been hastily introduced, so hastily introduced that the Minister does not understand it himself, and I am going to prove that. Last night I drew attention to the fact that the Bill contained in its definition section a reference to certain funds, and I asked the Minister in charge of the Bill to tell the House and the public how the guarantee fund, which is going to disappear, I think, under Section 13 of the Bill, came to be set up.  If Deputies will look at the definition section they will see that it should not have been necessary to put a question of that sort, that the Minister in introducing the Bill should at least have had the courtesy to explain to his colleagues in Dáil Eireann, to his fellow members in Dáil Eireann, who have the same sort of responsibilities as he has for considering legislation in this House, but who have not the same opportunities as he has of informing themselves in relation to these matters, what the guarantee fund was.  As he did not do it, I, in discharge of my duty to the House and to the country, asked the Minister to tell me how this guarantee fund had been set up for the purpose of Section 26 of the Act of 1911.  I got, of course, the sort of reply that one might expect to get from the Tánaiste.  It began with a tirade of abuse.  I was told&mdash;I am quoting from the Tánaiste's speech&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="358" />&ldquo;In case the Deputy is not able to grasp the Bill, may I tell him....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>May I say that if a Deputy is not able to grasp the Bill or the contents of it, it is his public duty before he votes to try to make certain that someone does inform him what is in the Bill and what he is going to vote for?  It may happen that there are Deputies who do not feel that obligation on them, but other Deputies, who do take their public duties seriously, are entitled for their own enlightenment and the enlightenment of their colleagues to make certain that they do understand what is in the Bill.  Therefore, if a Deputy does ask a question, he should not be treated in this supercilious way by a Minister when replying. The Minister should assume that the question is a <i>bona fide</i> one and, without comment upon the querist's ignorance or otherwise, he should give a straight answer.  Let me repeat:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In case the Deputy is not able to grasp the Bill may I tell him that the guarantee fund is a fund created by the 1911 Act, which he apparently administered for a long number of years without knowing anything about it?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have that Act here and if the Minister can show me where in the Act there is a reference to this guarantee fund I shall be very glad; because if it is there, then quite obviously, my eyesight must be failing, or my memory must be failing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I can find no reference in the Act of 1911 to the setting up of a guarantee fund.  However, the Minister, and I am very grateful to him for it, went on to enlighten my ignorance. He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The fund is designed to make good deficits in particular societies which then existed separately.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am grateful, indeed, for the strenuous effort the Minister has made to enlighten my ignorance.  It is a great pity, however, that by giving me inaccurate information he may have my confusion worse confounded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here is what Section 26 says about <Col N="359" /> the guarantee fund.  I will read it for the Minister:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every approved society and every society desirous of becoming an approved society shall give such security as the insurance commissioners may consider sufficient to provide against any malversation or misappropriation by officers of the society of any funds coming to the hands of the society under this part of this Act and in determining the amount of the security to be required the commissioners shall have regard to the amount of the funds so coming into the hands of the society, provided that no security shall be required from any society which proves to the insurance commissioners that the only funds coming into the hands of the society under this part of this Act are such funds as are required for reimbursement to the society of sums previously expended by the society under this part of this Act;</P>
    <P>(2)  In the case of an approved society with branches having insured persons among their members, security shall be given in respect of each such branch by the society;</P>
    <P>(3)  The insurance commissioners may from time to time vary the amount of security to be given or maintained by an approved society as may be thought proper and where security is given by way of deposit of securities the society which made the deposit, may with the consent of the insurance commissioners, substitute other securities for the securities for the time being deposited.  Any interest or dividends arising from the securities deposited by the approved society under this section shall be paid to the society.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Will any Deputy tell me that he heard me mention the words &ldquo;guarantee fund&rdquo; once while I recited the terms of that section under which the Minister tells us this fund was set up? The fund, perhaps, was set up under regulations made by the National Health Insurance Commissioners of Ireland, in the first place, and then subsequently modified and amended by the Minister for Local Government.  It <Col N="360" /> is quite clear that what the Minister had in mind when he was talking about this was not the guarantee fund to which I referred but a fund that was originally set up and called the central fund.  That was a fund designed precisely for the purpose which he mentioned. I think that fund was set up under the Act of 1918.  The purpose of the fund was to provide a sort of general reserve for all the approved societies from which, if the valuation of the assets of any society disclosed a deficit greater than the resources of the society, or the capacity of its members, would enable that to be liquidated within a reasonable term, the resources of the society could then be supplemented.  I am afraid I am not quite as precise as I should be in making that statement, but the House will understand what I mean.  There was a central fund established into which certain moneys, at one stage a sum of £150,000 a year plus the proceeds of what was known as unclaimed stamps, were paid, and out of these moneys a fund was built up which was available as a sort of last reserve to meet any society which had got into difficulty, no matter how that difficulty may have arisen; and that is the fund, I think, the Minister had in mind when he referred to the guarantee fund. Under the Act of 1942 that central fund became the National Health Insurance Reserve Fund.</P>
    <P>I said that this hastily-drafted Bill is introduced so that the funds which have been subscribed by or on behalf of insured persons may be used to buy a building for Government offices that the Government itself is too nearly bankrupt to be able to provide for itself.  In this Bill we have an exemplification of how the Minister for Finance proposes in future to deal with funds which are under his control.  At column 274 of Volume 119 of Dáil Debates on 21st March last the Minister for Finance said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The moneys will be found, first of all, from the American Loan Counterpart Fund, eventually by borrowing and possibly from certain other sources, in other words, Government funds which are at present ready for investment in some of these projects.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="361" /> As the law stands at present the Minister could not invest these moneys, which are not his property but which he holds as a trustee for the people by whom they have been subscribed or on whose behalf they have been subscribed, so that they will in due course receive the benefits to which their subscriptions entitle them.  The Minister for Finance should not be allowed to play ducks and drakes with those funds&mdash;to spend them now upon ill-considered projects such as the commandeering of a bus terminal building or in converting this country into the replica of a tank graveyard by dumping all sorts of heavy engineering machinery over it, as the Minister for Agriculture, apparently, is ambitious to do.  He should find the money out of taxation and not take it out of the funds that have been subscribed to pay the benefits that insured persons are entitled to under the National Health Insurance Scheme.</P>
    <P>We have been hearing a lot recently about capital investments.  It has been indicated to us that we are even going to borrow in order to provide the yearly sums that are necessary to pay the housing subsidies.</P>

They will not subscribe to their loans, and the Minister for Finance has admitted that. Therefore, they have to go and take the money where they can find it.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare, in introducing this Bill, said that an important provision concerned the funds of the society which were, up to the present, invested in various investments and that these were now to be used for the purchase and equipment of premises to be used by his Department.  If the Government proposes to provide itself with new buildings it should surely be done in one of two ways.  If the buildings are to be constructed over a number of years then the resources should be provided in the ordinary way, as was done in the past, out of voted moneys itemised in the Vote for Public Works and Buildings.  On the other hand, if the expenditure is so great and the urgency is so great, then they ought to be provided out of borrowed moneys raised in the open market in the manner in which the Government has been accustomed to raise its loans in the past.  But, because the Government cannot go to the open market, it has to adopt the procedure which it proposes to adopt under Part III of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Since I have come, perhaps a little prematurely&mdash;because there were quite a number of other things that I had to say about other features of this Bill&mdash; to Part III, perhaps it might not be any harm if we saw precisely what was going to be done there.  The Bill has been hastily drafted.  If not, then certainly it has been drafted with the idea of making it is as difficult as it can possibly be made for a person of normal intelligence, as I hope I am, to grasp what it is proposed to do.  In Part III of the Bill, Section 21 (1) provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Payments may be made out of the fund in respect of expenditure by the Minister on the acquisition of lands, premises, furniture or equipment or the construction or reconstruction of premises, and any such lands, premises, furniture or equipment shall be held by the Minister on behalf of the fund.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That looks all very well.  It looks as if all the Minister is going to do is that <Col N="363" /> if the building is going to cost £5,000,000&mdash;and it is going to cost a lot of money before they are finished with it&mdash;he takes the £5,000,000 and buys the building.  Then you go to paragraph 3 and see a statement as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There shall be an investment return in respect of payments made out of the fund under sub-section (1) of this section and such return shall be in the form of contributions to the fund in respect of the payments made out of the fund.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On that particular sub-section, may I say that I have never yet seen&mdash;of course, I am not a lawyer and I have not studied a great number of statutes &mdash;that phrase &ldquo;an investment return&rdquo; used in the precise way in which it is used here?  I think it is obviously ambiguous.  It might refer to a record or a report or a statement of investments. What it means, in fact, is that interest shall be paid as upon an investment. That, I think, is what it is intended to mean.  Whether the courts would uphold that it does, in fact, mean that, is another matter.  But there is some proof that this Bill has been hastily drafted because the Bill is not clear, because the intention is not clear, on the face of it.  We have to guess what it means.  I could argue that &ldquo;investment return&rdquo; means a record, a report or a schedule of investments. As against that, however, it could be argued that it meant an investment which would yield a return of interest. However, that is merely a minor point, anyhow, and only by the way.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the second paragraph of sub-section (3).  Remember that in sub-section (1) the Minister was empowered to acquire lands or premises.  In the first paragraph of sub-section (3) there is an obligation which is not clear&mdash;but, as I am reading the section, I take it that it implies that there will be an obligation on the Minister to ensure that if he invests the funds of the society in the acquisition of premises or lands, or for the reconstruction of premises, the society would secure an adequate return from those premises.  But, if that is the purpose, <Col N="364" /> we find that all that purpose is going to be defeated by the second paragraph of sub-section (3).  It reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For the purposes of this sub-section, the payments made out of the fund under sub-section (1) of this section shall, on the former staff of the society being transferred to any premises acquired pursuant to that sub-section, be regarded as being reduced by the value (as agreed upon between the Minister and the Minister for Finance) of the part of those premises that are occupied by the former staff of the society.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So, at once, under the second paragraph of this sub-section, the assets of the society are going to be written down by the value of the premises acquired.  We have here a building to be acquired for the purpose of housing a Government Department.  Instead of the Government Department financing that building out of the Central Fund, it goes and robs the National Health Insurance Fund.  Why all the urgency for the Bill except to conceal that fact?  The Government is so hard driven to meet its commitments that it rushes in this Bill in this form.  This is what you might describe as a smash-and-grab raid&mdash;and the Minister has become the particular smash-and-grab agent of the Minister for Finance.  He is going to smash the National Health Insurance Society and he is going to grab its funds.  That is the principal purpose, as the Minister himself has admitted, of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is something else happening in Part III, Section 21 of the Bill.  There are some other rather curious provisions in this Part of the Bill which are even more startling than that. Sub-section (7) of Section 21 reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In dealing at any time before the 1st day of July, 1954....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder why the 1st July, 1954, was selected?  Is it because that by that period the Minister for Finance hopes he will have been elevated to the Bench&mdash;I am told he has ambitions in that direction&mdash;and that his angry constituents in Dublin North Central, who have been pressing him regarding the disposal of Store Street, will no longer <Col N="365" /> be a menace to him?  However, passing away from 1st July, 1954, and coming to what is a much more important aspect of the sub-section, we read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...with any matter arising out of any acquisition, construction or reconstruction pursuant to sub-section (1)  of this section or arising out of any disposal pursuant to sub-section (5)  of this section, it shall not be obligatory on the Minister to refer to any other Minister or obtain the consent or sanction of any other Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What does that mean, except that under that sub-section the Minister for Finance is being ousted from his constitutional function?  I say &ldquo;constitutional function&rdquo; advisedly because the Minister for Finance under our Constitution holds a special place.  He must be a member of Dáil Éireann because he must be a Minister responsible to Dáil Éireann for the disposal of public moneys.  Here we have in this Bill&mdash;I doubt if the Bill is not repugnant to the Constitution&mdash;a proposal to oust the Minister from his position as the Minister responsible to Dáil Éireann for the management of public moneys and public properties. What is going to be the position? Under this Bill, the Minister for Social Welfare may buy from whom he likes, what he likes and for as much as he likes.  He may sell to whom he likes what he likes to buy under this Bill, and for as much as he likes to ask.  I think that is a very unsound principle to accept.  I hope that even the ranks of the Coalition will rebel against it if they have any regard for their responsibility to the taxpayers of this country. It is a very sound principle that a Minister cannot dispose of public moneys in that way except with the consent of the Minister for Finance. Quite obviously this is intended to oust the responsibility of the Minister for Finance to Dáil Éireann in respect to the user of the funds which the Minister for Social Welfare is going to get under this Bill and in respect of the power to purchase or acquire premises.</P>
    <P>Then what do we have at the end <Col N="366" /> as a finale to this particular section? We have this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This section shall be deemed to have come into operation on the 1st day of July, 1949.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Why is it necessary that the particular section relating to the acquisition of property should come into operation on 1st July, 1949?  Why did the Minister not tell us the reason when he was introducing this Bill?  Why should he try to keep it from the public? Why should he endeavour to conceal it?  Surely there is some explanation, something that apparently the Minister is not anxious to disclose to the Dáil.  It is a most peculiar situation. The Minister is presumed not to have had power to acquire these premises. He is only attempting to take the power now, but we are to back-date the power for almost 12 months, back to 1st July, 1949.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have noticed that Deputy Lemass has been putting a series of questions down in relation to the Store Street building which the Minister for Social Welfare has told us he proposes to acquire under this section.  Deputy Lemass put those questions first to the Taoiseach, asking whether the Government had agreed to purchase Store Street station; whether, if it purchased Store Street station, it yet knew how much it would have to spend to adapt the Store Street building to the needs of the Department of Social Welfare; whether, if it had not yet purchased Store Street station, it had entered into any negotiations in relation to the purchase, and whether, if it had entered into any negotiations in relation to the purchase, plans were being prepared for the adaptation of these buildings to the use of the Department of Social Welfare.  A whole series of other questions of the same nature were put, trying to obtain for the benefit and information of the public the facts as to the relationships between the Government, Córas Iompair Éireann and the Department of Social Welfare in regard to this building about which there has been so much controversy.  The Taoiseach refused to answer him and fobbed him off on the <Col N="367" /> Minister for Finance.  The same questions were put down to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Finance refused to answer them and fobbed them off on the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce refused to answer them, and Deputy Lemass was sent to the Minister for Social Welfare; but no Minister has given to the public the information which Deputy Lemass has asked for. Yet here is the proof in this section that some negotiations have been going on, that some indication had been furnished to someone that Store Street station was going to be acquired and that there must have been some discussion as to the terms upon which it is going to be acquired, the responsibility for adapting it and the cost to the public of adapting for the use of the Department of Social Welfare a building which was designed for quite another purpose.</P>
    <P>I pass on from Section 21, or, perhaps, instead of passing on, I should retrace my steps to show the nature of the legislative proposal which is being submitted to the Dáil.  I go back, as an example of the manner in which this Bill has been drafted to sub-section (2) of Section 2&mdash;what is commonly called the definition section. Here we find this phrase:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A reference in this Act to performance of functions includes, as respects powers, a reference to exercise of powers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The craze for economy has gone to such lengths that the Government, rather than make its definition clear, tries to concertina what should be two separate statements into one sentence.</P>
    <P>Let us see how that works out when we come to apply this reservation&mdash;it is not, in fact, a reservation, but this extension of meaning&mdash;to one of the sections of the Bill.  Remember that we are told a reference in this Act to performance of functions includes, as respects powers, a reference to the exercise of powers, and then we come to Section 5 (2) and we read this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The functions which the society had immediately before the transfer <Col N="368" /> day are hereby transferred to the Minister and shall be performed by him.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Could somebody tell me, if you try to construe that statement in the light of what is said in Section 2 (2), what precisely it means in regard to powers?  It is clear enough in relation to functions, but if we try to substitute the word &ldquo;powers&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;functions&rdquo; what do we get?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The powers which the society had immediately before the transfer day are hereby transferred to the Minister and shall be performed by him.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no other way in which that section can be read.  One can exercise, use, or avail of powers, but I have never yet known it to be common English usage, and I doubt if it is used in law, to say that you can perform powers.  But there it is, and it shows you the manner in which this Bill has been drafted.</P>
    <P>If one wishes to read through this Bill, there are a number of other examples of clumsy and hasty drafting. I come, however, to what is perhaps, from the point of view of the general mass of the people, a much more serious aspect of the proposal than any I have yet touched upon.  It has not been mentioned by the Tánaiste in introducing the Bill.  He was mainly concerned with smashing the society as rapidly as possible, and grabbing its assets with equal alacrity. But there are others than the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Social Welfare, and the staff of a Department which has to be housed in a suitable building, who ought to be considered.  Deputies know that under the national health code insured persons have certain rights <i>vis-a-vis</i> the society, and certain rights of appeal from the society to the Minister.  Section 5 (3) says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Nothing in this section shall affect the rights or obligations under the Acts of insured persons or of employers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Under the Act of 1911 there was a provision made for the settlement or the determination of disputes.  Briefly it meant this originally, that if a person <Col N="369" /> was aggrieved by the action of an approved society in refusing to pay benefits which he claimed to be entitled to, he had an appeal to the National Health Insurance Commissioners.  After the passage of the Ministers and Secretaries Act of 1924 the National Health Insurance Commissioners for Ireland disappeared and their place was taken by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  Ever since, whenever a person was denied the benefits to which he was properly entitled, by any of the approved societies, before the passage of the 1933 Act, or by the unified society after the passage of the 1933 Act, he had an appeal to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Of what avail is that going to be to him now?  Deputies who have been in touch with national health insurance matters know that that was a very important right.  It is going to disappear under this Bill despite Section 5 (3).  The Minister will now become the society.  He will have all the powers of the society and you will be appealing from Satan to Beelzebub, if you are appealing from the Minister for Social Welfare to the Minister for Social Welfare in a matter of this sort. He is going to be the big end of the stick.  The rights of insured persons are not going to be the same after the passage of this Bill, whatever Section 5 (3) says.  They will become radically altered, because there is no right of independent appeal left to them and there is no provision in this Bill for it. The Minister for Social Welfare becomes the sole arbiter of their destinies; he can pay them what he likes, or refuse to pay them if he likes, and the only satisfaction they will have, after the passage of this Bill, is that they will know he has collared their funds and will use them for the purpose of meeting charges that ought to be charges on the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other matters that will arise for consideration in the course of the Committee Stage.  What is going to happen to the National Health Insurance Reserve Fund?  I have some interest in that fund.  I was responsible for setting it up.  What will happen to that fund and to the benefit fund?  They are going to be placed at <Col N="370" /> the disposal of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Welfare to do virtually what they like with&mdash;the Minister for Social Welfare between now and 1st July, 1954, and after that date both Ministers if they agree together can do what they like with the money.  They can buy land for Government purposes, they can buy property to house more Government Departments, and as the Department for Social Welfare grows more and more, the whole fund which was originally designed to provide benefits, and which was called the benefit fund, can be disposed of in the manner in which the Minister for Social Welfare proposes to dispose of part of it in this Bill.</P>
    <P>What did we say in 1942 about the National Health Insurance Reserve Fund?  It is the only buffer that stands between the national health insured person and the difficulties which their society might have got into if abnormal conditions were to arise. The benefit fund similarly is the fund which was accumulated over the years by the surplus contributions of insured persons, and it was the source and the basis of the stability of the society, and out of the surplus income of which the additional benefits were being provided.</P>
    <P>We do not know what the position of the benefit fund is to-day.  We do not know what the position of the National Health Insurance Fund&mdash;&ldquo;the fund&rdquo; it is called in the Bill&mdash; is to-day, and we do not know what the position of the National Health Insurance Reserve Fund is to-day.  The Minister did not tell us, but we are entitled to know that.  I think he ought to have told us that when he was introducing this Bill.  What is more, so far as the Minister is concerned this Dáil is not going to get any further information on that matter. The reason I say that is this.  If Deputies will turn to Section 19&mdash;may I say, incidentally, that here we have an example of the hasty printing and drafting of the Bill&mdash;they will see it deals with two more or less different matters.  Sub-section (1) of Section 19 deals with Section 2 of the National Health Insurance Act, 1942.  That provided <Col N="371" /> that there should be quin-quennial valuations which would indicate the position of the assets of the society, whether they were sufficient to cover the existing and future liabilities of the society at the date upon which the valuation was made. Under sub-section (1) of Section 19 these valuations are no longer going to be made, and with the repeal of that section there disappears the obligation on the part of the Minister to lay a copy of the actuary's report of his valuation before the House.  Sub-section (2) of Section 19 deals with something quite different.  It provides that in sub-section (4) of Section 3 of the National Health Insurance Act, 1942, certain words will be substituted. Sub-section (4) of Section 3 of the National Health Insurance Act, 1942, provided:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In this Act references to the amount made available for additional benefits in any year of an additional benefit period shall be construed as references to the amount determined by the Minister under this section in relation to such year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>For that sub-section it is proposed to substitute:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;such amount (not being less, in the case of the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1951, and of the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1952, than £300,000) as may be fixed with respect to the year in question by the Minister for Social Welfare with the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I only quote sub-section (19) (2) to prove my contention that this Bill has been hastily drafted, because it provides for something entirely different from what is proposed in sub-section (1) of the section.  There should have been, as is the custom when a specific matter is being dealt with in a Bill, a new section to cover it and a separate marginal note.  However, I say that only on the general question of the haste with which this Bill and the carelessness, if I may put it that way, with which the Bill has been submitted to the Dáil by the Minister.</P>
    <P>To come back to Section 19 of the <Col N="372" /> Bill, perhaps I should point out again that Section 2 of the Act of 1942 obliged the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, after the expiration of each financial period (other than the first financial period) to appoint an actuary whose duty would include the making of a comprehensive review of the finances of the National Health Insurance Society at the end of such financial period.  Now, it is an extraordinary thing that the last relevant financial period in this matter should have been the 31st day of December, 1948.  We are now approaching the middle of 1950.  There was a review of the actuarial position.  I think, in the year 1943.  The report was published and is available to the House.  What has the Minister done in regard to the obligation to have an actuarial valuation made of the society's position as at the end of 31st December, 1948? Has he had the valuation, is he afraid to disclose it or what has happened to it?  Why was it necessary to put that provision in the Bill?</P>
    <P>I have commented elsewhere, in dealing with this question of the alleged social security scheme which the Minister is going to produce, about the paucity of the statistical information supplied in the White Paper.  Surely if we are going to have a social security service upon a sound financial basis, we ought to have an actuarial valuation made of the existing liabilities under existing social services.  Why is it necessary to put Section 19 in the Bill?  What is the Minister afraid to disclose?  Is it that he does not want to admit to the public that he has been so careless about the financial implications of his truseeship over a public Department that he has not even bothered to take steps to have an actuarial valuation made, or has the actuarial valuation been made and does he not want to disclose the result?  Does he, instead, want to bury it deep in his files?  Is he afraid, for instance, that it would afford too much ammunition for critics of further forthcoming legislative proposals of his?</P>
    <P>I think the Minister ought to have told us why it is proposed to repeal Section 2 of the National Health Insurance <Col N="373" /> Act of 1944.  Mind you, there are not many provisions of the national health insurance code which the Minister proposes to repeal.  He has selected only a few.  Why does he select this particular one?  There is an obligation on him under that particular section to have an actuarial valuation made, and there is an obligation on him to lay the report of the actuary before the Oireachtas.  Is that why Section 19 is in the Bill&mdash;in order to relieve him of that obligation?</P>
    <P>There are a lot of other things which I could say on this Bill.  There is scarcely a section in it to which objection, and serious objection, could not be taken.  The principal objection that I have is to the fact that, first of all, it proposes to take the property of other people because, remember, these funds do not belong, and have never been held to belong, to the Government. They belong to the insured persons.  They were built up for their use and benefit.  If the Government proposes to appropriate private property, because that is what it is, trustee property, because that is what it is in this case, it will not be long before it turns its attention, as the Minister for Lands has shown, to private property more intimately associated with private individuals in this country.</P>

      <P>It is a great pity that Deputy MacEntee did not warn Deputy Dr. Ryan that he was going to make this speech.  He is placing Deputy Dr. Ryan in a most embarrassing position. Having listened to Deputy MacEntee, I am sure he is going to vote against the Second Reading of this Bill; I do not see any alternative for him.  In his view, the Bill is an outrageous attempt to grab private property, to take the property of insured persons in this society, to put over a very quick deal in regard to the Store Street premises.  He said that the Bill is, from every point of view, badly and hastily drafted, a complete concoction of incompletely thought-out plans, deliberate evasions, and various other objectionable features.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night we heard the main purpose of the Bill commended by Deputy <Col N="374" /> Dr. Ryan.  He agreed in principle. Possibly he may have had criticism in regard to the details of the Bill, the ordinary criticism that many Deputies will direct towards a Bill on the Committee Stage, even though they support the Bill in principle on the Second Reading.  Deputy Lynch and Deputy Davern took the same view.  Repeatedly now we find on important issues coming before the House this diversity of opinion, not between back benchers of Fianna Fáil, but between former members of the Cabinet displaying itself in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The example we have before us now.  One could understand such difficulties as that arising amongst such an ill-assorted group as supports the inter-Party Government, but for a homogeneous Party like Fianna Fáil, with many years' record behind it acting as Government of the country and inspired and imbued by a Leader who has exercised a very considerable sway over the Party, it is a most peculiar manifestation to find, after being only two years out of office, that that diversity and the heterogeneous character of the Party are now its main characteristic. Of course, one could take that view if one were to take Deputy MacEntee seriously.  He has gone to great lengths to give the House a very learned and erudite criticism of the Bill based on one particular assumption&mdash; that the Bill, when it becomes an Act, is going to operate indefinitely; that what we are facing here is the decision of the Minister to amalgamate the functions of the National Health Insurance Society with the Department of Social Welfare and that, henceforth, we shall have the Department of Social Welfare performing and carrying out the functions now carried out by this society.  All Deputy MacEntee's criticisms and bellowings would merit serious attention if that actually were the position.  But we have been already informed that the main purpose of the Bill is to lay the preliminary groundwork on which to base a very comprehensive scheme in relation to social services as a whole and that, as a first step towards such a scheme, it is <Col N="375" /> thought advisable to bring within the scope and under the control of the Department associated with the general social services this society which, up to the present, retained a semi-independent position based on a membership of contributing members and operating, in general, a kind of collective machinery in the name of and on behalf of its members.</P>
      <P>One may object to the purpose of the Bill from that point of view.  One may quite readily say that it is preferable to leave the society as it is, not to merge it completely with a Government Department, and to rely on the contribution basis on which the society has operated for many years.  But, if one accepts the principle and the purpose of the Bill, then it is quite ridiculous to do, as Deputy MacEntee has seemed to do, to regard the Bill as intended for long-term operation, something that will be a permanent feature in the exercise of departmental activities in this country over a very considerable period.</P>
      <P>Many of the peculiarities which the Deputy has discovered in the Bill become somewhat clearer when it is realised that the provisions embodied in the various National Health Insurance Acts no longer require to be preserved if, instead of a society based not merely on the membership of insured persons, but based actuarially on their contributions, we have a system of social service, including sickness benefit, which, instead of being secured by an actuarial fund, is secured on the basis of the credit and the financial substance of the State as a whole, the same as any other form of social service.  From that point of view, many of the criticisms of the Bill by Deputy MacEntee lack any foundation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, Deputy MacEntee would be entitled to make many of his criticisms if he had the courtesy and the good sense to inform the first speaker of his Party in this debate who, presumably, was indicating what was going to be the viewpoint of the Party in regard to the Bill as a whole. From that point of view it is clear that <Col N="376" /> Deputy MacEntee was not concerned with the purposes or with the principle of the Bill.  He was not even concerned with whether the Bill was an effective instrument to give effect to the purpose of it.  But he was concerned, as he has been on many occasions, with giving a display of verbal and mental fireworks which may entertain many people of the same type as himself, but which seem to fall a bit flat of late years both in this House and in the country.  I suggest that the matters which he raised should not be settled as between Deputy MacEntee and the Minister but between Deputy MacEntee and his Party, from whom he seems to be travelling a different road.</P>
    <P>So far as the Bill as a whole is concerned, I think it is to be welcomed. One of the difficulties which has existed in regard to the National Health Insurance Society for a number of years, even though it has had many valuable features, has been that the members of the society came into violent collision, when Deputy MacEntee was the responsible Minister, with the fact that the benefits provided by the society, tied down as they were by this old and outdated actuarial basis, had, for a long number of years, become completely absurd and impotent in regard to the actual needs of sick people.  An overhaul of the whole system of sick benefit in this country is long overdue.  Now that it is to be overhauled as part of a general scheme, it is even more acceptable.  But to suggest that we could introduce in any form a comprehensive social system with various forms of cash payments and leave outside the scope of that system such a very important channel of social assistance as payment and sustenance during periods of sickness, of course would make the whole scheme not only unworkable, but completely ridiculous.  From that point of view, whatever may be our views on the type of social security system we should introduce in this country, anyone who accepts the principle must agree that the first step towards the application of that principle in real life is the bringing together within one Department and under the one machine of all the activities relating to social services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="377" /> I still think that eventually we shall have to go even further than is contemplated at the moment in the White Paper because, outside the activities of the National Health Insurance Society, there are other forms of social services which so far are not in contemplation under the comprehensive scheme.  We are making progress, though it is somewhat slow.  From the assurances of Fianna Fáil in 1947, when they had no pattern, not even in the collection of statistics within the Department, we have now arrived in 1950 to find ourselves dealing with the first piece of legislation in relation to a comprehensive social service scheme.  Many of us wish that progress might be quicker. Progress will certainly not be assisted by the type of contribution we had this afternoon from Deputy MacEntee.</P>
    <P>With regard to the purpose to which the funds taken over from the society by the Minister for Finance will be applied, I am quite sure that the men and women who will have to have recourse to sickness benefit will not be very much concerned about the funds being taken over by the Minister for Finance.  What they will be interested in is the guarantee of the continuity of the benefits to which they are entitled, the amount of those benefits and the regulations governing their payment. It is no particular satisfaction to a sick man or woman to know that £5,000,000, £6,000,000 or £8,000,000 is lying in the National Health Insurance Society when their benefit is limited to 22/6 per week.  I am quite sure they will be more than satisfied to have that sum increased to what might be regarded as a reasonable figure on which a sick man or woman could maintain himself or herself and to have that increased benefit guaranteed by the financial security of the State rather than by some remote sum lying under the control of the National Health Insurance Society and under the even more rigid control of the Minister for Local Government, especially a Minister with the approach that Deputy MacEntee had when he was in office.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch made some references to the staff at present employed by the National Health Insurance Society. He seemed to be nervous as to the manner in which the interests of that <Col N="378" /> staff would be safeguarded under the Bill.  He made the understandable mistake of not realising that the staff is made up of two sections, the permanent clerical staff and the agents throughout the country.  Nobody suggests that there should be any different approach towards the claims of these two sections.  As far as I can understand from the Bill, no distinction is made and I think that is an indication of the approach made by the Government and the Minister towards what might be regarded as the legitimate claims of the staff.  Under a different type of Government and under other circumstances I could visualise that those who are employed as agents by this society might find themselves in a peculiar and awkward situation if a measure like this was introduced and they were dependent on other people for their protection.  They have the good fortune, however, not to see their employment change under the Minister who would have very little sympathy for them.</P>
    <P>There has been a suggestion that the Bill does not provide adequate protection for the staff in regard to certain rights and privileges they enjoy at the moment.  I am speaking now as a member of the House and not as one having any connection with the staff. It seems to me that where we have a clerical staff employed by a society of this type given an assurance by statute that they will be absorbed into the Civil Service, with all the protection that implies with relation to their employment and their future prospects, they are there getting protection of a very high order.  I have no doubt that that particular assurance more than meets the wishes of the overwhelming majority of the staff concerned.</P>
    <P>Reference have been made to certain difficulties that may arise in regard to their expectation of promotion. Nobody would like any member of the staff to suffer in respect of his expectation of promotion.  The matter has been examined very carefully and I am aware of the approach both by the staff and the Minister in the matter; and it does seem to me that any fears that might exist in relation to the question of the expectation of promotion <Col N="379" /> are largely nebulous and are unlikely to give rise to any real difficulty.  There may be individuals or small groups in respect of which there may be minor difficulties in regard to absorption. Under the Bill there is an assurance given in relation to absorption, in relation to pension rights and also in relation to grievances that may arise.  Such assurances as have been given have satisfied the responsible members of the staff and do meet their wishes in general in this matter.</P>
    <P>I think the Bill is to be commended. It is an indication of the first step towards something for which many of us have been looking for a long time. We hope it will have a rapid passage through the House and we hope that, immediately following upon it, we shall deal with that wider system of social security which can be built upon the collective and homogeneous machinery established under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I have not much sympathy with the last speaker in the disappointment he has expressed because members of the Front Bench of Fianna Fáil appear to hold views, which, in his interpretation, show a certain divergence of opinion.  This is a democratic Assembly.  The responsibility for national policy rests upon the Government.  It is for the Opposition to criticise as best they can the proposals that are put before them.  I do not think there is anything unusual in the fact that an ex-Minister for Social Welfare should express a particular interest in a measure of this kind and in the general question of social security, with which it is connected, in the way in which Deputy Dr. Ryan has done.  On the other hand, when a former Minister for Finance, such as Deputy MacEntee, puts questions which are extremely relevant, I think answers ought to be given.  If we were to go into the question of an apparent difference of views or an expression of different viewpoints on this measure, I suggest that it is really on the Government side that one might expect to find the difference of opinion.  Was it not by Ministers of the Government which has now put this Bill before the <Col N="380" /> House that we were told not to-day nor yesterday but years past, before this scheme saw the light&mdash;it has not yet seen the light but we have heard a good deal about it&mdash;that such schemes were reducing the country to the position of being a servile State; that the recipients of social assistance or those who benefit were merely serfs; that the continuation of such policy would bring us back to conditions which existed in the days of the final dissolution of the old Roman Empire?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Were we not told by the present Taoiseach that social services were a symptom of disease in the body politic &mdash;medicine bottles in the chest which ought not to be there if the State were in a proper condition of health?  We were told something very similar by the present Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He practically said, in joining in the objurgations of the present Minister for Finance and others, that social services were a malignant growth; that the very fact of their existence is a proof that there was something sadly wrong with the condition of affairs in this State.  No doubt it was because the Minister for Finance pointed out last year that the proposals at present under consideration, termed social security, and which have been published in the form of a White Paper, should be very carefully scrutinised and examined that Deputy Larkin found it necessary to come forward and say that, so far as he and those for whom he spoke were concerned, they were going to see that they were going to have their social security scheme no matter&mdash;as far as I can remember his words&mdash;what the cost was likely to be.  Surely there was a greater difference of opinion between the Minister for Finance, who had been taking advantage of many opportunities to express to the public his serious doubts about this whole question of social security and whether it was worth the cost to the country, and the view expressed by Deputy Larkin to the effect that very strong pressure might have to be brought by the Deputy to enable this scheme to see the light of day.  If there is any examination of conscience with regard to <Col N="381" /> conflicting statements&mdash;I do not want to weary the House but really there are pages and pages of statements which I could quote from Ministers of the present Government condemning this whole idea of social services.  They condemned the past Administration for extravagance and for appealing to the lowest instincts of the people.  They practically suggested that one of the reasons why the Fianna Fáil Administration was spending more upon the services was in an endeavour to bribe the electorate.</P>
    <P>Whoever said the Minister for Finance controls the old age pensions books and the ration books apparently saw no difference between the régime that might exist east of the Iron Curtain and one where a democratic Government would be responsible for the administration of rationing or of social services.  It simply meant, in his opinion, buying over the entire community which receives services under this heading.  We know that in Russia and in some of these other countries &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy is going very far away.  He has not spoken about the Bill yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am entitled to refer to the philosophy behind this Bill.  Not alone in this country but in many other countries, well-informed thinkers&mdash;and I hope there are some in the Oireachtas&mdash;wonder whether it is a good thing that there should be this concentration of services in the hands of a central administration.  In other countries you have these welfare schemes carried out by the particular industries.  In this country in the past they were carried out by the National Health Insurance Society and, prior to that, by the approved societies.  I have no doubt that it can be argued that it is a good thing and that the State, as expressing its opinion through the Oireachtas, will have more direct control over these services by having all the services concentrated in one particular headquarters.  I have no doubt that it can be argued that it leads to a more direct control, to a more direct review and to more ready access by this House to information <Col N="382" /> through having the Minister in control of all the services.  But others would regret that it has become necessary to do away with all these societies and organisations which carry on voluntary schemes.  I think we have to admit that when you bring schemes which necessitate a good deal of administration and investigation under State control, you will, of course, have to face the costs of the administration on the same level as other administrative costs for which the State bears responsibility.</P>
      <P>According to Sir William Beveridge not alone does the success of these schemes depend upon certain factors such as the amount of regular and full-time employment that is being given, but it depends also on administrative costs.  If these costs are very high and very severe, if there is waste, in his opinion that is very bad for the scheme.  If the costs of administration are to come from the funds to which the contributors and beneficiaries are paying, then it means that the amounts that are going to be available for the extension of benefits must be reduced. It is well known that in the past the benefits under these schemes left much to be desired.  I do not think anybody would claim that as far as institutional treatment in particular is concerned, we could be satisfied that beneficiaries are getting the type of treatment to which, having regard to the advances in other directions and the payments which are being made, they would be entitled.  Therefore, I suggest that the House was entitled &mdash; as Deputy MacEntee and other speakers suggested &mdash;when we got this Bill, to have a White Paper, the usual explanatory memorandum, and, in addition, I think we might have had a statement showing the position of the funds at this particular time&mdash;the funds that are referred to, the reserve fund and the general fund&mdash;so that the House would know what exactly is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told here that certain funds are being handed over to the Minister for Finance.  We may argue about that but what we do not know is the amount of the funds.  No statistical information is given either in the Bill itself or in any document accompanying it as to <Col N="383" /> the nature of these transactions.  The Minister simply comes into the House and says: &ldquo;We are taking over these funds.&rdquo;  Surely we are entitled to know if this is a preliminary step?  Even if we accept it as a necessary foundation of some structure that has to be built on it later on, we are entitled to ask what exactly is the precise meaning of the transaction.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not given us any information, so far as I know, about the cost of administration.  Very little information was given in the White Paper which has been published.  I think it is legitimate and proper to ensure&mdash;in fact I think we would not be doing our duty unless we did everything possible while seeing that fair play and proper wages and conditions are given to the employees&mdash;that there is no waste and that the costs of administration are reduced to the minimum. As I have said if that is not secured, it is not alone the taxpayer who will suffer but probably the contributors themselves.</P>
    <P>We have had no information as to the advantage the Minister expects to achieve.  I can see, as I have said, that there will be certain advantages in bringing the organisation under the more direct control and supervision of this House but, side by side with that, I think it is the duty of the House to ask exactly what are the obligations we are taking on ourselves and what the advantages are going to be.  Can the Minister give us any figures showing the present cost of administration under this scheme?  What is the percentage of cost to income and what does he expect to achieve in the way of reducing that figure under this scheme?  It may be that the answers to these questions would be largely hypothetical but, nevertheless, I think that unless the House has some definite information as to the ratios of which the Department has experience in its working we are taking a leap in the dark.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been asked what is the extent of the pensions fund that is being taken over.  I think he should give the House the benefit of his information as to what the liabilities are. <Col N="384" />&ldquo;Every existing liability and every contingent liability of the pension fund shall become a liability of the Minister for Lands and shall be discharged by him out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  It may be that the Minister may not be able to tell us exactly what these liabilities are.</P>

      <P>I want to know in black and white what are the figures at the present time.  I think if we are to take these measures seriously, do our duty and examine them as we should, the Minister ought to give us that information. It ought not to be necessary for Deputies to have to go to the accounts of the National Health Insurance Committee which, in any case, would not be available for the past year.  May I ask the Minister if the National Health Insurance Committee's accounts for the year 1948-49 have been published?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it reasonable that the only information we can get about the matter is that given in the White Paper, where we have a lot of verbiage and very little solid material to go on.  The only published accounts are those available for 1947-48.  If we are taking over this organisation and taking over certain responsibilities with it, surely we are entitled to get fuller information as to what exactly the liabilities are going to be.  We should be told what is the total wage bill, the number of employees and the present value of the pension liability in so far as that can be ascertained.  After this wonderful discovery of the Minister for Finance that he could transfer some of the responsibilities, which should seem proper to be carried by the taxpayer, to <Col N="385" /> borrowed moneys, at a time when he is boasting of the millions of pounds which he proposes to spend&mdash;a sum of £12,500,000 in the Book of Estimates and another £12,500,000 in capital issues for State or semi-State undertakings&mdash;and when he has, so far as the latest returns show, issued well over £13,000,000 in the financial year concluded for capital issues, I think it rather hard that the provision of proper accommodation for the Ministry of Social Welfare should not be treated as capital expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the provision of schools or the provision of minor relief schemes is to be treated as capital expenditure it seems to me extraordinary that it could be suggested that the provision of buildings for the housing and proper accommodation of important Departments of State should not fall within the realm of capital expenditure. I do not commit myself to the opinion as to whether it does or does not, but I say it is very hard on the Tánaiste when all these millions, some £30,000,000, are floating about&mdash;the only question is that if there is a slight inflationary tendency because of that expenditure during the coming 12 months, the Minister for Finance may have to curtail it and devise a system of priorities&mdash;that buildings for this Department should not be treated as capital expenditure.  Is it possible that the Minister has put the Tánaiste down at the end of the priority list or excluded him completely from consideration? It seems to me that the fund which is here should be retained. Whatever the method of administration may be in the future, this fund has been built up from contributions from different sources to cover the benefits that are to be paid.  It may be regarded as good financing to do away with all these funds and to throw all the liabilities, like the liability for superannuation and various other things, on the annual Estimates, but I doubt if it is a very good policy to wipe out these funds.  I think that in so far as it is possible where they are hypothecated for a particular purpose and where the surplus is a very large one, running into millions of pounds and the assets are very substantial, the <Col N="386" /> House ought to get a very definite assurance that these funds will be preserved.</P>
    <P>It is all very well in a period of inflation, such as we have at present, that everything should be paid for out of this very buoyant revenue that we are enjoying; but we may not always be in that position.  In all these undertakings we are not taking over liabilities or responsibilities merely for next year or the year after; when we take over responsibilities like this particular one, we are taking over a big responsibility&mdash;with a very large number of people, some hundreds of thousands of them&mdash;of a permanent nature.  Therefore, we ought to make quite sure that any assets that are there are preserved, that any funds that are there are not interfered with, that they are safeguarded and, if possible, strengthened.  That would be a much safer and more secure way to face the future than to have the position that you are putting increasing obligations on your annual Estimates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking of bringing back our assets.  We are talking of the paucity of opportunities and avenues for investment at home.  It seems an extraordinary thing, therefore, if we want to build up an investment, if we want to strengthen what is called the rentier class and build up a large volume of investment here, that we should approach that possibly by dissipating funds.  It would seem to be an analogy to the creation of that particular class of people&mdash;building them up in the State&mdash;that you should have funds and resources into which their moneys would be absorbed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the location of the headquarters of the Department of Social Welfare, I agree with Deputy MacEntee that the Department should have up-to-date offices constructed for that particular purpose, but it would be a great mistake that a building which was designed, and which architects and persons in a position to give fairly objective and independent views on the matter regard as a great addition to the city, not alone from a <Col N="387" /> utilitarian point of view, but from the point of view of an addition to our architectural features, should be diverted from its purpose and turned into Government offices.</P>
    <P>My experience is that if you attempt to reconstruct a building which is already substantially built, it will cost a sum out of all proportion to what you would normally require.  I had experience of turning a college which was originally intended for a particular type of student into a college for another type of student.  It still remained a college, but the money necessary for the internal rearrangement, even in pre-war days&mdash;I think it must be nearly 20 years ago&mdash;was out of all proportion.  I think the Minister will agree that it is simply absurd to suggest that huge additional sums taken out of this fund should be spent upon an investment of that kind.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the explanation of the expression &ldquo;investment return&rdquo; may be.  I do not know what &ldquo;investment return&rdquo; may mean, whether it is some new accountancy device or something which has emerged in the process of these researches about capital expenditure which have been going on. It will be very interesting to ascertain the nature of the investment return which the Tánaiste assured us was going to be at a higher yield than investment returns in the past.  An investment return on securities or on a fund of assets which can be realised is at any rate calculable; we know by the state of the market what the investment return is going to be, but apparently some peculiar arbitrary type of investment return has been devised and we are told that this is going to represent the return, presumably in the way of a yield of profit or a return to the State on the moneys which will be put into the Store Street building.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste really ought to be more frank with the House and he should explain what exactly number three and the whole of Section 21 mean.  If large sums are going to be spent upon this building, the work surely ought to be undertaken by the State in the ordinary way in connection with its <Col N="388" /> capital programme.  I disagree, however; I think it is very bad policy and I am sorry the Tánaiste has been coerced&mdash;I presume it has been coercion&mdash;into agreeing that Store Street should be turned into buildings for the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Whether it is popular or unpopular to say it, this is a capital city.  It is the capital of the Irish Republic.  Is there any reason why we should not have proper offices, designed as such, for our Government Departments?  Is it not, as Deputy MacEntee said, a worthwhile idea that we should think of some period in the future when public works may be necessary.  I hope they will be in the position that they will have substantially solved the building problem in the City of Dublin. But, when you have the housing problem out of your way, and all your operatives there and all your forces of unskilled labour, it is not easy to devise public works which will absorb them. Any attention we gave to that matter was for the purpose of providing employment. I see no reason why we should apologise for considering the establishment of a building worthy of this city, and which we were satisfied was necessary, giving the required accommodation.</P>
    <P>When the Custom House was built there were riots in the City of Dublin because the business of the city at that time was congregated around Capel Street.  It was felt that that area, which was Dublin proper at the time, was going to be ruined by the taking away of business to the Custom House, and old John Beresford, who was responsible for it, was very lucky to escape with his life in the riots that took place.</P>
    <P>Only yesterday, in the other House, reference was made to the scandalous condition of some of our public institutions&mdash;of science and art.  Is there any reason why we should run away if somebody says that the expenditure of some millions of pounds is thoughtless, extravagant and unnecessary when we know very well that these are things which will have to be faced in the future?  When the Tánaiste has spent large sums on the reconstruction and readaptation of Store Street for a <Col N="389" /> different purpose altogether from that for which it was originally designed, he may find that the money has been very largely misspent.</P>
    <P>I have given my views on the Bill.  I hope that the Tánaiste will try to give us more information on later stages of the Bill as to what exactly has been done in connection with the funds that I have referred to, and that he will try to give the House particulars in black and white.  If other proposals are to come along later, I think it will be all to the good if we know exactly where we stand at this particular juncture and what the balance sheet in regard to the present proposal is.</P>

      <P>At the risk of being considered dense and obscure, I must confess to a difficulty in understanding the strict relevance of many of the observations to which we have had to listen in this debate.  As I say, I may be dense, but to me this Bill appears to be a piece of legislation which is necessary to cover the transition from the administration of the existing benefits operated by the National Health Insurance Society to the new proposed system which will operate when the new social welfare scheme is introduced.  If I am wrong in that conception of the Bill, I am open to correction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind, that appears to be the purpose of the Bill. I do not think it can be seriously contended, nor was there, as far as I am aware, any attempt to assert, that the existing structure of the National Health Insurance Society could be so expanded as to enable it to administer and operate the broader scheme envisaged in the White Paper published by the Tánaiste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I heard the greater portion of what was advanced by the four or five Deputies who spoke from the opposite benches.  I hope I do not do an injustice to any of them if I say that I did not understand any of them to advance that contention.  That being so, some measure, such as this, is essential, and the House, I think, is coerced, or should be coerced, into the <Col N="390" /> support of the general principle of the Bill.  Naturally enough, Deputies will be entitled, and would be quite logical, in putting down drastic and far-reaching amendments on the Committee Stage, but I fail to discover the logic of the position of Deputies in opposing the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan in his speech yesterday evoked a responsive chord in my breast.  He adverted to what he considered minor flaws in the Bill.  He made a criticism with which I find myself in complete agreement.  He made a criticism of the failure of the Tánaiste to provide, for the assistance of Deputies, some explanatory memorandum. I hope the Tánaiste will not take it amiss if I suggest to him that that was an unfortunate omission.  I think that, perhaps, if there had been some such explanatory memorandum, we might have been saved some of the time that has been wasted on this Bill in the House.</P>
    <P>But Deputy Dr. Ryan's approach did not satisfy his colleague, Deputy MacEntee, who came into the House playing a completely different tune from that of his colleague, Deputy Dr. Ryan. Deputy MacEntee characterised the Bill as a smash and grab raid on the funds of the National Health Insurance Society.  Deputy MacEntee is never noted for the moderation of his language, but relating his language to the measure we are discussing, I think he succeeded in creating a new all time high in hyperbole.  He made reference to the attitude of the Parties on this side of the House who support the Government to this measure and sought to draw from their support of the measure a conclusion of illogicality inasmuch as many Deputies occupying benches on this side of the House had in the past extolled some, or all, of the provisions of Dr. Dignan's plan for social security.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill comes to the Dáil from the Seanad which passed it last week.  It is a Bill to amend the original Acts of 1940 and 1943 and, together with these Acts, it is designed to constitute the efficient framework of our system of mutual insurance amongst cattle and live-stock exporters to indemnify themselves against the ordinary hazards of the export trade, which are those of injury and disease which become manifest subsequent to the slaughter of a beast exported and which were not discernible to the eye of the dealer or exporter when he put it on board.  The Bill is necessary, in part, to cure certain infirmities of the original two Acts and, in part, due to circumstances that arose consequent on the Trading Agreement of 1948.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to 1948, during the war emergency, the rule relating to Irish cattle shipped to Birkenhead for immediate slaughter was that when such cattle came off the boat they passed under the survey of representatives of the British Ministry of Food and, if no defect was then discerned in them, any defects that subsequently became discernible in the carcase when slaughtered was the liability of the Ministry of Food.  Subsequent to 1948, however, it was agreed between us that the final judgment on the quality of a carcase would not be taken until the beast had been slaughtered and the carcase examined by veterinarians attached to the slaughterhouse in Birkenhead.  Against this new liability undertaken by the shipper, however, a concession was secured because, prior to the 1948 agreement, the Ministry of Food treated the kidneys of a beast as offal and no allowance was made for them.  Subsequent to the agreement and at the present time the kidneys and the appurtenant fat are weighed with the carcase and the consignor is paid for them at the value of the meat itself.  This concession is hard to evaluate precisely, but is somewhere between 4/- and 6/- per beast, and I <Col N="392" /> think might safely be regarded as an average of 5/- per beast, although there are those who maintain that it is worth 6/-.  I judge, I think correctly, that this additional benefit fairly countervails any additional liability that has arisen out of that arrangement.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying to know that, under this new arrangement which now operates, our experience has been satisfactory. Prior to the agreement, our cattle were graded A, B and Manufacturing. Subsequent to this agreement, our cattle were graded Special, A, B and Manufacturing.  Bearing this in mind, I think the House will be satisfied that the conditions under which the cattle are handled are reasonably satisfactory when I have to tell them that, out of a total export of fat cattle to the value of £4,513,265 between June and December, 1949, the total liability for all forms of loss through disease, bruising or otherwise amounted to 62 of 1 per cent.  In addition to that, I think the House may be interested to know that, under the new grading arrangements, where we have Special, A, B and Manufacturing, in the same six months to which I have just referred of the steers and heifers (fat) going to Great Britain for immediate slaughter 99.1 were put in the grades Special and A; .8 of 1 per cent. were graded B; and .1 of 1 per cent. were graded Manufacturing.  The price for grade A cattle prior to the agreement was 1/1½, falling to 1/- per lb., according to season.  The price of Special quality to-day is 1/8¾; of A quality, 1/8¼, falling to 1/5¾ or 1/5¼, respectively, according to season.  The number of fat cattle shipped in the calendar year 1947 was 110,000; in 1948, 66,000; in 1949, 134,000.  The rate of levy made under this old code of insurance, beginning with the Act of 1940, was 2 per cent. at the beginning, but this rate was rapidly reduced until it reached one-half of 1 per cent. on 19th October, 1942, and it has remained at that level ever since.</P>
    <P>In addition to the matter I have mentioned, I would direct the attention of the House to Section 6, which enables travelling expenses to be paid to authorised officers of the Insurance Board, where they are directed by the <Col N="393" /> executive to undertake travel in Ireland or Great Britain on the business of the board.  Section 7 confers upon the board the power to prescribe a different rate of levy for different classes of cattle.  We understand from the live-stock exporters representative body that that is a facility the trade desires to have.</P>
    <P>Section 8 is designed to remove an anomaly which had not been foreseen; that is that sometimes in a claim relating to several items the award in respect of nine out of ten items will be mutually agreed but in respect of the tenth item the claimant will ask to have the award reviewed.  Owing to a statutory anomaly it was impossible for the board to review the tenth part of the claim if they did not review the whole claim.  It is proposed under this section to give them power to review any part of the claim in respect of which the claimant asks for a review.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything else of substance which I should mention at this stage.  I am, of course, at the disposal of the House to answer any inquiries any Deputy may care to make.  I mention this matter and, in respect of it, I desire to emphasise that I am entirely in the hands of the House.  This Bill has taken some time to draft in order to meet every situation that might require to be met and, at the same time, not go further in the matter of legislation than it was necessary to go.  As a result thereof a number of cattle-dealers have claims outstanding which cannot be disposed of unless and until this Bill is enacted. So far as the larger men in the trade are concerned that does not cause them any serious inconvenience because their bankers are always ready and willing to accommodate them. But there is a material number of small shippers who depend for their livelihood on being able to go to the fair with ready cash, buy their requirements there, ship them and turn their money over repeatedly throughout the year.</P>
    <P>I do not say that any of them will be unable to transact their business for want of the money due to them under claims, because I do not think that is true.  But I am informed that some of the smaller men are embarrassed for the want of money to which they <Col N="394" /> believe themselves to be entitled under claims they desire to make in the event of the Oireachtas approving of this Bill.  Therefore, if the House thinks well to expedite the passage of this Bill, I have no doubt it would be a kindly thing to do in consideration of the present circumstances of these small men.  On the other hand, if the House is of the opinion that the matter requires further and more careful consideration, or amendment, doubtless they will not suffer any irretrievable loss by having to wait until after Easter.  That is a matter upon which the House is as competent to judge as I am and it is a matter the House will have to determine for itself.</P>

      <P>As I understand the Minister's statement, the need for this amending Bill arises from infirmities in the existing Acts of 1940 and 1943 and as a result of the 1948 agreement. My mind is clear enough as to the need for amending the 1940 and 1943 Acts but it is not so clear as to the reason for the British, during the course of the discussion in 1949, asking for this new method of approach in the examination of live stock exported to that country.  I have read the Minister's speech in the Seanad in which he pointed out that this concession sought by the British and conceded to them was offset by the arrangement under which the kidney of the animal would be included as a counter in the carcase weight.  If the concession afforded by us to the British is countered by a concession which they have given to us, why is there any need at all for this procedure?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to bring the 5/-into the fund.  The 5/- is payable to the exporter and the object now is to enable a levy to be made on the fund and, if necessary, to leave the exporter open to a levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>But any additional cost incurred in the new method of examining animals would also be borne by the exporter.  Would it not, therefore, work out in the same way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt, but I think I can make it clear. At present when the exporter sends a beast over he gets the extra 5/- but <Col N="395" /> we now aim to give him a call on the fund to compensate for any flaw revealed in the carcase in the slaughterhouse. It may transpire on experience that that additional charge on the fund will require an increase in the levy of perhaps ?d. and this Bill is designed to give the fund the right to compensate the man whose beast is reduced in value on the hook, in which event we would levy a fraction on every beast; and it is the 5/- payable on every pair of kidneys that will fix the additional levy should an additional levy be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the intention then, if the fund is found to require assistance, that the 5/- derived from the inclusion of the kidney will be diverted to that fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not require 5/-. The levy would be raised by perhaps one-sixteenth or ?d. on all the beasts.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the feeling that when the British sought this, and I regard it as a concession from their point of view, they must have felt that, as a result of a new method of examination, more of our live stock would go down on the carcase examination than on the hoof.  The Ministry of Food would be saved to that extent.  If that assumption is correct, the calls upon the fund would be greater and therefore the contribution to the fund would require to be larger.  It would be impossible to say to what extent that process of reasoning is correct, but if it is correct&mdash;and I think it is a fair assumption&mdash;I could not see the need for this new method of examination and, when conceding this new method of examination to the British, to say: &ldquo;You must give us something which will balance the concession which we have granted.&rdquo;  I would have thought that in such a case the approach should have been: &ldquo;You are asking us <Col N="396" /> for this concession.  Here is a concession which I think we should have.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As I say, there may be some reason for this approach, but when the Minister assures me in respect of the concession which he has obtained in having the kidneys included, I am suspicious that that concession is, in fact, equal to the one given to the British. As a rule, when the British ask for something like this they know what it represents and they do not go after something that is just a sort of a kite. Anyhow, the agreement is there.  The necessity for amending the existing Acts is there and is admitted.  It arises, as has been explained to us, from two causes.  There is no reason why the request made to us by the Minister should be denied.  As one who has had some little experience, I resent the idea of coming to this House, Minister after Minister, and asking to be facilitated.  I do not suggest that it has been done in this instance to-night but we have at least been invited to facilitate the passage of this measure for the reasons which were given and which, I am sure, are quite valid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not contending that that request has been made to us in an aggressive fashion this evening. However, it has been made here so often and members of the House have been so often told that we are obstructing this and holding up that &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; that I think that sort of approach in having public business done is entirely undesirable. The request has been made that we should facilitate the passing of this measure and, so far as I am concerned &mdash;and I am sure as far as the Party on this side of the House is concerned&mdash; we have no objection to granting any facilities necessary in order to achieve that end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am much obliged to the Deputy for facilitating this matter. I think he will agree with me that <Col N="397" /> when you are making a settlement for the sale of your produce you must be influenced by whether the other party to the bargain is acting reasonably and fairly.  I think the record of the Ministry of Food in the matter of grading suggests, when they are taking over 99 per cent. of our cattle in the top grade without any agreement, that, on the whole, they acted and are acting fairly.  Our total write down for loss under this new system of examination amounts to .6 of 1 per cent.  I think that amounted over the period to about £28,700.  I think, over the period, the Ministry of Food bought about 95,000 head of cattle.  If you divide 5/- a quarter into that 95,000 it emerges, strangely enough, at almost exactly the amount whereby our total of cattle were reduced in price as a result of that injury and disease.  It is for the trade, I think, to make up their minds as to whether they can carry this additional liability of £28,700 on the fund without an additional levy.  If they find they cannot and want to put an eighth of a penny on the levy of all cattle to compensate the minority which are bruised or otherwise injured, we know that on shipments of 95,000 it is possible to levy, without abating the amount which the consignors used to get, to get the necessary £28,000 or £29,000 for the fund.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I think the Deputy may reasonably agree with me that in the course of the negotiations I felt it expedient to take that risk which I had to cast up in my mind as best I could across the table, and that I managed to hit a bull's eye&mdash;conceding what they wanted and exacting from them at the same time a corresponding concession which almost to the £1,000 covers the liability.  It is noteworthy that the £1,000 is on the right side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>But there is no uniformity. The concession you obtain is not likely to vary, while from year to year the percentage of animals that might fall on examination would increase or decrease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is right on that.  If he reflects for a moment he will realise that since this <Col N="398" /> agreement was made the price of fat cattle has gone up.  It might do so again.  On each occasion the price of the kidneys went up&mdash;and went up in respect of every single beast slaughtered in Birkenhead.  But the percentage of damage remains about .6 of 1 per cent.  Therefore, with every alteration in the price so far, the margin of safety for us grows wider. The only reason I am asking this power from the House is to provide against a situation in which, for the solvency of the fund, it might be necessary to gather that advantage that accrues to the consignor to the fund in order to meet compensation from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that how it would be proposed&mdash;to rehabilitate the fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  There is only one way to strengthen the fund should the charge upon it exceed its resources and that is to alter the levy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

The Deputy will have noticed that there is provision for another charge arising out of certain diseased conditions that may have to be provided for&mdash;that if the fund should be stranded by meeting those additional liabilities, then a corresponding levy designed to meet the additional charge would be levied on all cattle.</P>

I want to point out that so far as some of the Deputies on the Opposition side are concerned, they are not too happy about this section and as to how it is going to operate in the provision of lands for migrants.  Deputy Dunne speaking in Meath last week, is reported as having told his audience that in the past the claims of local people had been unreasonably ignored and that in Dáil Éireann he had questioned the Minister for Lands as to his policy. The report goes on to state: &ldquo;It is in the records of Dáil Éireann that the Minister had stated that it was not his policy to bring migrants to Meath.&rdquo;</P>

They should maintain sufficient pressure to convince the Government that any other policy would be unwise and unpopular.&rdquo; That was the statement made by Deputy Dunne.  He also told his audience that his trade union organisation of 3,000 members would be used to see that the policy now advocated by the Minister would not be carried out.  The Minister himself has been in the habit of receiving deputations in this matter over the past two years from organisations in Meath.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to your ruling. I suppose the Chair is always right. When the Land Commission proceeds to purchase land under this section it lays down three principles under which the land can be purchased&mdash;where (a) any interest in land is offered for sale and (b) the interest carries the right to vacant possession of the land and (c) the Land Commission require the land for granting new holdings to migrants. I want to make the third condition perfectly clear to the people I represent in Meath.  I should also like to have an interpretation of the &ldquo;the interest carries the right to vacant possession of the land&rdquo;.  I am not a lawyer and I want to know what is meant by this term &ldquo;vacant possession&rdquo;.  Say that an owner of a farm writes to the Land Commission or communicates to them in some other way, that he wishes to sell his land under Section 23, that he has a house on the land and that the farm contains a certain number of acres.  It is immaterial what the acreage is but if he has on the land, say, a house, a gate house, and another house in which workmen live, and he says that he is prepared to give the Land Commission vacant possession of the land and the house he lives in himself, does it follow that he must, if he <Col N="401" /> wishes to proceed with the sale, evict the other families who live in the other houses on the land or will the Land Commission purchase a farm offered for sale in such circumstances?  I am only asking for information.  I am not suggesting for one moment that that is intended.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of this section which agitates my mind is that when a farm such as in County Meath or the Midlands generally is put up for sale and some other farmer purchases that farm, he usually re-employs the men, if any, who were working on that farm previously.  Under this section if the Land Commission purchases the farm to secure the holding for migrants the people formerly employed there will naturally lose their employment.  In an area which is so denuded of its population as some of the rural portions of County Meath have been, it is almost an impossibility for those who lose their employment in such circumstances to obtain other employment.  I wonder will the Land Commission take such questions into consideration before deciding to purchase land offered for sale in these circumstances. On the Second Reading of the Bill, I raised the question generally as to the compensation people would get under this and other sections.  The Minister seemed to think that that question did not count for so much but the fact is that it counts a good deal.  We are now faced with the position that in counties such as Meath, if local people wish to purchase a holding, they have the Land Commission as a competitor.  I do not think it fair to people in the Midlands generally if this section will deprive them of their right to secure portion of the land offered for sale in these counties.  It is all very well for Deputies who live in areas in which congestion exists to press for a solution of that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told us in 1948 that the Land Commission was forging ahead. It has been two years forging ahead and now he is asking for additional power here to take the strings off the athletes' legs, as he said himself, so as to speed up land acquisition and division.  This is the section under which he hopes to get an extra amount of land that <Col N="402" /> would not otherwise come into the possession of the Land Commission for the purpose of giving it to migrants so that their holdings can be used in the areas from which they come to relieve congestion there.  The Minister said he hoped to secure by this method at least 50 farms a year of a certain size.  He has not told us what size of holding he intends to buy, but if we assume that the 50 farms will be occupied after they are purchased, in whatever manner they will be purchased, by 50 families, and if we assume that each family had before they came to the new holding about 20 acres each, then this section will place in the hands of the Land Commission about 1,200 acres a year and in 12 years it will give them 12 times that amount of land for this purpose. The Minister, Deputy Commons and other Deputies seem to think that this section will work wonders&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know by what method the Land Commission propose to purchase holdings.  The Land Commission have a reserved function to decide what price they will pay for each holding.  Will they send an inspector down to a public auction, or do they intend to notify the auctioneer who has charge of the sale what amount they are prepared to pay for the land, or will some particular auctioneer be told off to purchase the land, such as happened when the Minister for Agriculture purchased a farm in County Meath?  Will the same firm of auctioneers be sent on this job of <Col N="403" /> purchasing farms up and down the country?</P>
      <P>The Minister seems to think that because of the fact that we have no knowledge of rearrangement schemes, people like myself, who come from an area like County Meath, should not speak on this Bill.  The problem was solved for the people in Meath between 1841 and 1891 when the population of the county fell from 183,828 persons to 76,987 persons and it continued to fall until 1926, when it stood at 62,969. There is no necessity to point out why the population fell during those years. The repeal of the Corn Laws and that type of business&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It left the people of County Meath without their land, and that land is available now for the relief of congestion, where it can be purchased in the open market for migrants.  I want it to be made perfectly clear that, if the Minister proposes to purchase 50 farms a year, he will be a long time solving the question which is uppermost in the minds of most Deputies&mdash;that is, the relief of congestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather difficult for one to make up one's mind as to what the Fianna Fáil Party really want.  I think most Deputies will agree that it is desirable to secure land to relieve congestion&mdash;that is, to provide an additional parcel for uneconomic holders, or alternatively, a transfer of an uneconomic holding from one person to another, and provide a new holding for the person so deprived.  That is the main object of the Land Commission, and the question arises as to what way they should acquire the land for this purpose.  There are two ways open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="404" />
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The one in question here is land offered for sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am coming to.  We have two alternatives, to acquire land compulsorily or to acquire it by agreement in the open market from people anxious to sell.  It seems to me that of the two alternatives, the one provided in the section is the more desirable.  It is not any pleasure to the Land Commission or anybody else to go down the country, take people by the back of the neck, throw them out of their holdings and acquire their land compulsorily.  It is much better to meet people, who offer their land for sale, in a fair and open way and purchase that land from them by agreement.</P>
      <P>I would be absolutely false to everything I have advocated in this House if I were to oppose the principle of this section because on every occasion when the Estimate for the Department came before the House I have advocated that the Land Commission should purchase land in the same way that any purchaser does, that is by agreement, or in the open market for cash and so eliminate as far as possible all unnecessary delays.  I think everyone will agree that anyone who offers land for sale wants to realise his property as quickly as possible, and to get his money.  As far as this section meets that necessary requirement I think it is serving a very useful purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not disguise the fact that this laudable purpose provided for in this section may carry with it certain dangers, but it is absolutely impossible to carry into effect any legislative reform without running some risks. The risks involved in this section are that the Land Commission, if uncontrolled in their operations in regard to the price which they pay, may unduly inflate the price of land in a particular area.  That is a danger to be guarded against.  The main safeguard in that connection lies in the definite statement of the Minister that the land will be valued in advance, and that the price will be determined before the actual purchase is carried into effect.  I think it is important that some experienced valuer should estimate the value of the land to be <Col N="405" /> acquired.  His estimate should be a written one, and should be recorded for scrutiny by the Department of Finance or by whoever may find it necessary to investigate the matter afterwards.  I think that such a provision would guard against any unnecessary inflation in the price of land through the activities of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I mention this because I think some Deputies in their zeal for the acquisition of land, and for the prevention of its acquisition by aliens, have stressed the fact that this section might tend to keep out aliens.  I do not think the Land Commission should enter into competition with people who, perhaps, have unlimited money and do not know the value of land.  If the Land Commission were to act on the principle of out-bidding any particular type of bidder, they would certainly run up the price of land and incur unnecessary expense, and would perhaps be doing a very grave injustice to ordinary people in the district who might require land at a reasonable price.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, that if the Minister, in considering this section at a later stage, would ensure that the price would be determined before the purchase is made, there would be no reason to fear the evils which the Opposition Party seem to anticipate. What I expect will happen is that the Land Commission will send a purchaser to many sales and will enter into negotiations for the purchase of many farms which ultimately they may find themselves unable to purchase because somebody else has outbid them.  I think there is no harm in that.  They will, on the other hand, acquire quite a number of farms which will be very useful to them in carrying out their lawful purpose of relieving congestion and in providing additional parcels of land for uneconomic holders.</P>
    <P>I think it would be desirable that the fact that the Land Commission were interested in a particular holding was not generally known because there might be the danger that their intervention might frighten off other would-be purchasers in the district.  I think that danger, if it existed could be avoided if it was made perfectly clear that the Land Commission, when they <Col N="406" /> failed to purchase a farm because they had been outbid by somebody who placed a higher value on it, would not resort to their compulsory powers later to acquire that same farm.  There is that danger in regard to the Land Commission that they have a double-edged weapon: that is to say, that if they fail in their attempt to purchase a farm by agreement they could acquire it afterwards under their compulsory powers.</P>

      <P>There is one point in the section which I think requires explanation and perhaps some amendment&mdash; that is, the provision of new holdings for migrants or to facilitate the rearrangement of land held under rundale or intermixed plots.  Now I do not think that should be the only purpose for which land acquired under this section should be used.  I think the Land Commission should be free to use land acquired under this section for the relief of congestion in the district where the land has been acquired.  The Land Commission may acquire a holding on which there is no residence. There are many such through our country.  If the Land Commission acquire such a holding, I do not see why they should not have power to sub-divide it amongst uneconomic holders in the vicinity of that holding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The inclusion of this section appears very desirable as far as the congested areas are concerned, but everything that is desirable is not sound or good.  This section represents a very big departure from custom.  Deputy Cogan said that he does not know what the Opposition wants.  I think that we understand what we want as well as he, seemingly, does himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="407" /> He was always a great advocate of free sale.  I hold that this section is a departure from free sale no matter what the Minister may say about giving market value, when he qualifies that by stating that when he says &ldquo;market value&rdquo; he does not mean market price.</P>
    <P>As was pointed out, land resettlement is one of the many problems left to us as a legacy.  I do not think that even the most advanced advocates of land resettlement, even Fianna Fáil, ever envisaged that it should go on indefinitely; that State intervention for the transfer of land from one individual to another should go on indefinitely, and that is what this section means.  Under this section, the acquisition and resales branch of the Land Commission will never end.  That is one very big objection, as well as the fact that this is interfering with free sale.  I think the intention of all previous Land Acts and those who sponsored them was to take over the estates of this country; in other words, the land which was confiscated from the forebears of the people whom it was proposed to resettle on them.  But I think they certainly envisaged that when a certain stage was reached, State intervention should no longer obtain.  Of course, we have not reached that stage yet.  So far as completely relieving congestion by land division is concerned, I think it is not ever likely to be completed.</P>
    <P>Under this section, a holding of land, either medium-sized or large, can be purchased in the open market for a migrant or for the purpose of rearrangement. In the congested areas, it might be a laudable thing to purchase it for rearrangement; but, when that applies to the whole country, I do not think that it is a proper method. The Minister has not explained that when a vested holding is purchased there is not going to be any reduction in respect of the unrepaid portion of the purchase money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I was making is that, when the Land Commission <Col N="408" /> purchase a holding in the open market for a migrant and it is made over to him, that migrant has a right to get priority in becoming a vested tenant of the Land Commission at a very early stage.  In that event, in three, four or five years after he has been allotted the holding, is it not possible for him to offer that holding for sale and, under this section, is it not also possible for the Land Commission again to step in and acquire it for another migrant and pay the tenant the full value without any deduction, using State funds to finance the transaction? Cannot that be carried on indefinitely?</P>
      <P>Deputy Commons said on more than one occasion in this House that if the Land Commission did their work as he expected them to do it there would be no need for a section of this kind.  I agree with that up to the point that it is conditional on their confining their activities to holdings of a certain size.</P>
      <P>The Minister in this Bill has not been very helpful to the Land Commission in carrying out that work in the ordinary way when he has inserted a section reducing the number of commissioners. I just compare the practice that, in my opinion, should be followed with this new departure.  I think the Minister should have made it nine and let them work as three elements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It may not be on the section, but it was mentioned by other speakers and I am merely expressing my concern.  The Minister said that if Fianna Fáil had used all the land they acquired for the sole purpose of relieving congestion the problem would now be a very small one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with that at all.  Of the 647,000 acres acquired during their period in office a very small proportion of it was given to people other than uneconomic holders and Fianna Fáil should not be blamed for that.  That has gone on from the very first occasion on which a Land Act was introduced for the <Col N="410" /> relief of congestion.  If the British Government was sincere in relieving congestion they would never have set up a double institution, the Congested Districts Board and the Estates Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Congested Districts Board dealt with the problem of congestion and the Estates Commission dealt with the problem of local congestion adjoining estates.  We know that in nearly every instance the major portion of the estate was given to landless men both in Mayo and Galway by the Estates Commission.  That continued under the Cumann na nGaedheal Government and, if Fianna Fáil digressed, they are not to blame for that condition of affairs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has never been made clear yet whether land purchase by the Land Commission and land division are to be confined solely to the relief of congestion, either by migration or by relief in the immediate neighbourhood. The carrot is still being dangled before the eyes of the landless men.  I am very interested in the relief of congestion, and I honestly believe that that could be achieved without the introduction of this particular section in this particular Bill.  I hold that, if the Land Commission acted as we would expect them to act, with the ordinary powers they now have, they would be quite capable of achieving the objective it is claimed this section will achieve.  I think this departure constitutes a very bad principle since it is a departure from the fundamentals of land tenure and economics as we know them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section takes away the right of free sale from the small farmer and proposes to carry on indefinitely State intervention in the transfer of parcels of land from one individual to another.  I think that is a wrong principle. I think it is a bad principle.  I think it is a most undesirable principle. While I believe that we should aim at taking over, either compulsorily <Col N="411" /> or by agreement, large tracts of land, at the same time we should preserve the element of free sale or the transfer of holdings through the ordinary channels.</P>

I rise now to express the hope that Deputy Moran, Deputy Aiken, or some front-bench member of the Opposition will utterly repudiate the nonsense to which we have just listened from Deputy Beegan.  I do not represent a rural constituency and I have not the same direct personal interest in this problem as other Deputies have. Deputy Beegan spent a considerable length of time in apportioning blame for the delays of the Land Commission, in suggesting that Fianna Fáil, perhaps, had not gone far enough to eliminate that delay but that, at any rate, they may have done something and we should not blame them.  Someone else was to blame.

      <P>What he said in the first breath, in the second breath and in the third breath were all equally nonsensical.  If there was delay, surely this is one method of getting rid of or round some of the delay.  How is their right of free sale interfered with?  Was is not the position up to this that if the Land Commission wanted land, there was nothing to prevent them from acquiring it and acquiring it at what were described here last night as confiscation prices.  This puts them into the position of being able to go into the open market and to make their bid there and to pay their price just as anyone else can do so.  Surely this is giving <Col N="412" /> some protection to the owners of land, to which Deputy Cogan referred a few minutes ago.  I hope that Deputy Moran, when he speaks again, will repudiate utterly the sentiments expressed by Deputy Beegan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister describes this particular section as an experiment. I think it is a very dangerous experiment.  If the Government insist on going ahead with it, I should certainly like to see it limited in legislation to operation for as short a time as possible.  A number of Acts of Parliament have been passed here since 1923 and previous to that in the British Parliament, all designed for the purpose of making farmers secure in the land which they work and all endeavouring to relieve, as far as the pool of land would go, congestion and to bring uneconomic farms as far as possible to an economic standard.  Up to 1923 there was no safeguard for certain sections of farmers.  There was no protection against the operations of the Land Commission if they wanted to take the land compulsorily for the relief of congestion. After a long debate in this House, the 1933 Act gave all farmers who work their land the right to hold on to it, with certain limitations, if they were working it properly and producing a sufficient amount of food and giving a certain amount of employment, having regard to the necessities of the situation.  While giving protection to farmers who work their land properly in their own and in the national interest, it took from farmers, whatever their tenure, an unwarranted protection to do what they liked with their own, as it was called.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are setting out in this particular Bill on a new experiment.  We know, from a social point of view, how the operations of the Land Acts since 1923 and 1933 worked.  The Land Commission was able to get out after the person who did not work his land and give it to those whom the Land Commission thought were in a position to work it and who were willing to work it.  We start off on this new experiment and we do not know what its results will be.  The Minister gave no indication to the Dáil as to how he thought it would work out.  He indicated <Col N="413" /> that there are about 250,000 acres of land changing hands every year. That land, heretofore, has been bought as small farms by other farmers in the locality to relieve what Deputy Allen called their own congestion on the farm.  It was the most desirable type of farmer who was able to purchase another small farm for some of the sons he reared who were prepared to stay on the land and work the land. We know from statistics that the vast majority, nearly all, of the land of this country is divided into 30- to 40-acre farms or under.  The small 30-acre farmer who had worked hard and saved was able to purchase another farm for one of his sons when it was offered in the locality.  The competition he had to meet was the competition of a similar type of farmer.  From a social point of view, it did not matter whether one hard-working farmer or his neighbour got the land.  They were both prepared to work it equally well for themselves and their family and the natural consequence was that national production on the land could be kept up.  Here we have the Minister going to put an end to all that. He says he is not doing so.  However, we know perfectly well that up to the present time, whenever a large farm was advertised for sale in the papers, the local congests got in touch with the local Deputy and asked him to approach the Land Commission to take over that land.  That was natural.  The Land Commission sometimes went in and said that even though this large tract of land changed hands it was not going in any way to derogate from their right to take it over and to use it for the relief of congestion.  But the situation we are going to have after this is that, through time, a small farm of ten or 20 acres in any part of the country will no sooner be offered for sale than, on the appearance of notice to that effect in the papers, it will be followed by questions in this House to the Minister as to whether he is going to make a bid.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin can make his own speech and say whether it is imagination or not.  As the Minister says, we are starting off on an experiment. I think it is a very dangerous social experiment.  I would be prepared to support the Minister if he found that there were any flaws in the compulsory acquisition of lands which are badly worked and which should be transferred for the relief of congestion. I am certainly not going to support or to acquiesce blindly in this particular social experiment.  If Deputy Davin wants to do it, he can. We know that one result after the Bill has been in operation for some time will be that Deputy Commons will be asking his 39 or 40 questions a day.</P>

      <P>Deputy Commons does a little better than that.  We have often heard the Minister tell him that he has nothing to add to what he said last month about a particular farm.  Deputy Commons' questions hereafter will take the form of embarrassing the Minister as much as he can.  Between the Minister and himself they did for poor ex-Deputy Cafferky and Deputy Commons is quite determined that he is going to be the surviving member, if there is a survivor of any kind in Clann na Talmhan after the election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Commons' question is going to take this form: To ask the Minister whether he is aware that there is a certain farm for sale and whether he is going to make an offer. The Minister may answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  Next week the Deputy's question will be to the effect that the farm has been sold to some private individual and he will ask what did the Minister offer.  The Minister will name a figure and Deputy Commons will then come back and ask: &ldquo;Why did the Minister not offer a bit more and get the land for the relief of congestion?&rdquo; The result will be that the Minister will be urged to bid higher and higher for these farms that are for sale, and the tendency will be to crowd out the private person, the farmer who is offering to pay his own money for the farm on offer.  If a small farmer buys a farm at present he pays for it with his own money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="416" /> In future if this section goes through and the farmers follow the advice given them by Deputy Corish, the Parliamentary Secretary, they will wait for the Land Commission.  The Parliamentary Secretary said it would be a good thing if private individuals did not buy land but waited for the Land Commission to do it for them. He also said that the Land Commission should have an advantage over the private individual.  What is the result of that?  The private individual, the Minister having an advantage of 50 per cent. on him, will fail to get the land in many cases.  Instead of congestion being relieved by the operation of the private individual and his own money, the land will be purchased by the Land Commission at the public expense.  That is at the expense of the general taxpayer.  Then the Minister will cut the land annuity in half after having declared a loss on the resale. We may have a situation arising where there will be very little difference between individuals who would normally buy land under the present conditions and those who would get it through the operations of the Land Commission under this section.  The result will be that the State will have to bear this burden.</P>
    <P>I know that Government Deputies in recent times have become great spenders.  They have all since they topped the £100,000,000 mark and cheered the Minister for Finance on having reached the £100,000,000 mark, got the 100 millionaire mentality.  However as the Minister for Agriculture warned us to-day agricultural prices may not always be so high and it might be slightly more difficult for the ordinary farmer and taxpayer to pay this £100,000,000.  So that if the Minister declared a loss of a million or two on resale the halving of the land annuities to the new allottees might mean a considerable burden on the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We could, but it is no harm for a moment to advert to the fact that it is not only for the purposes set out in this particular section, as amended by the Minister's amendment, that land is being purchased, but also for the purposes set out in Section 24, sub-section (11), which says: &ldquo;Where any land becomes not required by the Land Commission for granting new holdings to migrants, such land may be disposed of by the Land Commission to any of the persons or bodies mentioned in sub-section (1) of Section 31 of the Land Act, 1923, as extended by this Act.&rdquo;  That is, where land becomes not required by the Land Commission under Section 23 for the granting of new holdings to migrants, so that we have the situation that the Minister, having sold this particular section to the country, for the purpose of providing land for migrants, can, if he wishes, use it for the purpose of acquiring land for all other types of persons to whom <Col N="418" /> land may be given under the Land Acts. I take it Deputy Cogan has thought a little bit about this particular section; I can take it from his speech also that he wants to do a little bit more thinking about it, if he wants to get some idea of its full consequences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We would like to see the Minister, if he proposes to continue with this&mdash;and I certainly would like to see him&mdash;limiting this legislation to one year because, if this system gets going, it will be very hard to stop it. If the powers fell automatically at the end of a year the Dáil would have a new look-out; it could look at this matter again and see if it was in the interests of our people that it should be renewed for a longer period.  It is a very dangerous social experiment, in my opinion.</P>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan said it was going to provide a pool of land.  I remarked on that that it was going to create a whirlpool of land.  There is nothing in the section which would limit the operations of the Land Commission. They can go into the open market, outbid local people and give land to migrants from Mayo or some other place or, under Section 24, give it to somebody for the relief of local congestion. If the land comes into the market again in a short time they can rebuy and resell it.  If Deputies are pressed by their constituents and, in turn, bring pressure to bear on the Minister and the Land Commission, they can go along gaily spending public money purchasing the 250,000 acres that normally are for sale within the year.  At that rate it will not be many years before we have bought and resold a quantity of land equal to the total amount of land in the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said last night that it was intended under this section to tap an untapped stream of land for the purpose of relieving congestion. I certainly would not quarrel with that, but if we are going to tap some untapped stream, let us tap it in the right way.  The provisions in this section are unworkable.  The section pretends to set out to do something that cannot possibly be done for the purpose of relieving congestion.  The powers conferred under it will be useless from the point of view of making headway with the problem of relieving congestion.</P>
      <P>I was interested to hear Deputy Cogan to-night advocating that the House should accept this section.  The mere fact of Deputy Cogan asking that should be sufficient warning to everybody interested in the relief of congestion to vote against it, because Deputy Cogan regards himself here, and has always done so, as the ranchers' advocate.  If Deputy Cogan thought for a moment that under this section there was a possibility of acquiring land in Wicklow or Limerick or where large tracts are, he would be up in arms against it.  He is supporting the section because he knows it is a fraud from the point of view of acquiring land to relieve congestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that we on this side of the House have different views on the section.  It was amusing to hear the Minister asking Deputy Moylan last night if he was reflecting <Col N="420" /> the opinions of the Fianna Fáil Party. Of course the acquisition of land differs in every county, as the Minister is well aware, and the problem of congestion differs in every county where it exists. It differs just as much as the price of land differs from county to county. The Minister was very careful to avoid giving a definition on that aspect.  The Minister and, I think, Deputy Cogan, suggested that on this side of the House we have different views on this matter.  That type of suggestion comes very well from a member of a Government no two members of which express the same view whenever they open their mouths, and they are contradicting each other from week to week&mdash;every single member of the Cabinet.</P>

A holding that would be suitable for the Minister's purpose is advertised, let it be in Limerick or Clare or Mayo.  It is land suitable for the purpose of this section.  The advertisement usually appears two weeks before the sale. Does the Minister suggest that a Land Commission inspector must go down to that area, make a report on the holding, send that report to the Department in Dublin, let the matter come before the commission and then let them decide?  If that has to be done, does the Minister really think that the holding will still be on the market after all that time has elapsed?</P>

      <P>The harm that is being done is that it is being pretended that a big attack is to be made on the problem of congestion, and that a big pool of land is going to be acquired under this section.  I am pointing out that that cannot be so.  In spite of all the powers vested in the Land Commission for the compulsory acquisition of any type of land, and with their full staff back in the offices, the total amount of land that the Land Commission succeeded in acquiring in the year ended 31st March, 1949, was 8,196 acres. That is the information that is given in the Report of the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have a word to say on that when the Estimate for the Department comes before the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position, that the Land Commission with their full powers and with their full staff operating under normal conditions only succeeded in acquiring 8,196 acres in the last year for which figures are available.  I suppose it would be correct to say that, when allowance is made for water, scrub, bog and so <Col N="422" /> forth, not more than 5,000 acres of that total of 8,000 acres odd would be available for the relief of congestion. If that is all the Land Commission was able to do in one year, I wonder what can they do under this section in the way of creating a pool of land for the relief of congestion?</P>
      <P>The Minister refused to accept an amendment which was moved from this side with regard to sales of land by private treaty.  Evidently he takes the line that under this section he is going to send a representative to sales for the purpose of acquiring land.  So far, the Minister has not informed the House as to what type of land he intends to get.  He did not say whether he was going to get after the large ranches or after small farms or what particular type of land he has in mind.</P>

In connection with the migrants, it was pointed out by some Deputies that, in some cases, they evidently are not very welcome in some areas to which they have been sent.  I thought it was a fundamental practice with the Land Commission, when carrying out a migration scheme, to send five, six, eight or ten migrants to the same area because it was found in practice that where they acquired land in an outside county for their accommodation, a local agitation was carried on principally by landless men. Speaking of landless men, I would like if the Minister or somebody would at some time tell those people who have been looking forward for years to getting land what their position is going to be.  They have been expecting for years to get land.</P>

I have been pointing out that very often local agitations are carried on by landless men in the areas to which migrants are taken.  Can we take it from the Minister that there is no intention of ever providing land for landless men in the future, and that the intention of this Bill is to concentrate on the relief of congestion&mdash;to get migrants out of congested areas and so get those areas resettled?</P>

Evidently, the Minister wants to ride both horses crossing the stream.</P>
      <P>There is another matter that the Minister has not adverted to under this section.  There are a number of cases pending before the Land Commission courts in regard to acquisition. There is a suggestion that the Land Commission can purchase these lands for cash.  I should like to know what will be the position of these people now.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the assurance of the Minister.  In this section the Land Commission take power to pay cash for land and I am wondering what is the position of these cases.  The question of the acquisition of land varies from county to county.  Deputies from different parts of the country have pointed out that under this section large farms might be acquired or bought.  In the West of Ireland I think that the contrary will be the case. Instead of enhancing the prices paid for the land, the mere fact of a Land Commission official appearing at the sale will finish the sale so far as the vendor is concerned.  In connection with every farm purchased in the West of Ireland one of the first requisitions of title is, &ldquo;have the lands been inspected by the Land Commission?&rdquo; and where a Land Commission inspector has appeared on the holding no purchaser will touch that land.  Under this section, if the Minister's representative goes to a public auction and makes a bid that will finish the sale and will finish the vendor so far as the sale of the land is concerned, because the Minister, under sub-section (5) of this section, preserves the power that, if he does not get the land one way, he will get it the other way.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;The powers conferred by this section are in addition to, and not in derogation of, any other powers <Col N="425" /> which the Land Commission may have by law for the acquisition or purchase of land or resumption of holdings.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>This sub-section preserves all the compulsory acquisition powers of the Land Commission in any case covered by the section.  Therefore the Minister or his officials cannot deny that, if the Land Commission bid for any holding and they do not get it, there is nothing to stop them from putting a notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> the following week and acquiring the holding compulsorily.  Is that the law or is it not?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would have no business opening his mouth in the House the following week, because we are putting in a section giving the Land Commission this power.  In the West of Ireland at present, if there is a rumour that the Land Commission are going to touch a holding, you cannot sell it in the open market.  It has been decided by the Judicial Commissioner that anybody purchasing land in Mayo should be aware that congestion exists and therefore should know that he is running the risk of the land being taken from him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>It happens to be the law of the land.  The matter has not been appealed to the Supreme Court, <Col N="426" /> so far as I know.  This may not apply in other areas, but the fact of a Minister's representative going to a sale in the West of Ireland will prevent the vendor from getting the market value of his land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister that I have about 40 &ldquo;white elephants&rdquo; which I can offer to him.  The Minister will get any amount of &ldquo;snipe&rdquo; land and places that nobody will buy.  I am sure he has been offered those already.  That is the danger of the powers conferred on the Minister by this section.  Political pressure can be brought to bear on anyone holding the Minister's office or even the Minister for the purpose of getting some farm acquired by the State that could not be sold on the open market.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing the different dangers arising from this section and that the section will be unworkable from a practical point of view.  If there was any hope offered in this section of relieving congestion, certainly all the western Deputies would be more than interested in accepting it.  There was a suggestion made that the Minister should concentrate one section of the Department, if he is getting land under this Bill, on acquiring lands in the Midlands, in County Limerick and other such counties, and another section of the Land Commission on the congested areas, getting suitable migrants and creating a pool of land and having it ready instead of trying to do it in bits and pieces.  I think the Minister would be well advised to listen to that suggestion. From the point of view of relieving congestion and from the point of view of this section stopping people like the Aga Khan or the Aly Khan acquiring land here, this section is so much eyewash.  The Minister knows that quite well.  If the Minister wants to take land off any Aga Khan or Aly <Col N="427" /> Khan or any other Khan in order to relieve congestion he can do that under the compulsory powers vested in him at the moment.  But he will not do it under this particular section.  There is a law operating against these people to the extent of a 25 per cent. stamp duty.  If the Minister is anxious to get shut of the Aly Khans and the Aga Khans and all the other Khans coming into the country he has power to do that and to take their lands from them in order to relieve congestion.  It is no answer to the Opposition to say that this section will stop the Agas or the Alys or the Begums coming into this country and buying land.</P>
      <P>I have tried to show that this section will not relieve congestion.  It is open to every type of abuse.  From the taxpayer's point of view it will create the extraordinary situation where the Land Commission will buy a holding for Pat Murphy; Pat Murphy wants to better himself so he buys a better holding and he sells his old holding back to the Land Commission and they give it to another Pat Murphy at State expense. In addition to that, it will interfere with the most sacred right of the Irish tenant farmer, the right of free sale.  I see no good reason why this section should be passed in its present form and I ask the House to reject it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a new departure. I take it the Minister thinks that this will be a short cut in the acquisition of land.  If the Minister improved the present machinery for acquiring land by appointing more commissioners he would get all the land he wants much quicker and more easily.  Short cuts are very often the longest roads in the end.  I can see this system laid open to the gravest abuses. I can see people organising to ensure that they will get enough money or enough land.  The Land Commission never had the name of paying too much for land.  I do not believe that the price will be forced down under this. I think it will have the opposite effect. I think every effort will be made to see that the Minister's representatives or the Land Commission pay enough for <Col N="428" /> land.  Land will continue at its present high rate for some time to come because there are many competitors.  We have complaints here of people coming in with money and buying land without let or hindrance.  It is said that there is a handicap, but the handicap does not stop them from purchasing land.  I think any sensible person whose lands comply with the regulations will do his utmost to get all the money he can for it.  I think the Minister would have been wiser if he had left the situation as it was and increased the staff, particularly that section of the staff that deals with legal points which arise.  As soon as the Minister decides to purchase there will be a shoal of letters and applications forcing his hand.</P>

      <P>I do not mind interruptions at all.  In my opinion neither this section nor this Bill will solve congestion.  At the present time the Land Commission and other people are tinkering with small places in the West of Ireland.  We have the position there that people on small farms of eight and ten acres had to go to America or to England in order to earn a living and hoping, at the same time, that they would be able to return and settle down on these farms.  Their neighbours are now writing to the Land Commission asking it to acquire these farms and the ranchers are laughing at the whole thing.  That is what this Bill will do.  The only way to get land is to acquire it compulsorily.  I heard it shouted by Deputies on the Government Benches that that was confiscation. Even if it should be confiscation, <Col N="431" /> I ask you how was it got in the first place.  It was got through confiscation. I do not stand for confiscation. I stand for fair play.  I am very much afraid that this Bill will do great harm and that it will give the ranchers a new lease of life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of a holding offered for sale, seeing that the market value is now guaranteed under Section 5, would the Minister say what the seller of the land gains by going to the trouble of having an auction?  On the other hand, if the Land Commission takes the land compulsorily and gives the owner the market value, what does the owner lose in the transaction? Would it not be as well to go to the logical limit in this matter and, where land is offered for sale, the Land Commission take that land when it is obviously needed for the relief of congestion? Under Section 5, no loss will accrue to the owner of the land.</P>
      <P>There is a type of problem with which the Minister must be well acquainted and I am doubtful as to whether it can be solved under this section or not.  If I thought that it could, it would make me look a little more kindly on it.  I have in mind an exchange that is desired between two neighbours.  A neighbour would sell the land if he were guaranteed two conditions&mdash;(1) market value, which he is now guaranteed and (2) that a particular neighbour living on land adjoining the farm to be sold would get it. The Land Commission will not give any such promise to any man who sells such land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister utilise this section to cover a type of case which is common, namely, a farm which was originally part of other lands&mdash;where it is, say, just a half of what was originally one holding with adjoining land&mdash;and where the owner now wishes to sell it and to have it incorporated in what was the original holding so that his neighbour can get it?  The Land Commission in such a case will not give the seller a guarantee that they will resell the land to the <Col N="432" /> neighbour who wants to reincorporate it in the original holding.  It seems to me that the Land Commission could go a bit further, seeing that they are taking certain new powers under this section, to sanction a private arrangement between two neighbours in a situation of that kind&mdash;in other words, to guarantee the loan of the money to the buyer for the purchase of the land from the neighbour.  That would bring about work which the Land Commission wishes to do and it would be done in a great many cases far more quickly and effectively than is now the case and also more speedily than will be the case under this section.</P>

      <P>When the 1936 Land Act was going through this House I heard the people who are now sitting on the Government side of the House talking about fixity of tenure, free sale, and so forth. This will upset everything and it will not settle anything.  Rural Deputies will agree with me when I say that in all probability they have never gone into a locality since they became Deputies but representations were made to them about land division to the extent that, where there was a farm of four, five or six acres and the valuation might be only £15, it was put up to them that the land should be taken over and divided and handed over to somebody else.  You are going to open this flood-gate.  You are not going to solve the land problem in Meath or in the Midlands or anywhere else.  It is a very dangerous section in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest, as has already been suggested from this side of the House, that the experiment be tried for not more than one year.  There are big estates which can be divided and settled in a proper way.  I heard the <Col N="434" /> late Mr. Patrick Hogan, who was Minister for Agriculture, state in this House: &ldquo;Beware of the day you do away with or try to do away with the middle-class farmer.

      <P>I should like the Minister to give me information on the following matter.  I have in mind a problem that arises in every constituency and that arises very often in my constituency of County Wicklow. There is a type of farm which may be 50 per cent. suitable for agriculture, 25 per cent. or even the other 50 per cent. suitable for forestry and which the Forestry Department require.  Can the Minister under this section acquire that particular farm?  It would be desirable if he could, because I know that both the Land Commission and the forestry section have fallen down in the matter of the purchase of farms under existing legislation.  If this section would enable the Minister to purchase farms of that kind and if he could use portion for the relief of congestion and hand over the other portion to the Forestry Department, it would be a great help.</P>

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 24.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 61 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 62:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), pages 12 and 13, to delete paragraphs (b) and (c) and substitute the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(b)  the Order shall be expressed and shall operate to vest the land in the Land Commission for an estate in fee simple in possession subject&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  in case the land is subject to a State annuity, to that State annuity, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  in case provision is made in the Order in pursuance of subsection <Col N="437" /> (4) of this section for the continuance or creation of an easement, to that easement, but save as aforesaid free from all public rights (if any) and from the claims of all persons who are interested in the land, whether in respect of incumbrances or interests therein or otherwise howsoever,.</P>
    <P>This amendment is a tidying up of two paragraphs in the Bill as introduced. It is deleting these and substituting one to bring about the same effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>This a very long and involved section and it is difficult to understand.  There are 14 sub-sections and these are again divided into paragraphs and there are so many that they absorb the alphabet several times. Anything I do not understand I am inclined to distrust.</P>
      <P>This section purports to do away with certain rights of way and certain easements and we would want to be very careful as to the destruction of any particular rights that people have. There are certain rights the preservation of which is wholly desirable and necessary.  I have seen rights extinguished by allottees, even though the Land Commission took certain precautions to preserve them, and I would like to be assured that where the Land Commission does recognise these rights they will make the allottees who benefit from land division also recognise them.</P>
      <P>There may be certain rights of way along a river bank, ancient rights which are of benefit to anglers and others.  The Aga Khan, Deputy Hickey's friend, and other people who are not truly Gaelic, have certain river banks, and no further rights of that nature should be wiped out by any action taken by the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then again, I want to know if this section applies, not to future transactions, but where injustices were done in the past.  There are many public paths which it is right to preserve.  There are certain rights of way which no longer should exist as rights of way.  They existed before proper roadways were provided <Col N="438" /> in the country, and now, when those roadways have been made through districts where rights of way existed over land before, many people insist on using the ancient right of way, even though they have got a new road.  That is the cause of a good deal of trouble and a good deal of litigation.  Every farmer objects to trespass&mdash;and rightly so.</P>
    <P>Many of the rights of way that are still being used are being used unjustly, causing a good deal of difficulty to the man who owns the farm.  I would like to know if this section will operate to relieve farmers of such trespass.  Could we eliminate rights of way that were originally justifiable but now, in view of the multiplicity of roads created, are no longer justifiable?  Will this section operate to give a farmer a chance of appealing to the Land Commission to destroy such rights?</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of easement which it is very difficult to interfere with, and that is the question of water. This purchase of land purports to eliminate certain rights of way and certain easements.  One of the most valuable easements people have is the right of water.  You may destroy the value of a farm and put the farmer to a tremendous amount of inconvenience, and I do not know of any monetary compensation that will be sufficient for the farmer for the removal of an easement which he has to water.</P>
    <P>I would like to be assured by the Minister in specific fashion as to what exactly are the powers taken by the Land Commission in this case and if the section, when passed, will operate to relieve certain farmers of disabilities from which they suffer now, as well as the Land Commission.  The Land Commission want to provide for the elimination of disabilities on farms which they will create.  If these disabilities existed on existing farms will the farmer have the right to appeal to the Land Commission for authority to destroy an easement which is no longer justified?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>This section will deal, first of all, with land purchased under the preceding section&mdash;that is, land purchased for cash in the open market or by private treaty.  Secondly, in the <Col N="439" /> case of a private purchaser&mdash;for instance, if myself or Deputy Moylan goes out to buy a holding&mdash;there are certain things attaching to it.  We do not mind that, but in the case of the Land Commission they must hand absolutely clean, sound title to the allottee.  For that reason power is being taken under the section to get land absolutely clean and free.  We are dealing now, I presume, with the amendment.  There are ample safeguards in the section giving the Land Commission power to give alternative rights away, to give rights to water and so on.  I think that should put Deputy Moylan's mind at rest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is an extraordinary proposition that is made on behalf of the Land Commission.  Here the State are going to purchase land at the public expense.  If there are rights or easements attaching to that land, the Land Commission are taking power to wipe them out, while a purchaser in the open market would have to buy that land subject to those rights and easements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>They already have similar powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to tell us where the Land Commission have the power to wipe out a public way over land purchased by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>They have that power since the 1923 Land Act was passed, and I think even before it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have chapter and verse for that because I do not accept it.  Under this amendment the Land Commission are proposing to take power to wipe out any of the existing easements that may be an appurtenant to a holding which they purchase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>May I read for the Deputy sub-section (1) of Section 41 of the 1939 Land Act:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Where the Land Commission have, either before or after the passing of this Act, acquired or purchased any untenanted land or acquired any holding by way of <Col N="440" /> exchange or resumed any holding and such land or holding is subject to any easement or to any grazing, turbary, or other right or to a tenancy of such a nature that it does not constitute an interest entitling the occupier to purchase under the Land Purchase Acts, the Land Commission may by order extinguish such easement, right or tenancy subject to payment by the Land Commission of such compensation as shall be fixed by the Land Commission by their said order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are merely giving the Land Commission the same power where they purchase under this section and there are similar safeguards as regards compensation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Where are there similar safeguards under this amendment in the matter of compensation for easements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (9) provides:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a transfer order is made in respect of any land, the Land Commission shall be liable to pay compensation in respect of every interest (other than an easement continued by the order or an easement in lieu whereof a new easement has been created by the order) subsisting therein immediately before the operative date, but no claim for compensation shall be made after the expiration of six years from that date.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If that is not a safeguard enough, I will make an amendment on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>That mentions the word &ldquo;interest&rdquo; and, presumably, interest in this section means an interest within the meaning of the Land Acts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It includes an easement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must know that there are many different rights that would not be termed easements within the meaning of the Land Acts. There are many different rights attaching to farms, rights in regard to Mass paths, rights to water and perhaps to a well on a farm.  It may be the only well that people for miles around can get <Col N="441" /> water from.  In regard to holdings near the sea, there may be rights in regard to the taking of seaweed.  All these rights may be wiped out by the Land Commission under this amendment.</P>
      <P>I want to remind the House that all these rights on particular holdings have been jealously guarded and defended by the people concerned, and particularly in the congested areas.  The people have jealously guarded and protected their rights in the courts of the country for many years.  All these easements and rights of way are of very grave importance to the people concerned.  The exercise of them makes all the difference between running small farms economically or otherwise. I want to tell the Minister that unless adequate provision is made to secure every conceivable type of easement which the Land Commission would propose to wipe out under this amendment, the Land Commission may find themselves up against a big constitutional issue.  The individual's rights to property are protected under the Constitution and the Land Commission are not entitled to take them away.  I can visualise all kinds of hardship arising in the case of individuals who for a long time have enjoyed certain rights over a farm that may be purchased by the Land Commission. The Land Commission may ignore their rights completely.  It is a large body and is inclined to terrorise people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Land Commission are going to wipe out rights which people have enjoyed from time immemorial, then they are going to create a very serious difficulty.  I have already pointed out that if a private individual went into the open market and purchased a farm over which there were certain rights and easements, he had to do so subject to these rights and easements.  But the Land Commission are going to wipe out all such rights and easements where they purchase a holding.  I submit that they have no right to do that.  The Minister stated, on Section 23, that the Land Commission would go into competition against the ordinary purchaser <Col N="442" /> in the open market where land was offered for sale.  We now find that that is not so, and that the Land Commission will have at least a 15 per cent. advantage over the ordinary purchaser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Have you read the whole section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the power which the Land Commission is proposing to take under the amendment. I do not see any reason for the taking of those powers.  If it was a question of the rearrangement of a holding or of dealing with rundale, where you had criss-cross by-paths, I could understand a power like this being taken by the Land Commission. The same powers were taken under the 1939 Act but, if they were taken, there was provision made for compensation. I presume that this provision is confined to purchases under Section 23. I see no reason why the Minister should get those powers and should be given this advantage over and above any other purchaser who may be in competition with his officials in the purchase of such a farm.  If this amendment is inserted in its present form and a farm is purchased with certain rights over it, it will come as a shock to the adjoining people to know that the rights which they have been enjoying are wiped out and they have no redress.  I ask the Minister to withdraw the amendment or reconsider the matter before the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I will not, because the amendment is a definite improvement on the original drafting of the Bill.  I asked Deputy Moran if he had read the whole section because it is a very long section.  Sub-section (9) states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a transfer order is made in respect of any land, the Land Commission shall be liable to pay compensation in respect of every interest (other than an easement continued by the order or an easement in lieu whereof a new easement has been created by the order) subsisting therein immediately before the operative date, but no claim for compensation shall be made after the expiration of six years from that date.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="443" /> That depends on what the interest covers.  If you turn to sub-section (14), paragraph (d), you will find that the word &ldquo;interest&rdquo; there in relation to land is defined as &ldquo;an easement or an annual payment&rdquo;.  In between lines 5 and 10 you have this: &ldquo;The word &lsquo;easement&rsquo; includes any <i>profit-a-prendre</i> or other right (including all sporting rights, within the meaning of the Land Purchase Acts) in or over land, and also any fisheries appurtenant to land within the meaning of the Land Purchase Acts.&rdquo;  In other words, it includes practically every conceivable kind of right for which the Land Commission must pay compensation to the owner.  What greater safeguard can you have than that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that a water right is invaluable and no amount of compensation is adequate for it.  Is it proposed under this section to destroy water rights which are the cause of constant litigation throughout the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  A good deal of the Land Commission time is taken up acquiring rights of way in the case of vested land.  In the course of their ordinary land resettlement, it is the duty of the Land Commission to provide rights of way to water if none exist or if there is trouble in connection with them.  I have known cases where there was litigation because rights of way were not clearly defined and the Land Commission had to get the necessary land for the rights of way.  It is inconceivable that they would do what is suggested.  On the other hand, as in the case of forestry, it is necessary for them in case they would meet a person&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  The Land Commission must give clear title to the allottee.  It is not in their own interests they are working.  When they go to purchase land it is not for themselves they are purchasing it, but for some future allottee.  They want to give that allottee a clear title.  If no right of way exists, they will not hesitate to strike out a new right of way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 65:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (10), page 14, to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(10)  Where a transfer order is made in respect of any land and the interest therein purchased by the Land Commission was, immediately before the operative date, subject to a mortgage&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the reference in sub-section (9)  of this section to every interest subsisting in the land immediately before the operative date shall include a reference to the interest purchased by the Land Commission, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  the fixing of compensation in respect of the interest purchased <Col N="445" /> by the Land Commission, and the allocation of such compensation as between the Land Commission and the mortgagee, shall be carried out in accordance with the rules made for the purposes of this section.</P>
    <P>This amendment is being moved to meet the wishes of the Incorporated Law Society.  It seeks to clarify the position in relation to the payment of compensation to mortgagees whose interests may be extinguished under a Transfer Order.  As a general rule, mortgages against a vendor's interest will be discharged in the process of completing the purchase under Section 23 of the Bill.  It is only in a very rare case that such a mortgage will be affected by and compensatable under the Transfer Order procedure.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Deputy Aiken I move amendment No. 66:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (11).</P>
      <P>I do not like this sub-section for the reason that it seems to me that, in going out to purchase farms as going concerns, the Land Commission and the Minister should be very careful and should not purchase them speculatively; I mean in the sense that they have not a settled plan of use immediately. It would seem to me that that plan is not clear in the Minister's mind. If the Minister is purchasing a farm, it ought to be purchased with a specific purpose and design and not with a speculation as to what might happen later.  The verbiage of this is peculiar, &ldquo;becomes not required by the Land Commission.&rdquo;  If there is any likelihood that the Land Commission will not require it, they should not purchase it.  There ought to be some specific plan in their minds for dealing with the going-concern farm immediately and not having it on their hands and having Deputy Commons asking why it has been in the hands of the Land Commission for the last 20 years, as he might conceivably ask.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, if the Minister will look at Section 25 of the Bill and at Section 31 of the Land Act, 1923, if we have to have this Bill, I have no objection to a person who is the tenant of a holding <Col N="446" /> which, in the opinion of the Land Commission is not an economic holding, getting one of these farms.  I have no objection to a person who has entered into an agreement with the Land Commission for the exchange of his holding getting one of these farms.</P>

      <P>Romance came up on the 9.15.  I wonder if the Minister got his 9.10.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  A person who within 25 years before the passing of the Irish Land Act, 1903, was the tenant of a holding to which the Land Purchase Acts apply and who was evicted from that holding in consequence of proceedings taken by or on behalf of his landlord or, in case such person is dead, a person nominated by the Land Commission as his personal representative.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have no objection to that person, but Section 25 of the Minister's own Bill says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a person is displaced from employment on land by reason of the acquisition, resumption or purchase of that land by the Land Commission, the Land Commission may, if in their discretion they so think proper, pay to him such gratuity as they consider reasonable in respect of his displacement from employment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is a section of which I approve. But then sub-paragraph (d) of Section 31 of the Land Act, 1923, says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A person being a labourer who by reason of the sale of any lands under the provisions of the Land Purchase Acts has been deprived of his employment on the said lands.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="447" /> If you intend to purchase a going-concern farm for a man who is displaced from his employment because of the acquisition of an estate, I think that is wrong and I think that section needs amendment.  I do not know if I have any objection to trustees for the purposes mentioned in Section 4 of the Irish Land Act, 1903, as extended by this Act.  We got our education in various ways.  Portion of mine came from the present chairman in regard to legislation by reference.  It had escaped my notice up to then but, since then, I have become very keen on it. Anyone can dig up all the Land Acts which affect this particular Bill.  They go back as far as the Deasy Act and at least to 1883.  It is important for me to know whether or not I object to these trustees.  I think I have an objection to the people under (f).  The Minister includes all these people mentioned in the section of the Act of 1923:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(f) Any person or body to whom in the opinion of the Land Commission an advance ought to be made.</P>
    <P>In selecting persons under this paragraph the Land Commission may have regard to the cases of persons who, or whose predecessors have been evicted from their holdings in consequence of proceedings taken by or on behalf of the landlord, and who are not included in paragraph (c) above.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If you include all these I shall be accepting at least four farms because there are a number of farms in which my forebears lived and from which they were evicted.  Another peculiar thing is &ldquo;any other person or body to whom in the opinion of the Land Commission an advance ought to be made.&rdquo;  If you go back to Section 10, sub-section (1) (d) and (e) the opinion of the Land Commission gives way to the opinion of the Minister because we have in brackets:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(other than any determination arising in or being part of a rearrangement scheme.)&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That gives the Minister full control in the case of price and allotting.  If we <Col N="448" /> include (f) of sub-section (1) of Section 31 of the Land Act, 1933, as mentioned in the Bill at Section 24, I am afraid that I would not like to confer all that authority on the Minister.  I think he ought to make some change in sub-section (11) in order to narrow the number of types to whom this land will be given.</P>
    <P>First of all, these going-concern farms should be bought for a specific purpose, the purpose being the relief of congestion.  I have no objection to a true representative of an evicted tenant, even at this late hour, getting land.  But the problem of the existing congestion is much more important and its solution should override all other problems.</P>

      <P>I never knew the Land Commissioners to be so liberal as to give four farms to one person.  It is possible that from time to time a holding or farm may be purchased for a particular migrant.  The standard holding at the present time is about 33 statute acres and it is possible that the holdings purchased may comprise 50 acres.  A standard holding would, therefore, leave a balance on hands and that balance might be added to an adjoining small-holding in order to make it economic.  That would be allotted by the commissioners and not by the Minister since it would have to form part of a rearrangement scheme before the Minister would come into it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 71:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) Where any such person is employed on agricultural work for wage or payment in kind on the estate, he shall be entitled to a holding on satisfactory proof that he has sufficient stock, equipment or capital to enable him to undertake the successful working of the holding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this amendment is very desirable. It is true that, in the past, first preference was given to employees. That did not work out satisfactorily. Of course, I can see that the Minister can defend his section on the grounds that a number of those who were given holdings of land did not prove capable of working them.  It also affords protection to other employees. Despite the fact that the regulations, I believe, stated that employees did get first preference, that was not always put into practice.  In very recent years an estate in my constituency was divided.  There was a large number of employees and there <Col N="452" /> were two or three what you might call old retainers who were physically unfit for land and the Land Commission passed them over and they got no compensation at all.  Some of those men are as a charge on the rates at the moment as a result of this provision not being there.  A number of others got holdings and within the past year they have been given permission by the Land Commission to sell them.  Consequently, on that score, I do not find any fault with the section.  At the same time, it is very sweeping.  It leaves full discretionary powers with the Land Commission to deny anybody or any employee a holding of land and give them, in lieu, cash compensation. That is why I would wish that there would be a safeguard as far as persons who worked on estates and who were, perhaps, living on them are concerned. I know that the Minister will say he has already given an assurance on the Second Reading that such types of persons are going to be treated fairly.  The Minister's assurance is all right but what is in the Bill is different.</P>
    <P>No assurance of that kind is given to anybody.  It refers to employees, all and sundry, and the Land Commission can, in their absolute discretion, take exception in any particular case. If a Land Commission inspector prepares a scheme, the Land Commission, on his recommendation or report, allocates a holding to some particular individual who, in the opinion of the inspector who prepared the scheme, was a suitable person.  If, after a while, it becomes apparent that the allottee did not use that land and made application for permission to sell, naturally enough, the inspector would become very irritated.  If he came along and found a person on an estate, such as, say, the head of a household who, although perhaps a good and a satisfactory employee so far as his employer was concerned, was not a very thrifty person as far as his family was concerned, the Land Commission inspector might very probably take the line of action of saying: &ldquo;Well, it is better to compensate this man than to give him a holding.&rdquo;  In that case, it is not the individual concerned who would really be penalised but his family.  After all, if some brake is put <Col N="453" /> on the discretionary powers of the Land Commission in that way to ensure that a holding would come to the family&mdash;and it need not be vested for quite a long number of years&mdash;it would be a very great safeguard.  Despite the fact that that individual, who, as I said, may have been a very satisfactory employee in carrying out another person's business but not very careful or thrifty as far as his own family was concerned, would receive monetary compensation, I am afraid that if it was handed over to him it would pass away very quickly.  There would be a definite form of security if the amendment that was tabled here were inserted, and still it need not deny the Land Commission inspectors their discretionary powers in numerous cases. At the same time it would safeguard the others.  Of course, the condition is here in this amendment that where any such person is employed on agricultural work for wage or payment in kind on the estate, he shall be entitled to a holding on satisfactory proof that he has sufficient stock, equipment or capital to enable him to undertake the successful working of the holding.</P>
    <P>I think that is a very big safeguard so far as the Land Commission is concerned.  If the Land Commission are to be provided with protection and given these discretionary powers to ensure that no unsuitable person will be allocated a holding, I think that on the other hand an employee of the type we have mentioned here should also be entitled to greater security.  If the Minister is not accepting the amendment in this form, I expect that on the Report Stage he will be able to bring in some form of amendment to provide that security.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>In paragraph (a), sub-section (1), of Section 31, of the Land Act of 1923, the Land Commission were empowered to give, if they saw fit, to an employee a holding of land on the estate taken over by them because, by the acquisition of that estate, the employee had lost his employment.  I thought I was doing very well when I was providing for the type of employee who might have been a very short period working on an estate, who lost his employment and who, perhaps, <Col N="454" /> would not be in a position to get similar employment elsewhere.  That was one type of employee.  Then there was the type of employee who lost his employment on an estate but to whom a holding did not offer a suitable type of alternative livelihood.  It did not happen very often but it did occur on some occasions that disturbance, inconvenience and perhaps actual loss were caused to such employees when an estate was taken over.  That is the reason Section 25 was introduced and I think the Deputy will agree that it is an improvement on Section 31 of the 1923 Act.  It has been left to the discretion of the commissioners but I have never heard a case in which it was seriously charged against them that they treated some person who lost his employment in circumstances of this character in any harsh manner.  I could not accept the amendment in the terms in which the Deputy put it forward.</P>

I should like to ensure that everybody who worked for a reasonable time on an estate should get adequate compensation and I should like that in assessing compensation, payment in kind might also be regarded as an emolument to be compensated for.  It was the practice of the Land Commission to compensate employees on an estate by giving land to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>There had to be some system of selectivity.  Many people who might have been a long time on an estate were found unsuitable to get land and therefore got no compensation whereas people who were only a short time on the estate and who were regarded by an inspector as suitable, got compensation away beyond their deserts.  One evil was created by that. <Col N="455" /> Many of those people had not the farming mentality.  They had not the capital or equipment and in dealing with them the Land Commission recreated a condition which they set out to ameliorate.  After a few years they gave those people, most of whom fell down on the job, permission to sell their lands.  That was a most unwise proceeding and I am glad the Minister has changed it but I should like nevertheless that where possible, some provision might be made to give to a man who has real farming experience even though he may be only a part-time employee on the estate, who has equipment and who has stock, some consideration and not completely close the door on him because he may be a very valuable tenant of the Land Commission.  Otherwise I welcome the section.  I want to point out again that Section 25 as it stands amends Section 31 of the Land Act of 1923 which operates in regard to the former section and makes it necessary to recast the Minister's proposals in the previous section.  Perhaps, the Minister would look into that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to point out that the land problem and the congestion problem vary from county to county and from place to place.  One thing that strikes me in connection with this amendment is the position of men such as those working in the Lagan Valley in Donegal.  They have been taking conacre for the last 200 years and they are real farmers.  From time immemorial they have been taking plots of two and four acres and intensively cultivating them.  If land is to be acquired there under Section 23, I think that some amendment of this kind should be provided because, owing to the way in which this section stands these people would of course be excluded.  You are cutting out any temporary convenience lettings and presumbably that particular type of letting would be a temporary convenience letting.  I do not regard the type of individual who worked these lettings as a landless man. We were talking about landless men to-day and in particular it was suggested that you could give <Col N="456" /> a holding of land to some man who had no connection with a particular estate or farm at all, that you could make a present of it to somebody who was not connected with the land in that way.  I invite the Minister to state now if he is prepared to take the line that we are to make up our minds once and for all to acquire land for the relief of congestion only.  Are we going to say that for all time the landless man is cut out?</P>
      <P>The Minister to-night gave two answers to that question.  He stated that it was the intention to finish for all time this question of landless men, and he came along a few moments afterwards and said, not for all time, that they might come in at some later stage.  The sooner the Minister, the Land Commission and the House make up their minds on this matter, the better.  It is most unfair to these men who, in many instances, have been coming along to Deputies and pressing them in connection with division of estates.</P>
      <P>It is not correct to state that harshness by the Land Commission does not occur sometimes when dividing estates, in not taking into account people working on the estates, who would have claims.  We had a case of that type on the Dignam estate at Shrule, between Galway and Mayo.  A man who worked there for years&mdash;the Minister, I am sure, is aware of the case&mdash;got no compensation when the estate was divided; he was not provided for.  In cases like that some provision should be made.  I do not include that type in the definition of landless men, as I would mean it in the ordinary sense.  The Minister, before the Report Stage, should consider this matter and leave the door open to provide for special cases of that sort.</P>

      <P>All the amendments to this section are my own.  This is a section which is really retrospective, but it will operate for the future as well.  In pre-1922 days the Lord Lieutenant had certain powers in cases where the Congested Districts Board or the Land Commission allotted fields and parks for certain purposes.  He had certain powers to prescribe the type of scheme, and when I use the word &ldquo;scheme&rdquo; it is not to be confused with a Land Commission scheme for the allotment of land..  A scheme in this case was a document signed by the Lord Lieutenant and it set out the use to which the field could be put. The same document governed the conduct of the trustees.  The Lord Lieutenant had power to appoint new trustees in certain cases, or authorise the trustees to dispose of the field if its normal use ceased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="458" /> That particular power was never transferred.  It was an oversight that occurred in the change-over of Government from the British to our own people in 1921 or 1922.  That oversight was not discovered until a court action brought it to light in 1939.  This whole section legalises things done in the past by the Minister for Agriculture for a period, and various Ministers for Land since that time.  It legalises these things and sets the matter right for the future.  It is a long section and I must admit I do not understand the finer details of it&mdash;nobody but a solicitor would.</P>

      <P>I am advised that it is desirable to add this definition of the expression &ldquo;public purposes&rdquo;.  Without it the words &ldquo;public purposes&rdquo; might be very narrowly construed and the section might not be regarded as allowing the Minister to authorise trustees to dispose of land except where it was required for State purposes or, at best, for, say, parks open to the public at large.  It is obvious that the section will benefit the community very little unless it is wide enough to enable trustees to come to the rescue where land is needed for desirable purposes; for example, to provide education, entertainment or recreation facilities.  Used in this way, the section could be a valuable contribution to the betterment of rural conditions. I am asking for the amendment on these grounds.</P>

      <P>The deletion of these words will allow the Land Commission to allot sports fields to people in rural districts where they could not do so before. They were confined to what was set out in the words which I propose now to delete.  The Land Commission being a Department of State dealing principally with rural Ireland, it was doubtful if the giving of sports fields in certain cases would be valid for want of such an amendment as this.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing provisions of this section, the Land Commission shall not resume such holding or any part thereof for any purpose other than the relief of congestion in the locality in which such holding is situate, or the provision of sports fields, parks, pleasure grounds or playgrounds for the inhabitants of villages, towns or cities or for schools or the provision of gardens for schools.&rdquo;</P>

I do not want the Deputy to understand that we are depriving towns, cities or villages of any benefit that they enjoy at present.  By the deletion of the words in the amendment they will still have the benefits which they have at present.  The trouble is that the Land Commission could grant a sports field to a city like Dublin, but not to a rural district.  The whole thing hinges on the definition of the word &ldquo;village&rdquo;.  By the deletion of the words proposed, the Land Commission will have the power to allot a sports field to any city, town or village or even to put it on the top of a mountain.</P>

      <P>(16)  To avoid doubts and without prejudice to the Interpretation Act, 1937 (No. 38 of 1937), it is hereby enacted as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <P>As far as I can see, this amendment proposes to confer further power on the Land Commission which they may wield against anybody.  I do not think that I have ever seen a Bill go through this House with so many provisions as this one contains intended to ensure that no matter what the Land Commission may do, let it be right or wrong, nobody is going to have any redress against them.  This Bill is remarkable for that.  The Minister, in this Bill, is providing the finest type of insurance for the Land Commission that I have ever seen in a Bill.  That is the position so far as this amendment and other sections in the Bill are concerned.  No matter what goes wrong, no one will have any redress against the Land Commission. If poor Pat Murphy is adversely affected in any way by anything done <Col N="462" /> by the Land Commission he is not going to have any redress against them.</P>

      <P>I have never seen this House in the case of any other Bill, go to such lengths to ensure that nobody will have any right of redress against the Land Commission.  Under one section it is provided that, whether the Land Commission are right or wrong, no action will lie against them. This amendment would seem to me to be a continuance of what I may call the building up of an iron curtain around the Land Commission.  Surely, the Land Commission will make mistakes from time to time as everybody makes them.  Therefore, they should be liable like other people for them, and should be prepared to take the consequences.  On that general principle, I am against the amendment as I was against another section which provided buffers and safeguards for every single thing done by those inside the doors of the Land Commission from the office-boy up to the Minister himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy has exaggerated the effect of this amendment. When one bears in mind the history of land tenure in this country and the scope of the land code, one must admit, I think, that it would be impossible to visualise the framing of a perfect Land Act.  There have been many Land Acts passed since the Deasy Act of 1860.  The Deputy is right, I suppose, in thinking that counsel and solicitors will discover flaws in this Bill as they have discovered them in others. It would be foolish on my part to claim that this is a perfect measure.  At the same time, I must point out that it is <Col N="463" /> a very unpleasant thing for a Department of State to find, while they had been taking a certain line of action in perfect good faith over a long period in the belief that they had adequate powers under a statue to do so, that in fact, when a test case was brought to court, what they had been doing was illegal, although the illegality might not matter a row of pins.  What we have been trying to do is to plug holes that have appeared in previous Acts passed in 1933, 1936 and 1939.  I want to tell the House that there will be another Land Bill following on this.  It will be made up practically of amendments to previous legislation.</P>

      <P>After Section 28 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where a scheme of rearrangement or resettlement has been prepared and submitted by a Land Commission official such scheme shall be put into operation if a three-fourths majority of the people interested sign an agreement to accept such scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea I have in my mind is to help to speed up rearrangement and avoid the usual trouble which arises in the congested areas.  We know that when a scheme of rearrangement is prepared by a Land Commission inspector and submitted it is very hard to get the agreement of the parties concerned.  As Deputy Moylan has often told us, it is very hard to satisfy all the people, particularly those who have been in such dire circumstances and so hard pressed for such a long time.  When a reasonable rearrangement scheme has been submitted to tenants by a Land Commission official, it is wrong that any single individual should have the power <Col N="465" /> unjustly to hold up such a scheme.  I know of two or three areas in my constituency where there was sufficient land to bring practically all the congested holdings up to an economic size and practically all the tenants were in agreement with the scheme submitted by the Land Commission official, but, because some crank in the locality, because of jealousy that his neighbours were put on equal terms with him, refused to sign, the agreement fell through.  When the best job possible has been done by a Land Commission inspector, if a majority of three-fourths of the people interested sign the agreement the scheme should be put through because, no matter what any Land Commission official or any Minister or Government will do, it will be impossible to satisfy everybody in connection with a rearrangement scheme.  There will be people dissatisfied despite the best efforts of the inspector.</P>
    <P>In order that resettlement may go ahead with a fair amount of progress, I suggest that this amendment should be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>We have threshed out the whole question of rearrangement thoroughly on Section 10.  This amendment raises it all over again.  I was thinking along the same lines as those suggested by the Deputy in his amendment, but the truth of the matter is that there is no means, short of bringing out guns and bayonets, to compel a tenant to take a rearranged holding if he does not want to take it.  Even if the amendment were inserted, it would never be of any use.  Suggestions were made that the majority of the tenants should have power to bring objecting tenants into court to show cause why a good sound scheme should not be put into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had the advice of the commissioners, the legal men and inspectors with excellent records and the general consensus of opinion was that any attempt at force in a matter of this kind is worse than useless.  It would only cause embitterment amongst the tenants which would put off rearrangement for 20 years.  The scheme must be left more or less to the tenants themselves.  Even if the commissioners <Col N="466" /> and the Minister and the whole of the Dáil went into a townland where 20 tenants were to be rearranged, until each of these 20 tenants is satisfied that he is getting a fair deal they will not agree.  In other words, when an inspector proposes such a scheme, instead of having six commissioners, every one of the tenants will be a commissioner and much more severe and critical than any Land Commissioner. That is why we introduced a new departure by bringing in Section 10, because a rearrangement scheme is the tenants' own scheme.  The whole secret of an inspector being able to put a scheme into effect is to give as even a division of the good land and bad land available as possible.  When a man knows that his neighbour is not getting any more or any less than he is, then the scheme will go through.  The amendment would not serve any useful purpose; neither would any other method that we can devise or think of. The whole thing depends on the goodwill of the people whose holdings are being rearranged.  As a matter of fact, the less interference there is with them the better chance there is of success. No amount of pressure is any use.  For that reason, I ask the Deputy not to press the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister knows that this principle has already been accepted in connection with other legislation, for instance, in the Local Authorities (Works) Act and I think in connection with rural improvement schemes.  I would not put the number as low as Deputy Commons puts it, but if 90 per cent, of the people involved in a rundale area agree there should be some procedure whereby the scheme could go through at the instance of the Land Commission, subject to a simple appeal to the District Court by the 10 per cent. dissatisfied.  Some rearrangement schemes which would have gone through were upset for other reasons. The Minister, when he was a Deputy, upset one down at Kiltarsaghaun by simply going out on the land and stopping the people signing.  People will always be exploited in some direction. At the same time there should be some way of getting over the difficulty <Col N="467" /> where in a particular rundale area nine out of ten tenants are agreeable to the rearrangement scheme and one black sheep holds out against it.  In many cases the particular individual may not be responsible for his actions. I have known cases where that occurred and the whole scheme was held up for years.  That has been one of the Land Commission headaches in dealing with rundale areas.  Now that the Minister is putting this Bill through, I do not think he should confine himself to the 75 per cent. suggested in the amendment.  Would the Minister consider a figure of 90 per cent?</P>

The first essential is fair play between all interested <Col N="468" /> in the scheme.  Secondly, the tenants know that the scheme will be in existence for a long time to come and it will be the last settlement for which they can hope.  Very often the Land Commission is cramped for want of land, but where they can make a liberal settlement that is the best means of ensuring success.  There is no other way of doing it.  In most cases the tenants are reasonable.  They recognise that there is not a lot of land at the disposal of the Land Commission and very often they accept settlement at a much lower valuation level than I would like to give them if I had the land at my disposal.</P>

We know that all the tenants in a rearrangement scheme are not brought up to the same level.  An effort is made to do that, but it is impossible to make all equal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  Some scheme should be devised where when nine people agree the tenth will not be allowed to hold up rearrangement. There was a provision in the old days but I do not know whether it was ever enforced.  If anyone refused to sign a scheme the valuation of his holding was raised to an economic standard and he had to do without any extra land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking the Land Commission to enforce any such provision now.  What generally happens is that the Land Commission decides to rearrange and there is not sufficient land available.  There is always a delay and during that time certain portions of the available land are let for grazing at a rent to those who will ultimately benefit.  When the final settlement is reached these people expect to get the same portions they had <Col N="469" /> for grazing.  In that way trouble arises. Some provision is necessary under which the Land Commission could hurry up these rearrangement schemes. Certain powers have been taken in other legislation, such as the Local Authorities (Works) Act, where an obstructor is taken to court if necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 84:&mdash;</P>
      <P>After Section 28 to add a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding anything contained in the Land Purchase Acts the Minister is hereby empowered to give directions to the trustees appointed under the said Acts in regard to the construction and repair of river and sea embankments and the trustees concerned shall comply with any such directions.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down this amendment in order to get clarification of a certain type of procedure.  As far as I am aware the Land Commission has only an indirect control in relation to trustees on certain estates.  I would like a statement from the Minister in the matter.  This has become a subject of controversy in our area on various occasions where moneys for the repair of embankments are concerned.  In one case a particular trustee stood to benefit from the trust moneys and he influenced the other <Col N="470" /> trustees to allocate money for the repair of his own particular embankment. Naturally the tenants objected to the money being used in that way. I raised the matter some time ago with the Land Commission and I was told that it has no direct control over these trustees.  If you like, they have control over them in regard to the principal of the money invested, but not altogether, as far as I am aware. I should be glad to hear a statement from the Minister as to whether he can clarify the position.  If he could do so, I would be satisfied.  I should like him also to go further and to accept this amendment which would meet the point made by me on behalf of the people whom I represent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Deputy to understand that the entire question of embankments and trustees is very complicated.  I realise that something should be done about the matter but how it will be done or what shape it will take, I do not know.  However, I guarantee to the Deputy that between this and the Report Stage I shall give the problem he has in mind full consideration to see if his points can be met.  I know a little about that problem although it does not affect my particular province.  Therefore, I would ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say something about this matter in relation to the county in which the Minister in interested.  To our amazement we discovered a fortnight ago from a statement made by the Minister that if there is something in the nature of a sluice gate or an embankment keeping out the sea, and which was erected by the Land Commission, it disclaims liability once the land has been vested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not say &ldquo;liability.&rdquo; The liability up to the date of vesting is the landlord's liability to his tenant. After vesting, that liability passes to the landlord, who then becomes the tenant.  The tenant is no longer the tenant&mdash;he is his own landlord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="471" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the Minister's point but it is a distinction without a difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a big difference between the tenant of land and the owner of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Some years ago these embankments and causeways and sluice gates were erected by the Land Commission. In the meantime, their holdings happened to be vested under the Land Acts and when these embankments or causeways or sluice gates break down the Land Commission disclaim liability.  They say that as the estates are vested they have no further interest in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is going to reconsider this amendment I want him to reconsider this question also.  You have in these coastal areas, and particularly along the West coast of Mayo round about Kilmeena Bay, a number of these embankments and so forth which were erected by the Land Commission 20 or 30 years ago.  The lands have since been vested.  These embankments and so forth have, in a great many cases, broken down.  Hundreds of acres round the coast are, therefore, damaged and the sea floods the farmers out.  These are big and costly jobs and they are sent from post to pillar.  Apparently no Department of State accepts responsibility for them. I was amazed that the Land Commission had taken this line&mdash;perhaps it is their line all over the country&mdash;in accordance with the law, that once they vest the estates they have not the necessary power to act in the matter. But if they have not the necessary power I would urge the Minister, before the Report Stage, to consider seriously whether he should take the necessary power to deal with these matters.  No Department, other than the Land Commission, should be responsible for these matters.  It was responsible originally for erecting these piers, barriers, sluice gates and so forth and surely it should be responsible for their maintenance.  Why they should get out on a legal quibble when the lands are vested, is beyond my <Col N="472" /> comprehension.  If County Kerry is to be considered I would point out to the Minister that charity begins at home and that he should not forget County Mayo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Originally, the principal purpose of the Land Commission was to buy out the landlords of this country and to make the tenant farmers their own owners.  That occurs in the act of vesting.  Some of the rights won in the past from the landlords still apply to the Land Commission so long as unvested holdings lie on their hands.  The tenants on these unvested holdings enjoy the same rights against the Land Commission today as they did against the landlord in the past.  The act of vesting transfers the ownership that the Land Commission bought from the landlord and hands it over to the tenants.</P>
      <P>While I should like to see these points met I should not, at the same time, like to see the Land Commission becoming a wagon with every kind of label and tag tacked on to it and that they would do a bit of work for the Department of Industry and Commerce, for the Department of Finance, for the Department of Defence, for the Department of Justice, for the Board of Works and so on.  Their sole object was to purchase the land of Ireland from the landlords and to make the tenants the owners.  The relief of congestion and land resettlement have been grafted on as part of their duties.  I understand that the Board of Works is there for the type of work which Deputy Flynn and Deputy Moran have in mind.  We assume responsibility from time to time.  We have to get the sanction of the Department of Finance for the repair of embankments and the installation of sluices and so forth, in the case of vested lands.  I would point out, however, that we do that because our engineers are more familiar with the problems than the engineers of any other Government Department&mdash;not because we have a responsibility or a liability in the matter.  However, I shall look into the two points.</P>

    <P>Sites for 88 cottages in Portarlington and district were included by the council in a Compulsory Purchase Order which was confirmed in November, 1948.  Sketch lay-out and house plans for a scheme of 26 houses as a first instalment in the council's programme were submitted for approval in June, 1949.  The owner of the site, however, appealed to the High Court against the making of the Order and no further progress was possible pending the determination of the appeal.  The hearing of the appeal was postponed and to avoid further delay the council opened negotiations with the appealing owner.  Agreement was reached some weeks ago and the council now have power to enter on the site.  The settlement with the owner involved a reduction in the area of the site necessitating the preparation of revised plans which it is understood will be submitted for approval at an early date.</P>
