      <P>All just methods calculated to achieve the ending of Partition will continue to be employed as occasion offers.  Already the urgency of a solution of this grave problem is being realised in many countries abroad.  I am confident that a peaceful solution will come, in time, not alone through the pressure of opinion on those who are primarily responsible for Partition, but also through a better understanding of their own true interests on the part of those Irishmen in the Six Counties who are at present opposed to the reunification of our common country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In a vote on Ireland's application last September the Security Council of the United Nations once again failed to make the necessary recommendation to the General Assembly, owing to the opposition of the Soviet Union.</P>
      <P>In November, the General Assembly of the United Nations passed a resolution requesting the opinion of the International Court of Justice as to whether the Assembly could itself elect new members, even though their candidatures were not recommended by the Security Council.  Early in March, the International Court gave an advisory opinion answering this question in the negative.</P>
      <P>The position thus remains as it was before.</P>

      <P>As regards this particular case, I have no information, but I am having inquiries made, and I will convey the results to the Deputy.  Even if the facts prove to be as stated, the Land Commission could not without careful consideration decide whether all or any of the lands should be acquired. After such consideration and investigation of all the facts, acquisition might prove to be impracticable or undesirable.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies mentioned during last year's Estimate debate that chain-purchasing of farms is taking place in a few instances.  I am keeping a close watch over this matter, but, so far, this trend is negligible. Any system of chain-purchasing of farms, whether by nationals or non-nationals, which would undo the work of the Land Commission or the former Congested Districts Board would be most undesirable, and I would feel compelled to ask the House for adequate powers to cope with such a problem should it become serious.</P>

      <P>I should say at the outset that I am convinced that, from the point of view of public health, the difficulties regarding the milk supply in Cork will not be effectively removed until all milk sold in the area is either pasteurised or &ldquo;highest grade&rdquo;.

      <P>I am not aware of the correctness of the statements made by the Deputy, but I will give the Deputy the facts of which I am aware. Mr. Dalton was employed in the base work attached to Supply and Transport. He was instructed by his superior officer to clean a station wagon.  The station wagon was inspected after this instruction had been given and on the following day.  The station wagon was found to be dirty and not properly cleaned.  A recommendation had been made, in view of the fact that it was not properly cleaned, that Dalton should be dealt with.  The higher officer then called on Dalton and instructed him to clean <Col N="176" /> up the wagon properly.  He was left to do the job, and when the wagon was inspected subsequent to that it was found that the particular portion of the wagon to which his attention had been drawn was not touched. Dalton's reply was that never in his life did he have to go under a wagon or a vehicle in order to clean it, and that he would not do it now.  He was informed that when he was instructed to clean a vehicle he had to clean it underneath as well as on top.  He said: &ldquo;I would prefer to leave the job.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only assure the Deputy that I am as keen as my predecessor to carry out the promise which he gave.  The death of the Minister and my coming into office just 12 months ago intervened.  I got this legacy from my predecessor and I intend, as I told the Deputy in reply to other questions, to bring this matter on the Order Paper for introduction <Col N="179" /> as soon as I can.  A very heavy legislative programme prevented me from getting it on up to now, but the Bill will be circulated at a very early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister further aware that the principal idea behind the postponement of the local elections in the Bill to which I referred was to enable the Management Acts to be amended so that, as has been stated, a better type of candidate would be induced to stand for election, a candidate who would have some powers which are now denied to local authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that if the Bill is printed and circulated and gets to the Second Stage even if it has not passed its final stages it will be enough. Once information of these powers is made available to the public the issues raised by the Deputy can be met.  There will be no difficulty in electing new councils even if the Bill has not been completed before the elections take place.</P>

      <P>I understand from the Cork County Council that, following approval of the road works schemes for the current year and the notification of the first section of the grant in respect of works proposed under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949, all regular road workers in the Milford, Liscarroll, Rockchapel and Newmarket areas should be engaged on the various schemes, including ordinary road maintenance works now in progress.</P>
      <P>As regards the Meelin area, I understand that there are no regular road workers at present unemployed there.</P>

Would the Parliamentary Secretary state that a considerable amount of money should have been spent in that area during the latter portion of last year but came back to the Department due to the carelessness of the engineers there?</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that on a £600 scheme in the district there are only eight men employed, and will he have inquiries made into the matter?  The point I make is that men in receipt of unemployment assistance have been refused work there.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that there are three local works schemes altogether in the Island, and there are only 24 men employed in these schemes, the value of which totals approximately £1,000? Is he aware that either the local surveyor or the engineers in charge are not carrying out their duties properly, and will he have inquiries made?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>On Thursday of last week, Deputy Giles made a statement that I consider to be gravely injurious to my personal character and reputation. He said, as reported in column 2256:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I should like Deputy Cogan to give up his narrow-minded way of looking at things.  He talks as if he and he alone had saved the rate-payers. He brought down the rates and he is a national saviour, when everybody knows that it is all a matter of spite and jealousy because Deputy Dillon is Minister for Agriculture and because Deputy Donnellan is in the position which he thought he would get himself.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want to say that that statement is a grotesque falsehood.  Since I came into this House I have disagreed profoundly on a number of occasions with the Minister for Agriculture but have never borne him the slightest ill-will and never have allowed my personal feelings to influence me in regard to public policy.  Regarding the suggestion that I sought a Parliamentary Secretaryship, I think every member of the Government can bear witness that I never at any time sought any position of any kind under the present Government.  Both these accusations are contemptible and if allowed to pass unchallenged are calculated to lower the dignity of debate in this House.  I want to emphasise that I do not bear the slightest ill-will towards the present Minister for Agriculture here, or towards any member of the Government or, for that matter, towards any member of the House, and I ask the Deputy to withdraw his statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Any perusal of the debates which have taken place upon this Estimate always throws up a sharp conflict of ideas so far as forestry is concerned as between the enthusiasts and the experts.  Most Deputies who profess any interest in forestry at all are inclined to come within the class of enthusiasts and, indeed, it is difficult to see why any limit should be put upon the efforts of those anxious to see a progressive reafforestation policy pursued.  We were told last year, during the course of the Minister's closing speech, that approximately 150,000 acres had been acquired for reafforestation by the Department of Lands; we were told that of that acreage approximately 30,000 acres were reckoned to be unarable and, not alone unarable but even unfit for the planting <Col N="189" /> of trees.  That statement sets a problem to those of us who are enthusiastic about forestry.  If we look around us and make inquiries as to the steps taken in other countries in connection with forestry, it is not difficult to find examples of great progress having been made on land which was also reckoned to be unarable.  The classic example is the Brémentier Commission in France, where, in the dune areas, tracts of sand were made arable and areas which were formerly known as &ldquo;the great desolation&rdquo;, since no plant life of any kind existed on them, were successfully planted.  By dint of the application and the determination of enthusiasts, as against the pessimism of the experts, that area under the Brémentier Commission was transformed into one of the most arable districts in France.  When we read of such progress having been made elsewhere, we find it rather difficult to understand why a statement should be made here that of 150,000 acres acquired by the Land Commission as large a proportion as 30,000 acres is deemed unfit for planting.</P>
      <P>When we were discussing this Estimate the week before last, I stated that I thought insufficient attention is given generally to this problem of reafforestation.  That may be due to the heavy responsibilities which ordinarily devolve upon the Minister for Lands.  But we have, as everybody knows, very considerable areas of waste land; where such land is used at all, it is only used for the grazing of sheep. Various estimates are available as to the economic value of sheep pasturage on the mountainsides.  Perhaps the most authentic is an estimation that the highest value that can be placed upon pasturage of that kind is approximately 25/- per acre per annum.  That represents an infinitesimal addition to the national income.  It also represents a waste of what should be utilised as a national resource.  Last year the Minister stated that, even if it were possible to plant the 25,000 acres suggested by some Deputies, it would not be desirable to do so.  I cannot see the point in that statement.  I cannot understand the statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I may not have used the Minister's exact words, but the statement was something to that effect.  I think the more we can plant each year, the better it will be.  The Minister adverted at considerable length to the difficulty of acquiring land.  Some Deputies put forward the view that the only land which could be planted is arable land.  I think it would be a great mistake to plant land which is fit for other uses, such as tillage, for instance.  In so far as forestry is concerned, I think the proper approach is to tackle the most difficult land, which is of little or no use for any other purpose, and to grow trees upon that particular kind of land.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moylan dilated upon the advantages which a serious reafforestation policy must bestow.  It is obvious that a country which is well sheltered and well provided with woodland must possess a richer soil than a country which is bare and open to the elements.  I think this problem of afforestation should be brought to a far higher level than hitherto has been done.  Various statements have been made and challenges have been hurled across the House with regard to the publicity brought to bear upon forestry during the election of 1948.  One good thing at least was done in that election. More people heard of forestry and there was more talk of afforestation during that period than ever there had been before, or since, for that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many will over-estimate the potentialities and the employment possibilities of forestry, but it is undoubtedly true that we have an unusual problem in this country, where we have many thousands of peasant proprietors living on uneconomic holdings and wherein, no matter what land division policy is pursued, there still will remain at the end of it all many <Col N="191" /> thousands of people living on uneconomic holdings.  It is essential in circumstances such as these that we should provide in rural areas, particularly in areas where there is a great deal of unworkable land, some alternative form of employment, some kind of industry whereby the people living in these areas will be able to earn a living. Of course in the long run any forestry policy must necessarily be one of which we, in our generation, will not see the full fruits.  A forestry policy to be successful must be pushed for at least a century.  It has been developed in this country for no longer than 30 or 40 years.  I think we owe it to the nation, and particularly to the people in rural areas, to press this matter of afforestation with far more vigour than has been displayed hitherto.</P>
    <P>Very few Deputies take any interest at all in this Estimate.  That seems to be a pity because bound up with the question of reafforestation is part of the solution of the great problem that faces any Government in this country &mdash;the problem of how to keep people who are living poorly on bad land in the rural areas.  It does offer one way by which we can stem the tide of emigration and prevent the rush to the cities and I think, from that point of view, it is deserving of far more serious consideration than it has been getting in this House.</P>
    <P>In the course of my remarks last week, I referred to the fact that the main instruments in our forestry policy, the men who go out and plant the trees, were not in my view being treated in the manner in which they should be treated.  Even since the occasion of my last remarks, I have had representations from various parts of the country where men are employed at this work regarding their working conditions and their wages.  I am told, for instance, that in one forest in Wicklow the men are required to be on the top of a mountainside, two miles from the nearest road, at 8 o'clock in the morning. If they are a few minutes late they cannot start work until 1 o'clock. That surely is an injustice and something that should be looked into and <Col N="192" /> attended to by the Minister.  As I have stated before also, this is simply a reflection of the fact, so far as I can judge it at any rate, that the operation of the forestry policy is left, inevitably perhaps, in the hands, not particularly of the Minister, but of his officials.  The officials who are doing the work in Government offices very often have little appreciation of the difficulties and the hardships that men undergo out on the mountainsides and the hillsides.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reason I am bringing the matter forward here so that he will be made aware of the conditions and take steps to remedy them. We have now arrived at the stage when forestry workers all over the country are being paid the princely wage of 64/- per week.  I think that the Minister, who is a man who knows himself what hard work is, should apply to this problem of the wages of the forestry workers the ordinary tests which every individual must apply to the problem of living.  Difficult enough, indeed, it is for these men to carry out the kind of work which is provided by the Forestry Department.  The hardships which they have to undergo during inclement weather are better imagined than described&mdash;up to their knees in water with no protective clothing, rubber boots or anything of that kind. Over and above that there is the problem which they have to face of trying to raise families on a wage of 64/- a week, the average wage now paid.  As I indicated, if we are to <Col N="193" /> tackle the question of reafforestation in a serious manner and if our policy in this connection is to be something more than just an excuse, we shall have to approach it, not alone from the viewpoint of the present policy so as to ensure that a far greater acreage is planted each year, but we shall have to tackle it from the very essential human point of view, that is, the needs of the man who must carry out the forestry policy.  We, on our part, must have consideration for the need that exists for bringing into being large-scale afforestation, but the primary consideration for the man who has to do the work, that is, planting the trees, is how he is going to live in the way that he should live and he has not yet got that opportunity.  He did not get an opportunity while the last Government was in office of living fully as he should live, because the wages were inadequate and he is not getting it now.</P>
      <P>No person who knows anything about the problem of the cost of living will suggest that a worker can live as he should live on 64/- a week, much less rear a family.  It has often puzzled me, moving around as I do amongst these men and seeing many of them with large families, how they exist.  The only conclusion I can come to is that someone is suffering, and in such cases where there is want the children are always the last to suffer.  The parents, naturally, provide for the children first.  Many of these men have to go long distances to their work, in some cases seven and eight miles.  They have to climb up the bare sides of mountains in the worst of weather, with little to eat for their breakfast, perhaps a cup of tea and a couple of slices of bread, with the same for their luncheon, and then return home at 7 or 7.30 at night after their day's work. If that sort of existence is deemed to be good enough for the rural workers of this country, then I say it is a disgraceful thing for anybody to accept that as being correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These forestry workers have always been overlooked.  Sufficient attention has never been given to them or to their problems because of the fact that they operate in remote rural areas <Col N="194" /> far from the public eye.  They have become the forgotten workers of this country.  There are approximately 5,000 or 6,000 such men.  I want to try to get the Minister to develop a a keener appreciation of the problems which these men have so that we may get a greater degree of satisfaction amongst them.  There is dissatisfaction, so far as the wages and working conditions of these men are concerned, in every forest and in every nursery in the country.  Some Deputies, in the course of discussions in this House, would seem to create the impression that dissatisfaction amongst workers is something that is created by people who go around the country for the purpose of raising their minds.  I wonder have those Deputies any appreciation at all of the position which exists?  Far from that being the case, the position is that you will find amongst forestry workers, whether they belong to a trade union or not, or whether they have ever been influenced by a trade union or not, the most complete and absolute dissatisfaction with their lot.  That is not a healthy condition of affairs.  It is not a condition of affairs which is going to bring fruitful results from any point of view.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that these workers' wages have been almost doubled since before the war.  What they were paid before the war was a coolie's wage&mdash; nothing more&mdash;just sufficient for them to keep the spark of life in their bodies. What they are being paid now, when you take into consideration how living costs have increased during the war years, is not much better.  In view of the fact that workers in cities and towns engaged in occupations of relatively far less importance than this particular job of reafforestation are earning 50, 60 and 70 per cent. more than these men, the time surely has come when their wages should be brought into conformity with their needs.</P>
    <P>I think it is very much more important that men on a job such as this should be adequately paid than that we should be endeavouring to establish with other countries, some of which we do not even trade with, diplomatic connections.  We are expending moneys <Col N="195" /> on every form of human activity and, in some cases, we are expending them without very much regard to economy. Not alone has this Government done that, but the previous Government did it also.  When, however, it comes to a question of these men getting a few shillings a week more we are always told&mdash;we were told it by Fianna Fáil and would appear to be told the same now&mdash;that the money is not there to pay them.  It is a question of finance. Surely, there are greater considerations than finance.  We have got to have some recognition of the needs of the ordinary human beings whom we employ, or have we just got to accept the position that while, on the one hand, we have State employees enjoying excellent conditions&mdash;relatively good wages and working a far shorter working day and in very much more congenial surroundings&mdash;there must be one law for that section of the community, and another law for the unfortunate forestry worker?  How can that be justified?  What standards are we applying when we accept that condition of affairs tacity?  Does it not seem to follow that such a condition of affairs arises purely from the fact that the forestry workers have been so helpless that they have been unable to bargain effectively as other workers have been by virtue of the fact that they are scattered through the country and are in remote rural areas, and that advantage is being taken of that?</P>
    <P>I want again to try to get the Minister to see that pious expressions of sympathy for the forestry workers are not sufficient.  There should be, and there must be, steps taken to make forestry work attractive from the point of view of the economic good that will accrue to those engaged on it.  I asked the Minister during the course of the year for details as to the wages and working conditions of forestry workers and for a copy of the regulations which govern these wages and conditions.  I was given to understand that it is a confidential document.  What is the reason for that kind of attitude on the part of the Department of Lands? Surely, a member of the House is entitled to know under what conditions his constituents are working, and <Col N="196" /> entitled to get all the details that are available to the Minister in an issue of this kind.  I should like the Minister to indicate the reason for that particular attitude.  Is it just one more example of the attitude of mind of the officials of the Forestry Department? If it is, it is something which should not be tolerated for a moment, and I want to protest against it.  I want to ask the Minister also whether Deputies are entitled to visit State forests or nurseries in their constituencies, to see what is being done in them, to see the conditions under which the men are working, or must they be beholden to any of the officials of the Department for permission to do so?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, I regret that Deputies do not go to see the State forests and nurseries often enough.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be of interest to the Minister to know that I have been informed that I can only visit the State forests in my constituency with the permission of the officials of his Department and under no other circumstances. That, I think, is an abrogation of the ordinary rights of Deputies. So far as my constituency is concerned, there are about 14 forestry workers employed in it.  There are many more, of course, in different parts of the country.</P>
      <P>One of the problems which arise from time to time in County Dublin at any rate, is that of forest fires.  It is not an uncommon thing to see pretty extensive fires occurring on the Dublin Mountains.  In that connection, I think that inadequate precautions are taken against the activities of the holiday-makers and trippers who visit the Pine Forest.  I think that insufficient precautions are taken to protect the forests in that area.  It would be a good thing if additional men were employed in the warm summer days for fire-watching and if more notices were displayed warning of the dangers attendant upon carelessness by campers and so on.  Undoubtedly, when forest fires occur, very great damage is done and the work of years can be reduced to nothing by carelessness in these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said practically all that can <Col N="197" /> be said, particularly in regard to the question which I consider to be the most important of all, namely, the treatment of the forestry workers.  I should like the Minister to say what is going to be done for them, whether or not they can expect any improvement in or amelioration of their conditions, because upon his intimation of what is going to be done will depend a great deal.  Many workers employed by the Forestry Department are feeling that there is no future for them here and that they would be better off if they emigrated.  I do not want to see that happen, I am sure the Minister does not want to see it happen, and I suppose no Deputy does.  But men will not be content to accept bad wages and bad conditions <i>ad infinitum.</i>  Steps will have to be taken to put them in a better position to battle with lite. These steps have not yet been taken. The Minister has an opportunity to do what has never been done before, that is to give the forestry workers a fair deal.  I trust that he will grasp that opportunity with both hands and that we will not be disappointed with the steps he will take in regard to this matter.  I hope that the coming year will show some progress in this matter and that some progress will be achieved, not in 12 or six months, but in a very short time.</P>

      <P>I have listened to Deputy Dunne talking about the forestry workers.  I thought that, as a result of the Government being now controlled by Labour, something worth while would have been done for these workers.  I agree with every point which the Deputy has made regarding these workers, while I disagree with him in a lot of other things.  I believe that the State should be a model employer. Notwithstanding all the statements made against us when we were the Government, the only improvement in the conditions that the forestry workers and the agricultural workers got was under that very much despised Act, the Agricultural Wages Act of 1936, which first gave them the right to demand a minimum wage.  One point of view has been very prevalent in recent years, and that is that the wages of forestry workers should be based on <Col N="198" /> the wages of agricultural workers in the different areas.  The inter-Party Government and the Labour representatives have failed to improve on that condition even under more favourable conditions than we had.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The position has not been improved.  We laid down the groundwork and we were expecting that, step by step, that position would be improved year by year as economic circumstances permitted.  As I said, the State should be a model employer and should not allow these things to be governed by local conditions.  That, of course, is a personal view.  It could possibly be argued that the State is competing with ordinary local employers, but forestry workers definitely have a harder job than the ordinary worker.  They have to leave their homes at an early hour in the morning, and work in exposed positions on the mountainside.  Now that we have an inter-Party Government, supported by the archangels of the workers, something definite should be done in regard to these forestry workers.  No matter how you reason it out, I do not think it can be said that the work of forestry workers in any area can be compared with men working in the lowlands.  If allowance were made for the length of time it takes them to get to the top of the mountain from the roadside, or if they could be supplied with protective clothing or some such extra consideration, it would encourage these men and they would feel that they are State servants.  This is a Christian State, and we ought to set a headline in our treatment of these men.  I need hardly say that in bettering their conditions we would be doing something worth while.  We on this side of the House did our best in that respect during our term of office, and we had a very long road to travel.</P>

I hope the Minister and his Department will agree that it is about time something reasonable was done for those workers, and that the hardships they have to undergo demand immediate attention.

There has been much talk about increasing the acreage of forestry in this country.

      <P>I wonder if this is another of their fairy tales.  The fairy tales were so many and so varied that it is no harm to accuse the inter-Party Government and to say that this is another of their big fairy tales.  Time has proved that they knew nothing about reafforestation when they pledged themselves, before the election, to take thousands and thousands of acres of the land of this country and to plant them overnight.  They neglected to take into consideration the question of the acquisition of land apart altogether from the suitability of the land and the problem of procuring young trees. They were just the usual wild statements made from the platform in order <Col N="200" /> to buy the votes of the people at any price.  That is the type of thing the people of Ireland listened to, and the trouble is that there was nothing whatsoever constructive about it.  I have seen some of the young trees or plants which were sown on the mountainsides as a result of the mad rush by the inter-Party Government to try to beat our programme &mdash; little tree plants that were not more than one or two inches long.</P>

      <P>I suppose it is very fair to say that they were second best in that respect.  I would point out, however, to the members of the House that the Minister has not improved one iota on the sound policy in regard to reafforestation that was carried out by our Party under our able and honourable Minister for Lands, Deputy Moylan.  When the Minister was on the Opposition Benches he was very critical of the progress made in regard to reafforestation but, like a lot more, when he found himself in charge of the administration of that Department he discovered that our policy was sound and practical and that we had taken every aspect of the matter into consideration. We took the long national viewpoint and we did not make any idle promises just for the sake of political expediency.  We took the long view in the interests of the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not, for the sake of political expediency, give a return for imaginary acres that were planted.  Our aim was to ensure that the good, sound, practical plans we devised would be put into effect.  If, by any chance, there was a question of taking <Col N="202" /> over some of the mountain rights of small farmers which, in hundreds of thousands of cases, represented their means of livelihood, we did so in a democratic way and with due consideration for the rights of the individual as enshrined in our Constitution.  It is generally realised now that the only advance that can or will be made in regard to reafforestation will be on the basis of the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government.  The Minister seems to derive much amusement from my remarks but I am telling him nothing but the truth.</P>
      <P>On the general question of reafforestation I should like to say that, as a man who was born and reared on the land, I am and always have been a strong advocate of shelter belts.  I am convinced that the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Lands could do a great deal to encourage small farmers and large farmers alike to devote a small portion of their land to shelter belts.  I feel that a good deal could be done through the schools to encourage a civic spirit amongst the children, especially in the rural areas.  There should be, for instance, a tree-planting day for the children.  The children of one school might plant 20 trees in a particular plot, even once a year.  That, I feel, would encourage children to become civic minded and to like trees and grow trees and take an interest in nature as a whole.  That was an aspect of reafforestation that I had in mind for quite a long time.  As a youngster I used to like planting trees and shrubs. I feel that type of thing could be developed through the country to a greater extent.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It would encourage the growing of trees, anyway.  The Deputy is very kind in putting me on the right track.  We found ourselves, during the emergency, cutting down a number of our plantations.  That work was really very essential.  It suited our purposes very well at the time, when fuel and other things were scarce. I know that the Department is encouraging landowners and others, in <Col N="203" /> every area where trees were cut down, to replant.  The Forestry Department carried out its job during the emergency in a judicious manner.  The Department tried to be reasonable both to the State and to the people who wanted the fuel.</P>
      <P>Replanting on a wide scale should be encouraged, because we do not know when we may have another emergency. In conjunction with all the work that is being carried out from a national point of view by the Forestry Department, if all our farmers could devote a bit of their land to the growing of some kind of trees, these would become, in the years ahead, an important national asset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>So much has been said on this matter, one finds it difficult to avoid repetition.  I want to put briefly before the House my view of the reactionary policy that is still being pursued by the Department with respect to proper conditions of employment. Early in January of this year, I, in my capacity as a trade union representative, participated in a conference lasting several hours.  It was an inter-departmental committee conference on wages and conditions of employment. Except for an improvement which has been made in the rate of wages of forestry workers, I am not aware that any improvement of a social character has yet been effected.  Slavish conditions have been far too long in operation in this country, even since we secured the right to regulate our own affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that the old traditions, that so much sacrifice was made here to get rid of, still remain in the Minister's Department in regard to the day-to-day life of the ordinary workers employed by that Department.  I cannot understand why, in this country, which is almost 100 per cent.  Catholic, the workers employed in the Forestry Department are denied the right to attend Mass.  If they do attend Mass, there is a penalty imposed upon them, and this appears in the form of a deduction from their wages.  I know that the trade union with which I happen to be associated referred, in a <Col N="204" /> recent communication, to this matter. In a way, it is a small matter, but in another sense it is a very big one.</P>
    <P>I quite agree with Deputy Burke that the State ought to show that it is a model employer.  I regret that Deputy Burke did not stress that more since he came into the House.  Perhaps if he and others did, a lot could have been achieved in that connection long before this afternoon.  My attitude in this House always has been to give credit where credit is due.  When I was sitting on the opposite side of the House, I heard no speech from this side except one of thanks to, and praise of, the particular Minister of the day for all he had done.  From the Opposition Benches, I on occasion, have complimented Ministers when they deserved it.  Now, though I am on the Government Benches, I cannot fully compliment the Minister.  Perhaps in the matter of wages he has made one move, but I am not prepared to give him all the praise I would like to until a good many or all of certain long-overdue improvements are effected.</P>
    <P>I might say, in passing, that in regard to trade unions &mdash; I hope I am wrong &mdash; judging from the nature of the correspondence that has taken place between a particular trade union and the Minister's Department, it would seem that there is not a warm spot in the heart of the Minister's Department for the trade union outlook, as one might call it.  The workers in this country are as well entitled to protection as anybody else; indeed, they are more entitled, because it is enshrined in the Constitution, and by law they are protected.  I hope the Minister will not allow himself and his Department to be led into the trap into which some private employers have fallen, of interfering with the constitutional rights of employees, particularly those of the lower grade.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that has come to my notice in relation to forestry employment.  The men are sometimes asked in the afternoon, at about three or four o'clock, to move to another part of the works.  It may be two or three miles away, and these men are expected to use their own <Col N="205" /> bicycles to carry tools and other equipment.  It is hardship enough for workers to have to provide themselves with bicycles to get to their work and to their homes, without having to use the bicycles for the conveyance of tool boxes and other equipment.  There ought to be some other way of transporting these implements.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is out of order for every Deputy to emphasise that a further effort ought to be made to improve the wages and the conditions of forestry workers, in the light of present-day money values.  I am glad that the Minister has broken away from the rather unfortunate policy which was pursued over a number of years of comparing one class of worker with another, or taking the worker employed by the private employer at agricultural work and pinning the wages of State employees down to the miserable minimum rate he receives. I am glad that has been abandoned, and I hope that a greater sense of justice will continue to prevail in regard to rates of wages.  I quite agree that a substantial improvement has been brought about since the beginning of this financial year, but, apart from money, there is a good deal of improvement to be brought about in the social life of the forestry worker, without the imposition of any great cost on the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about give and take and we in the trade union movement are very anxious to see co-operation and a spirit of give and take.  I have, personally, been a life-long advocate of it, but what we very often find is that so far as the employer is concerned it is a matter of take all and of expecting the worker to give every time the employer feels he ought to give.  I feel also that those in charge of forestry workers might well in many cases adopt a more humane and friendly attitude towards the men. Anything in the nature of military-sounding orders will not &ldquo;wash&rdquo;. These men have an interest in the work, and a good deal more could be secured in the way of results if those in charge of them would adopt a kinder attitude.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will continue to <Col N="206" /> give attention to the representations of the trade union catering for these men.  The Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, to my own personal knowledge, have been engaged in quite a lot of correspondence with regard to them and we are anxious to see peace in a very important work.  We realise the many values which this work has. There are, of course, mixed views with regard to it from the expert angle, but there is no doubt that it has great value apart from its commercial value, and many people believe that this island country of ours should be restored at least to the position it occupied some years ago in the matter of afforestation.  There was a great clearing out of timber during the emergency, and, in order to get this timber replaced and to get everybody enthusiastic in the matter, it is absolutely essential that there should be a happy atmosphere on the job.  I conclude by expressing the hope that the Minister will continue his efforts to make the life of the forestry worker worth living.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should feel very happy inasmuch as every Deputy who has spoken seems anxious to help him in his work by every means in his power.  The Minister can rest assured of the co-operation of practically all Deputies in the very important national work he has in hands at the moment.  It is a good thing that we should have a discussion on forestry not merely once a year but more frequently because there has been, in my opinion, a good deal of, perhaps, foolish thinking on the part of certain people who, while very enthusiastic, do not seem to possess the necessary knowledge to give sound advice to those responsible.  We are living, as is well known, in a country which is the most treeless in Europe, with the possible exception of Iceland, and everybody who loves trees will naturally be anxious to see forestry developed to the utmost possible extent and as speedily as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a good thing that the Minister is enthusiastic in that regard.  I dare say it is better to be optimistic than pessimistic, but in order to achieve <Col N="207" /> success the Minister will need to satisfy himself, in the first instance, that he will have the goodwill of the people living in any locality in which it is proposed to establish a forestry centre, because we all know how very easy it is for any evilly-disposed person to undo the very valuable work done by the Department over a long number of years.  The first essential, where he is establishing a new forestry centre, is to secure the goodwill of the people and particularly the smallholders who have grazing rights.  These rights may perhaps not be of much value in the eyes of people living outside the area, but to those living on small cramped holdings, these freedoms which are available to them for summer grazing are of vital importance to their economy and it is essential that, where these rights are being upset by the Department in connection with forestry operations, they should be compensated adequately, either by the provision of additional land, where possible, or otherwise.</P>
    <P>There is another section with whom the Minister is more directly concerned and whose goodwill and co-operation he will have to ensure also.  In addition to those for whom Deputies have already spoken, there is a section of employees, forestry foremen and foresters, employed mainly in a temporary capacity.  As these men have taken up this occupation and made it their means of livelihood and as forestry is likely to go on long after most of us are in the clay, the Minister would do well to examine the position of these temporary employees with a view to having them established, because, as he knows well, unless there is satisfaction amongst all the employees, from the ordinary labourers doing the actual spadework to those in charge, he will not get the results he hopes to achieve.</P>
    <P>There is a large area of what might be described as non-arable land, particularly along the western seaboard, and the Minister would do well to have some of these areas examined, with a view to having experimental plantations, even on a small scale, established there to show whether it is <Col N="208" /> possible to grow timber on certain lands.  There are advocates for and against.  Some people think that timber can be grown anywhere, even on mountain tops.  Others think that timber will grow only on arable land. I would like the Minister to carry out experimental plantations in certain selected areas where, in the opinion of the experts, there would be reasonable hope of success and, after a few years, he and the Department would be in a position to expand the experiments if it were found that they afforded reasonable prospects of success.</P>
    <P>I would also like, if possible, to have all plantations, whether of forests or shelter belts, under the control of one Department.  If the Minister could secure the co-operation of the farming community and each farmer could be induced to plant the waste portions of his land, if he could get 10,000 or 20,000 farmers planting even half an acre each, that would add considerably to the total area under timber.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies have made reference to the clearances that have taken place during the two wars.  I hope that the Minister will see to it that everybody who was given a permit to cut timber will, in due course, replace that timber and will plant a considerably larger number of trees than were cut down.  I heard one Deputy state that the benefits of afforestation may not be apparent during our lifetime.  I do not believe that we will have to wait a lifetime to achieve the benefits of afforestation.  Trees grow pretty rapidly and, after 20 years, if not sooner, there will be the clearances which will be of benefit.  After ten years, or even as short a time as eight years, there will be improvement in the landscape by afforestation.  It is much more pleasant to see forests growing than to see a bare patch on the mountainside.</P>
    <P>I would also like the Minister to experiment with some of those areas that perhaps may not be considered the most suitable.  As we are spending such a large amount of money on reclamation or rehabilitation of land some of that money should be devoted to experiments with a view to having <Col N="209" /> land or mountain which has hitherto been unplantable brought to a stage at which trees could be planted.  If that were done on a small experimental scale at first, in the course of a few years the Department would have experience which would enable them to expand and perhaps plant a much larger area than is at present contemplated.</P>

      <P>This is not an Estimate upon which there can be much political or Party strife.  The ex-Minister for Lands set a good example in approaching this Estimate in a very constructive way.  This is the Estimate, above all others, in regard to which we should think in terms of construction, reconstruction and future development.  It is well that the Minister has made a fairly comprehensive survey of all the plantable land in the Twenty-Six Counties.  While it may not be complete in detail, that survey gives a general idea of the amount of land that is capable of being planted and the amount of land that we should aim at planting in the shortest possible time.</P>
      <P>We all know the difficulties that must be faced.  First of all, there is the difficulty of acquisition.  All land belongs to somebody.  There is not a piece of land in the Twenty-Six Counties to which somebody does not claim ownership.  It has not been the policy of the Department in the past and it is not their policy at present or for the future to acquire land compulsorily. The general aim is to secure agreement on the part of the owners for the acquisition of land for planting by the Forestry Department.  Practically all of the land that is suitable for planting is of very low agricultural value.  Many people might claim that equal benefits would be conferred upon the nation by using this land for rough grazing for sheep, but the general consensus of opinion now is that the return from afforestation, if it is properly planted, would be greater. The margin is not very wide between the two types of production but the balance is certainly in favour of afforestation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be a good idea if the Minister <Col N="210" /> would give us, when he is replying, fairly exact figures of the actual cost of planting an average acre of suitable land and the period of time which it would take before that crop of timber would be completely harvested, and the gross value of that timber when marketed.  We would then see exactly in terms of pounds, shillings and pence the annual profit to the nation from afforestation.  I know that this is not a work the value of which can be assessed exactly in terms of pounds, shillings and pence.  I know that there is advantage by way of improvement in climate and general agricultural conditions by the provision of shelter belts on hills and waste land. Therefore, while afforestation has all those advantages, in addition it would be no harm for us to know, as ordinary business people, the actual value in money of the acreage which it is required to plant.</P>
    <P>The Minister has estimated that there are 1,200,000 acres suitable for planting.  I take it that that estimate is, in most cases, of waste land on hillsides, land above a certain altitude. We all know also that we have a fairly large acreage of land which is wet or waterlogged, cutaway bog and the type of land which, while it may be drainable, is not dry land at present. The Minister may have to decide with the Minister for Agriculture whether this type of land should be reclaimed for agriculture or for afforestation purposes. I think the Minister will agree with me that the cost of reclaiming this land for agricultural purposes would be immeasurably greater than the cost of reclaiming it for forestry purposes.  I have inspected land which was drained under the rehabilitation scheme in County Wicklow.  It was not very low-lying, but it was wettish land, nevertheless.  It had been drained at enormous expense by the Department of Agriculture, and I was wondering whether it might not be more advantageous to have planted that land.  It would only require a few open drains instead of the covered drains required to make it into agricultural land.  It is a matter on which we must have very expert advice as to whether we can find suitable commercial timber <Col N="211" /> which will grow on that type of land and be of real value to the country.</P>
    <P>When we consider that we are setting out to plant large areas of forest, upwards of 1,000,000 acres, in the shortest space of time which is humanly possible having regard to all the difficulties and obstacles that must be overcome, we must remember that we are setting out to maintain a permanent productive organisation, the Forestry Department. For that reason we must give very considerable attention to the personnel of that organisation and in my opinion the key-men in the Forestry Department are trained foresters who are for the most part young men who have entered the service.  I have met quite a number of them and they are men whom anybody would be proud to meet, men keen on their work and zealous to forward the work of planting.  They are men who have acquired a good education and a good technical training and they have entered the service by the ordinary method of competitive examination. Then they do a course of training in the forestry school and after that they are sent out to do this important work throughout the country. Each forester has under his charge a considerable area of land and a considerable number of men and he has very heavy responsibilities to carry.  On him depend the things which were mentioned by Deputy Dunne and Deputy Pattison, that is, the good relations between the ordinary workers and the Department.  On those men depend to a great extent the amount of work which is done and the efficiency with which it is carried out.  Generally speaking I think that the average Irish worker is a good worker and all he requires is capable and efficient leadership. If he is given that he will give a good return, probably a better return than workers in any other country in the world.  It is these foresters who give that leadership and supervision to the ordinary worker.  I am told that each forester has to control the expenditure of £5,000 a year which is a fairly substantial responsibility on a young man.  He has to prepare the whole programme of work within his unit, prepare estimates of labour and expenditure, <Col N="212" /> supervise and pay staff and look after sales of firewood and other forestry produce.  In addition to that, I understand, each forester is responsible for his area at all times.  Like a good police officer he is never off duty.</P>
    <P>In the case of fire or any other damage to the plantation he must be on the spot to deal with it, and that is also a substantial responsibility.  It is responsibility that should carry with it not only fair remuneration but also a certain measure of security, but I understand that foresters are not established officers of the Forestry Department.  They are simply temporary officers working from year to year without established pension rights.  When we have made up our minds that afforestation will go on for years, and that it will be productive, and that when we reach the 1,000,000 acres we have in mind, probably many more acres will come on the market to be dealt with and replanted, we can look on the work as permanent national work that will go on indefinitely. For that reason if any civil servant should be established and have pension rights these men who control and supervise afforestation should have these conditions.  I understand that men in the same classification in Britain, and even in Northern Ireland, are established officers.  Another point is that more than any other civil servant they actually produce the means to pay their pensions in visible physical assets.  Each forester controls and plants about 100 acres per year, and by the time a young man starting on that work reaches pension age, the produce of his area and of his years of work will be coming on the market.</P>
    <P>I want also to support the case made with regard to the ordinary forestry workers.  They are engaged in a difficult, strenuous work.  I have been a manual worker for most of my years, and will not acknowledge that there is any undue hardship in manual work in the open air.  It is strenuous work, work for a hardy, healthy man, but it has many advantages in addition to the disadvantages.  Many of the disadvantages could be overcome by care and thought on the part of those in charge. <Col N="213" /> To begin with, the forestry workers have to travel a long distance to their work.  The permanent solution of that problem is to bring the workers' houses nearer to the work.  In his introductory statement, the Minister said the Department is planning the building of houses for the forestry workers. That should be pushed forward.  It may be said it is the duty of local authorities, but there is a special duty on the Forestry Department to provide housing accommodation for its workers.  They have the land and they know exactly where the men are required.  In ordinary housing development, a man applies for a house in a certain place, and in due course it is built for him on that site.  That is a haphazard way of dealing with this problem.  The Forestry Department require a certain number of men in a certain area, and it is their duty, in addition to planting trees, to plant the workers convenient to the work.</P>
    <P>I could give instances of that.  In County Wicklow, in the great valley of Aughavannagh, there is a very sparse population at present, yet there are, I suppose, thousands of acres of plantation all around.  That would be an ideal site for a model village for forestry workers built by the Forestry Department.  It is not enough to build a house here and there.  If you bring the workers nearer the work you must provide some of the ordinary amenities which a worker enjoys in the smallest villages and towns.  You must build a group of houses where they would have the usual amenities of any established village, and the Minister should be thinking along those lines.  It is wholly undesirable to denude large portions of the country of the human population in order to achieve the ideal of afforestation.  If you remove smallholders who own the mountain lands, you must replace them by some other type of worker, and the only type you can put there is the forestry worker.  For that reason, the Minister should push very hard to secure the erection by his Department of suitable housing for those workers in isolated areas.  That would remove some of the grievances they have in having to travel long distances.</P>
    <P>In the same way, it should be possible <Col N="214" /> to have here and there for adverse weather a few portable shelters where men could take cover in case of really severe weather during their work.  Also, in the very cold or wet weather, these shelters would be useful for men taking their midday meal.  Small comforts of that kind supplied to the men thoughtfully would go a long way to win their wholehearted confidence and make them feel that the Forestry Department was not a cold, impersonal machine, determined to extract the maximum from the men and give the minimum in exchange.</P>
    <P>As a manual worker accustomed to working in the fields, I had a certain amount of sympathy with Deputy Dunne when he mentioned the question of an evening meal.  We all know that matter might not receive very sympathetic consideration from the ordinary higher civil servant who thinks in terms of working from 9 to 5 and going home to his evening meal. The forestry worker continues on some days to 6 p.m. and then may have to travel a considerable distance home. That means that from 1 p.m. till 7 p.m. there would be no refreshment of any kind.  That is an unduly long period. Everyone knows the kind of appetite you can acquire when working on an open hillside.  That problem needs to be thoughtfully and sympathetically considered.  No one suggests there should be a long break in which men would go away to cook a meal, as that would mean too great a loss of time. It should be possible to provide a small, light evening tea which would be very much appreciated.  There may be difficulties, but I am sure the Minister would find ways of getting over them. These are small matters, but they would create between the men working on the hills and the Department that spirit of co-operation and goodwill which is essential to work of national development.</P>
    <P>I hope the legislation we enacted this year for the acquisition of land will help the Minister, particularly in the case of mixed farms where there is a considerable amount suitable for agriculture and a considerable amount suitable for afforestation.  I had personal <Col N="215" /> experience of a fairly large farm offered to the Department and which they were anxious to acquire but, because it was more than 50 per cent. agricultural land, they could not acquire it at the ordinary price payable for forestry land.  They had to wait for the Land Commission to decide to acquire that particular holding, and in the course of the departmental delays the owner of the farm found a better buyer and sold the land, with the result that the Forestry Department was at the loss of it.  If some means could be found to speed up the acquisition of such holdings, it would be possible for the Forestry Department to utilise to great advantage more than half of such a holding.  Furthermore, the Land Commission could utilise the other half for their purposes, for the relief of congestion or the provision of holdings for migrants.  These delays should be overcome.  It is very difficult to find a holding which does not contain some agricultural land.  There should be some departmental method of getting over the difficulty of having to acquire agricultural land, in addition to mountain land, and to rearrange that as between the Forestry Division and the Land Commission proper with a view to utilising portion for the provision of exchange holdings for those who are giving up their land for planting.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in the Estimate for the grant of a sum of £10 to farmers who plant trees on their own lands. The Minister would not appear to be very optimistic in this particular direction since the amount he has set aside for that purpose is very small.  I do not think he has any reason to be optimistic.  I do not think farmers at the moment have any desire to avail of these grants to any considerable extent.  One reason why the grants are not availed of to the extent the Minister would like is that they are too small to permit of the land planted being properly fenced; £10 will only go a very small distance towards fencing. I do not ask the Minister to increase the grant but I do suggest to him that he should introduce a loan scheme under which the farmer would be paid the full cost of both planting and fencing. <Col N="216" /> The loan could be made a charge on the actual acreage of trees planted. It should not be repayable in yearly instalments.  It should be repayable when the trees mature.  I think a good many farmers would avail of such a scheme.  They would have the pleasure of seeing their farms improved with plantations and proper fences.  The value of the farm would be enhanced. The farmer might not himself reap the benefit since the trees would be mortgaged to the Department of Lands but he would own the land upon which the trees grew, and he would have some scenic addition to his farm.  If, at the end of the time it took the trees to reach maturity, there was any surplus, that surplus would go to the farmer. At any time he could, of course, repay the mortgage and do what he liked with the timber.  I think a scheme along those lines would result in a much larger area being planted.</P>
    <P>It may be said that there would be little use in asking a farmer to undertake this work on a large scale without expert advice and instruction.  I understand that a large number of additional agricultural instructors are about to be appointed.  Surely these could be given a course in afforestation so that they would be competent to advise farmers in the future.  A great deal of valuable work could be done under such a scheme.  Deputy O'Grady pointed out that if 20,000 farmers planted half an acre each a considerable acreage of afforestation could be achieved.  I think that is a rather modest estimate.  I can quite visualise 100,000 acres planted under a scheme such as I have outlined, over the next five or six years.  It would be a valuable addition to the work being done by the Forestry Division itself.  In most farms there are small areas which are unsuitable for agricultural purposes, but which would be quite suitable for afforestation.  The support of local organisations, such as Macra na Feirme and Muintir na Tíre, could be enlisted and a tremendous amount of work could be done along the lines I have suggested.  I do not think we should be disheartened because the farmers have not applied for the £10 grant to the extent that <Col N="217" /> was anticipated.  I think it would be a good idea to discuss this matter with the farmers themselves, and with the organisations that I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>There is one small point I would like to raise with regard to the actual plantations already in existence.  I think the divisions between the plantations are not sufficient to afford adequate protection should fire break out.  I know that we have not experienced any conflagrations here to the same extent as they have been experienced on the Continent, but it might be a good idea if we took precautions in advance to check the spread of fire should a conflagration break out. We should, therefore, be on our guard in time.  It would be a terrible disaster if many thousands of acres of trees were completely destroyed by reason of the fact that we might have, as we had in the past, an exceptionally dry summer.  While one may talk of public opinion, civic spirit and all these things, a fire will sometimes occur accidentally without any wilful neglect on the part of anybody.  It could be brought about in a variety of ways, and it would be a terrible thing if the whole community were to lose thousands of pounds' worth of valuable timber by reason of the absence of adequate precautions.  Various precautions will suggest themselves to the Department, but I think wider spacing between the trees in plantations or wider passages between them would be desirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement that surprised me most in this debate was that little interest is taken in this question of afforestation.  I imagine that there is hardly any economic question that has been so much before our people for so long a period.  I listened very carefully to the arguments that were put forward here and I think I could parallel every one of the statements made with regard to the advantages of afforestation by statements made throughout the country at least 30 years ago.  There is nobody who thinks at all in terms of national wealth, improving the national estate and developing the national resources who at some stage or another will not come to the question <Col N="218" /> of afforestation.  If he has lived any reasonable length of time he will have paid very little attention to public affairs indeed if he has not been told very many times that there are probably few countries in the world so treeless as ours, and that, from every point of view, we should try to get back to a reasonable proportion of forests in this country.</P>
      <P>You have the economic question, social questions and so on, all bound up with this subject.  Suppose we leave the question of the commercial forests and their value to the end, we might look at the matter for the moment from a broader point of view.  There is the scenic value to the country generally of our woodlands.  Anybody who has lived to middle age must be aware that there has been considerable deterioration in the country from that point of view.  That is due to the fact that the estate lands, which were fairly well planted with woodlands, have been distributed and that the ordinary farmer looks upon a tree on his land as something of a pest.  Most of us remember the trees that grew by the fences.  Anybody who has had experience of working in the fields knows of the damage caused by these trees and the farmer naturally desired to get rid of them.  Again, the trees that were planted in the fields and dotted the lawns on these estates, have also been taken away since the estates were divided.  There has been, therefore, on account of the division of land, a considerable destruction of our ordinary woodlands.  It is vain to think of the restoration of anything of that sort but we ought to try as far as we can to do what we can, consistent with our present policy of the division of these lands, to restore some of the woodlands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only step taken to promote private planting, so far as I know, was the Minister's scheme providing for grants of £10.  That scheme has not been attended with favourable results. I think we ought to try to make a scheme of that sort workable.  If £10 per acre was not so very attractive some years ago, and if that were regarded as the minimum sum necessary to get trees planted by the individual farmer then, it is quite <Col N="219" /> obvious that that sum is altogether inadequate now.  Has the Minister any plan to get the individual farmer to plant portions of his land which are regarded as more suitable for growing trees than for any other purpose, in addition to any planting that might be done in the way of shelter belts?  If the scheme is to be of any value, it seems to me the amount will have to be increased.  We know that the cost of fencing has increased considerably, and without fencing it would be merely so much wasted effort and money to plant trees.  When fencing has to be provided for, forestry becomes fairly expensive.  It is on account of that expense that the Department itself, in dealing with State forests, will not take very small areas for plantation, as they are regarded as uneconomic. Our first effort should be to get as many trees as possible planted by private individuals.  That is not the State forestry scheme as such, but it is part of the whole question of getting a reasonable amount of woodland in the country.</P>
    <P>Passing away from that, and coming to the question of the planting of commercial timber in State forests proper, the Minister has tried to create the impression that no attention was paid to this matter at all until he came into office.  Of course, that is ridiculous; the figures prove quite the contrary. From 1922 on to 1932 there was an average yearly plantation of something like 2,700 acres &mdash; it was under the 3,000-mark.  Fianna Fáil came into office in 1932.  Part of its programme was to develop afforestation, to get ahead and try to secure as large an acreage of suitable land as was possible and plant it with commercial timber as quickly as possible.  The figures again show what was done. The figures went up progressively, year by year, from less than 3,000 acres, to 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000, until it reached the 7,600-mark, which was the figure just before the war.  There were well over 7,000 acres planted in three successive years.  I can speak with some knowledge of this matter, because every Minister who had been in charge of the Department since we came into office was, I am <Col N="220" /> sure, annoyed more than once by the persistent demands I made for even greater progress.</P>
    <P>One has, however, to be reasonable in these things.  You cannot get good work done if that work has not been properly prepared.  We had 7,600 acres when the war came.  During the war we had a shortage of fencing material, a shortage of tools, a shortage of seeds and of other things.  Of course, Deputies say that we should have known that the war was coming and should have made full provision for all these things.  I am sometimes amused when I hear people talk like that, on the one hand, and then talk about the amount of turf that was left over at the end of the war as if we could have arranged to a nicety when the war would end so that the supplies we had would just go out when the war finished.  One might as well say that those who engage in war should arrange for its finish to coincide with the time when the cannon had fired its last round and the other weapons had ceased being serviceable.  That is, of course, all nonsense.  You cannot foresee definitely when war is coming and neither can you know exactly when it is going to end.</P>
    <P>It is my view, for instance, that at the present time &mdash; I do not want to digress, but to say parenthetically in regard to these arguments to which I have been referring &mdash; we are not making the preparation that we ought to be making in view of the dangers and the circumstances with which the country is faced.  But, to come back to the point I was on, Governments, in a situation like that, have to depend upon their judgment.  Now, we can be accused of not having foreseen that the war was coming, and of not having made ample provision in the way of sufficient wire netting, sufficient tools and sufficient seeds to keep up the advance from the 7,600 acres which we had reached before the war, and so continue the progress of some thousands of acres additional every year which had been obtained up to that particular time.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Deputy a question?  Will he indicate <Col N="221" /> who blamed the Deputy or his Party for not foreseeing the advent of war in that connection?  Can he give any instance of having been blamed by anybody for not foreseeing that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It was said by some Deputy during the course of this debate.  I cannot remember who.  I heard someone say it but I regarded it as being so absurd as to be really not worth taking notice of.  The point is that, by progressive stages, we had advanced from 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000 and up to 7,600 acres in the successive years up to the outbreak of war.  Now, when the war came we went back year by year from that figure of 7,600 acres until in the last year of the war we had only got 3,500 acres.  That was mainly due to the fact that the seeds and plants which have to be arranged for were not available.  The fact is that if you want to plant 10,000 acres of land with trees you must first sow the seeds.  The seeds have to be planted, the plants have to be planted out and transplanted, so that a period of from two to three years will intervene before your desire to plant trees can be accomplished, if you start at zero.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1946 we considered this whole question, and, as part of our post-war planning, we set up a subcommittee to develop our programme of afforestation. I got particulars from the Forestry Department.  I will give some of them to the House so that the situation, as it was in 1946, may be known. It will be helpful, I think, to do so, because it will enable us to get a sort of picture of the problem that is ahead of us.  Before I come to that, may I say that it seems to me the Minister is very foolish?  What has he gained by detracting from the work that we did?  From the official figures supplied to me, I find that 27,460 acres were planted between 1922 and 1932, and that between 1932 and 1939, 42,487 acres were planted.  That is to say, that during the period 1932 to 1939 over 6,000 acres were planted each year, while over the period 1932 to 1947 over 80,000 acres were planted.  That represents an average of well over 5,000 acres a year.  In view of these figures, there is no use in pretending that this <Col N="222" /> question was completely neglected.  It is a question to which a great deal of thought was given by successive Ministers.</P>
    <P>I come now to the position in 1946 as it was presented to me and to the subcommittee of the Cabinet that was examining this question with a view to proper planning for the post-war period.  The estimate that was presented to that subcommittee was that we had about 600,000 acres of forest, which would supply not merely existing needs but foreseeable needs.  It was said that about 100,000 acres would be required, in addition, for protective purposes, and I take it that most of these protective purposes were the ones suggested by Deputy Cogan. That meant that 700,000 acres were regarded as the amount that would be required.  We had already planted 115,000 acres, which were in State hands, and there were 85,000 acres of effective woods in private hands. Therefore, of the 700,000 acres which were required, there were about 200,000 acres already planted, leaving 500,000 acres to be planted &mdash; that is on the assumption that the estimate given was accurate.  Even though we can examine these things in terms of pounds, shillings and pence, as Deputy Cogan said, I still think that we ought to make liberal allowances, and so let us take the figure that I have given merely as a working figure.  I take it that the people who are advising the Minister were those who advised us.  I think if that advice was given to us, then it ought not to differ very much from the advice given to the Minister. We would like to hear about the changes and the reasons for them.  If the estimate was too low, let us hear the reason.  Why was the estimate given at that time too low?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy mean suitable acreage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That figure was not given to me.  The point was, what was the acreage in woodlands or in timber which would be sufficient to supply our ordinary needs?  Everybody knows that we want timber for housing.  We know, too, that if we had timber we could use it for pulping, and so try to secure <Col N="223" /> some independence with regard to our paper supplies.  If we had the raw materials in pulp, there is no reason why we should not develop a paper industry here and so make ourselves reasonably self-sufficing in that respect. Our whole object was to try not merely to have the industrial variety that is to be got from different uses of the land but, as far as possible, to supply our own fundamental needs.  We were told at that time that 500,000 new acres planted would meet our needs.  In this matter you have to think in the way of succession if it is not to be a question of a feast and a famine.  I have been told that during the election people were talking about planting 1,000,000 acres in five years.  The whole thing is absurd and nonsense.  Anyone who gives any thought to that would know that there is no sense in it.  If you did that, it would all mature about the same time and would have to be harvested about the same time, and then you would have, as I have said, this matter of a feast and a famine. You must arrange for a regular succession year after year, and in that way you will get in the amount of timber that you want roughly each year.  If you take 500,000 acres as the quantity, it will work out at a yearly planting of 10,000 acres.  The obvious thing, therefore, would be to plant that much, making provision of course for a little extra.  That would be a sort of minimum planting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We investigated the position in 1946 and we were informed that, with the position as it was then and with the possibility that in a year or two we would have sufficient supplies of seeds, tools and netting for fencing, we could hope, in a period of about three years, to advance to the 10,000 acres figure. That was indicated as being the figure which would, year after year, meet our requirements.  I do not recollect exactly the way the committee discussed the matter, but I do know that my attitude was that we had only got at the best before the war 7,600 acres. That was reduced during the war to 3,500 acres.  Therefore, there was no use in talking about a higher figure <Col N="224" /> than 10,000 acres until we got to the 10,000 acres.  Then, when we got to the 10,000 acres, we could review the situation.  Having got to the 10,000 acres, we could advance beyond that if we thought it desirable and if we could get the land.  The present Minister has not yet reached the 10,000 figure.  The factor which will ultimately determine the rate at which we can go is the rate at which we can acquire land.</P>
    <P>If, as has been suggested, the Minister is going to work on a 25,000 acres a year programme, we on this side of the House will not oppose it, provided the work is properly done.  There are two things which I think are completely improper.  One is to pretend that you can do something you know you cannot do and the other is to scamp the work, to do bad work.  When we had compulsory tillage one of the things which had to be watched was that people did not pretend to till when they were not tilling.</P>

      <P>We tried to see that they would not get away with it.  One reason why there was not more land division then was that Land Commission officials were employed as inspectors to see that that would not happen. We had to get people who knew their business to do the work.  However, we on this side of the House would support the Minister in getting as much land as properly afforested as he can.  We do not, however, want any deception.  We know that afforestation cannot be carried out by sudden expansion. You can go on by gradual expansion and by progressively improved expansion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The deception was to say that you could at once plant 25,000 acres, to pretend that you could plant 1,000,000 acres in four or five years, and also when the Minister said that there were only 3,000 acres planted yearly during our time.  That is positive deception.  We will support the Government in developing the <Col N="225" /> resources of the country, in trying to make this country more self-sufficient, and in this particular way we will help him.  If the Minister can get 25,000 acres planted yearly, nobody will be more pleased than we will be.  If he is to get 25,000 acres a year planted, as he says, the land must be acquired at a rate which will permit that to be done.  If you are going to plant 25,000 acres per year you should have a pool of land ready for it so that you will be able to look two or three years ahead. If you are not able to look ahead for two or three years, if you have not 50,000 or 70,000 acres on hand, it will be difficult to do good work.  For instance, we do not want young seedlings transplanted and have it then pretended that there has been planting. We want to see good work done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Our attitude in regard to borrowing money has been explained many times.  We are always prepared to borrow money provided it can be reproductive, and that we get back the money we spend. Take, for instance, forestry.  It was suggested that the value of some of the poor land was 25/- an acre.  The Minister is prepared to buy land at up to £8 an acre.  Suppose you forego £1 a year for 50 years, and that from what you forego you only expect some sort of gilt-edged return of about 5 per cent., in 50 years you will have to get from £200 to £300 per acre back.  If the Minister pays £8 an acre for land on the basis that it produces £8 per year, he will have to get back £1,600 per acre without any question of the extra money which will be spent in the preparation of the soil and in planting and subsequent care.  Therefore, from the purely narrow economic point of view one has to be very careful not to use land for afforestation which is valuable from the agricultural point of view.  Otherwise, you would need a tremendous return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="226" /> I should like the Minister to give us some figures, as was suggested by Deputy Cogan, even though we are not tied down absolutely to those figures and they only refer to the present situation.  We do not know what may happen in 29, 30, 40 or 50 years.  It should be possible, however, to make some guiding estimates as to the returns for the expenditure.  We know that there are vast areas in the world where they are ruthlessly destroying forests for the purpose of getting agricultural land, making clearings in order to make settlements.  That is a proof that trees in themselves in all situations are not more valuable than land on which other crops can be grown.  Therefore, if we are considering this from the economic point of view, and I think we must have the economic point of view in mind, we have to be careful not to encroach with our afforestation on lands that are cultivable and can produce agricultural produce.  If the Minister is right that there are 1,200,000 acres of land which are better suited for forestry than anything else &mdash; I do not know if he means that it is land really suited for forestry; it might be better used for forestry than for other purposes and yet not be much good for forestry, as trees need their proper land too &mdash; the point is that it would be important for him to tell us whether that is land that has been certified as being suitable for forestry&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and more suitable in the sense of being more profitable and economic.  If there is twice the amount of land available than the figure given to the Cabinet in 1946, then we ought to be able to meet our requirements without encroaching on land which could be used otherwise to better advantage.  We have, therefore, a problem for which there appears to be a solution.  On the other hand, it has been pointed out to me by successive Ministers that the chief difficulty is the getting of this land which is to be planted from families who have used it as their means of livelihood. It is quite obvious that we ought not simply to give a cash value to families such as these and then let them go. <Col N="227" /> If they wish to leave, all right, but it would be very much better for us to see that these families are somehow employed in connection with afforestation work.  I expect that it is the policy of the Minister and of his Department to try, as far as possible, to give the alternative livelihood through forestry to the people who, up to the present, have been using the land as sheep ranches.</P>

      <P>I would point out that that is much easier said than done. The worst about all these projects is that you hear people justifying them by talk about courage and imagination. I saw a reference by a learned Senator in that connection.  Imagination and courage are splendid things provided there are other qualities with them. You can go down to the Bankruptcy Court any day and you will see people with imagination and courage who find themselves there.  You can visit our prisons and you will find quite a large number of people there who are people of imagination and courage.  If you want to see examples of concentration of imagination and courage, you have only to visit a lunatic asylum.  It is not sufficient, therefore, to talk in that manner about large schemes unless it can be shown that, in addition to imagination and courage &mdash; which, as I have said, are splendid qualities in their way, but they have to be accompanied by other qualities &mdash; other qualities, such as prudence and so forth, are also present.</P>

I am aware that when the Minister took office, there was a considerable pool of land in hand.  If he is going to continue, he will have to try and have 25,000 acres to start with and then have 25,000 acres a year after that.  He must acquire at a rate at least as rapid as the rate at which he is going to plant.  As I say, if he does that, I shall be very glad to say &ldquo;Well done&rdquo;.

      <P>It was not last week. Not at all.  The point is that there are certain things for which it is right to borrow and certain things for which it is not right to borrow.  We can very well live on the future.  You can always get a man, if he happens to inherit a good estate, who can do very finely for a few years but Deputies must not forget the old Irish proverb which says &ldquo;Deineann tart tart&rdquo;.  The more you go on mortgaging the future, the more it becomes a disease and the more difficult it is to get rid of it.  Our anxiety is to ensure that we borrow for the things for which it is proper to borrow &mdash; the things that will give us a return that would be commensurate with what we expended.  If we have an income of £100 a year, say, and deal with it in such a way that we would only have an income of £50 a year, that could not be called a prudent operation, could it?  If, instead of getting £50 a year out of our £100, we only got £5, it would be more ridiculous still.  Our anxiety is that we should consider the people not merely of this particular time but the people who will come after us and the younger people in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so.  I shall do my best to keep off it.  I should not have gone on to that line were it not for certain objections that have been raised.  I have very little further to say on this matter except that the Minister, as far as this side of the House is concerned, will get all the assistance that we can give him to carry out that programme.  We enter a caveat that we want good work &mdash; we do <Col N="230" /> not want scamped work &mdash; and prudence. If the Minister succeeds in reaching the 25,000-acre target, although it is two and a half times &mdash; and I would be willing to leave a fair margin of safety &mdash; the amount suggested to us, at the time, as the estimate of what would meet the national needs, we shall not object.  It would, no doubt, be possible not to go ahead so rapidly afterwards if it were found that the figure was more than was likely to be required. At the very best, anyhow, these can only be estimates.</P>
      <P>To end as I began, I should like to say that I was very surprised when people said that little interest is taken in the question of afforestation.  I believe a great deal of interest is taken in it and that much interest has been taken in it over a long period of time. The difference is that some people think the mere wish to do a thing enables it to be done.  That, as we know, is not so.  You have to follow up your desire to get a thing done by devising the practical means which will enable you to reach your objective.  If you do not do that, it is simply vain wishing. There has been interest, and once more I say that, so far as we are concerned, we will be very happy to support the Minister in any efforts he makes, reasonably, to try to get this work of afforestation undertaken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year, unfortunately, I was not in a position to speak on this Estimate, but two years ago, when I did speak, I offered what I considered were constructive criticisms.  Even though they were criticisms, they were offered in a constructive fashion.  Reading through the remarks of the Minister at the time, I found one small sentence that stuck closely in my mind.  The Minister's statement was that time and knowledge of the working of Government Departments temper one's statements as the years go by.  The Minister used these words two years ago when winding up the debate on the Forestry Estimate and these words are taken from the official record of the debate.  I think these words would seem to indicate the difficulties that beset us as Deputies if, in our <Col N="231" /> sincerity, or, as we imagine, in our wisdom, we consider it worth while to spend a long time discussing this Estimate.</P>
      <P>It is at least a healthy sign to find Deputies on all sides of the House stating clearly that they are in favour of a good, healthy programme as regards reafforestation.  It is but natural that before we consider the amount of land we should put under trees we should give some consideration to the acquisition of that land. The Minister mentioned 1,200,000 acres as the minimum suitable for reafforestation. It is well to realise, be the target 10,000 or 25,000 acres, that before we start figuring out how we stand we must lay our hands on the land.  Deputy de Valera mentioned 7,600 acres as their highest figure, but I think their highest figure was 7,328 acres and that was in 1938.  The difference may be small, but, nevertheless, the Deputy was on the wrong side.  Surely that does not represent the type of progress that should have been sought for?</P>
      <P>I was glad to note when Deputy Moylan spoke that he was not satisfied with a target of 10,000 acres &mdash; that that was not enough.  I agree with him there.  I suggest that 10,000 acres should not be our maximum target.  I must condemn the action of the last Government, not alone for failing to plant at least 10,000 acres, but for not acquiring more land for afforestation during the emergency years.  Even though these were years when it might be difficult to plant trees, the Government could have attained a better rate in acquiring suitable land.  They could have done more than they did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would seem that there are different opinions as regards the quality and type of land that should be acquired. So far as mountain land is concerned I was glad to note that Deputy Moylan seems to hold the same opinion as I do.  Though mountain land may be of a certain type, we cannot just accept its present value to people who may be using it for grazing purposes.  As the years roll on its value for grazing purposes will, naturally, not be the same. Why not take the mountain land now, <Col N="232" /> where it is of good value for reafforestation purposes and while there may be better opportunities for doing so than in the years to come?  Then we have to consider the bog land.  I can say truthfully that I have seen timber, both hard and soft woods, growing on land which may not definitely be bog land, but which certainly is marshy.</P>
    <P>Experts may tell us lay people about the various types of timber to be grown, but in this matter I would prefer the common-sense approach.  If you go around the country you can see the types of timber that are grown in the various areas.  It is not sufficient to say that the experts are there to advise us.  My honest opinion is that the experts are hiding behind a barrier just as strong as any barrier in Eastern Europe and we cannot get at them.  We spend our time discussing these matters in the House, but when all is said and done they have the last word.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the amount of land that is available at the sources of our rivers.  In the matter of land reclamation, if we are clearing areas at all, it is surely worth our while to clear the river beds.  If we are not determined to plant the hillsides around the sources of the rivers, I suggest that in a number of years we will find the beds of those rivers becoming choked up with the silt from the mountainsides and hillsides.  We can, I suggest, get a large amount of timber into these areas.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the Minister, this type of work could have been done in years gone by.  Deputy de Valera said there is trouble in getting a certain type of land, but I believe there would not be so much trouble in getting that particular type.  There might have been a little trouble, but the Government at the time did not seem to go to any great trouble in securing land which, as Deputy Moylan admits, is most essential for the purpose of reafforestation.</P>
    <P>As regards replanting, there was one statement made by the Minister which is of the utmost importance, and that is that the people who definitely made <Col N="233" /> a lot of money &mdash; some of them made large fortunes &mdash; out of the felling of timber during the emergency, have still not replanted in many cases, and I think that the date given by the Minister when he opened the debate &mdash; 31st March, 1952 &mdash; should be clearly indicated through the Press and on the radio, and the people who made money during the emergency and who are allowed a certain amount towards replanting should be notified that they must do their duty.  Even those who have replanted have, in many instances, done it in a shameful, negligent way. It should be made clear to the people who have not yet replanted that after 31st March, 1952, they will be made answer, through the courts if necessary.</P>
    <P>We should be determined that every acre available &mdash; and thousands of acres are available &mdash; will be put under trees. The Minister should realise that while it may be difficult to deal with the acquisition of new land he should use all the power he has to see that land fit for reafforestation where timber was cut during the emergency is planted and that there will be no mercy shown to those who do not answer to their responsibilities in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect to be considered in connection with the acquisition of land and the planting of trees. I have in mind the position of the Department of Defence.  That Department has a good deal of land of which it could make better use.  In some parts of the country Deputies can see plenty of furze bushes growing on land where there should be timber. That is not to the credit of any Department of State.  If private individuals must accept their obligations, certainly a Department of State should also accept its obligations, and I believe that there is failure in that respect in the matter of afforestation.</P>

This matter, as the Deputy will appreciate, had to be discussed with the Government and the Department of Finance, and we finally came to an agreement by which the period of five years would operate from the date on which we were discussing the matter, which was July last year.  Taking July, 1949, and relating it to the termination of the period during which the Minister can exercise his functions, it will be seen that the functions end in July, 1954.  That is the only meaning the sub-section has.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (1) provides that payments may be made out of the fund in respect of expenditure on the acquisition of land, premises, furniture or equipment, etc.  So far as expenses incurred in that connection are concerned, they are trifling &mdash; a matter of a visit by officers of the Department to see some equipment being purchased for the Store Street building, and an examination of the equipment to see in what way it could best be adapted, or incidental expenses of that kind.  I assure the Deputy that they are trifling, and the only meaning of the date in the sub-section is to complete the period of five years.</P>

      <P>The matter of the acquisition of the Store Street premises has been fully debated and it would probably be futile for me or any other Deputy to appeal to the Minister to change his mind in any respect. However, I think it should be put on record that, apart from all political considerations &mdash; and they certainly do not apply to me personally &mdash; it is the opinion of members on this side of the House and of people generally throughout the country that the decision to abandon the premises at Store Street as a bus terminus was a mistaken one. I shall refer very briefly to the considerations which prompt me to make that statement.  First, there is no denying the necessity for such a terminus not only in Dublin but in other cities in the country.  I can say for Cork at least that the premises in existence there for a like purpose are much better than the premises which the people of Dublin and the people who visit Dublin now have at their disposal on Aston's Quay, but that would not be saying much for the premises in Cork.  There was a period when the people of Cork and people visiting Cork had to labour under the same hardships as those under which the people in Dublin now have to labour.  Córas Iompair Éireann secured better premises and these are being used now, but I insist that even they are not adequate for the purpose of controlling queues, parking buses, and giving travellers the requisite shelter and facilities while awaiting long-distance buses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I have come to know Dublin much better than I did before I became a Deputy and having regard to the location of this particular site, I doubt if a better site could be procured <Col N="237" /> in any other part of the city. From the point of view of convenience. nobody can deny that it is the most convenient site, and, from the point of view of traffic congestion, which is the greatest argument advanced against it, ingress to and egress from this point in relation to all parts, except possibly the south-east can be secured by way of routes which would in no way interfere with the main traffic arteries.</P>
    <P>I think I outlined these points in the course of the debate on another Bill and I do not wish to labour them any further, but there is one other point which I think is very relevant to the section.  The Store Street building, as it now appears, seems to be far too big for housing the Department of Social Welfare.  It appears big enough, if completed in its present design, to house several Departments.  There are several floors and I am of the impression that, even including the staff now in Árus Brugha, in D'Olier Street, Lord Edward Street and some of the other smaller sections of the Department, the building as it stands is far too big for the proposed new Department. I would ask the Minister at some stage to give us an idea as to the number of officials he expects will be housed in the Store Street premises. I think the Minister will say that his officials alone could not occupy the entire premises.  I may be wrong in that, but that is my impression.  If I am right, ample provision could be made for using the bottom portion of the premises as a bus terminus.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, it is of no use to ask the Minister at this stage to change his mind.  The amendments that have been put down to preserve this building as a bus terminus have been defeated by small majorities. The small difference between the number who voted for and the number who voted against the amendments is in itself sufficient justification for the Government to think twice before they come to a final decision in this particular matter and before the building is altered for all time and is rendered unsuitable for the purpose for which it was originally designed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not complaining about the Deputy, but I think all the arguments on both sides have been paraded in all their merits.  Quite clearly, there are two points of view. I think I made our point of view perfectly clear, namely, that we decided to buy this building because it was going.  We might have bought any other building that was going.  We decided to buy this building because it was going, because it could be completed within a reasonably short time and because it appeared to us to be capable of housing the entire headquarters staff of the Department of Social Welfare.  At present, the Department's staff is scattered all over the city, as Deputies who have any contact with it know.  One has to go to one place for children's allowances, to another for old age pensions, to another for widows' and orphans' pensions, to another for unemployment benefit.  The offices of the Department are scattered all over the city.</P>
      <P>This building has the merit that we believe it will accommodate approximately 1,000 members of the staff.  The figure may be below that; it may be above it, but it is in or about that figure.  If it does that, as we believe it will, it will accommodate the entire staff of the Department.  At this stage we are talking about an incomplete building and the figures, necessarily, are given with some reserve, but I think they are reasonably accurate figures.  We hope, therefore, that when we accommodate the entire staff of the Department it will be possible to shed the variety of buildings which are at present occupied by various sections of the Department of Social Welfare. In that event, the offices which we will evacuate will be available for other public purposes or the release of private dwelling houses which have been acquired here and there throughout the city in order to provide accommodation for Government staffs for which there is no official accommodation available, will be permitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="239" /> The Store Street project, from the point of view of the Department of Social Welfare, has the merit that it offers accommodation for the entire staff of the Department in the centre of the city, permitting of easy access. The lower portion of the building can be easily and satisfactorily utilised as a central inquiry office for the transaction of all that type of business for which people visit the Department every day in the week.  The fact that there is an extensive office on the ground floor will enable us to establish there a variety of sections where inquirers can get speedy information, where they can be interviewed and where their business can be satisfactorily dealt with.</P>
    <P>It is from all these points of view that the building known as Store Street is considered to be a satisfactory one from the standpoint of the Department of Social Welfare.  It has the merit also, again from the Department's standpoint, that it permits of the integration of the entire staff in one building, with all the merits of integration, co-ordination, and the fact that people are woven into a common administrative machine, permitting of greater efficiency than is possible where people are compelled to work in separated buildings, with the loss of co-ordination which inevitably results from such a position.</P>
    <P>The question of the provision of another bus depot is a matter for Córas Iompair Éireann, certainly not a matter for the Department of Social Welfare and whatever is being done in that respect must stand on its own feet.  We desire to purchase this building because of the advantages it affords in the way of providing a central building for the entire staff of the Department and enabling its business to be transacted in a much more satisfactory manner.</P>

All the merits of this matter have been discussed at considerable length. I think the only wise thing to do is to recognise that there are considerable merits, no matter what has been said on the other side, in having an integrated Department of Social Welfare centrally situated, with staff working in the one building and able to give the more satisfactory type of service which you can give in such circumstances.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a matter that I would like to raise on this section.  I kept this point for this section because I think it is more relevant here than anywhere else.  This Bill provides that the employees&mdash;whether they are officers or employees&mdash;of the National Health Insurance Society will become civil servants if they so opt.  There is no provision made for those who do not opt to become civil servants.  It is quite conceivable that an officer or agent of the National Health Insurance Society, say, an agent in the country, might, for various reasons, decide that he did not want to become a civil servant. In the first place, a civil servant has not the same freedom with regard to business as a person outside the service.  As far as I know, some agents down the country who are acting for the National Health Insurance Society run a business as well, own a shop or something like that, and if they become civil servants, I do not think they will be allowed to do that. That is the first point.  Secondly, some of them were interested in politics, were members of public boards and so on and certainly they will not be allowed to continue.  If a person took an appointment from the <Col N="241" /> National Health Insurance Society on the understanding that he would be allowed to go on with his business or continue in politics and if he spent a good many years there and now when he is asked to become a civil servant does not want to become a civil servant, I think there should be some way of giving him compensation.  I do not say that the compensation should be as high as if he were forced out.  If the Minister brought in a Bill and stated that there would be redundancy and that he would have to eliminate a certain number we would press for very substantial compensation.  Where a person opts to go out I do not say it should be so high but there should be some compensation.  I was going through the Bill a few times to see if I could frame an amendment and I could not.  The easiest way to do it would be if the Minister examines this section again&mdash;the section, I would like to point out to the Dáil for those who have not the Bill in front of them, prohibits the committee of management from giving any increases in remuneration between the 1st January last and the time the Minister takes over&mdash;and amends the section or puts in a new section to enable the committee of management to give compensation to any officer or employee who resigns. That means that every officer and employee has the option of resigning before the transfer takes place and he would like to know what he is entitled to by way of compensation. I do not want to suggest to the Minister at this stage what the compensation should be, but in all fairness there should be some compensation for officers and employees who for one reason or another are not prepared to become civil servants, but who were quite prepared to carry on as officers or employees of the society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Deputy Dr. Ryan realises that he would open a very wide door if we were to make provision to compensate a particular person who would be transferred from the National Health Insurance Society to the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The generality of part-time agents who represent the society throughout the country have at present a tenure <Col N="242" /> which would permit of the termination of their services on one week's notice. All of them would be taken over to the Department of Social Welfare, and on transfer they will have a tenure at least no worse than what they have at the moment, and probably substantially better.  I have already given assurances in this House that the conditions of service of the indoor staff of the Society will not be worsened, and their pension provision will in fact be substantially improved on their assimilation to the Civil Service superannuation code, so that both indoor and outdoor staffs are being transferred to the Department with the assurance that their conditions will not be worsened in any way.  I have given that assurance, and I say it most positively.  The position of the pensionable staff will be better in future than it is to-day.  They are coming into a State Department where their employers will be the entire community functioning through this Parliament, so that they probably will have the most stable kind of employment that it is possible to devise in this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan says that we should consider paying compensation to those who do not want to come in.  I am afraid he will create an &ldquo;easy street&rdquo; mentality and that a variety of people for a variety of reasons would say that they did not want to become civil servants, not because they had any objection to become civil servants, but because it would be much more advantageous to them speedily to cultivate that view so that they would get substantial compensation and so that, having safely deposited it in their pockets, they could say &ldquo;we will get another job elsewhere&rdquo;.  The question we must ask ourselves is whether this young State with a population of 3,000,000 people can say to people who are being offered no less salary than they have at present, greater stability in tenure and better pension rights that they are also entitled to compensation if they do not embrace the idea of assimilation into the Civil Service.  I think with all respect that we have overdone the compensation aspect in some of our approaches to legislation <Col N="243" /> problems.  We have got to ask whether a country with our resources and population can with equanimity face a situation where people 25 or 30 years of age become pensioners and entitled to compensation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Pensioners to the extent that they get substantial lump sum compensation after a relatively short period of service with the society in view of the offer which is being made, namely, no worsening of conditions, no weakening of tenure, a substantial improvement in pensions in many instances, and an opportunity of employment in what will be an expanding Department.  I think in these circumstances that it is not reasonable to ask that compensation should be paid to those who for one reason or another do not wish to become civil servants. I think Deputy Dr. Ryan will admit that the plea that a person would not like to be assimilated into the Civil Service could be used as an umbrella to cover any possible devices he wished to resort to so that he could get compensation and look for a job elsewhere. On reflection I think Deputy Dr. Ryan will realise that it would open wide a door which would not be easily shut if there was any let-up in the matter at all.</P>

      <P>I did not want to make the point&mdash;it was argued at an earlier stage&mdash;that anybody could hold that he would be worse off by way of remuneration or superannuation.  It is possible that some may argue that, but I am not arguing it for them.  My point is that a man may not want to become a civil servant.  I could give three cases in my own county.  In one case the person concerned has a shop which he cannot continue if he becomes a civil servant&mdash;he will probably make it over to his wife.</P>

      <P>Those two men must retire from politics or not accept the job.  They were men who were interested in politics when they took the posts as agents.  If they had not taken that job they might have drifted into something else where they could have remained for the rest of their lives and remained in politics and on the county council.  Now they are told at an age when it would be difficult for them to get anything else that they must drop politics or get out of the job.  I think that is rather hard.  Employees or agents&mdash;I think agents more so probably&mdash;may object for reasons of that kind, that they would be more restricted in expressing their views than they are as they are employed at the moment.  I think that if the Minister were to permit the committee of management&mdash;if you like, put in &ldquo;for some good reason&rdquo;&mdash;to allow persons to retire now giving them reasonable compensation he would be doing what is only fair and just.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this problem is not insuperable.  We have in the Civil Service a system whereby when female officers wish to retire on marriage they get a certain proportion of their salary for each year of service, as a bonus.  If we had a system of that sort, it would definitely discourage the short-term man from going out, the man who just wanted to go out, as the Tánaiste has suggested, in order that he might secure the lump sum compensation, and it would compensate the long-service man who did not want to give up the ordinary civil freedom which he enjoys at the moment.  In this case, there would be, in relation to a number of the agents&mdash;I do not know any of them as intimately as Deputy Ryan appears to know them&mdash; here and there through the country, men who would feel that their individual freedom of action would be too greatly hampered and fettered if they <Col N="245" /> became civil servants, as it would inevitably be if the proposal goes through in its present form.  Since they are being transferred from their existing employment to the employment of the State without their consent and not of their own volition, surely there is a case in equity to extend some consideration to them.</P>
      <P>I think that when we were nationalising the railways, for instance, there was a provision whereby a man who had been in permanent employment, if he wished to retire when he reached retiring age, was entitled to compensation and certainly there was compensation for redundancy under some of the earlier Railway Acts.  We are not contending for the acceptance of a new principle.  It is a position which has been recognised by the State in the past, and on the whole has been fairly met.  Would it not be possible for the Tánaiste to do as I suggest, to draw up some proposals analogous to those which are already extended in the Civil Service to female officers who wish to retire on marriage? The position here is rather different. We have people who are in a job and who are being brought into the Civil Service, whether they like it or not. Strange as it may appear, there are many people who do not like the Civil Service conditions and whose dream and ambition is not to be a civil servant but to retain a certain independence of occupation which will enable them to utilise their own energies to what they conceive to be their own best advantage in the freest possible way.  In those circumstances, as they are being transferred from the service of one employer to the service of another, they have a very strong case in equity and justice for special consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy, and also Deputy Dr. Ryan, will appreciate that, under this Bill, in the whole transaction of taking staff from the National Health Insurance Society and assimilating it into the Department of Social Welfare, I have divested myself of any power to make them redundant and push them out on grounds of redundancy.  In Railway <Col N="246" /> Acts to which Deputy MacEntee referred, there was provision whereby a man becoming redundant might be pushed out, whether he liked it or not, on certain terms of compensation.  I have always felt that that could work out very harshly and unreasonably in certain classes of employment. If, for instance, a person is following a particular occupation and is told he is redundant at 50 or 55 and that it is proposed to terminate his services and pay him some compensation, it is not easy in these days, or in any other for that matter, here or anywhere else, for such persons who have followed a particular occupation all their lives to find a new job in any capacity at that age.  Any Deputy who has experience of listening, from time to time, to heartbreaking stories of men of that age who want to try to get employment knows only too well how difficult it is for a man of that kind to find employment, particularly when he has no skill to sell, since his service has been in another capacity and is that kind of service which is not wanted by everybody. I feel that, no matter what compensation you provide, following the pattern of the compensation which we have already provided in some of these cases, you can unconsciously do considerable hardship in pushing a man of that age out on compensation terms. The compensation is only a fraction, in some cases a relatively small fraction, of the former wages and then they have the problem of trying to rehabilitate themselves in some other class of employment for which they have no particular talent.  I am divesting myself of any power to do that for those who are transferred, I am undertaking that no one will lose his job by reason of the transfer, that the salary conditions will be no less, that the wages will be no less, that the pension conditions, where he enjoys pension rights, will, in fact, be better and that he will be transferred to the secure employment of the State.  We have to put both sides of the case and I think we have to look at both sides. Deputies will find that the proposals which the House is being asked to endorse frankly recognise that we are dealing with human beings.  We are <Col N="247" /> not going to endanger their prospects of employment.  Whatever they were in the past, they will be no less stable in the future, and that is a very considerable asset and advantage to the persons concerned.</P>
      <P>Deputies Ryan and MacEntee referred to certain restrictions on persons who may be taken over.  So far as the agents are concerned, there is no restriction on a man running a shop at the moment, and I do not propose to put any restriction on a man running a shop.  Civil servants do run shops, and can have business acquaintance without any transgression of Civil Service rules.  The only point left is the political facilities he has at the moment, which he might not have on becoming a civil servant.  I am prepared to look at that special matter, to see to what extent it may be possible to meet that situation for a limited class of persons, namely, those who are in that position at the moment.  I do not make any promise, but I will look into it, to see what it would be possible to do to meet the point of view of Deputies opposite.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I must say I do not think the Minister will be able to overcome it in that way, but I suppose we must accept his offer to look into it. There are only two things now in question, but there may be other restrictions. There are people, as Deputy MacEntee says, who do not want to become civil servants, whether there are restrictions or not.  I have in mind two men who are county councillors. One of them is a member of the Minister's Party, a fairly young man, the other is an old man going out in any case, I suppose.  If he says &ldquo;I do not want to leave politics&rdquo; and resigns, I do not know what job he will get as he would be too old to get a job again.  I suppose he is nearly as old as the Minister himself&mdash;and the Minister would find it hard to get another job.</P>

      <P>Before Section 23 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The committee of management shall be dissolved on the transfer day.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (1) of Section 23 in the Bill as it stands at present provides that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may, at any time before the transfer day, by Order dissolve the committee of management.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is then what I can only describe as a rather laborious process under which the Minister may appoint some institution, which he describes as the &ldquo;nominated person&rdquo;, to act instead of the committee of management in the interregnum after its dissolution and the coming into operation of the new social welfare scheme.  There was an earlier amendment to the Bill which laid it down substantially that the transfer of the members of the staff would not take place until such time as the scheme envisaged in the White Paper would come into operation. Now, the Minister made a fair case against that particular amendment.  He said that he would want his machinery oiled and ready and all the necessary staffing arrangements made for the new Department, and he wanted the members of the National Health Insurance Society, therefore, incorporated <Col N="249" /> into the Department for some time before the scheme would come into operation.  I do not think that argument holds with respect to this amendment.  I have heard the committee of management praised very highly during the course of this debate. I think the committee consists of a limited number of persons; they give their services free and their duties have been most satisfactorily performed during the lifetime of the society.  I see no reason why the committee should not continue to act during the interregnum.  National health insurance will have to be administered, benefits will have to be paid and the staff will have to work in much the same way as they have been working heretofore.  It makes very little difference, I think, from the point of view of the efficiency of the society in the examination of claims and the payments of benefits whether it be a nominated person or the committee of management that acts in the interregnum.  I cannot see any difficulty in relation to the administration of the affairs of the society pending the coming into operation of the comprehensive scheme.  I would like to hear the Minister on the matter.  He may have some good reasons to advance, but certainly I cannot see any reason why this section should be included in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Let me explain to the Deputy that my mind is in fact running along the lines of the amendment.  I would not normally propose to dissolve the society before the transfer day. This section is not put in deliberately with a view to doing that.  It is put in in case some unforeseen or unexpected contingency should arise which would render that step necessary.  The Deputy may take my assurance that so long as circumstances continue to be normal the committee will continue in operation until the transfer day.</P>

      <P>If a contingency does not arise, the Deputy and I will then be doing the same thing.  I will not <Col N="250" /> lightly dissolve the committee.  There would have to be some very substantial reason to make me do anything other than dissolve the committee on the actual day of transfer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we leave this matter, perhaps I might be permitted to draw attention to the startling inconsistency in the policy of the Government in regard to democratic control which this particular section illustrates. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government has just come into the House and I gather that in the Department now the knives are already being sharpened to procure the speedy execution of county managers throughout the country on the plea, of course, that this will restore democratic control in local affairs. When we come to the Department of Social Welfare, however, I would like the House to note the rather startling proposals contained in Section 23.  First of all, the Minister may at any time before the transfer day dissolve, by Order, the committee of management. He does not have to hold an inquiry. He does not have to find the committee of management guilty of some dereliction of duty.  He can just decide that, if a majority happen to have red hair, or black hair, or are bald, he does not like that particular composition of that particular committee and he can, therefore, propose to dissolve them.</P>
      <P>A local authority cannot be dissolved unless it signally fails to do its duty. It does not matter in how exemplary a fashion the committee may discharge its functions; it does not matter with what efficiency and economy it discharges the administrative affairs of the society; if the Minister decides he does not like its composition, or any of its members, he may sentence it, without giving any reason whatsoever, to summary dissolution.  Proceeding from that, what do we find?  Having dissolved the committee of management, the Minister may appoint any person to be a dictator over the affairs of the National Health Insurance Society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Remember, the whole theory of this Bill is that the National Health Insurance Society, which was originally <Col N="251" /> very democratic in structure and which continued very democratic in structure under the Act of 1933, is now to have the control of its ordinary day-to-day affairs taken out of the capable hands of the committee of management and vested apparently in a nominee of the Minister's.  I think there is here the same sort of inconsistency as permeates practically every aspect of Coalition policy.  On the one hand, you have the Minister for Local Government, his Parliamentary Secretary and the Labour Party clamouring to do away with the county management system on the plea that they want to restore democratic control in local affairs; and, on the other hand, you have here the Minister coming in with a proposal to empower him to abolish the democratic committee of management of the National Health Insurance Society and substitute therefor his own nominee, his rubber stamp, a person who will act ostensibly in his own name but really in the name of the Minister, who, under this section, proposes to constitute himself a dictator.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>On this particular issue, has not the Second Reading of the Bill been an endorsement of the view that the taking over of the society is a necessary preliminary to the implementation of a comprehensive scheme? I suppose the best answer I can make to Deputy MacEntee is to quote for him once more what Deputy Dr. Ryan said about the National Health Insurance Society during the discussion on the Estimate for the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare in this House on 23rd June last. At that time Deputy Dr. Ryan went on the record as saying:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It would be better to have the society in before going on with the comprehensive scheme because it would be easier to start off from the new point then.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan, who has given some study to this matter, and who is aware of the volume of work to be done and the necessity for planning in advance, took the view that the integration of the society into the Department was desirable and necessary, and he went <Col N="252" /> on record as saying so.  This Bill is a recognition of the very important fact that the integration of the society with the Department is a necessary preliminary towards constructing the machine which will operate the comprehensive scheme.  As I have already told Deputies opposite, my normal line would be to allow the committee of the society to function until the society is transferred to the Department. At the moment I do not foresee any contingency which will make it necessary to dissolve the society before the transfer day.  If there is any great fuss over the matter, and Deputy Lynch feels any way keenly about it, I shall look into the matter to see if it is necessary to be equipped with powers to take over the society in advance of the transfer day.  I do not want to use these powers at all unless something arises that I do not foresee at the moment.  Normally my mind would run along allowing the committee of the society to function until the society is transferred to the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a reasonable approach on the part of the Minister to reconsider, shall I say, this very objectionable proposal.  I rise only to point out that the quotation which he read to the House from Deputy Dr. Ryan's speech has no bearing on this proposal whatsoever.  Deputy Dr. Ryan, in that passage, said that in his view it was a good thing to bring the society into the Department.  This proposal here is quite different.  This proposal has got nothing to do with bringing the society into the Department.  Sub-section (1) of the section is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may, at any time, before the transfer day, by Order, dissolve the committee of management.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what we are objecting to.  I quite agree that if the National Health Insurance Society is going to be incorporated in the Department of Social Welfare and actually forms part of the Department, it is difficult to see the committee of management discharging its present functions.  I am not saying that there would not be a place for some sort of body representing insured <Col N="253" /> persons which would act as a watchdog on their behalf and secure justice for insured persons at the hands of the Minister.  That is quite different.  I will concede that the committee of management could scarcely operate as a committee of management once the society is transferred to the Department of Social Welfare and becomes part of the Department.  That is a logical fact and cannot be denied, but the proposal in Section 23 is far and away different.  The proposal is that, even if the society is not absorbed in the Department of Social Welfare, even if the Minister, on reconsideration, decides that he is not going to fix the transfer date, he will have, under the powers he is looking for, power to dissolve the committee of management and entrust the management of the society to a nominee of his own.  That is a very different thing and the Minister has already conceded that it is a highly undesirable power to give him.  The only justification the Minister has given the House for asking the power is that some contingency may arise which will make it desirable for him to dissolve the committee of management.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that once the Bill becomes law there is no control over the Minister's normal or abnormal actions.  These powers will have been given to him and he can exercise them, whether there is any change in the existing situation or not or whether he incorporates the society in the Department of Social Welfare or not.  Under the section, it will be quite open to the Minister, let me repeat, not to fix the transfer day and, exercising his powers under Section 23, to dissolve the committee of management and appoint his nominee to administer the affairs of the society.  I do not think that any member of the House who voted for the Second Reading of the Bill ever visualised such powers being given to the Minister.  I think the Minister himself has already recognised that they are extravagant powers <Col N="254" /> to look for.  I certainly do welcome his changed approach to this matter, and I hope that if Deputy Lynch withdraws the amendment at this stage, the Minister will be able to come to the House to say, as he has perhaps indicated, that on second thoughts he has come to the conclusion that it is not necessary for him to look for these powers at all and that Section 23, or, at least, sub-section (1) will disappear from the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This appears to me to be a rather unusual section to put in the Bill.  As a matter of fact going through the Bill at the beginning I wondered why the Minister did not bring in Section 25 alone and leave the rest of the Bill out, because he can do anything he likes under the section.  It appears as the Bill stands that he can modify in any way he needs to modify certain provisions to suit his purpose and make these specific modifications and changes in Orders and regulations under the various Acts.  It is a most extraordinary provision.  It is so extraordinary in fact and so incomprehensible that I do not feel competent to deal with it.  I should like if the Minister could tell us whether there is any particular reason why a section of this kind is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>When the society is transferred to the Department, it will become a branch of the Department and this section will enable the Department to make such adjustments as are necessary in provisions which will have ceased to have any validity or value once the society becomes part of the Department.  The intention is to utilise the section only for the purpose of cutting out the dead timber, as it were, of procedures which may in fact be completely inoperative in the new setup. If they have any value they will still remain there but accounting periods and adjustments of that kind regarded as necessary when the society was a separate body, may not be necessary <Col N="255" /> when the society is integrated with the Department.  It is only a matter of making whatever necessary adjustments we find necessary from experience.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 29:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (2).</P>
      <P>This amendment is submitted principally for the purpose of seeking information and because I have an objection to retrospective legislation.  The section, as it stands, says that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 17 of the National Health Insurance Act, 1947, is hereby amended by the deletion in sub-section (2) of the words `during that financial year' &rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One has to go back a little bit to see what was the provision in Section 17 of the 1947 Act.  Under Section 3 of the 1911 Act it was provided that the cost of benefits and the cost of administration were to be payable as to seven-ninths in the case of men and as to <Col N="256" /> three-fourths in the case of women out of contributions, and as to two-ninths in the case of men and one-fourth in the case of women out of moneys provided by Parliament.  That was amended by sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the 1920 Act by deleting the differentiation in the case of women.  Section 17 of the Act of 1947 provided that as from the 1st April, 1947, and for each succeeding financial year, moneys payable out of the Exchequer should be payable in such amounts as the Minister for Finance would decide. The moneys were payable in each financial year as they became due.  This section now seeks to provide that the moneys will be payable at any time out of the Exchequer in such sums as the Minister for Finance should decide&mdash;in other words, it seems to me, moneys that were due and payable in the financial year 1947-48 or that were not payable.  As I say, I am looking for information as to why the words proposed to be deleted should be deleted, and I submit the amendment also because I do not like retrospective legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the section is to remedy a flaw which has come to light in the National Health Insurance Act, 1947.  Sub-section (2) of Section 17 of that Act provided that the annual State grants in respect of national health insurance expenditure should be paid during the relevant financial year.  In other words, you had to make the payment during the year and not one hour after the year, although you could never ascertain what the expenditure was until the year had, in fact, passed.  Consequently, you could not make the payment during the year, because you did not know the amount that had to be paid until you had calculated the amount of the expenditure and that was not available until after the year had ended.  This section proposes to make the payment in relation to the relevant financial year.  The payment will be made immediately the amount is ascertained.  This section is merely an adjustment of what, in the light of experience, has been discovered to be a flaw, which makes administration difficult.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a complicated business, and I hope the Deputy will be able to grasp the significance of the section when I explain the position to him.  Under the Scottish Insurance Companies (Superannuation Fund) Order, Confirmation Act, 1914, a fund was established for the provision of disablement and superannuation allowances for employees of certain Scottish insurance companies, and the companies concerned were excepted from the provisions of the National Health Insurance Acts.  The employees affected in Great Britain came within the scope of the British National Insurance Act, 1946, as from the 5th July, 1948, and steps were taken to wind up the fund referred to.  These companies have some employees in this country, and the companies have undertaken to protect these employees until they qualify fully for benefits under the National Health Insurance Acts and the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts here.  In those circumstances, there is no necessity to continue the confirmation Act here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this section, therefore, is to wind up the Scottish Insurance Companies Superannuation Fund) Order, Confirmation Act, 1914, because it now ceases to have any validity here.  In fact, it has been wound up as far as the British section is concerned.  Only 15 employees are affected here and the offices of the employees have undertaken that their sickness benefits under these Acts will be safeguarded.  It is merely a matter of doing in this Bill what would <Col N="258" /> probably necessitate the promotion of a private Bill.  The interests of the 15 employees are being adequately safeguarded.</P>

      <P>I want to give notice that, on the Report Stage, it will probably be necessary for me to move an amendment in connection with the next election of certain members of the committee of management of the National Health Insurance Society. The new committee of management will be due to come into office, I think, about August next, but in order to provide for their election, or for the election of some members, you would have to put the election machinery in motion not later than the 15th of next month.  If there is a likelihood of the Bill being passed through this House and the Seanad by the 15th of next month, I probably will not need to move any amendment.</P>
      <P>But, in case it may be necessary to move an amendment on these lines, the only purpose is to avoid the necessity for holding an election to elect persons who, in fact, will probably never be able to function because of the fact that the society will have been dissolved and transferred to the Department of Social Welfare in the meantime.  I would, however, make provision whereby, if the society was not taken over by the date on which the new committee was due to function, we would allow the existing committee to carry on until such time as the transfer takes place.  We can discuss the matter on the Report Stage. I merely want to give notice of it.  It would not be necessary at all if one could be sure that the Bill would be passed by both Houses before the 15th of next month.</P>

      <P>I have a few words to say on this Vote on forestry, although it does not concern my county very much because it is a county of very good land.  At the same time, it is a very picturesque county&mdash;at least it was up to the last war when a vast <Col N="260" /> amount of timber was cut down there. I ask the Minister to see that some scheme is devised whereby the big belts of forest land which were cut down during that period are replanted. All over the county at present, where the timber was cut down, there are belts of land which are eyesores.  The greatest offenders in this regard are the Land Commission themselves. Right beside my own home there are at least 50 acres of cutaway forest land, the trees on which were cut down by the Land Commission and taken away and sold.  For the last eight or ten years there is nothing there but briars and weeds and dirt of all sorts, and the Land Commission are not making the slightest effort to bring that land into forestry again.  I ask the Minister to see that the Land Commission get going right away with that.  There is big work to be done there in clearing away the old scrub and putting a new plantation there.</P>
      <P>Some years ago the Land Commission acquired most of the good land on the Langford estate and divided it. There is a big forestry belt of 150 or 200 acres, on that estate which is not receiving any attention from anybody. The owner, Lady Langford, is an absentee landlord.  I have asked the Land Commission to take over the estate and divide the good land amongst the people there and take the forestry land into their own hands. Some trees on that estate which fell 30 or 40 years ago were never taken away.  There are also about 100 acres of semi-bogland which would make a fine forestry belt.  The Land Commission have not made the slightest effort to do anything about afforestation in that county.  As I say, they were the biggest offenders themselves.  There are tens of thousands of pounds' worth of the best timber which is of the full age for cutting and there is nothing being done about it.  Even when there is an absentee landlord in an area who is giving no return to the people, there is nothing done about the matter.  I ask the Land Commission to take over that estate immediately and to include it in a big forestry belt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has also been a public agitation recently because this lady tried <Col N="261" /> to sell two acres of a little wood near Summerhill.  The public resented this being allowed to happen.  That place has been a landmark for generations. From it you could see right across to the Hill of Tara.  I ask the Minister to see that this lady is not allowed to sell this two-acre plot.  The priests and the people are up in arms against it.  There is no reason why she should be allowed to sell it.  There is a fine view from it and lovely trees on it.  One of the local residents has offered £250 for the wood so that it would not be cut down. Notwithstanding that, it has been sold to another person who wants to cut down the timber for profit.  I ask the Minister to see that this little amenity in the locality of Summerhill is not allowed to be cut away by anybody. There will be a big hubbub about it if the wood is allowed to be cut down. A vast amount of destruction has taken place in that area already by the cutting down of trees.  It was one of the nicest spots in the country.  It was well planted and there was a picturesque view from it.  The Land Commission should do something to restore that district to its former condition.  They should plant the forestry belt which they cut away and the people who got a vast amount of money by cutting down and selling timber should be made to plant three or four trees for every one cut down. We do not want to have a complete wilderness all over the plains of Meath. The Forestry Department should get going on their job.  This country needs timber and now is the time to start with reafforestation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome any progress which is made in respect of the reafforestation of this country.  After having had two and a half years' experience of administering the Department, the Minister must by now realise how wrong he was in the charges which he made from time to time when he was an Opposition Deputy against the Fianna Fáil Government for alleged slowness in this respect.  He must be convinced by now that it was impossible to carry out, as he suggested, the plantation of thousands and thousands of acres of the land of this country.  He <Col N="262" /> told us, when he took over the Department, that he aimed at planting 25,000 acres and now, after two and a half years of office, he informs the House that he hopes to reach the target of 8,000 acres this year.  That is a long way from 25,000 acres.  As I have said, I feel sure that the Minister is now convinced that under the circumstances that have obtained in this country for the past nine or ten years, and under existing conditions, such a target would be impossible to reach and that only after he has provided himself with the necessary wherewithal in the matter of seeds, equipment and so forth will it be possible to reach it.  As Deputy de Valera stated earlier this evening, no Party in this House will be better pleased to see the Minister reach that target than the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>The Minister also informed us that he proposes to establish a number of drying kilns and saw-mills throughout the country.  With that, I am in perfect agreement.  I wonder, however, if he is over-optimistic when he says that he hopes to put on the market Irish timber which can compare favourably, from the point of view of quality and so forth, with any foreign timber of a similar kind which is imported.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that. I am very interested in a certain type of timber.  I should be glad and proud to know that as a result of the process the timber goes through in the drying kilns and in the saw-mills which the Minister proposes to erect, we can economically produce a timber in this country equal in quality to any similar timber that can be imported.  During the emergency we had experience of the use of native timber which was kiln-dried in this country.  In fact, some timber was kiln-dried in the City of Dublin.  I agree that for certain types of work it was first class&mdash;as a matter of fact I would go so far as to say, and I am speaking from practical experience, that even without kiln-drying we have produced in this country timber equal to almost, I might say, the best Norway spruce that was ever imported.  But these timbers were <Col N="263" /> used solely for a special job.  The timbers were used for roofing, for joists, for floors and so forth.  I am very glad to hear that it is within the bounds of possibility to produce Irish timber which will be suitable for joinery and which can take its place with the best red deal or pine that can be imported.  I have had practical experience of the use of kiln-dried timber for joinery work.  In order to ensure that I would get the proper type of material put into the particular piece of joinery that I had to carry out, I would need to procure at least anything from 25 to 30 per cent, over the amount of timber necessary to carry out the particular job&mdash;and I would not have to do that if I were using imported timber in the nature of red deal to carry out joinery work.  I am glad to hear that that particular difficulty can be got over.  However, I am a doubting Thomas and until such time as I see for myself timber produced of which every inch can be utilised I am afraid I cannot subscribe to the optimism of the Minister in this particular instance.</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister agree with Deputy Moylan when he suggested that farms on mountains and in catchment areas should be purchased or acquired&mdash;or whatever the correct word may be&mdash;and the people from those areas migrated to other farms that would give them a proper economic living from the point of view of farming. Deputy Moylan's point was that those lands could be planted and that both from a climatic and a commercial point of view that policy would add to the amenities of the country as a whole. In speaking on this Estimate last year I suggested much the same thing&mdash;that the people should be taken from the hillsides and brought down to the lowlands and given a certain amount of land there.  I am glad the Minister expressed agreement with that point of view.  Now that he has unlimited powers under the new Land Bill to go into the open market and purchase land at its market value I hope he will take the initiative in respect of this suggestion by Deputy Moylan and with which he expressed agreement.</P>

      <P>A certain matter was mentioned this evening by Deputy Pattison.  I refer now to the position of the forestry workers, the peculiar position in which they are placed when attending Mass on Church holidays.  In some areas, and particularly in the southern portion of my constituency, there is a diocesan law which prevents any individual, provided he holds the same religious views as the majority of the people in the county, namely, Roman Catholic, from working on holidays. Any person professing that faith is prevented by the diocesan law from working on those days.  I think the same treatment should be meted out to the forestry workers as is meted out in the County Wicklow, at any rate, to the ordinary road workers.  The road workers there are paid for holidays. They have not to turn in to work at all.  I think the Minister, in his concluding statement in the debate last year, remarked that he would like to see every worker remaining away from work on holidays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>He followed that up by saying when the question of pay would arise, the workers would find that he would not be a very stern antagonist in the matter of payment for the day's work.  I suggest the Minister should <Col N="265" /> follow up that viewpoint and he should release these men from their responsibility of having to work on Church holidays and at the same time he should see to it that they will be at no financial loss as a result.  He also spoke in glowing terms of the workers, when he was concluding the debate last year, and he made a sort of promise that, so far as the workers are concerned, he would take steps to see that their interests would be looked after by way of increased wages.  I understand the wages of the forestry workers have been increased.</P>

      <P>We will talk about the Wicklow County Council another time.  I do not believe the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would let us develop that point very much further.  Deputy Dunne painted a picture of the existing circumstances, a very dark, gloomy picture of the circumstances which obtain so far as the average forestry worker in County Wicklow is concerned. I know quite a number of forestry workers both in County Wicklow and County Wexford&mdash;I am on the borderline&mdash;and I never heard any of those men complain that they were compelled to do the things that Deputy Dunne mentioned.  He said that in pre-war days they were little better than coolies.  I know these <Col N="266" /> workers and I am aware that the average workers will appear on a Sunday as well dressed as any other worker in the country.  To all appearances he is living just as well as the average person in the same category as himself.  I would be prepared at all times to advocate that the wages of forestry workers should be increased. Road workers and others have received increases in their wages and I do not see why forestry workers should not be similarly treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I now come to another section of employees, the foresters.  Last year the Minister admitted that those men hold very responsible positions and he appreciates their work.  He said that they handle a lot of money, thousands of pounds, annually and he went so far as to say that never did they find that there was one penny going astray.  Those men must possess certain educational qualifications before they are allowed to enter the forestry college for training. <Col N="267" /> They must spend two years or so in a training college and are then sent out as foremen.  They eventually reach the rank of foresters, grade 2 or grade 3 and finally become foresters, grade 1.  These men are not established officers and I think the time has arrived when they should be placed on the established list, so that they would have an incentive to co-operate with the Minister in carrying out the work of afforestation.  As they are at the moment, they have nothing to look forward to.  If because of sickness, ill-health or otherwise, they are compelled to give up their jobs, nothing but privation and want stares them in the face.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his reply last year said that he appreciated all these things and that he would make representations to the proper quarter with a view to seeing if it was possible to get these officers established.  I should like to know from him whether he made these representations and what was the result.  Can he hold out any hope to these officers&mdash;their number is not very large; probably 150 or 160&mdash;that they will be finally placed on the established list and can rest easy that, if they are compelled through ill-health or otherwise to relinquish their posts, their position will be secure?  I do not know what the Minister has done, but it should not be necessary 12 months after the Minister paid such a tribute to these men to have to ask what is the position with regard to them.  The Minister had 12 months in which to do his job, to pay them a tribute in a practical way by getting them established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He cannot say that he is not in a position to do so.  He is the Minister in charge of the Department and he holds a certain power which he can use, if he wishes to do so, as other Ministers have used their power in order to secure increases in wages for their own immediate organisations.  I hope that the Minister will hold out some hope to these men that, within a very short period, they will be placed on the same footing as the ordinary road worker at the moment.  The ordinary road worker who has worked so <Col N="268" /> many hours in the year for so many years is entitled to his pension when he reaches a certain age and these men who carry such heavy responsibilities, as the Minister has admitted, are entitled to at least the same treatment as road workers.  The Minister can do it. All he has to do is to put on the screw, to throw his weight around.</P>

Deputy Dunne is prepared to forget about these things when the crucial moment arrives and something is at stake.  The Minister should assert himself.  If the Minister for Finance is a bit tough, the Minister is big enough physically to overpower him, but he also has the other method of putting on the screw from the political point of view.  The Minister for Finance then will have to toe the line and you will be carrying out the promises you made to these men and helping to bring about peace and contentment in the Department.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to hear the Deputies opposite advocating a better policy for the future with regard to forestry workers than was pursued for the past 16 years.  Deputy de Valera asked the Minister to-day had he any plans.  Since the change of Government in 1948 we have been told by various Deputies that all the plans were there, that they were Fianna Fáil plans, that needed only to be carried out.  It seems that they had no plan as far as these people were concerned. An ex-Minister for Lands is in the House at the moment.  What did they do?  They confined forestry workers to the agricultural rate of wages.  Since we came in, the present Minister has put them on the county council workers' rate and the higher the local council workers' wages go, the higher the forestry workers' wages go.  That is a big improvement.  In County Wicklow, where Deputy Brennan lives, they have £3 15s. 0d. a week.  They had not that in 1947 or 1946.  The higher the road workers go, the higher the forestry workers go.</P>

Private employers do not do that.  Surely it is not right that in a Christian country workers should be so penalised.

It is not right that we should continue an Act under which bank holidays are observed.

      <P>Many people engaged on forestry work in Wexford have a grievance in regard to the wages they have been paid under the previous Government. A State industry should be able to pay a better wage than the agricultural rate.  This Government have £40,000,000 for land reclamation.  There ought to be another £40,000,000 for reafforestation which would enable decent wages to be paid to the men engaged in that work.  Much depends on the local authorities.  Forest workers should be paid on the same basis as county council workers instead of on the basis of the agricultural rates of wages.</P>
      <P>The organisation to which I belong has been in communication with the present Minister on this very important question of Church holidays.  I think the Minister will be meeting the wishes of our organisation if he puts into force the suggestion that I have made.  Local authority and Government workers get bank holidays.  There are only six Church holidays recognised under the Conditions of Employment Act but in County Wexford all Church holidays are observed.  Therefore, the workers there have more holidays.</P>

They get a fortnight's holidays in the year as well&mdash;by trade union action, not by Government action.  The trade union organisations have got a fortnight's holidays in practically all industries at <Col N="273" /> the moment.  The Minister should give consideration to the view that forestry workers should be entitled to a fortnight's holidays and not a week.  According to their conditions of employment, they get six days.  Would the Deputy agree with that?</P>

      <P>There is another duck who has trees on the brain.  There was not much consideration for trees during the emergency when they were hauled up to Dublin to rot in the Park while people in the South of Ireland could not get a block.

    <P>Deputy Burke spoke here to-day for an awful long time all about the forestry workers too, but when he was on this side of the House I never heard him doing anything but praising Ministers and congratulating them on what they did, although they did nothing for the workers.  He is a worker himself and if he had the workers' interests at heart he would be on this side of the House.  He would not be with the Party who were a capitalist Government because that is what they were at the finish.  He is a mental hospital worker and he should be on this side of the House to-day.  I think I have said enough now as there are some other people to follow me who will be crying salt tears over the forestry workers too.  I appeal to the Minister to give consideration to the question of holidays.  Do not let them off for an hour but do as employers do in other parts of Ireland and give them the full day.  This State will not be broke if you give forestry workers <Col N="274" /> Church holidays and if you do, you will have the blessing of the country and of the forestry workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I would like to deal with is the position of farmers who are anxious to plant trees and I think it would be the best way of getting what you might call voluntary timber.  Under the present system grants of roughly £10 per acre are given but the Minister and his Department should know what the cost is at present of fencing an acre of ground. If the Minister is going to say that he is anxious to see farmers planting shelter belts and things of that description surely he should offer some inducement to them.  He knows that the amount they got pre-war for planting and fencing has no comparison with the amount it costs to-day.  This is the first thing the Minister should tackle if he wants shelter belts and acre plots. He should increase the grant so that it would be sufficient at least to enable the farmer to fence the ground he wishes to plant.</P>
      <P>Down in my constituency there is a place called Glenbower, Killeagh, County Cork.  I am sorry that the Minister is going because I know he would be interested in what I have to say on this.  There is not a courting couple in East Cork or perhaps I might almost say North Cork who do not go to Glenbower on May Sunday.  It is the Mecca of courting couples.  In the old bad days of the British Government the gates of that wood were left open for visitors on that day.  Even in the bad days of Fianna Fáil the gates were still open and it took the democratic Minister and the democratic Party over there to come along and close the gates on May Sunday.  I wrote to the Minister's Department early in March about this matter and appealed to him but that appeal apparently fell on deaf ears for the gates were kept closed.  That is one complaint I have to make and I think it is an honest one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear a lot of talk from the Minister about the difficulty of getting land.  Down in Curraglass area there is a man named Maurice Cunningham who offered 80 acres to the Minister <Col N="275" /> a year and a half ago.  The land was not inspected yet and Maurice did not hear anything about it.  I will give particulars and the name of the estate to the Minister when I have finished. If there is any anxiety to get land for planting&mdash;and no one wishes to see land which can be used for agricultural purposes planted&mdash;surely the Minister and his Department should make some attempt at least to reply to the letter when a man writes to offer 80 acres of land for planting.  You would think there would be some time dodgers in the Department who would say: &ldquo;We will sit down now and do ten minutes' work for the munificent salary we are getting and write to this fellow who is offering land&rdquo;.  I am anxious to hear from Mr. Cunningham when some inspector from the Forestry Department will happen to have spare time enough to look around the land which he is anxious to give them for planting.</P>
    <P>We heard a lot of talk from Deputy Dunne about workers' wages but you and I, Sir, being on the roads committee of the county council, are aware that the case made there a few months ago was that the average pay of those men, taken over the 12 months, was only 26/- a week or thereabouts.  The county council workers in Cork County are drawing, for the last two years, £20,000 a year less, because this benevolent Government cut away the amount allocated for roads.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary is interested in holidays and Church holidays, but what about the poor devil who is given 15 weeks' enforced holidays without pay? That is what this Government has conferred on the road workers.</P>

      <P>He might be surprised to know how many were out on enforced holidays, due to the extra assistance <Col N="276" /> Deputy O'Leary's Minister gave them in the way of grants for road works.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dunne made a wise suggestion in connection with wages here.  I realise now that, if the agricultural policy which has driven 21,600 workers off the land in the past two years is going to continue for another few years, we need not bother about tying anyone to the agricultural worker's rate.  There will be no occasion to do that, as like the Red Indian on the shores of Manhattan they will be gone. What we should interest ourselves in, therefore, is seeing what wages forestry workers get.  Deputy Dunne made a wise suggestion, when he spoke of the 18 men who got the two pairs of wellingtons, regarding some of the gentlemen from the Department, of whom he gave a very nice description.  He said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am convinced that the Forestry Section of the Department of Lands, as far as the higher officials and the general staff are concerned&mdash;I do not say this in a spirit of bitterness&mdash; seem to be dominated by one idea, to economise every conceivable moment at the expense of the workers and to keep the few shillings they get each week as low as possible.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is taken from column 1750 of the Official Report for the 3rd of May. Deputy Dunne then suggested that a few of these men should be sent down to the woods for a week or a fortnight. I am glad that the Minister for Lands is also the Minister for Forestry, as I would like to make a suggestion to him, in view of Deputy Dunne's attitude here towards farmers and his anxiety to see that the farmer would not get any more for his milk I am anxious that the Minister for Lands would take one of those farms of about 30 acres and plant Deputy Dunne in it for a year.  Let him carry on there for 12 months and see how he would like it.  I guarantee one thing, that the Minister would never have a stauncher or border advocate for higher prices for farm produce than Deputy Dunne would be after 12 months' work on a 30-acre farm, even in County Meath. There would be a complete conversion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dunne, who is so anxious about this matter, complained about the reason we gave for not increasing <Col N="277" /> agricultural labourers' wages&mdash;that what we were getting for our produce would not pay us.  I do not think the hold-fast movement, which has held agricultural produce at the 1947 price for the past two years, will enable the farmer to increase the wages to bring them into line with either the road worker or the forestry worker.  The time has come, in my opinion, when those two sections must go off on their own.  We should at least endeavour to get their rate up to the rate that is being paid to the unskilled labourer in the building trade, who is building the houses that those unfortunate men will have to live in and pay for.  That building labourer is getting £5 12s. for working with pick and shovel in digging the foundations.  If he is entitled to £5 12s. to dig the foundations for the house in which these unfortunate workers have to live and pay rent, surely the forestry worker is as much entitled to £5 12s.?  A drive in that line would do good.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister for Lands that he should get in line with the Minister for Health, the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Social Welfare, who every two months send down a nice little indication to the local authorities, inviting them to increase the wages, to shorten the hours or to take some other action to improve the lot of their workers.  If the Minister for Finance allows those people to do that, the Minister for Lands should have the same right. Those forestry workers are working for him and if there is a 96-hour fortnight, with special holidays, for one section of the community under local government, and if we have the Minister for Health entering into competition the following week and getting another increase for his team, and the Minister for Social Welfare, not to be outdone, coming in on top of the other two, the Minister for Lands should see that his workers get some lift.  I think he is not using his weight with the Minister for Finance as he should.</P>
    <P>In regard to holidays of obligation, what is the general rule?  The only place I have seen workers working on such holidays is in the cities or in some big towns and with some of the would-be <Col N="278" /> aristocratic gentlemen who are still left here and there in the country.  In a Catholic country like this, we should follow the Catholic rule.  After all, we knock off work to-night and do not come back to-morrow, because to-morrow will be a holiday of obligation. There is an old rule: &ldquo;Do unto others as you would wish others to do unto you.&rdquo;  I think the Minister should follow the example set by this House and give the forestry workers the same holidays that we give to ourselves.  I think that is only fair.</P>
    <P>With regard to the wages, I suggest that there is no longer any use in tying the forestry workers to the rates of wages paid to the agricultural labourers.  I have come to the conclusion that agriculture will have to be the one depressed class, since we evidently are to have a depressed class here.  The farther other classes of the community are moved away from them the better it will be.  The farmer in 1950 cannot be expected to pay a high rate of wages to his workers when he himself is only getting the 1947 price. It is no use pinning the forestry workers to the agricultural rate.  If that is done there will be a flight from forestry just as there is a flight from the land.  The forestry workers will fly just as quickly as did the 21,600 who walked off the land in the past two years.  In any area where house building is taking place close to a village the agricultural labourers are walking off the land to dig the foundations for those houses at £5 12s. 6d. a week as compared with the £3 they would get if they remained on the land.</P>

      <P>The 2/6 per dozen for eggs made Deputy Rooney stand up <Col N="279" /> here looking for a dual purpose hen. Deputy Rooney should not invite me to attack him because I do not like attacking him.  The position is that 21,600 workers were driven off the land in the past two years by the present Government.  The time when forestry workers could be tied to agricultural wages has gone.  The lowest paid labourer on the housing scheme gets £5 12s. 6d. a week and out of that he will have to pay the rent for the houses he is building; the agricultural labourer will have to pay the rent out of the £3 and the couple of bob that he is paid for working on the land.  We must face up to the situation.  The sooner we do that the better it will be.</P>
      <P>I want to see land that cannot be used as arable land turned over to forestry.  If the Minister will investigate the position in the parish of Inch and from that right down to where Maurice Cunningham has his place out in Curraglass, he will find a couple of thousand acres there very suitable for planting.  I would urge the Minister to make some move in that direction if he has the requisite seedlings.  I would like the Minister to tell us when he is replying what kind of seedlings he has at his disposal because, if they are anything like some that I saw, I think it would be a waste of time and land to plant them anywhere.</P>

If an attendant in a hospital is entitled to a 96-hour fortnight, a bonus and an increase of 15/- to 20/- a week in wages, surely the poor devils working on reafforestation are entitled to some better consideration than two pairs of wellingtons between 18 of them.  If the Minister entered into the competition and said: &ldquo;For every <Col N="280" /> five shillings you raise these classes I must get five shillings for my employees&rdquo; the problem would soon be solved.</P>

      <P>Judging by the debate, people have been receiving some education in the matter of reafforestation.  I hope we have heard the last of the wild statements about the millions of acres in five years, as the Clann na Poblachta Party promised the people, and the Minister's 60,000 acres.  The Minister knows full well now that such a target is impossible for many reasons. It is not necessary for me to enumerate them.  If forestry is to be a success we must have, first of all, the goodwill of every section of the community.  We in Fianna Fáil have inherited and have, from the foundation of our Party, carried on the policy of Sinn Féin in so far as forestry is concerned and, needless to say, we welcome any decision of the Minister to go ahead with reafforestation and we assure him of both our goodwill and active co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do hope that the Minister will not be carried away by any political considerations in administering the affairs of this Department.  The Minister might be anxious in order to save certain political faces or for some purpose of that kind, to plant a certain number of trees or a certain type of trees, whether or not it was good policy.  I do not know how many thousand acres the Minister has planted this year but I do hope that he is not going to plant some of the specimens that I have seen, such as that which I now produce. It would require a microscopic examination <Col N="281" /> to find it even in this envelope. If that is the type of tree that the Minister plants, then I appeal to him to put on the brake even if he has to admit that it is not possible to plant more than 10,000 acres per annum, which we believed was true.  For goodness sake, do not plant that type of tree with failure painted all over it and then pretend that up to date you have been planting 10,000 acres per year.</P>

      <P>If there is to be any hope at all for afforestation what is the use of planting something that is going to be smothered by the growing grass? I am informed that some specimens of the type which I have produced have been planted in some of the woods. While the Minister appears very eager and anxious to promote afforestation, nevertheless I find that there is a desire in the Department of Forestry to grant permits for the cutting down of trees. We still live in an age when there are people who would desire to make money even by denuding the country of timber.  I have a case in point where, near the town of Cashel, one gentleman has succeeded in getting a permit to cut down 67 trees in the belt of trees around that district.  It is a good job he did not get a permit to cut down another 67.  I think it is a shocking thing that permits to denude farms of trees are given out in that manner.  I certainly say it should not be allowed by any Minister or any Government. The people of the district, the climatic conditions of the district and the beauty of the area should be taken into consideration by the Minister before allowing people to denude these areas of trees.  At a later stage I hope to have something more to say on that matter.</P>
      <P>With regard to the matter of workers' wages which has been mentioned here, I find that in Tipperary the forestry workers are paid lesser wages than similar workers in other places.  Why should that be?  They have the same hard work to do, the same long journey to trek to work, the same altitude to reach and, if they are lucky enough to have any bicycles, they have to leave them a long way from the particular places in which they have to work.  They have to travel perhaps through portions of woods and frequently get wet.  The deterioration in clothing is unquestionably higher than in the case of any other section of workers so that I hold the forestry workers should get a better wage as they are deserving of it.  I hope the Minister will consider that aspect of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would say again to the Minister that, if he is desirous of getting the goodwill of the people as a whole, he <Col N="284" /> should organise something like Arbour Day such as we had in 1918.  The people then got forestry minded because the political Party of that day decided it was in the interests of the nation to grow more timber and to have afforestation here.  After many years of foreign rule it was not any great wonder to find that a large part of our country had been denuded of timber.  Then we had the last war which helped in no small way to almost finish the job as far as the cutting of trees is concerned.</P>
    <P>I think it is unfair to expect forestry workers to work on holidays.  If they have to be employed on these days I hope the Minister will see that they are paid, as farm workers are paid, but that they should not be asked to do any work that might be deemed unnecessary or servile.</P>
    <P>I am not an authority on the altitude or the height at which tree planting can be carried out with a reasonable hope of success.  I will say to the Minister that we have many mountain areas where experiments might be carried out as to the altitude at which trees can be grown.  Some people claim they can be grown at an altitude of 800 feet, while others say trees have been grown in areas at an altitude of 1,300 or 1,400 feet.  The Minister should have experiments carried out with a view to getting reliable information on that point.</P>
    <P>In Tipperary, in the Cappawhite and Hollyford districts, there are vast areas of land which are suitable only, I think, for forestry.  I am speaking with authority when I say that the people there are anxious that the Minister would take over this land for forestry purposes.  If he does so with the goodwill that is desirable, I am certain there will be no greater guardians of forestry than the farmers living in those areas.  If the Minister decides to take over that land for forestry, it could be attached to the station at Dundrum which is only seven or eight miles away.  That could be done without any great additional expense to the State.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion on which I spoke in the House on forestry, I said that the Forestry Department seemed to think that they could never get <Col N="285" /> away from the large tracts of land for forestry, and that it was only the 300 acre unit, or something near it, that was economic.  If we are to stick to the 300 acre unit we shall never reach the goal that we desire.  I suggest that where, say, 50 acres are any way near a station and are available, they should be taken over and planted.  The station should then be responsible for the work on those 50 acres.  I feel that during the past 20 or 30 years our people have got forestry minded and that they now realise that forestry is one of the things which, in the future, will bring to the country the wealth that we desire.  When we have completed that job, it will be a source of revenue to those who come after us. Afforestation it is true is not the sort of activity that pays immediate dividends. It has to be carried out on a long term policy.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance who is present has been advised, I am sure, that afforestation, at the higher levels, near the source of rivers, is one of the things that is going to help him out in the work of arterial drainage.  Practical people all over the country will tell you that that is so.  In other countries, where afforestation has been carried out at or near the source of rivers, the experience has been that they have very little flooding That is a point that should be borne in mind here, where the rivers do considerable damage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with one point that was mentioned by Deputy Davern, namely, the size of a forestry belt.  I had occasion recently to mention to the Minister a proposed afforestation scheme in South Kerry. I asked him to insist that his forestry advisers would get away from the old traditional idea of experiment.  Up to the present they have not dealt with this question on a wide national basis and do not seem to have the courage to face up to the requirements of the country in regard to afforestation. They are inclined to turn down very good proposals.  Recently I submitted a scheme which dealt with 200 acres. The Department queried it and refused to sanction it because we had not got <Col N="286" /> at least 300 acres in the area.  There was a forestry centre ten miles away from it.  I suggested that the scheme could be worked from that centre, but the Forestry Department would not hear of it.  While they continue to adopt that attitude, I can see no hope at all of advancement, now or in the future.  Why wait until you get 500 or 5,000 acres and neglect the small belts? If you want to take a national view of the matter, you must welcome the people who will offer 100 acres or 50 acres as well as those who will offer 1,000 acres.  In my opinion, that is the right attitude to adopt.</P>
      <P>I have been examining the map in the Library and I am not in agreement with the markings on it, because there are areas in South Kerry excluded from that survey, areas on which very valuable forests were developed in years gone by.  I submit that, so far as South Kerry is concerned, there are areas there which are excluded from that survey and which should be included in the afforestation scheme.</P>
      <P>I contend that the wrong idea is being taken up by the Department of Forestry.  I appreciate their efforts in one direction.  They made an effort to obtain lands in South Kerry and to form a forestry centre but, apart from that, over a long period of years nothing has been done.  It was the present Minister who recently made that advance.  Some 13 years ago I made an appeal to the previous Government to do the thing in a big way and to forget about experiments and piecemeal schemes and all that kind of thing.  I hope that the present Minister will do as the Minister for Agriculture has done in his Department and break with traditions which have been built up in this Department and do the thing in a big national way.  If he does, he will have the full co-operation of the farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>During a number of years in which we debated forestry in this House, Deputy Moylan, the ex-Minister for Lands, told us many times that the one dread he had was the amateur forester who talked so much about something that he knew nothing about.  I am inclined to agree with him and, in fact, did agree with him, <Col N="287" /> because amateur foresters have the idea that it is very easy to plant forests and grow trees.  They believe that you have nothing to do except to take 1,000 plants, put them down in any sort of soil under any conditions and just sit back and wait for them to grow into trees in less than no time.  Nevertheless, those who cannot be described as amateurs or yet described as experts know that there is considerable difficulty and a lot of obstacles to be overcome before a forest can be planted successfully, before a forest can be brought into full growth and trees made to grow straight and up to their proper maturity.  The old saying: &ldquo;As the twig is bent, so the tree shall grow&rdquo; is perfectly right.  When a forest is planted with three-year-old plants and attended to properly, a successful forest will be the result.  Even though the period of waiting may be at least 40 or 50 years, it is worth doing. In this country where we have so much suitable land for forestry, we should definitely at some time or another, decide that we are going to get to the root of this problem and start on a good national scheme on a broad scale.</P>
      <P>I listened with much interest to the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy de Valera, giving his views as to what the Fianna Fáil programme with regard to forestry was during their 16 years of office.  He pointed out how little land was in their possession when his Government took over in 1932, how they carried on until they arrived at the highest figure of 7,350 acres, or something like that, in 1938, and then how, because particularly of the shortage of materials, forestry had to be abandoned during the war years. What struck me as very strange with regard to his statement was that he pointed out that in 1946, when he asked the forestry section of the Land Commission to give him an estimate of what they thought was the quantity of suitable land available for forestry, the officials informed him that approximately 500,000 acres was the quantity of land which they found suitable; that that was the quantity of land that could be made available for a successful afforestation programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="288" /> I am not going to throw any bouquets at the present Minister in connection with the work he has done.  We have, however, an understanding at present of the actual amount of land that is ready for forestry if we had plans ready or sufficient trees to go ahead with it.  We have in the Library a map from which it can be seen that there are some 1,200,000 acres of forest land in this country on which we can go ahead with planting at a rate, we hope, of 25,000 acres per year, which we expect to reach in the next year or two. That is a foundation.  We know the amount of land that is available.  My own opinion is that there is that much more land available.  We have had a statement as to the number of acres to be planted every year and that, in itself, is something which shows a definite improvement over what was stated heretofore.  What I want to know is, who are the amateur foresters? Is it the officials of the Department who pointed out in 1946 that 500,000 acres was the amount of land which they thought was available?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information. What Deputy de Valera pointed out was that the proposal was to plant 600,000 acres, plus 100,000 acres of shelter timber, or 700,000 acres in all. That is not the amount of land available, but the amount which was proposed for forest cover.  There was no statement made as to the amount available.  That was the proposed amount of adequate forest cover suitable for the country's needs.  The map in the Library does not show the amount of land available.  It shows the amount of land that is suitable, if it can be acquired, which, of course, is a different proposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite what Deputy Moylan has said, what I understood Deputy de Valera to say was that, with the forests already planted, 500,000 acres was the amount which the Forestry Department thought was available and which they thought was sufficient.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the estimate of the experts in the Land Commission during the Fianna Fáil régime it was calculated that the requisite forest cover needed for all our purposes in this country was 600,000 acres plus 100,000 acres of rough woods.  They are two different things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not two different things.  They both indicate how much land is to be planted and how much money would be necessary in that connection.  Let us go back further than 1946&mdash;let us go back to 1932.  We know that the two things that are essential are (1) land to plant your forest in and (2) trees to plant. What should have been done in 1932 or 1933 or even 1934 by the then Government was the creation of State nurseries for these plants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Deputy in the House knows, and Deputy Moylan knows, that if we have to rely on a source other than our own State nurseries for the provision of these plants we will not get a sufficient number of them for the large-scale programme of planting which we have in mind, we will not get the proper type of plant which we require and we will not get it as cheap as we could get it from one of our State nurseries. Despite all that, very few State nurseries were created and the number was insufficient in so far as our plant requirements are concerned.  If these <Col N="290" /> nurseries had been created over a period of years&mdash;from 1933 to 1935 or 1936 or even 1937&mdash;we would then, despite the war, have been able to carry on as other countries were able to carry on.  We would have had sufficient plants and I need hardly say that the labour would have been available. We would, therefore, have been able to carry on even a restricted programme of planting of 5,000 or 6,000 acres per year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no good in increasing the acreage of nursery or increasing the number of plants without relating the amount of nursery acreage and the plants thereon to the amount of land available for planting.  The main thing is not to increase swiftly&mdash; even though I may want to, myself&mdash; but to keep the rhythm, the seeds, the plants, the land, each in order so that there will be a possibility afterwards of having the growth of plants at the final transplantation stage for the amount of land you have available each year.  It would be possible to plant 25,000 acres of land next year if you had the plants but that would be useless unless you could continue to plant at the same rate over the following years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  Deputy Moylan claims that if he has not an expert knowledge he has a pretty thorough knowledge of tree planting. I have never asserted that I have anything like a thorough knowledge of this matter but the point I am trying to make is that it will be a long time before we shall have sufficient State nurseries to provide us with the plants to carry on a 25,000 acre or even a 15,000 acre programme of planting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very bad to jump to 25,000 acres immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>The present Minister has started the idea of providing ourselves with more State nurseries so that we shall have more plants available each year for the amount of land which he intends to make ready for plantation when the time comes. Deputy Davern produced a year-old tree plant for inspection.  I think Deputy Moylan will agree that no <Col N="291" /> Forestry Department would be so foolish or so daft, if you like to put it that way, as to dream of planting trees one year old on the mountainside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not, therefore, be worth while on the part of the Minister to make an investigation into the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is being done I may say that I regard it as a most foolish policy.  As a matter of fact, if it is being done it is time for the Minister to take particular notice of it.  If there is anything in Deputy Davern's argument that trees of one year old have been planted and expected to grow in State forests, some bunch of officials somewhere in the Forestry Department should be fired out of it immediately because I am afraid that policy might have the effect of sabotaging our whole forestry programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the three intervening years between the laying down of State nurseries and the increase in the number of plants which we expect we shall require for the increased programme of from 8,000 to 10,000 or 12,000 acres, or whatever it may be, for the coming year, I gathered from the Minister's statement that he intends to carry on during these years and go ahead in an effort to provide himself with more land, acting on the survey that has been made and that can be studied on the map which hangs in the Library. That is the proper idea.  There is only one snag.  Here, again, I am in slight agreement with Deputy Moylan in regard to the acquisition or taking over of the necessary land for forestry.  The Minister has made it clear all along that he will be very slow to come in and take compulsory powers to take land from anybody for forestry.  I can assure him, as I did last year, that if he expects that he will get the people to co-operate wholeheartedly with him in order that he may get 25,000 acres per annum for forestry purposes he is mistaken.  The people have to be educated to forestry.  Only when they realise that maybe rough mountain grazing, cutaway bogland or bottom <Col N="292" /> land, as the case may be, will give them better employment and, at the end of the year, put more money into their pockets, as an industry brought to their back doors, will he have close co-operation.  If he expects that, from the outset, people who own land and commonage, as they own grazing rights over mountains, will co-operate with him, I think he should realise that the Irish people are peculiar when it comes to something like that.  However far his good intentions may lead him, he will find out eventually that he will have to use compulsory powers to get the tracts of 300 acres and over that he wishes to get in order to have an economic unit of forestry in any area or in any centre.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of planting by private individuals.  I do not believe for a moment that planting by private individuals will ever provide us with the State forests that we wish to develop and encourage in every possible way.  In the name of goodness, what good is a grant of £10 per acre and does anybody think that it is an incentive to any farmer or land owner to plant an acre of land?  The Department should introduce some more tempting scheme.  It might, perhaps, as a concession, cut the price of the necessary fencing materials and subsidise, perhaps, a little more the purchase of plants from the nurseries.  If the Department would do that I think they would make the matter more tempting.  A grant of £10 per acre is no attraction to anybody and that is the reason why so little advantage is taken of that type of forestry by private individuals.  The shelter belts got from the local committees of agriculture may be useful but 500 or 600 or 700 trees are a long way off what could be termed a forest.  When a farmer or the best intentioned man in the world sets out to plant and decides that, despite everything, the £10 per acre grant will do and that he will back it up with his own money and plant an acre or two of land which could never be brought to fertility, even under the land reclamation scheme, he goes to some private nursery and I have been told that the lowest price that he can buy three year old plants at is £16 per <Col N="293" /> 1,000.  I do not know whether that is true or not, but I do know from my own experience over the past year that that figure is very nearly correct.  I know from a small plantation produced from the trees procured from private nurseries that the price of trees is altogether too dear.  It would be interesting if the Minister would give us some estimate of what it has been found possible to produce from the few State nurseries we have, what it costs to produce 1,000 plants and bring them to the three year old stage.</P>
    <P>I think that Deputy Moylan need have no fear whatever that the quantity of plants produced from nurseries will pass out the amount of land available. If such were to happen, the best thing to do with the surplus plants would be to turn them over and sell them to a private planter, or encourage others who can plant one, two, three or ten acres to plant these surplus trees at the very reduced prices at which they can be disposed of.</P>
    <P>Last year I brought to the notice of the Minister that it was a very wrong idea for the Land Commission still to keep in their minds this 300-acre belt as the very lowest they can go into in the sense of an economic unit.  They may argue, and with pencil and paper they may provide a genuine argument, as to why this is the least amount of land they find it economic to plant, but I suggest that where you have 50 acres or 100 acres or half a dozen plots containing 50 or 60 acres spaced, say, within a ten-mile radius, the Forestry Department should move in and there should be no stopping because they may think they want the 300 acres together in a single belt.</P>
    <P>It came to my notice&mdash;I am not quite sure whether it was by way of a parliamentary question or otherwise&mdash; that until quite recently there was only one inspector in the Department of Forestry whose duty it was to survey any land that might be available.  If that is true it is a shocking state of affairs that we could not have more of the Forestry Department staff out on surveys.  I hope that the Minister will do one thing, and that is, that for every county of the 26 he will appoint one man for the purpose of surveying <Col N="294" /> available land.  If, in the counties where there is very little land, that inspector finds there is not enough work to do, he could then go to the counties where there is plenty of available land. If it is necessary for these inspectors to use compulsory powers, they should do so.  If they have not to use compulsory powers, all the better, but that is the only way we can provide ourselves with the necessary land.</P>
    <P>I quite agree with the idea of State nurseries.  I imagine that by the time. they are producing we shall have the necessary land available.  If we do not, the fault must lie on the Minister and, so far as I am concerned, he will get the blame if the land is not available and ready.</P>
    <P>There is one thing I like, and that is that the Department of Forestry has decided to bring in experts from abroad.  The Minister told us that they had a gentleman from Holland who is an authority on the planting of bogland and cutaway bog.  They also had a Canadian who could give very useful information to our forestry men here on the planting of mountainsides and the planting of lands at high altitudes. This type of thing is essential.  I will admit that in our own Department we have men, who, in theory, are very skilled with regard to the planting of forests, but they could not be expected to have the practical knowledge of people living in countries abroad, such as Canada, Sweden, Norway, the Scandinavian countries, where forestry is one of their biggest industries.  The bringing here of those men to give advice on the different types of land and plants is a very wise thing.  In doing so the Minister is taking a very wise step.  He is carrying out in a wise manner something with which the ex-Minister for Lands is in total agreement and he may be relied upon to give every help and assistance.</P>
    <P>I now come to the forestry workers. Everybody has sympathy with the forestry workers.  Anybody who has had to work must definitely allow his sympathies to go to the men who have to stay out in the cold and wet to put trees down.  We have not yet been able to find any type of mechanised tree planter which can cope with the work. <Col N="295" /> Forestry workers have a hard task to perform and if it is at all possible they should get better rates of wages.  They should also get better protective clothing.  That has often been asked for here and the Department has been very slow in granting it.</P>
    <P>When these workers are content we find that a better job is done.  They are more satisfied and more eager to go ahead with a task which is of great national importance.  It is something which gives them a means of living. The forestry worker is in steady employment and he has one advantage over the county council worker.  The county council worker may be guaranteed six, nine or 12 months' work, but the forestry worker is guaranteed practically whole-time employment, year in and year out.  It will make him more content if he gets the little extra he asks for and he will then take more interest in an industry which will be for him a life-long one and which will give him so much employment.</P>
    <P>There is another man who is equally important and that is the State forester, who has not got the recognition that he should have got.  State foresters should be established civil servants.  They belong to the outdoor staff of the Forestry Department.  It is most unfair that men who become State foresters through open competitive examination, after spending two or three years in a State forestry college in order to become expert, should be treated as unestablished, and, when they come to retire, should be thrown out into the world without a pension or gratuity of any kind, after doing so much useful work for the State.  The Minister should decide once and for all to give these men established status.</P>
    <P>A State forester is given charge of 200 or 300 acres of mountainside and is told to go ahead and plant it.  The advice he gets from the Department or from senior officers may be very good and many times may be very useless, as it generally is, because the State forester has the practical experience. He knows absolutely what should be done&mdash;the correct way to plant trees, <Col N="296" /> the distances to be allowed between them and the manner in which they should be set down.  In addition to these duties, he also has to take charge of the paying of the men on Saturday night.  He has to keep an account of the amount of plants used and submit accounts with regard to the amount of plants needed to complete a forest. Later, when forests have grown up and have to be thinned, he also has to submit the amount of thinnings taken out, with their value.  He has to arrange for their sale and furnish all these various returns at the end of every week or every month to the Department in Dublin.  In view of all this work, I think these men are entitled to be established and to receive pension rights.  In England, State foresters are treated in the same way as ordinary civil servants&mdash;they are established&mdash;and I tell the Minister that if he were to look into the grievances of these men, he would find that they are not getting a square deal, in view of the amount of good and useful work they are doing and which they will do during the lifetime they devote to forestry.</P>
    <P>We wish the Minister every good luck and will give him every encouragement in his great effort.  If enthusiasm in this House and outside it can be regarded as any pointer, he can safely say that there is no obstacle whatever in his path.  He will not be denied the necessary money because we are told that, even in respect of the borrowing about which we heard so much criticism during the Budget debate, no word of criticism will be levelled at the amount of money to be devoted to forestry.  There are plenty of men.</P>
    <P>There was emigration from this country, but there should be no need for men to emigrate when forests are to be planted.  We have seen a map which shows that 1,200,000 acres of land are suitable for forestry, and as the Minister has adopted the very wise policy of providing himself with more State nurseries, he should have a very successful campaign ahead of him.  Candidly, I think that if he reaches the target of 25,000 acres in three years, it will be very good work.  I hope he does.</P>
    <P>I find myself in agreement with some of the Opposition speakers with regard <Col N="297" /> to the planting of any more than 25,000 or 30,000 acres.  Even if we could do it, it would not be a wise policy because anybody who knows forestry or who has studied what has been done in other countries knows well that a country's wealth is greatest in regard to what is called a rotation forest.  If we have 30,000 acres of trees to be felled this year and, at the same time, 30,000 acres to be planted, so that we can keep up a constant rotation, it represents our greatest source of wealth, as it is the greatest source of wealth of the Scandinavian countries, which have pinned the whole success of their industry to this system.  It reached such a stage in one country that we have been told that legislation had to be introduced in Parliament during the past five years to prevent the farmers and landowners from planting arable land.  The industry was so progressive and the temptation so great that people were going into the planting of land which could be satisfactorily used for agricultural production.  We need have no fear for many years to come that we will use up all the non-arable land which is available for forestry. With all this land at his disposal and with the encouragement which he is getting, the Minister should have no trouble in going ahead with a very speedy and very successful forestry programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise by now that the planting of forests is a very technical matter and I therefore do not propose to adopt the rôle of expert adviser to the Minister.  I merely want to reiterate a point which I made in the course of the debate two years ago and with which, so far as I remember, the Minister did not deal in his reply. One aspect of the planting of timber in which I am particularly interested is the planting of ash.  People throughout the country are bemoaning the small number of young men who are playing our national game, hurling, and it is said that the playing of hurling is declining in almost every county.  If that is so, the cost of hurleys is one of the major factors in that decline.  I do not know what policy the Minister's Department has in respect of the growing of ash, but I suggest to the Minister that, first, from the point of view of a <Col N="298" /> genuine interest in the continuance of this national game, secondly, from the point of view of the community, and, thirdly, as a good economic proposition, the growing of ash should stand very high in the Department's programme for the coming year and succeeding years.  Of my own knowledge, I know that the quality of the hurleys at present put on the market is not nearly as good as it was 15 or 20 years ago.  Hurleys which cost anything from 8/6 to 10/6 are often broken in the course of the first match and, if they are not broken in the first match, by the time the next match comes around, they are far too light for use on the hurling field.  Whatever sap is in them will have dried out and the hurley will have become far too light.  The hurler picks his hurley on the basis of balance and weight but, after a fortnight the hurley is about one-third lighter than it was when bought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I took the trouble to get some statistics, in so far as they can be ascertained, of the number of people playing hurling, not only in Ireland but outside Ireland at present, and I want to use these figures to advance my argument and to impress the Minister with its soundness in relation to the economic value of growing ash.  It has been estimated that in Connacht there are 65 hurling clubs; in Leinster, 254; in Munster, 370; and in Ulster, 88. There are also 25 in Great Britain. That represents about 800 clubs, and, on the assumption that there are two, three or four teams&mdash;minor, junior and senior&mdash;in every club representing, say, 30 players per club, there are approximately 25,000 active adult hurlers.  In addition, it has been estimated that there are about 10,000 boys playing hurling in the national schools and in the colleges, together with 4,000 camogie players.  That makes in all almost 40,000 people&mdash;the actual figure I have here is 38,060&mdash;playing hurling in this country and in Great Britain, not counting those playing the game in America, where, I understand, it is becoming more popular, and in the Argentine.  Assuming that the average hurler will break three hurleys per year, we arrive at a final figure of about 115,000 hurleys in use every year. At an average cost of about 8/- per <Col N="299" /> hurley, that represents £50,000 per annum paid out by the hurling community in this country.  That is a good argument in favour of planting ash as a commercial proposition and making it an important part of the Department's plantation programme.  In the whole country there are only about five or six firms that manufacture hurleys to any reasonable extent.  These concerns are finding great difficulty in procuring suitable ash and, indeed, in procuring any type of ash.  I would suggest, therefore, to the Minister that he should not ignore this problem in the course of the debate this year as he did two years ago.</P>
    <P>If it is true that hurling is declining, one of the greatest reasons for it is the cost of hurleys and the poor quality of the hurleys that are being made at the present time.  I was secretary of a hurling club five or six years ago. It may surprise the Minister and other Deputies to know that the bill for hurleys in that club amounted to £95 a year.  It is true that the Gaelic Athletic Association subsidises clubs to some extent in the cost of hurleys.  I can foresee opponents of the Gaelic Athletic Association saying that the Gaelic Athletic Association are making so much money that it is up to them to look after the planting of ash and to subsidise hurleys to keep the cost down but I submit that this is a national problem.  We are dealing with our national pastime, with the health of the people and with what I consider to be a sound commercial proposition for the Government.  Therefore, I put these figures and facts before the Minister to prove my case and to ask him to take serious notice of the decline in the growing of ash, the decline in the quality of ash that is used in hurleys and, if there is any truth in the argument, the decline in the number of young people playing our national game.</P>

      <P>Táimse ar dhuine de na Teachtaí Dála a bhí i nDún Droma, Co. Thiobrad Arann, tamall ó shoin nuair a tháinig an tAire Tailte chugainn leis an Tornóg Tiormúcháin nua d'oscailt ann agus ba <Col N="300" /> mhaith liom comgháirdeachas a dhéanamh leis faoin obair atá á dhéanamh ag an Roinn i nDún Droma.  Roimh an Cháisc, chinneas ar sheilfeanna leabhar a chur suas in mo thig cónaithe agus fuaireas cuid den adhmad dúchasach a tiormaíodh i nDún Droma.  Cúis áthais dom a rá go raibh an t-adhmad sin go hiontach ar fad.  Nuair a thugas don tsiúnéar é chun é a phlánú, dúirt sé go raibh an t-adhmad san cumasach amach is amach.  Séard a dúirt sé liom &ldquo;Nach gcloiseann tú an radad ceoil atá ag an bplána?&rdquo; Bhí an siúnéar a chuir na seilfeanna suas dom ar an tuairim chéanna.</P>
      <P>Ba maith liom an tAire a mholadh mar gheall ar an obair sin.  Bhí na seilfeanna a cuireadh suas go gleoite snasta.  Deirtear liom gur tuairim 27 faoin gcéad an taisleach a bhíonn in adhmad a thagann ó thíortha eile ach ná bíonn ach dó dhéag faoin gcéad san adhmad a tiormaítear i nDún Droma. Is iontach an difríocht é sin.</P>
      <P>Bhíos ag éisteacht leis an Teachta ó Cill Mhantáin nuair bhí sé ag caint inniu.  Dúirt sé go raibh sé amhrasach i dtaobh oiriúnacht adhmad na hÉireann le haghaidh ard-shiúinéarachta. Dúirt sé gur cheap sé go mbeadh sé ceart go leor le haghaidh garbh-obair. Mholfainn go láidir don Teachta sin píosa adhmaid as Tiobrad Arann fháil agus ansin sílim go mbeadh a mhalairt de thuairim aige.  Tá sé ar intinn agam píosa a bhronnadh air an tseachtain seo chugainn agus beidh a mhalairt de thuairim aige ansin.</P>

    <P>Bhí fear scannán i nDún Droma an lá sin agus rinneadh sé pictiúirí reatha den oscailt.  Ní fhacas na pictiúirí sin go fóill.  Bhí an tAire sa phictúir agus cheapas go rabhas féin ann.  Chualas go rabhadar ar a dtaispeáint ins na pictiurlanna.  Is trua ná fuaireadar níos mó poiblíochta.  Nuair a bheas an cumhacht aibhléise sa muileann agus nuair a bheas an muileann ag obair ar feadh an lae agus ar feadh na hoíche, tá súil agam go bhfaighidh an obair a bheidh á dhéanamh ann an phoiblíocht is dual di.  Tá súil agam go bhféachfaidh an tAíre don taobh sin den scéal. Tá fhíos againn go léir go bhfuil sé de thuairim ag a lán daoíne nach bhfuil aon mhaitheas in adhmad na hÉireann <Col N="301" /> i gcompráid leis an adhmad coigcríche agus ba mhaith an rud é deire a chur leis an tuairim sin.  D'fhéadfaí obair mhaith a dhéanamh sna scoileanna le suim na ndaoine óga a mhúscailt maidir le cúrsaí crann agus mionchoillte. Is beag teach sa tír, go háirithe sa nGaeltacht, nach bhféadfaí crainn a chur ina thimpeall nó in aice leis.  Dá ndéantaí sin, bheadh rud éigin le feiscint againn a mhaiseodh an tuath agus a chuirfeadh lena bhfuil an Roinn Foraoiseachta a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Má tá cúis mholta agam i dtaobh an Aire, tá cúis ghearáin agam chomh maith.  Rinne an Teachta Ó Dabhoireáin tagairt don rud seo.  Tá cnoc in aice m'áit dúchais i gCeapach na bhFaoiteach, Co. Tiobrad Árann, agus cé go raibh an áit ar fad clúdaithe fadó le crainn níl ach corr-chrann le feiscint ann anois.  Mar a dúirt an Teachta Ó Dabhoireáin, níl sé ach tamall beag ó Dhún Droma mar a bhfuil muileann agus aontaím leis nuair a deireann sé go bhféadfaí feidhm a bhaint as an áit sin chun cuidiú le coillte Dhún Droma. Dúradh liom le déanaigh go ndúirt cigire éigin ón Roinn nach raibh an áit seo oiriúnach do fhoraoiseacht ach tá daoíne eolasacha eile ann a deireann a mhalairt.  Ní fheadar a ndéarfadh an tAire agus é ag freagairt an bhféadfadh sé cigire nua a chur chugainn le tuarascáil nua a fháil, nó rud a bheadh níos fearr, an bhféadfadh sé fhéin teacht leis an áit a fheiscint agus ansin b'fhéidir go ndéanfaí rud éigín ann.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The map that is to be seen by Deputies at the end of the corridor near the entrance to the Dáil was referred to by more than one Deputy; I heard Deputy Commons refer to it. That map shows an area of 38,764 acres of plantable land in County Limerick. Until I examined that map I thought that a reasonably substantial acreage of land had been already planted in <Col N="302" /> County Limerick, but now I find that that acreage looks very small in comparison with the area which is plantable and which has not yet been planted.  I am afraid that another snag is that all those 38,000 acres might not be available for planting and the point I want the Minister to make clear is how many acres of those 38,000 he expects will be available this year or next year and, indeed, how much of the 1,200,000 acres he expects to be able to get for planting.  I know the location of some of that plantable land specified on the map in County Limerick and I know from my experience, from efforts I made myself in years gone by to make it available to the Forestry Division, that the owners will not part with it, in West Limerick particularly.  It is no good to know that the land is plantable unless we also know that it will be available to the Forestry Division and that it can be transferred from the owners when the Forestry Division needs it.  The owners will not part with that Limerick land because it is more valuable in the way they are using it at the moment unless some new technique can be devised to induce them to part with it. Other portions of that land were offered to the Forestry Division in years gone by and were pronounced unsuitable for afforestation, but judging by what I saw on the map these portions are now marked &ldquo;plantable&rdquo;. It would be interesting if the Minister would clarify the difference between land that is plantable and land that is available for planting.</P>
    <P>I do not want to tire the Minister with a long speech now.  The forestry question is a very interesting one but I am speaking simply as one with very little knowledge of it.  I am only giving expression to ideas of my own and I will not bore the Minister and the Dáil with them at this late hour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>To clear up the point which Deputy Ó Briain has just mentioned, the map on the wall in Leinster House shows the plantable area, that is, the area which is plantable at the moment, but practically every part of the area which is coloured yellow on the map is in the hands of private owners.  It is in that <Col N="303" /> area that the Forestry Department will search and invite offers of plantable land but Deputy Ó Briain said that he has made efforts in the past to get people in that very area to sell some of that ground to the Forestry Department for planting and they refused.  Very good; there is only one thing to do&mdash;forget about that area.  I hope to get 25,000 acres outside these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the 1,200,000 acres depicted in yellow on the map I admit that it will not be easy to induce the people to change over from their old methods of sheep raising and cattle grazing on the hills.  We cannot lose sight of the fact, however, that cattle grazing and sheep raising, particularly on steep slopes, will ruin the grazing capacity of these lands by the ordinary natural process of erosion which must be noticeable to anybody who travels through the hilly areas of this country. Since these areas were denuded of their trees 100, 200 or 300 years ago, the soil is constantly stripping down.  I am gravely concerned that, no matter at what speed we develop under this or any other Government, we will not be able to overtake the amount of land suffering from erosion in time to arrest all the damage.  The day may come when this or some other Government will have to take a decision as between sheep grazing and forestry.  Forestry will pin down the soil at present covering those hills and mountains and will also increase the amount of it.  Whether from the national point of view it is good policy or not I am not sure, not to disturb the people in those areas but allow them to continue the method of usage which will erode the soil, until it leaves the hills little better than barren points of rock or like mixed concrete allowed to set.  Now that we have straightened out and got over the difficulties in relation to expansion of the forestry programme, it is a problem which must cause immediate concern to me and to whoever comes after me and to whoever come after him again, while that problem lasts.  At the moment, we do not propose to acquire land compulsorily for forestry. The present usage of certain hills is <Col N="304" /> only aiding and hurrying the erosion taking place there and that will need very serious consideration.</P>
    <P>Many suggestions have been put forward to the Minister and the Department. The workers have received a considerable amount of attention here. I think they are better treated than ever before.  Whatever one may say about the Government, the present Government has done more to improve their conditions by way of increased wages than they have met with for quite a long time.  In January, 1947, the wages were 44/- a week; in February, 1948, it was 52/-; in March, 1948, it was 57/-; in January, 1949, it was 58/4; and in April, 1950, the minimum was 62/-, the maximum to be levelled off with the rate paid by county councils. There was an exception in one or two counties.  In Dublin, for instance, because of its proximity to the city, the county council rate was £4.  For that reason, for the sake of seven, eight, or ten forestry workers engaged in County Dublin, and because of the particular forest at which they were engaged, it was decided to link up their wages with Wicklow and not to strike a high rate for them because of the exceptionally high wage of Dublin County Council workers.  Taking that into account, we have gone a long way to meet the forestry workers.</P>
    <P>The question of time off for Mass has been raised.  I gave information on this before to the House.  Out of 133 forest centres all over the Twenty-Six Counties, workers turn out for work on Church holidays only at 16 centres and out of the 16 only in two centres does the full gang turn out.  It was Labour Deputies principally who raised this question.  In order to meet them as far as possible, it was decided to substitute the four bank holidays for four of the Church holidays.  I said last year&mdash;and I think also on an adjournment debate here&mdash;that the majority of farmers all over the country do not work on Church holidays.  They regard it as an extra Sunday.  I have always done so myself and it is the custom all over the province from which I come.  I think it is so practically all over the country.  However, if there is an attempt to suggest that I should establish a principle whereby a <Col N="305" /> man will be paid to go to Mass, I will not do that.  I have said on previous occasions that I would much rather that the few out of the whole total would do as the rest of their comrades do throughout the country and observe the Church holiday as a Sunday.  Sometimes I see letters written to me by forest workers who claim they want to get paid for the time taken in going to Mass.  I will not establish that principle.  If it has to come to the time of day when a man wants to get paid for the time taken in going to Mass, I do not think it matters much whether he goes or not, because if he is genuine about his religion he would not be talking in that strain.</P>

      <P>In regard to the conditions under which forestry workers work, it is an outdoor job, a rough and tumble life but a very healthy one.  It is very noticeable that most forestry workers will not change their employment. Let me quote an example.  In Wicklow, where the forestry wages were 58/4d. up to a short time ago and where the county council wages were more than 10/- a week higher, the forestry worker stuck to forestry work and did not seek work from the county council.  The vast majority of forestry workers like the job and give of their best.  Now and again in every gang there is one crank or disturber who does not want to work, but that is only natural.  The vast majority like the job and I am proud of the work they are doing.  That is one of the reasons why I have been determined to deal with them as fairly and as liberally as possible.  Their work will not be fully appreciated in this generation, not until some future date.  I regard them as being some of the pioneers, contributing <Col N="306" /> largely and in a manly way towards building up the nation and taking up the leeway in this young State. They are doing a good job of work and they like it.  Some Deputies are inclined to exaggerate the hardships. They do not suffer any more hardship than tens of thousands of small farmers all over the country who have wrestled with nature and with the elements in order to knock a living out of their small-holdings.  Compared with that, they have definitely an easier lot.</P>
      <P>The question of being caught out in bad weather on the forest where they are planting, draining and fencing has arisen; but every farmer who goes out to work in the morning has to meet that kind of thing.  Some Deputies tried to make a joke of the fact that only two pairs of boots were supplied among so many workers in a gang. The fact remains that in very few instances are rubber boots necessary, except where there is a particularly bad job of drainage to be done, perhaps in a soft, boggy area and in that case it is not proposed to put the whole gang on the job.  Some of the men would be working on hard, dry ground. There is no scarcity of the rubber boots and for men engaged in work where ordinary boots will not protect them, or doing wet or muddy work, there is no shortage, scarcity or stinginess in the protective clothing made available. I would like to see the workers treated as fairly as possible, because, with the exception of the odd crank or disturber whom you cannot eliminate from any section of any body of people, the vast majority are a decent, honest crowd, willing to do their best and taking an intense delight and interest in the work they are doing.  I move to report progress.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; the Committee to sit again.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 23rd May, 1950.</P>
