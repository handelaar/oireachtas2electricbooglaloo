      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state whether any estimate has been made of the increases in the costs of goods imported from the dollar areas since the £ was devalued, and if he can give the percentage increases in the costs of (a) food, (b) other consumption goods, (c) capital equipment, and (d) raw materials imported from these areas since September, 1949.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been provisionally estimated that the price level of goods imported from the United States of America and Canada in the three months November, 1949, to January, 1950, inclusive, was 14 per cent. higher than for such imports for the nine months January to September, 1949.  Imports from these countries account for about 95 per cent. by value of all dollar imports.  The corresponding estimates of the increases in various categories were: (1) Food and other consumption goods, 12 per cent.; (ii) producers' capital goods ready for use, 42 per cent.; (iii) materials for industry and agriculture, 12 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is concerned <Col N="1907" /> with restrictions on emigration only in so far as emigration to employment is in question.  These restrictions, which were imposed by the Government from the early days of the emergency period, were intended to prevent abuses which indiscriminate and uncontrolled engagement of workers for employment outside the State might involve, and to secure the retention within the State of adequate numbers and classes of workers for essential purposes.  The restrictions have varied from time to time and now apply only to the following classes:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  Males in employment or for whom suitable employment here is available or will be available within a reasonable period.</P>
      <P>(b)  Males who refuse an offer of suitable employment in this country or who leave employment voluntarily without just cause or who lose their employment in circumstances within their own control. (This latter restriction operates for a period of six months from the date of event.)</P>
      <P>(c)  Males under 19 years of age (not enforced where training is offered in skilled trades or professional employment or in cases of straitened circumstances).</P>
      <P>(d)  Men whose services are deemed to be essential in this country on grounds of special experience or qualifications.</P>
      <P>Exemptions are provided for professional persons, e.g., clergy, doctors, engineers, nurses, teachers, university graduates, as well as seasonal migrants to agriculture, fish curing and beet sugar production.</P>
      <P>The refusal of travel identity cards or other travel documents on grounds other than these particular restrictions on emigration to employment is not a matter for my Department.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Supplies of Maize Meal.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state on what date it became apparent that supplies of maize meal would be in doubt after September, 1950, and on what date this information was conveyed to farmers so as to give them sufficient time to break additional land this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>A rational appraisal of the price support programme at present being operated by the United States Government in respect of maize coupled with the failure of the Argentine crop, makes it apparent that dependence on this cereal is fraught with a measure of uncertainty in the coming year greater than that ordinarily associated with it.  These considerations combined with the knowledge that we have now available a variety of barley capable of yielding from 40 to 60 cwt. of grain per statute acre, and that it is a short straw variety strongly resistant to lodging, indicated the desirability of warning farmers generally in advertisements, the first of which was published on 25th February last, and public statements in this House and elsewhere, of the desirability of making full provision for at least their own requirements of feeding stuffs in the coming year.</P>
      <P>I avail of this occasion to add that experiments are now proceeding to test the reliability of work done in the United States and Great Britain which suggest that appropriate fortification of barley meal with aureomycin may well demonstrate that such barley meal will in the future be a markedly superior feeding stuff to any maize meal at present available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not admit that an advertisement appearing on the 25th February was a bit late, if those who were expected to break <Col N="1909" /> up additional land in view of the position to which he has referred were to get a decent chance of doing so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>For any purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that given that notice, as it was given by spoken word repeatedly before that date and by official advertisement reiterated two or three times, farmers had a fair opportunity of preparing land for the sowing of barley which, as the Deputy will recall, is a cereal ordinarily sown later than oats or wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to take it from the Minister's statement that his great god maize has now been overthrown?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, the Deputy may take it that it is now being so assiduously supported that it is rising so high that we cannot even reach it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As my question will show, I asked the Minister for certain dates and in his reply he avaded the question entirely.  I want to know why farmers were not given reasonable notice of what the position is likely to be so that they could break additional land in order to produce a substitute against the effects of the change that is taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will see by the resultant crop that the notice has been adequate and I confidently anticipate a substantially increased acreage of Ymer barley.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was a bad prophet as to the price of maize.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state what action he has taken, or proposes to take, to ensure constant supplies of maize meal in areas such as north-west Cavan where, because of the scarcity and price of potatoes, maize meal is an essential element in the diet of the poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the Deputy's view that the people of West <Col N="1910" /> Cavan should be required to depend on maize meal as a significant element in their diet.  I would remind the Deputy that adequate quantities of wheaten flour and bread made therefrom are provided for every household on a subsidised basis, and I would be obliged to the Deputy if he knows of any cases where maize meal constitutes a substantial essential element in the diets of any family if he would give me particulars so that urgent measures may be taken to relieve any such distress, which, so far as I am aware, has not been manifest in recent times either in Cavan or any other part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister has his own officials who, I know, are in possession of the facts as they have existed there for some weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to inform the Deputy that I know of no case in all Ireland nor have I known of one for a very considerable time, in which maize meal constituted an essential element in the diet of a family.  I repeat my invitation to the Deputy; if he knows of any such case I would be beholden to him if he would let me have particulars so that I could ask my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, to take immediate and urgent measures to relieve that distress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister admits that an area like that is different from other areas.  The potato crop is gone in December, and with potatoes making £20 a ton how are people with large families to feed their families unless they resort to the use of maize meal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I speak not only with the specialised information available to me in the Department but with a lifetime of experience having been born and reared in a congested area where the average holding was 12 acres.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite frankly, as soon as the Minister for Food in Great Britain signifies his readiness to end the discussions which are at present in progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has repeatedly emphasised the importance of conveying information to producers as to the prices which will obtain. Surely he will admit, now that we are half way through 1950, that it is not unreasonable to expect to hear from him the prices which are likely to obtain in 1951 for eggs produced here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is apparently absent from the Deputy's mind that I initiated steps to create a situation in which I would be able to furnish that information as far back as last November, but certain electoral developments in Great Britain and subsequent developments together with his other duties, have so far engaged the attention of the Minister of Food that he has found it impossible to date to finish the negotiations.  I hope, however, that they will be completed in the early future.  I am sure that the Deputy will agree that it would not be becoming unduly to press the British Minister of Food as long as it is thought possible for us to consult his convenience.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether, having received the views of the co-operative societies on his proposal to stabilise the price of milk for a period of five years, he <Col N="1912" /> will now announce his policy in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>My policy in regard to all matters relating to the production of milk and milk products is to keep in touch with the farmers and their co-operative societies for the purpose of collaborating with them in the expansion and development of the industry on a basis which will enable the producers profitably to market a larger and larger volume of produce at home and abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say, now that he has collaborated with the producers, when he is likely to announce his own policy regarding this industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my policy.  I think it is a very good policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has already collaborated with the producers by asking them to accept a scheme outlined by himself.  He has had replies from these committees, I understand, and it is surely to be expected from him that, having had these discussions and replies, he will now tell the country and relieve the producers of the uncertainty which now undoubtedly exists by making a clear statement of what his own policy is regarding this important business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy appears to have overlooked the fact that collaboration is a continuing process.  One does not collaborate with a man to-day and hit him on the head to-morrow morning.  If I consult with and advise the farmers, I see that as a continuing process and I think it is the proper approach to allow this matter to develop in consultation with the farming interests concerned.  The Deputy will no doubt have observed that I took occasion to meet the annual meeting of the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society in this matter last week. I propose to continue meeting groups of farmers to discuss this matter with them and have little doubt that we shall find a means of formulating procedure which will ensure the farmers an opportunity profitably to market a larger and larger volume of produce at home and abroad.</P>

      <P>The proposal was initiated in September, <Col N="1918" /> 1935.  The site is the northern part of the Rotunda Gardens and is, approximately, one and a half acres in area.  The site was acquired in fee simple from the governors of the Rotunda Hospital on the 20th October, 1939, in consideration of a sum of £2,000.  The decision to hold a competition for a design was taken on the 15th March, 1940.  The first advertisement appeared on the 26th January, 1946, and the 31st July, 1946, was fixed as the closing date.  The result of the competition was announced on the 20th August, 1946.  In accordance with the published conditions of the competition, Mr. John J. Robinson, M.Arch., F.R.I.A.I., F.R.I.B.A., acted as assessor, and selected the design submitted by Mr. Daithi P. Hanly, B.Arch., M.R.I.A.I., A.R.I.B.A., A.M.T.P.I.  The design comprises a sunken garden with a pool in the form of a cross, the main axis running east to west, the principal entrance lying at the east of the site and a large sculptured monument at the western end. The cost of the scheme was estimated at £23,000, but this did not include the cost of the sculpture, of which no estimate was made, pending a decision as to the actual design of this feature. The following provisions for the scheme were made in the Vote for Public Works and Buildings:&mdash;</P>

    <P>At a meeting of the Government, held on the 14th May, 1948, when the question of effecting economies in the Vote for Public Works and Buildings was under consideration, it was decided to defer this scheme with a number of other projects.  There has been no decision not to proceed with the execution of the winning design.  As the Deputy has already been informed, the scheme has been deferred and the temporary use of the site has been granted to the Rotunda Hospital authorities, who made urgent representations for it for infant welfare purposes.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 41, before Section 67 a new section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The board shall pay to each person who was immediately before the establishment date a director of the Grand Canal Company a sum equal to the fees received by him as director of that company during the year 1949.</P>
      <P>(2)  This section does not apply to a director of the Grand Canal Company who becomes an original member of the board.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment which was carried in the Seanad to provide compensation for the directors of the Grand Canal Company.  The House will remember that in the Bill, as originally introduced, there was a section which proposed to provide compensation for the directors of both the Grand Canal Company and Córas Iompair Éireann and the amount of compensation was to be two years of their remuneration as directors.  The matter was discussed here at some length and eventually, on a free vote of the House, the section was defeated by a substantial majority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter was raised again in the <Col N="1929" /> Seanad on the Committee Stage and, on the Report Stage, two amendments were moved, one covering the directors of the Grand Canal Company and the other covering the directors of Córas Iompair Éireann.  The provision for compensation in both amendments was one year's remuneration instead of two years'.  These amendments were debated at some length and eventually were adopted unanimously by the Seanad.  I am putting the amendments before the Dáil and I am recommending them to the Dáil, but I propose, as on the former occasion in connection with the section originally introduced, to leave the matter to be decided by the House by way of a free vote.</P>
    <P>I do not know that it is necessary to say very much on these amendments. The principle was fully discussed here in Committee on the original section. I am recommending the amendments as I think they are reasonable.  It was argued in the Seanad that this was a matter of principle.  Some Senators held that provision should be made for the directors of the Grand Canal Company, but that provision should not be made for the directors of Córas Iompair Éireann.  If it is a matter of principle, as I stated in the Seanad, I believe the directors of both companies are entitled to compensation. I think it ought to be both or none. I know that here as well as in the Seanad there was a view strongly held that the directors of Córas Iompair Éireann should not be compensated and that provision for compensation should not be made for them.  It is true to say also that, when the original section in the Bill was being discussed in the Dáil, it seemed to be the feeling of the House that they would be prepared to provide compensation for the directors of the Grand Canal Company. Be that as it may, the two amendments are now before the House.  As I say, I accepted them in the Seanad and I am recommending them to the Dáil. If the amendments go to a division, while leaving them to a free vote of the House, I propose to vote for them myself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether it is possible for us to consider these amendments <Col N="1930" /> on their merits depends entirely upon the attitude of the Government.  Do the Government want these amendments carried?  I think the House is entitled to that information.  So far as we are concerned, our attitude will be determined by the answer we get to that question.  We know the history of this proposal.  The Minister brought to the House a Bill containing provisions relating to the payment of compensation to directors of Córas Iompair Éireann and of the Grand Canal Company losing their position because of the provisions of the Bill.  So far as the House was aware until the relevant section of the Bill came up for discussion, the Government had considered the matter fully and had decided to put this proposal to the Dáil and to recommend its enactment by the Dáil. When the section was discussed here, we found that the Minister spoke against it.  Any Deputy who wants to check the accuracy of that assertion can do so in the Official Report.  In his speech on the section, the Minister did not say one word in favour of it and, in the course of the discussion that followed, it was quite obvious that there was a serious cleavage of opinion amongst Deputies supporting the Government concerning the proposal.  The debate ended with Deputy Larkin making a speech in which he pleaded to Deputies on his side of the House to vote against the proposal and to Deputies on this side of the House to vote for it.  That nonsensical method of doing public business does not appeal to us.  When the division was taken, we found that a majority of members of the Government who had participated in the division voted against the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now have a proposal similar in principle back from the Seanad.  It was, I understand, carried there upon the Minister's assurance that he would recommend it to the Dáil.  He is recommending it to the Dáil.  Is he doing so as an individual or as a representative of the Government?  If the Government are trying to play politics in connection with this matter, so far as we are concerned we will direct our manoeuvres so as to cause the maximum embarrassment, irrespective of the <Col N="1931" /> merits of the case.  We are prepared to discuss the merits of the question and to vote according to the merits if the Government follow the same line. If, however, we are presented with the position that the Government want to get it carried but want to ensure that any unpopularity that may attach to it will be shouldered by Fianna Fáil and that the Government will be able to escape it, we will regard that as releasing us from considering the matter on its merits and we will consider it as a political manæuvre.  If we have on this occasion the same spectacle as before of members of the Government coming in and voting against a Government recommendation, we will keep the Minister going from this House to the Seanad and back again as long as the Standing Orders of each House permit it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was one of the few Deputies who spoke in favour of compensation for the directors of both companies when this Bill was last before the Dáil. I did so because I felt and still feel that in a matter of this kind there is an important principle at stake and a principle which should not be clouded by any views with regard to individuals or by any particular matters in connection with either Córas Iompair Éireann or the other company.  Here, by an Act of this Oireachtas, we are destroying both Córas Iompair Éireann and the Grand Canal Company.  We are putting them out of existence and, at the same time, we have the right in this Parliament to decide what director or which of the directors should be compensated and, if so, in what way and to what extent.  We are both judges and interested parties in the same matter.  For that reason, I think a very strict rule should be observed and it should be the rule which has always been followed that, where by legislation we are destroying any existing office, we should provide for compensation for holders of that office.  I realise that objection was taken with regard to this particular matter for probably very good and very sound reasons in so far as the directors of one of these boards &mdash; the directors of <Col N="1932" /> Córas Iompair Éireann &mdash; are concerned. I think it is unfortunate that those who held those objections should allow their particular grounds of argument against the directors of Córas Iompair Éireann to cloud the principle.  If we abolish an office without providing for any compensation for the holders of that office, it is just the same as if, under this Act, we were providing for the dismissal of one, two or 100 workers &mdash; holders of redundant positions &mdash; and providing that they should not be compensated.  I do not see that there is any difference in principle between the position of the lowest worker in either of these companies and that of a director.</P>

It is for that reason that I urge Deputies to accept these amendments inserted by the Seanad.  I do not think any useful purpose could be served by the intervention of Deputy Lemass in this matter.

      <P>Prior to the adjournment of this debate one evening, Deputy Lemass was all out to ensure that any opposition from any side of this House which would seek to prevent any compensation being paid to these directors would be opposed by Fianna Fáil.

It is an important matter and one that should not be decided upon hastily one way or the other.  Certainly, I hope the considerations of cheap Party politics&mdash;evidenced by Deputy Lemass &mdash;will not influence other speakers in this debate.  It is perfectly clear that Deputy Lemass, who has a very deep knowledge of matters of this kind, is quite determined that if he possibly can he will have the best of both worlds in relation to this matter.  Of course we have not been told what view Deputy Lemass himself takes on this matter now, but I hope that other members of his Party will approach the matter from loftier motives than that which he evidenced.  I urge, therefore, that the amendments tabled by the Seanad be accepted by the House.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass very seldom speaks unnecessarily or uses unnecessary phrases.  Very seldom will he be open to a charge of padding out what he may have to say but, certainly, it was completely unnecessary for him to tell us this afternoon that on this amendment he proposed to play politics.  I think that was obvious from the debate in this House on the last occasion.  Deputy O'Higgins made a reasoned case for the amendment but, to my mind, he approached it from an unrealistic point of view.  I do not think we can consider these amendments as if we all lived in Cloud Cuckoo Land.  This amendment, particularly the second amendment which refers to the directors of Córas Iompair Éireann, proposes to compensate people who, to the mind of many of us, have not earned that compensation and who are, in fact, in receipt of substantial emoluments from their directorships of other companies.  It may be argued against me that I am illogical and that I am not considering this as a matter of principle if I say that I would approach this question in a completely different frame of mind if it could be pointed out to me that there was even one individual whose livelihood, or even a portion of his livelihood, depended upon the director's fees of which he was in receipt either from Córas Iompair Éireann or the Grand Canal Company.  That position does not apply.  Let us be realistic in our approach to this matter.  We know that the gentlemen we propose to compensate are gentlemen who, to put it colloquially, are pretty well fixed as it is.  There is one matter on which I should like the Minister to enlighten me and the House in general.  I am not quite sure if my facts are correct or not, but I should like to know how many directors are common to the Grand Canal Company and Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>

      <P>I invite the Minister and Deputies on every side of the House to approach the consideration of this matter purely on the merits of the recommendation, if there are any merits.  Deputy Lemass has taken up a rather interesting attitude in the course of the short statement he made. He said to the Minister that, if the Government want this, &ldquo;we will support them&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>The Deputy did not say the same in relation to some other measures.  He did not say it with reference to land rehabilitation or with reference to the Land Bill, which caused so much discussion and was the cause of so much obstruction; neither did he say it in relation to other measures of equal importance to the one that is now being discussed.  To my mind, this is the most brazen kind of proposal that has ever come before the House during my time, and, for the information of Deputy O'Higgins, let me say that I was sitting in this House during the discussions on the 1924 Amalgamation Act and the 1933 and 1944 Acts.  The 1944 Act was the one that went through this House after Deputy de Valera insisted on having a general election in order to establish this dictatorship that we are now getting rid of.  We all learn in the school of experience, and the <Col N="1936" /> Deputy has had his lesson from the people.</P>
      <P>This is the most brazen <i>ad misericordiam</i> appeal that I ever listened to. It is made on behalf of persons who, without any disrespect to them personally, can be properly described as professional directors.  Deputy Lemass, if he gets up again, will not, I would imagine, assert that they were selected and put on the board under his 1944 Act because they had an intimate knowledge and personal experience of the working of a transport concern. Deputy Lemass knows, and so does the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that the shareholders' directors, as they are called, rightly or wrongly, are the nominees of the banks who act as trustees on behalf of the shareholders.</P>
      <P>These banks, over a long period of years, were represented at the meetings of the ordinary shareholders and the chairman, on innumerable occasions, to the knowledge of the Minister and Deputy Lemass and other Deputies, had wide powers.  When a motion was challenged at the shareholders' meetings, he was able to plank down 3,000,000 bloc votes on the table and rule out even eloquent spokesmen like Deputy Lemass from criticising the work of the directors on any particular matter.  When it came to voting for the election of directors, it was a question of the nominees of those assembled in the hall as against those who were nominated beforehand, and the 3,000,000 bloc votes were planked on the table again and the poor people proposed in the hall got short shrift.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the type of person for whom the Minister is now recommending payment of compensation.  There are other serious aspects of this whole proposal, but I will confine myself to this one for the moment.  If Deputy O'Higgins were here long enough he would be aware that under previous Acts, when the companies were amalgamated, and later, provision was made for compensation for what were described &mdash; I do not know who invented the term &mdash; as redundant directors.  Deputy O'Higgins says there is a serious principle involved here, and that is that the directors should get the same treatment as <Col N="1937" /> the men who lost their positions under previous Acts.  If Deputy O'Higgins knew the history of the 1924, 1933 and 1944 Acts as well as Deputy Lemass does, he would know that hundreds of railwaymen and transport men were given the right to go before an arbitrator, but in hundreds and not individually. Under all these Acts, in the plainest of English it is written that compensation must be provided &mdash; and it has been paid under those Acts &mdash; for redundant directors who had many other directorships apart from the railway.</P>
    <P>Why is it now suggested that we should give compensation to these gentlemen?  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in the course of the various discussions on this measure, gave innumerable reasons why these directors should not be compensated. Why should we compensate, for the first time, individuals, no matter how highly placed they may be, for proved incompetence and inefficiency?  Deputy Lemass may endeavour to cover up what some of his colleagues said in the other House, but surely he cannot deny that it was the stockholders' directors who were responsible, by their silence, for the bankruptcy of the concern and forced the members of this House to take £4,000,000 out of the pockets of the taxpayers in order to balance the budget of Córas Iompair Éireann for the year ended 31st March this year?</P>
    <P>We are asked to go around to the taxpayers to collect money for those individuals, who are very wealthy men and who are supposed to have a wealth of brains as well as wealth in other respects.  We are asked to collect for them the equivalent of one year's fees. Let us discuss this matter on its merits. I absolve the individuals concerned from a good deal of responsibility because, under the 1944 Act, they were put in as super yes-men.  It was laid down in that Act, which was supposed to have been passed by the will of the people, that unless one man, the chairman, was present, they could not hold a meeting and, even if the other directors expressed a particular point of view, he could oppose it.  The point of view of the superman, the dictator, <Col N="1938" /> prevailed and the stockholders' directors had very little power or authority. If they had any power or authority, surely they had the right to dissent from decisions when serious decisions were taken at board meetings?  Even if they did dissent, it did not much matter.  I should like to know from the Minister if the stockholders' directors ever insisted on having recorded in the minutes their dissent from the policy of squandermania and sabotage in connection with the railway system.</P>

I say put these on the same level as those transport men who were given an assurance here under previous legislation that they would get compensation; but when they went before arbitration they found out their mistake. Put the directors who were responsible for the mismanagement, incompetence and proved inefficiency of our transport on the same level as the men who lost their jobs on the railway under previous Acts and who never got as much as one penny compensation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take that.  We have had on occasion to deal with Bills here under which, either directly or indirectly, men lost their employment. That was full-time employment. That employment was their livelihood. Without that employment they either became a burden on the rates or were compelled to seek ways and means of supporting themselves and their families elsewhere.  During that employment they gave full-time service, often under very arduous conditions and for very low wages.  They gave that service direct to the undertaking by which they were employed and their responsibility was to that undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whom, in fact, do these directors represent?  Whom do they serve? When the 1944 Act was passing through this House the case made on behalf of these present directors of Córas Iompair Éireann, was not that they would be directors serving the national interest and ensuring that we had efficient and effective transport from the point of view of the national interest; they were there to serve, protect and safeguard the interests of the private shareholders.  That was the justification.  I recall very vividly that when Deputy Lemass, who was then <Col N="1942" /> Minister in charge of the Bill, referred to the doubts in many of our minds as to whether or not his new system of transport would be effective, he stressed at great length the fact that these directors' shareholders would be sitting there with the direct responsibility, so far as the shareholders were concerned, of making the undertaking efficient and effective in order that dividends would be available for the private shareholders.</P>
    <P>I am quite prepared to admit that there is a principle involved but it seems to me that we are going to the wrong pay office.  If these directors &mdash; I do not want at the moment to go into the question as to whether or not they have satisfactorily performed their duties &mdash; have carried out their responsibilities and served the people they were appointed to serve, then it is to the shareholders of these two undertakings they should look for compensation. The shareholders of both undertakings have been dealt with very generously and they can well afford to pay compensation.  That is my feeling in regard to this matter so far as principle is involved.</P>
    <P>Let us now examine it from another aspect.  Let us examine it from the point of view of loss of employment. I wonder could the Minister, or anybody else, tell us how many hours' service these directors gave to these undertakings in any month in any year. What were they paid for that service? Let us make a comparison then between their fees and the number of hours, not that they worked but during which they attended meetings of the directors, and relate that to the number of hours worked by the ordinary labourer on both the canal and rail system and the wages paid to that labourer for his work.  It is all very well to talk about principle, but we invariably seem to apply the principle to those who least need protection while denying it to those who are in immediate and urgent need of it.  Deputy Davin has pointed out that under previous Transport Acts thousands of men met with very grievous misfortune and there was very little principle applied to them and very little sympathy.  Some of those on <Col N="1943" /> whose behalf our generosity and sympathy are requested to-day were not altogether unconnected with the manner in which many thousands of these ordinary labouring men were dealt with under that past legislation.  I do not know what the views of the members of the Government are in this matter, but there are certain things upon which one has got to stand.  I gathered from the Minister when he referred to this matter in an earlier debate that his view was that in this type of legislation there was a certain continuity of approach on the part of Governments, irrespective of their Party or political outlook and that with very considerable reluctance he was following that system of continuity and embodying this principle in the Bill so far as compensation to the directors is concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I am correct in that; he is there to make his own explanations and is quite well able to make them, but that definitely was the impression I got.  Certainly, I could not imagine, after the debate we have had in this House, that any feeling could exist amongst any large sections that there was a genuine and definite case to be made in support of this section of the Act other than the worn, threadbare and theoretical one of principle referred to by Deputies O'Higgins and Dockrell and indicated by the Minister in introducing this section in the earlier debate in this House. Whether there is a continuity of principle or not, so far as the drafting of these Bills is concerned, there is also the question of at least trying to be logical and consistent in our approach to the matter.  I was twitted by Deputy Lemass at the end of the last debate for having appealed to the supporters of the Government to vote against the section and of having appealed to Fianna Fáil to support it.  I am prepared to do the same thing again.  Every time I find a person of Deputy Lemass' standing and political sagacity leaving himself wide open to that kind of approach, I am going to take advantage of it.  Deputy Lemass, for long periods in this House, in the most eloquent and capable manner possible, <Col N="1944" /> quite frankly, with very little material at his disposal, made a case in defence of the management of Córas Iompair Éireann that, possibly, no other member of the House could have made. He rejected indignantly the various charges made against them and defended not merely the chairman, but also the board of directors.  I then said, towards the conclusion of the debate on the Committee Stage, that if he believed in what he said during the course of the debate he should vote for the section.  I do the same to-day, but the Deputy knows very well that this section is not popular and that, even with all his eloquence, he will find very considerable difficulty in justifying outside this House the payment of compensation to the gentlemen with whom we are dealing now.  Even when he formulated the 1943 Transport Act he had not much faith in these directors.  He took away from them every possible vestige of power.  He made them merely the nominal representatives of the private shareholders and, so far as any question of the effective running of the concern arose, so far as there was any question of giving the nation an effective transport system in future, he placed his whole trust and dependence on the chairman in the new machinery he was building around him. So far as the directors were concerned he said to them: &ldquo;You are to be nice boys, sit there and do what you are told.&rdquo;  If they did what they were told, let them take the responsibility for what has happened; if they did not do what they were told, then we have still to hear it.  They cannot have it both ways.  If they were effective directors exercising authority and responsibility, then let them take the consequences for what has transpired, but if they were not in effective control and if they had no authority they could not do any effective work and therefore they are not entitled to compensation for loss of an office, the duties of which they never carried out.</P>
    <P>The position is somewhat different in regard to the Grand Canal Company. Deputy Lehane has indicated that, in respect to the Grand Canal Company, he might be induced to take a different view from that which he has expressed <Col N="1945" /> in regard to the other directors.  I hope he will not make any such distinction.</P>
    <P>There have been many companies in this country with good and bad reputations but I know of only one group of employers in this country who repeatedly, time after time, have openly stated that they are not prepared to defend the condition under which their employees have had to work.  That is the record of the Grand Canal Company.  For more years than I care to remember, the men working that system have worked under conditions that any Christian country should have been ashamed to have revealed publicly.  Men have had to work 24 hours for seven days a week. They have worked not only under the ordinary laborious conditions associated with an inland waterways system, but they have worked exposed to all the dangers of a canal boat travelling during the night with none of the ordinary safety devices which an up-to-date system would have provided. Many of these men have lost their lives and their bodies have not been found for days.  Some of them have even been found smothered in the cabins of their vessels.  They have all the responsibility of boatmen and they have also to work as dockers and stevedores, loading and unloading.  When required they have to act as lock-keepers. They have also to work as skilled engineers, as captains in charge of a boat and again as members of the crew.  For all these combinations of jobs, for the dangers they constantly incur and for the intolerably long hours they have to work, they get less wages than the average general labourer working in Dublin, paid to them by those for whom we are now asking compensation.</P>
    <P>Within the last year a final opportunity was afforded to these directors, even in their last days of glory, of being generous in making some adequate provision for the men who carried on the system and made it possible for them to draw their dividends and directors' fees.  A decision was given by the Labour Court in favour of an increase in wages and there was money available to meet the increase but these men had not the <Col N="1946" /> decency even in that last hour of saying: &ldquo;Whatever may be our view of the future of the system, even if we were never to sit here again, at least we shall have the decency to show some appreciation of these men, many of whom have served us faithfully for 30 or 40 years; we shall give them this increase because it has been justified.&rdquo; Not even then had they the courage to take the responsibility.  They had to go to the Minister and ask his permission whether they could carry out the decision of the Labour Court.  The Minister told them that until this Bill became law they were still in charge of the canal company.  The result was that, even in those last days of their work, they did not have that little touch of generosity and human feeling that makes the difference between a good and a bad employer.  The men got their increase eventually but they lost three months of retrospective pay.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would tell us who is actually the controlling shareholder in the Grand Canal Company? Is it correct that so far as effective control is concerned, it is vested in one man who has been a director of the company for many years and who, in addition, holds 18 or 19 other directorships in the City of Dublin?  These are the practical aspects as opposed to theoretical questions of principle. Whatever may be the principle involved, when it comes to the question of Córas Iompair Éireann directors we have the definite and clear case that either these shareholders' directors exercised power in the full discharge of their responsibilities or on the other hand that they were mere figureheads, who are not entitled to compensation for something they never did.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Grand Canal Company, so far as I am concerned if I have to walk alone into the division lobby, I will do so, because I am dealing here with the question of compensating directors whose attitude to their employees over the last quarter of a century has been that of people who were dealing with some kind of animals and not with human beings. The sooner those gentlemen learn the lesson that if they cannot run their <Col N="1947" /> industry on the basis of ordinary human conditions, the sooner it is taken over by those who have got some understanding of the problems of working men the better for this community as a whole.  I feel that the directors of the Grand Canal Company have never missed their dividend. They have received each year in directors' fees more than any workman in the Grand Canal system was paid in wages for a full year's work. They have, in fact, received in fees, for probably two hours' work every fortnight, more than was paid for 24 hours' work on seven days a week and over 50 weeks in the year, to some of their workers.  I think that the comparison I have made is a sufficient answer to this claim for compensation to the directors of the Grand Canal Company.</P>
    <P>As I said in my opening, if there is a principle involved in this, then let those whom the directors directly represent &mdash; the shareholders &mdash; accept responsibility. They should be well able to do that because they &mdash; the shareholders &mdash; are being generously and adequately compensated under the provisions of the Bill.  If they feel that the directors have discharged their responsibilities to them, then let them show their appreciation of that.  I feel that so far as Córas Iompair Éireann is concerned the bill which is being presented through this House to the nation is sufficiently heavy already.  So far as the Grand Canal Company is concerned, I think that the directors have been very well paid for their services over the last 50 years by the shareholders.</P>

      <P>When a proposal similar to this was before the House some time ago I described it as a reprehensible one.  That is my opinion still.  If there was any question of principle involved I would certainly stand on principle.  There is no question of principle involved so far as I can see, and there is no justification for the suggestion that these gentlemen should be paid a sum equivalent to a year's directors' fees because of the fact that they are going to lose certain fees when this Bill becomes an <Col N="1948" /> Act.  We had in the railway service of Córas Iompair Éireann quite a number of old employees.  They had given to the company of their best over the last 40 or more years.  Now they are existing on a miserable pittance or a miserable pension.  If there was a proposal to increase their pensions I certainly would support it.  When I see a proposal like this coming out of the blue to pay over a few miserable thousand pounds to a few individuals who do not need it, I certainly am against that.</P>
      <P>This House, by a free vote, rejected a proposal of this kind that was in the Bill.  I think the Minister understood that that free vote was a decision of the House.  I feel that when the matter was raised again in the Seanad he should have made it clear to Senators that if they insisted on inserting this amendment it would be rejected by this House.  I do not think it serves any purpose to have this discussion again.  Everything that could be said in favour of or against those directors has been said.  It is not in their interest, I think, that there should be a repetition of the discussions we have had in regard to them. Their record has not been a very good one.  It is not a record of efficiency or even of ordinary courage.  It is not a record of common sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Davin has said, some of those directors were just nominal shareholders of the banks, put into a position where they were entitled to receive substantial sums of money each year without giving anything in return.  I think they have done very well over the years.  The fact that we have to introduce this Transport Bill to establish a new board which is to try and make a success of transport, is an indication that those gentlemen, on whom responsibility rested for so long, did not do the job that they should have done.  I indicated before my views in regard to one of the directors to whom it is proposed to pay a sum of money in compensation.  There is no necessity for me to repeat what I said then.  I did make it perfectly clear that I am opposed to this proposal, and that if it goes to a vote I will vote against it.  I hope the House will have <Col N="1949" /> the courage to do what it did on a previous occasion, and that is to reject this proposal and so make it perfectly clear that no proposal of this kind is ever going to receive sanction or support from the members of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We have asked the Minister a question and I think the House is entitled to get an answer to it.  What is the view of the Government on this question?  Are the Government in favour of the amendment or are they not?  We have not got an answer to that.  The Minister brought in a Bill here with a certain section in it.  I never saw, in my time anyhow, a measure brought into this House by a Minister which was supported so weakly, if I may put it that way, by the person introducing it as that particular section was.  Then the Minister left it to a free vote.  When it came to a free vote, lo and behold, the Minister who brought it in supported it, but many of his colleagues &mdash; I think they were in a majority &mdash; voted against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, there is something very, very important for the country involved in all this.  We have, by our Constitution, imposed on the Government collective responsibility.  That is done for very good reasons.  It is done so that the House may get leadership, in regard to matters, by a group of people, who will themselves have thoroughly examined the questions at issue.  Ordinarily, if a question of difficulty of this sort came up before a Cabinet composed of people who had any common outlook, they would examine this thing thoroughly.  There might be certain individual differences, but they would finally come down on a decision on one side or the other or else the whole question would have to be shelved or, more likely, if the matter was of considerable public importance, it would be pushed to the point in which those who felt that it was an important matter of principle to them not to accept the majority view-point would resign and say: &ldquo;We cannot share in the responsibility for that decision&rdquo;.  That is done, as I have said, for a very good reason, because it means that in the Cabinet, where <Col N="1950" /> there can be the fullest and frankest discussion of every aspect of a question, the matter would be thoroughly sifted and then, as a group, as a team, as a body bearing collective responsibility, they would come to the House and give leadership in regard to the matter involved.</P>
    <P>Here we have the spectacle of the Minister who is chiefly responsible for this measure coming to the House and telling the House they can vote as they please on it.  If it is a matter of no consequence, why should we have to decide it?  If it is a matter of consequence, why should the leadership that is expected from a Government not be given?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever we did we were prepared to take the responsibility for it.  The trouble is that we have people on the other side who will not take the responsibility for it.  They are trying to shift the responsibility to this side.  Nobody who was one year in politics would have any doubt as to the manoeuvres that are being tried.  The whole thing is that they are looking for the vote on this side, which is practically equal to the vote on the other side, to decide the issues for them and we object to being made cats'-paws in that way.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Lemass said, we are quite prepared to discuss this amendment and to argue it on its merits if the Government, on their side, will say they are either for or against it, but what we do object to is that two or three members of the Government take one view and the rest take another view when, according to the Constitution and according to everything that is right and proper for the administration here, they should take collective responsibility and have a collective view.  They will not do it, of course. They want to have it both ways.  When there is anything that is popular, they want to get all the popularity for it and when there is anything that is unpopular to be done, that they think is right, they have not the courage to say: &ldquo;Yes, that is right.  We will take responsibility for it and we will do it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not the first time, of course, that this thing has been tried on here. We gave notice that we are not going to allow this thing to happen and that, if there are matters to be discussed here, the Government, in accordance with its constitutional duty, should give the leadership and say: &ldquo;This is the Bill which we are introducing.  These <Col N="1952" /> are the principles for which we stand and, if we change these as a result of arguments that may come before the House, then we will do it as a combined body and take collective responsibility for the change.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a great deal involved in this.  Ministers, according to our practice, have charge of different Departments.  Is each Minister in each particular Department to be allowed to run that Department without any consideration of the general policy?  Is there to be no check on a Minister's conduct of his Department through the criticism of his colleagues? One of the reasons for collective responsibility is that at the Cabinet meetings, as there is collective responsiblity, each member of the Government feels that he has a right to be satisfied with the policy that is being carried out by the particular member of the Government who is in charge of a particular Department.  You get effective criticism of administration in that way.  If we are to give up the idea of collective responsibility, then, obviously, what will happen is that the individual Ministers will be allowed to conduct their own Departments without the informed criticism of their colleagues.</P>
    <P>The matter is of tremendous importance for the welfare of the country and administration in general and, in order to do our utmost as a Party to insist on that principle being followed, we will not allow the Government to get out of their difficulties by our doing for them the work that they should do.  We think it is of the utmost importance for the proper administration of public affairs that they should be made to bear the responsibility of the Government, which is combined and collective responsibility, and not be allowed to shift it on to the Opposition.  It is in protest that Deputy Lemass said that we will not consider this amendment on its merits until the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A very relevant matter surely is the manner in which this amendment is coming before the House.  Is this amendment coming before the House with the recommendation of the Government or is it not?  When we were in office, there would never have been a suggestion that a Minister coming before the House with a measure did not represent the combined, collective Government view.  I said that it is a matter that is very germane to this whole discussion as to how it is coming before the House, whether it is coming here with a Government recommendation or not.  It comes here without it.  It is left in the air.  It is left to every one of us to make up our minds as we please about it, without any indication of what the people who are primarily responsible for the conduct of the country's affairs think about it.</P>

      <P>Let the Government take up that view.  We are not telling them which view they should take, but what we do say is that they should discuss this matter, come to a decision, come before the Dáil with their decision and let the discussion take place, as it should take place in these cases, on a decision of the Government, as to whether we approve or do not approve of that decision.  The present attitude will lead to chaos.  The main purpose of this Dáil in electing and putting up a Government is to get a leadership for the House as a whole. We can disagree with that leadership; we can disagree even to the point of getting rid of it, but at least we have something concrete and definite to discuss when it has been thoroughly sifted by the body which is supposed to do the work having got all the information which it is possible to get and having looked ahead as far as they can to the various precedents that may or may not be established by a proposed line of action.  We have not that here and, as Deputy Lemass said, as long as the Government fails to make <Col N="1954" /> up its mind and come and tell us, so long will we persist in our attitude and see that they will not get away with the trick they are trying to play on the House and on the country.</P>

The Deputy was quite indignant at the bare thought that those men should not be recompensed and rewarded.  The Deputy spoke for over an hour.  Then the Adjournment came and there was a meeting of the Fianna Fáil Party on the following day and Deputy Lemass came in with that assurance which only he possesses and took a completely different line, the very opposite of what he took the day before, because in the meantime he discovered that he had embarrassed his Chief and his Party. They were in difficulty and he tried to extricate them from it.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera &mdash; not for the first time &mdash; can simulate indignation when it suits as he did this afternoon.  The Deputy is afraid that an assault is being made on the constitutional position. The Deputy is shocked that there should be a free vote.

There is nothing wrong in allowing Deputies on all sides of the House to vote as they wish on this.  Will Deputy de Valera allow the members of his Party to vote as they wish on this? Has it been indicated that they can vote on this?  Is there only one view on this in the Party opposite?  How is it that the Fianna Fáil Party in the Seanad can have a view on this and express it clearly, but the Fianna Fáil Party in the Dáil can have no view?

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Thursday evening, when the Budget Resolution was being discussed, I invited the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party to consider in relation to their criticism of the various items of capital expenditure proposed by the Minister the items which were in fact passed as proper items of capital expenditure by their own Minister for Finance in his 1947 Budget statement.  I should like at this stage to repeat that invitation, because it seems to me that the opposition coming from the Fianna Fáil Benches in relation to both parts of the present Budget, the domestic Budget and the capital Budget, was reckless in its nature and showed that very little consideration has been given to this matter by Fianna Fáil.  Many Fianna Fáil Deputies have accused the Minister and the Government and the Deputies on this side of the House of changing their attitude in relation to the important question of finance.  Deputy Briscoe, I think it was, said that the Minister had made a complete somersault since 1948.  Other Deputies spoke along somewhat similar lines.  The point I want to make is that many of the items outlined in the Minister's Budget statement as being items for which it was proper to borrow are already included in the list which Deputy Aiken sanctioned in 1947.  They are items for which Fianna Fáil borrowed and for which this Government and future Governments will borrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the size of the domestic Budget, the part of the Budget which has to be met out of taxation, I want to extend another invitation to Deputies opposite.  I want to ask, will any Deputy on the opposite benches have the courage before this debate concludes to point out to the Minister where they suggest he should make cuts?  Since this Government came into office a couple of years ago, as the Deputies opposite are aware, a number of different sections of the <Col N="1964" /> community have benefited by the actions of the Government.  The old age pensioners are in receipt of better pensions to-day than they were ever under Fianna Fáil.  I should like to know if Fianna Fáil Deputies stand for reducing old age pensions and bringing them back to the Fianna Fáil level?  If Fianna Fáil Deputies are sincere in their complaint that the amount which the Minister is going to take from the people in taxation is too much, it follows that they must have in mind some reductions which the Minister could make.  It is perfectly fair to ask them where these reductions could be made.  I wonder if there is any Deputy opposite authorised to stand up and speak the mind of the Party opposite on this question.  Surely it is ridiculous that Deputy Lemass, Deputy Aiken, Deputy Briscoe, Deputy Corry and others should come into the Dáil and complain that the amount is too high, that the figure is too large, and so create the impression that, if they were here, the figure would be less and, at the same time, should lack the courage to stand over what they say and to point out to the Minister where they suggest he should make reductions.</P>
    <P>I take it that it will be accepted as a general proposition, at any rate, that the only way of reducing the taxation proposed would be by reducing expenditure. I have asked any Deputy opposite who may follow me in this debate to indicate if Fianna Fáil want the old age pensions cut to the Fianna Fáil rate.  Would they prefer to cut the salaries of the teachers?  Would they prefer the teachers to go back to the same conditions under which they operated at the time when they went on strike when Deputy Derrig was Minister for Education?  Would they prefer, not only that the national teachers should get back to the Fianna Fáil level of pay, but that the rating system, which was abolished by the present Minister for Education at a cost to the Exchequer of a considerable number of pounds, should be reinstated? Would Deputy Boland prefer to see the Guards operating under the conditions which obtained when he was Minister for Justice?</P>
    <Col N="1965" />
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>You will soon have no Guards here at the rate you are going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy want to see the Garda pay reduced to the Boland level?  Possibly Deputies opposite would prefer to economise on the Army.  When the Estimate for Defence was being discussed and when the annual Army Bill was being discussed, the complaint then was that we have not enough artillery and other arms and have not sufficient men in the Army.  Now they come along in this debate and criticise the amount of the bill.  If the Deputies opposite shirk making cuts in the directions I have mentioned, they have another wide field open to them. Perhaps they would like the civil servants to be put back to the old Fianna Fáil level of pay, or would they prefer to get back to 1946 and 1947 level of house production?  There are various other items in the Book of Estimates, any of which might be cut if Fianna Fáil were back on this side of the House.  I take it, at any rate, that Deputy Boland and the other Deputies opposite will at least concede this to me: that it is perfectly fair for any Deputy on this side to ask the Deputies opposite to have the courage to name the cuts they would make; that if they enjoy the liberty of criticising the Minister for Finance because of the aggregate figure in the Budget, there is, at the same time, a responsibility on them to indicate to the Minister what their attitude would be and where they would make savings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Deputies on these benches here occupied the benches opposite, they at least had the courage to tell the then Fianna Fáil Government where economies could be effected, where waste could be cut out.  When the change of Government came in 1948, a number of the wasteful, spendthrift projects on which Fianna Fáil were wasting money were cut out and the money which Fianna Fáil proposed to waste in the future was saved to the Exchequer.  Fine Gael, Labour, Clann na Talmhan and Independent Deputies, when in opposition, at least had the courage to point out to the then Fianna <Col N="1966" /> Fáil Administration where economies could be effected.  I do not think any Fianna Fáil Deputy who has spoken in this debate so far has pointed out where as much as £1 could be taken off the bill.  As I say, there are many fields which they can choose from and the choice is there for the making.  I venture to suggest that very few Fianna Fáil Deputies, if any, would have the courage to make the choice.</P>
    <P>Glancing through some earlier Budget debates, I notice a colourful phrase used by Deputy MacEntee which would very well describe the activities of the Deputies opposite this year.  He referred to the prodigals of March becoming the Scrooges of May. That is precisely what we have witnessed this year.  When the Estimates were being discussed, and even before that, Deputies opposite were crying out for increased expenditure.  On the Vote for the Department of Education, Deputy McCann, for example, complained that the Minister was not building enough new schools and was not building them quickly enough.  Schools cost money to build.  The Budget is now before the House for discussion and I think we shall find that before this discussion is over Deputy McCann will come in here and criticise the amount being spent.  I think every Deputy opposite will adopt the same line.</P>
    <P>I referred, as one of the choices which is open to Deputies opposite, to the old age pension position.  Deputies will recollect that despite some early enthusiasm from the benches opposite in support of old age pensioners they changed that tune very quickly and that shortly before they were put out of office a motion was tabled for discussion in the Dáil which, according to the then Minister &mdash; I think it was Deputy Dr. Ryan who was in charge of the matter at the time &mdash; would have cost the State something in the neighbourhood of £550,000 a year.  The motion suggested a modification of the means test as it then applied in the case of old age pensioners.  A very peculiar thing about that matter is that the figure of £550,000, which Deputy Dr. Ryan thought the proposal would cost, was practically identically <Col N="1967" /> the figure which the Fianna Fáil Government were quite prepared to lose annually on the operation of a transatlantic air service.  They were prepared to lose on that air service a sum of something over £500,000 per year. They preferred to retain that service and to have that loss borne annually by the taxpayers of this country rather than allow modifications of the means test in favour of the old age pensioners.</P>

      <P>The loss the Deputy mentions was not to be permanent, but only for a period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There was never any hope at all that the loss would be turned into a profit &mdash; I am going on the written record and the spoken word in this House.  I heard the present Minister for Industry and Commerce putting it to the Deputies opposite, and in particular to Deputy Lemass, that that loss would have remained &mdash; that it would never have been turned into a profit and that possibly it would have been larger.  I doubt very much if even Deputy Lemass would have the brazenness to deny it.  However, that loss had been occasioned for some years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies opposite thought it was good business to have a loss.  What was their explanation?  It was not the explanation which Deputy Breathnach would have us accept now, namely, that it was only temporary in nature and that in a few years everything in the sky would be lovely and that they would make a profit.  Not at all.  The explanation offered by Deputy Lemass and by those who wanted to maintain the air service was that it was good for our prestige to have that air service; that other nations were going in for that kind of thing and that, small and all as we were, if we wanted to bolster up our pride and our prestige a transatlantic air service was necessary. I think that Deputy Breathnach, in all fairness, will have to admit that that was the case put up by his Deputy Leader, Deputy Lemass&mdash;that, and no other case.  Subsequently, some effort was made to say that it should have been retained because of its dollar-earning capacity.  In fact, of course, a <Col N="1968" /> currency loss in the region of £500,000 a year would be equivalent to a dollar loss, even before devaluation took place, of something in the neighbourhood of £1,500,000 a year.  However, that was the Fianna Fáil mentality and the Fianna Fáil attitude towards the old age pensioners on the one hand and Constellation aircraft on the other hand.  That was not merely accidental. It was the mentality which ran right through the Fianna Fáil budgets.  What was the position as far back as 1935, when economies were felt to be necessary; when the then Opposition Deputies suggested various kinds of economy and when Deputy MacEntee was Minister for Finance?  I wonder if Deputy Breathnach would make a case as to the attitude of Deputy MacEntee in connection with the means test?</P>
    <P>I have been in this House only a short while but I am very well aware that even in the two years during which I have been here, and for many years prior to that, Deputies have from time to time put down questions asking the Minister for Social Welfare about individual pension cases.  The attitude of the Deputies who put down the questions is that whatever means test is there &mdash; whatever the law in relation to old age pensioners may be &mdash; it should be administered in as lenient a manner as possible so far as the applicant is concerned.  I am glad that Deputy Breathnach nods his head in agreement with that.  I think that that is a fact, that it is the attitude of most Deputies here and that it has been the attitude of the present Minister for Social Welfare since he took office.  But it was not the attitude of Deputy MacEntee while he was Minister for Finance.  In his Budget statement in 1935, Volume 56, column 867, he had this to say regarding the old age pensioners:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am satisfied, and the Minister for Local Government and Public Health concurs with me, that a closer supervision and a stricter enforcement of the law in regard to old age pensions would result in a considerable reduction in the cost of that service.  It is felt that a saving of £100,000 can be effected....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1969" /> When one places that statement by Deputy MacEntee side by side with the callous rejection by the Fianna Fáil Government of the motion calling for a modification of the means test, it will be seen that the Fianna Fáil mentality was not one which was favourable to the weaker sections of the community. They were quite prepared, as I mentioned, to fly Constellation aircraft. They were prepared to plan for the building of new Parliament houses &mdash; to cost £11,000,000, presumably as capital development.  They were prepared to go into many fields of activity of an unproductive character but they were not prepared to assist the weaker sections of the community &mdash; apart from their first few years of enthusiasm for that cause.</P>
    <P>Criticism has been made, as I mentioned, by Fianna Fáil Deputies who spoke in this debate.  One of the criticisms made has been that the present Minister for Finance is going completely back on form in introducing what has been described as a two-tier Budget &mdash; in recommending to the Dáil and the country a vast programme for capital development.  Deputy Briscoe, I think it was, described the Minister as making a complete somersault.  That is not correct.  The present Government, from the moment they assumed office, made it quite clear that their policy was to cut out waste where waste could be eliminated, but that they were not afraid, and would not be afraid, to spend money on worth-while projects.</P>
    <P>Looking back on some earlier Budget debates, we find that in the 1945 discussion on the Budget the present Minister for Finance had certain things to say with regard to the borrowing of money for capital development.  He was sitting on the benches opposite at the time &mdash; it was before he had the responsibility for dealing with this particular Department.  In Volume 97, column 63, Deputy McGilligan, referring to the Minister for Finance, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He tells us of the £100,000,000 which we have piled up more or less as dead-weight debt, but he does not tell us that he intends to spend <Col N="1970" /> another £100,000,000 which we would like to hear was to be spent so long as it was devoted to productive purposes and so long as it was possible to say there would be some return.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In 1945, when the present Minister was in opposition, he was then quite prepared to recommend to the people that if necessary £100,000,000 should be spent on capital projects, provided it was devoted to productive purposes and it was possible to say there would be some return for it.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Lands, speaking in the same strain during the same Budget debate, followed Deputy McGilligan, and, at column 65, Volume 97, he is reported:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As the last speaker said, if the Government advocated the spending of £100,000,000 on production, this Party and, I suppose, every other Party in the House would welcome it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think those quotations show quite clearly that the Deputies who now compose the Government were never afraid of projects of capital development; they were never afraid to recommend the borrowing and the spending of money for capital projects.  It is quite untrue to say that in recommending the spending of £31,000,000 or £34,000,000, whatever the exact figure is, the Minister for Finance has in any way gone back on the policy he advocated when he first became a Minister.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to keep the Dáil much longer on this question.  I would like to conclude by congratulating the Minister on the work he has done during the past year, and particularly on producing this very satisfactory Budget.  So far as the people are concerned, I think they are very satisfied with the results of the Minister's efforts.  I do not believe the efforts of Deputies opposite, whether they were deliberately mischievous or not, will succeed in creating panic among the bank depositors in the event of the floatation of another National Loan.  I do not believe they will succeed in doing that, even if they want to do it.  I do not dogmatically charge them with that desire, but some of the speeches made, especially those by <Col N="1971" /> Deputy Lemass and Deputy MacEntee, are open to the very gravest suspicion. I think that is as far as I will put it now.</P>
    <P>The people are satisfied with the Minister, who has found it possible to hold more or less at a standstill the cost of living figure and, at the same time, give increases in wages to most, if not to all sections, of the people and, side by side with that, to remit the taxes imposed by Fianna Fáil in 1947 on beer, tobacco and entertainments. The achievements of the present Minister for Finance are very heartily welcomed by the people, and my experience since this Budget came before the House is that the people of this city are very satisfied with the work done by the Government as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>In his Budget statement last year the Minister for Finance said, in column 493:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A very rough estimate, prepared by short-cut methods, put the national income for 1947 at about £320,000,000.  The proportion of the national income which is absorbed by taxation &mdash; including local rates and social insurance contributions as well as Central Government tax revenue &mdash; is of the order of 25 per cent., or roughly £27 per head per annum.  The persistence of such burdens over any lengthy period would be deplorable, and all our efforts should be directed towards securing their abatement.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was when the bill which the taxpayer was asked to meet amounted to £74,000,000.  This year the corresponding figure is £87,000,000, but as it would be impossible for the Minister for Finance to endeavour to cover the deficiency through raising money through extra taxation and as he has turned his back upon the policy of retrenchment which he seems to have completely abandoned, it has been found necessary to devise some new means of meeting the Minister's difficulties and the solution that has been devised, following upon experience which the Minister has shown himself very versatile and skilful in employing during the past two years, is to borrow <Col N="1972" /> to the extent of the deficiency, which may be said to be £12,000,000.</P>
    <P>The first thing that strikes one about this new departure is that if the Minister for Finance succeeds in his purpose he will remove from the control of the Dáil in the review of the annual Estimates the items for which he now proposes to borrow.  It was suggested by the Banking Commission, and, apparently, some of the pundits of that body are still sufficiently influential to have their advice accepted by the Minister, that it was only by specific legal enactments that money should be borrowed as, for example, in the case of the Electricity Supply Board.  It was pointed out also by that body that there was no method, if borrowing for what was termed dead-weight debt was to be permitted, of ascertaining what, in fact, was the deficit and that there should be an annual account audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General at the end of the financial year which would make it quite clear what exactly the deficit was.  The Minister says there is no deficit.  He has converted what was a deficit of £12,000,000 into a surplus.  It may be that this deficit will be regarded by some people as a very good thing.  It may be regarded by others as a very bad thing. Like these modern American drugs, if it does not kill the patient during the earlier stages of the treatment he may live to a ripe old age.  By a process of trial and error we achieve better things.  There used to be a textbook dealing with the adventures of a British officer during the Boer War called <i>The Defence of Duffer's Drift.</i> We used to hear a good deal about it in the volunteer days.  This officer was quite inexperienced in Boer guerilla tactics and, having set up his little defensive position as well as he could, he was compelled when the guerillas descended upon him to adopt a new line of defence.  This happened on several occasions, until finally the officer began to learn that there might be some means of keeping his enemies at bay.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister for Finance seems to be driven very easily from the positions he occupies.  In fact, one wonders if the Minister for Finance <Col N="1973" /> really has made up his mind to defend these positions.  The line of retreat has been so skilfully laid that the Minister regards his retreat as a victory instead of a retreat, which it really is, when he is driven back from the policies he has proclaimed in the past and comes along now with a brand new one which he asks the country to accept.  Two years ago the Minister told us that his policy was to reduce the cost of government and the cost of living.  According to certain figures which I have obtained by way of parliamentary question, it does not appear that the Minister is making very much progress in reducing the cost of government.  The figures indicate that, if he is making an effort, it is not a very successful one.  When we were in office we were reminded pretty frequently by the Fine Gael Party in their attacks upon the Minister for Finance's squandermania that the central machinery of government was growing out of all proportion to the resources of the country.  According to the figures the Minister has given me, there has been an increase in the number of civil servants during the past two years of 1,264, and an increase in the unestablished civil servants of 540; that is 1,800 in all.  The additional cost of salaries, remuneration and superannuation&mdash;I think superannuation was included &mdash; came to about £1,500,000.  In his Budget statement, the Minister has told us that, in respect of the Civil Service alone, there will be a further increase of some £600,000 in the current financial year.  That means that, so far as the Civil Service is concerned, its cost has gone up by some £2,000,000 since the Government assumed office.  Then we had the promise to reduce the cost of living. The Taoiseach, before he assumed his present office, informed the electorate that all other considerations must be subordinated to the overriding necessity of reducing the cost of living and increasing the value of the people's incomes.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The first task of the new Government must be vigorously to grapple with and to provide a solution for the problem of the soaring cost of living which is menacing the <Col N="1974" /> economic life of the State and the happiness of its people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In reply to a question by Deputy Cowan some time ago the Taoiseach made a long statement referring to reductions in the cost of a number of commodities; a wide range of articles and clothing, he said, had been reduced.  It may be that there have been reductions but the reductions are not significant.  They may sound great in number when a catalogue of them is read out, but they are not as significant to and cannot have the same bearing on, I suggest, the cost of living as items like food, clothing, footwear, transport and other items, including services.  Last year the Minister told us that the wholesale price index had increased by 5.8 per cent. over the previous year.  This year there has been a further increase and we have not yet had the full effects of the devaluation of the £ upon retail prices; but it is well known that our materials in general imported from areas which have not devalued their currency are increasing considerably in price and will, in due course, reflect themselves in the retail prices. Actually there has been an increase. The Minister may say it is only a small increase.  He may describe the cost-of-living index figure as practically static. But if one takes the opportunities which people now have for spending, the things they want to purchase, the fact that certain important classes of the community, the professional classes and those described as the white-collar workers, have not got anything like the compensation that would enable them to buy the things they need one can hardly say that they are as well off as they were before the war.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear to anybody who is familiar with these people and their circumstances that they are feeling the pinch more now than at any time since the war ceased.  Yet, the Minister has not seen fit to give them any consideration in his Budget.  He talks of social justice.  One of the aims of the Budget should be to redistribute the national income so as to give more justice to the deserving.</P>
    <P>While the Minister may be able to reconcile these fine principles with his <Col N="1975" /> complete lack of consideration for the taxpayer in the Budget, there is no attempt to reduce the burden upon ordinary workers, whether manual or clerical workers, particularly the workers on the lower scales.  The Minister has even refused to consider increasing the children's allowances in these cases.  I cannot avoid reminding the Minister that he used to tell us that the £ in 1947 and in previous years was worth only 8/-, and that if the Government were doing its duty, full recoupment should be made to salary and wage earners to enable them to get the things to which they had been accustomed, to look after the education and the upkeep of their families, etc. Now, after devaluation, I take it that the 8/- which the Minister emphasised so eloquently and so long in this House, is reduced in terms of purchasing power and on the international market to something like 5/7.  So that the position the Minister had taken up that he was going to retrench on a wide field of Government expenditure has been abandoned.  The promise to reduce the cost of living remains unfulfilled. Its fulfilment has not even been attempted and the remedying of the distortion of the £, to bring it back to something like its pre-war value, which was one of the proclaimed aims of the Minister's Party, is an absolutely complete failure.</P>

      <P>If they could not do it, why did they promise to do it?  If Deputy Hickey had his way, we would have more pounds, but I do not know what value they would have outside this country.  We are now to have this new departure of borrowing to meet the budgetary deficit.  The first, and I think the most important, point for the people to remember is that, while there may be a pretence that the burden is being lightened on the taxpayer, in fact, it is only being deferred. The moneys which the State has to pay by way of interest and sinking fund charges are a first claim upon the future taxpayer.  They are, in fact, <Col N="1976" /> mortgaged on the national wealth of the future and upon our productivity and taxable capacity.  You can see there a lien on the productivity and the enterprise of producers, whoever they may be.</P>
      <P>There has been a pretence that there is some justification for this new departure.  Sweden has been mentioned. What was done in Sweden, so far as I know, was that the Swedish Government introduced an emergency budget to provide for public works, to alleviate unemployment and to create additional purchasing power in a time of depression, from 1933 to 1937.  This is not an abnormal situation in that sense.  If it is abnormal, it is abnormal in the fact that we have this inflationary pressure to which the Minister has called attention in his Budget statement.  It is quite the opposite to a condition of depression and should need a different type of remedy. Although the Swedes borrowed for a period of years, they amortised the dead-weight debt, as they considered it, for a comparatively short period of years.  I have a bulletin here of the Swedish Trading Bank giving an account of the matter, and it may be no harm to read it:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;As from the budget year 1933-34, new principles have been applied to the financing of the appropriations for unemployment relief, differing from the traditional rule that borrowed funds may only be employed for the financing of grants for productive purposes.  In the budget for 1933-34 and subsequent budget years, the use of borrowed funds has been extended.  Grants have been voted to be paid out of borrowed funds even in cases in which no immediate return has been counted upon.  Such grants out of borrowed money have been passed into a special fund, the non-productive borrowed capital included in the fund to be amortised on a short-term basis.  The amounts voted to this fund for the budget year 1933-34 was 168,000,000 and for 1934-35 226,000,000 kr.  Certain special sources of income have been applied towards writing off the non-productive borrowed capital included in the fund, viz. &mdash; for the budget year 1933-34 the <Col N="1977" /> income derived from estate duty and gift tax, estimated at 25,000,000 kr., and for 1934-35 also an extra income and property tax, estimated at 8,000,000 kr.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The particulars are given in the appendix.  In the year 1933-34 the actual disbursements were 98.5 million kroner.  Estate duty on the other side brought in 23.8.  In 1934-35 disbursements were 197.3 and estate duty, excess income and property tax, and ordinary taxes allotted as appropriations amounted to 38.9 millions. In 1935-36 appropriations out of the Budget were 72,000,000, and the appropriations from taxes in aid were 41.5 millions.  Finally in 1936-37, as against payments of only 11.6 millions, there were receipts from estate duty, car tax, royalties from mines and transfers from the Treasury reserves of 127.8 millions.  So from 1933 to 1937 the total expenditure seems to have been 379.6 millions and the actual taxation levied during the period to meet that was 232,000,000. That was roughly about 60 per cent. That was in order to meet the depression, and even during the depression taxes were allocated to meet expenditure, and one might gather that even some additional taxes had been imposed.</P>
    <P>What is the position in Britain at the present time?  What is the distinction they are making between capital and current expenditure?  As far as I understand &mdash; the Minister is in a position to correct me if I am wrong &mdash; it has been stated that nine-tenths of the moneys required in the annual Budget came from tax revenue.  If that is the position, it means that Britain, having gone through one of the greatest wars in history, is able to carry on, paying her way to the extent of 90 per cent. and borrowing to the extent of 10 per cent.  On the figures the Minister has given us, we are in the position that we are only paying our way to the extent of some 60 per cent., because, if all the borrowing that the Minister envisages takes place, it will amount to some 40 per cent. of the total of £107,000,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It might not do us any harm if we had a little of it now and again.  I am only pointing to the fact that if, as the Minister says, our conditions are somewhat similar to England, and the same principles ought to guide us, and if we had such an admirable Chancellor of the Exchequer as Sir Stafford Cripps, who holds the same philosophy as the Deputy and has made it his business to pay his way, there seems to be no reason why this country should not do the same. We are told that the country is flourishing, that production is increasing, that exports are increasing and that generally there is a great air of prosperity.  It seems an extraordinary thing that we are unable to meet our obligations and that charges which in the past were met in the ordinary way annually from revenue, and that were regarded as recurring obligations, to be so defrayed, have now to be met by borrowing.</P>
      <P>The Minister, with his colleagues, has discovered this wonderful secret of the national debt: When you are in difficulties, you get an easy way out, transfer the burden to future taxpayers and add to the national debt.  The charges are pretty substantial.  The Minister estimates that they will be about £6.3 millions this year &mdash; an increase of £2.3 millions over last year &mdash; and, if he has to pay £655,000 a year for the next 30 years to liquidate the £12,000,000 which I think it might be fairly argued should be met from revenue this year, the ordinary man in the street, by a simple arithmetical calculation, will see that £655,000 for 30 years on an initial expenditure of £12,000,000 is not a very good proposition. One would need to have a very good revenue-giving investment to make it worth while but, in fact, there is going to be no revenue from that particular borrowing.  There will not be even 1/- available to help to liquidate the costs.  The money will come from the taxpayer and if the taxpayer does not pay for it in taxes this year, then, during the next 30 years, he will have to find that £655,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dual budget, emergency budget, or special works budget which has been introduced in other countries seems to <Col N="1979" /> me to have been largely the fruit of prolonged depression and great unemployment in large industrial States. Even in those circumstances the amortisation was over a short period and, in addition, there was an effort to get production of capital goods for industry. The money was not simply spent in such a way that there would be no return afterwards.</P>
    <P>We are told that some of the Banking Commission experts have now changed their minds and what they condemned as dead-weight debt and bad, reprehensible, financial policy when Fianna Fáil were in office is now not alone excusable, but it is to be admired and praised.  Lord Palmerston on one occasion asked his Attorney-General for advice.  Later, when he met the Attorney-General, he said: &ldquo;I could do nothing.  I was prevented from taking the step which was necessary by the advice you gave me.&rdquo;&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the Attorney-General, &ldquo;did you not tell me the advice you required?&rdquo;  I must remind the House that the Minister himself has changed his position in this matter.  In the Budget statement of 1948 there is the following passage:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At a time when taxation is of unprecedented severity and economy in State expenditure is imperative, it is more than ever necessary to examine critically proposals for capital expenditure which add to the taxpayer's annual burden and thus tend to stifle incentive and to reduce savings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the Budget statement in 1948, the Minister said that capital expenditure had reached a record height:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Capital expenditure by the Central Government and local authorities will reach a record height in the current year.  Gross capital expenditure by public authorities and by private concerns and individuals will probably account for almost one-fifth of total national expenditure. To keep capital outlay on this scale from having inflationary consequences, it is essential that output and savings should be increased.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1980" /> Towards the conclusion of that Budget statement, having reviewed the more encouraging signs in the way of industrial output and employment, and so on, which the Minister foresaw, he went to refer to the less favourable aspect:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...agricultural output and exports as a whole are still at dangerously low levels, capital expenditure &mdash; some of doubtful productivity &mdash; is outstripping current savings,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash; not having the figures, we are not in a position to know whether that is still the situation &mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;rates and taxes are excessive, dead-weight debt is rapidly expanding and production costs are unduly high.  The primary needs of the moment are increased output at lower unit costs from farm and factory and more saving by the community generally. To this public authorities, central and local, can contribute by reducing their demands on taxpayers and ratepayers. With such improvements rapidly achieved, the national economy would gain in strength and stability.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With regard to capital investment, the Minister said in column 1629, Volume 120, No. 11 of the Dáil Debates:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;One of the primary responsibilities of a Government is to promote, by an enlightened budgetary and investment policy, the continuous and efficient use of national resources in men and materials.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the following paragraph there is no reference whatever to private investment and I want to know whether this new departure means that in future the initiation, financing and planning of enterprise by the State is to be the main feature of our economy. If it is, if that is to be the central feature of our future development, it seems to me that we will have that planning which is characteristic of Socialist States and which, outside the Russian-controlled countries, seems to have been abandoned.  It would be an extraordinary thing if we were to be forced into that position now.  If we are not, why is the emphasis in the Budget not upon the private investor? <Col N="1981" /> If we stand for private investment, why is there no incentive to the private investor and why is no encouragement given to him?  Are we to take it that development is impossible in this country unless the State comes in?  If that is the case, the central administration, as I have shown, will increase enormously, or if it does not increase directly, the overheads of these enterprises will be very considerable.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hickey need not depend on what I am saying.  He can depend on what the Minister is reported to have said when he took part in a discussion on State control and expenditure in relation to national expenditure arranged by the Dublin branch of the Institute of Costs and Work Accountants held in Jury's Hotel.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;He did not think, he said, it was possible to speak in sufficiently exaggerated terms about the iniquities of these Government boards.  They had nearly always been very bad.  &lsquo;Some of these days,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;the population will get a real fright when they hear the whole truth about the transport situation in this country.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>They have not heard the whole truth yet.  There is a pious expression by the Minister that Córas Iompair Éireann may be able to pay its way during the coming year, and the Supplementary Estimates which we had last year for that service will be remembered.  No provision has so far been made for the present year. According to the report:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister said he might ask if the Electricity Supply Board was an efficient body.  It was interesting to compare the accounts of the Electricity Supply Board with those of the Belfast Electricity Station.  As a Government body, he would put the Electricity Supply Board at the top of the line, but were they doing the job as well as private enterprise would have done it?  The directors themselves were not entirely satisfied about the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1982" /> The Electricity Supply Board, he said, had been given a certain job to do in the beginning, but many duties had since been added, including rural electrification, and when all these things were done he thought the Electricity Supply Board would not be a very popular body.  The price of electricity was bound to go up.  He had an objection to a nationalisation of services, for as long as people knew the public purse was behind them there was a tendency to extravagance.  There was not the test of insolvency in the background.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the Minister's view on that occasion and it was not the only occasion, I think, on which he expressed doubts regarding Government enterprise.  According to a speech which he made in the Seanad, he thought that very little of the type of enterprise in which the Government may function was really remunerative. The Minister went on to say that only the Shannon scheme proper and certain advances from the Local Loans Fund could be regarded as remunerative. He has now stated very specifically in the Budget statement that the return from these enterprises is reasonably satisfactory.</P>

      <P>There is no hope for private enterprise but the Minister had not always such a high opinion of Government enterprise as he has now when £34,000,000 is to be borrowed for projects for which the Government is to be responsible in one way or another.  On the 14th March, 1947, column 2273, the Minister's views were:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government preached very much about inflation.  Inflation is a sort of bogeyman at the moment. The Government's very activities show they do not know what inflation is.  They are doing what I have mentioned already but, in addition, we heard of a vast reconstruction programme, of great telephone extensions, of marvellous stretches of broad, straight roads, more money <Col N="1983" /> on airports, and a lot of luxury hotels.  I do not know what fantastic business there is that the Government have not accepted.  We have heard of the various Bills for reconstruction, adding £1,000,000 or £2,000,000.  The one safeguard we have is that they are only programmes.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In column 1631 of the Official Report of this year's financial statement the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the White Paper of Receipts and Expenditure it is estimated that these &lsquo;below the line&rsquo; issues will amount to £19.6 million in the current financial year.  The expansion in this category of capital outlay by the State is all the more marked when comparison is made with 1938-39, when the comparable outlay was only £1.5 million.  Advances to the Electricity Supply Board in 1950-51 are estimated at £4,750,000, as compared with advances of £802,700 in 1938-39.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is an increase of six times.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Advances to the Local Loans Fund in 1950-51 are expected to reach £9,750,000 as against £450,000 in 1938-39,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;that is an increase of 22 times.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and advances to meet telephone capital expenditure are estimated at £2,250,000 this year as against actual issues of £240,000 in 1938-39.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is an increase of ten times in the telephone expenditure.  Let us get back to the Minister in 1947:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Surely it is realised that to pour more money out through the country, without adding to the stock of consumable goods in the country means inflation?  We can build roads&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
      <P>I think £5,000,000 or £6,000,000 is being spent by the local authorities on roads this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1984" />&mdash;&ldquo;until the country is riddled with straight, terraced roads.  Do we add to production?  Only very remotely, very indirectly.  We hear of telephone extensions, putting this country on a par with Sweden, one of the greatest telephone-using nations in the world. What do we want it for?  How much money is to be spent on telephone extensions?  Will it get any more consumer goods produced in the country? The money we have spent on airports and the money we propose to spend will not bring any more goods in, but there will be more money flowing through in circulation.</P>
    <P>The same applies to these luxury hotels, only we have added to it that you bring in, not merely money to make future claims on our small stock of consumer goods but bring the people to consume the goods. Yet, these are the designs that the Government have on our economy in the future.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister has rather changed his attitude now about tourism.  I suppose the Deputies whose parrot cry is &ldquo;luxury hotels!&rdquo; do not understand that in one Italian city there are more bedrooms than in the whole of this country.  He says now:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Net receipts from tourism are estimated to have fallen in 1949 and, as holidays abroad become more popular for our own people and Ireland loses some of its special attractions for visitors, every effort will be needed to sustain this important source of external income.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know what the income is, but it has been estimated to be far more that what we get from the whole of our live-stock exports.</P>
    <P>I think this matter of tourism should be transferred to the Department of External Affairs, who have shown themselves so capable in providing entertainment.  I have here an extract from the <i>Irish Times</i>, from a contribution by a well-known writer, on 13th August last.  It shows the possibilities that exist in that Department for developing this business of national entertainment, if the Government will only properly attend to it.  The writer says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1985" />&ldquo;I saw Mr. MacBride before he went abroad&mdash;at the big reception&mdash; one just dare not refer to it as a &lsquo;hooley&rsquo;&mdash;in Iveagh House the other night.  It was given in honour of the distinguished visitors to Dublin for the Horse Show and nobody can deny that it was &lsquo;done&rsquo; exceedingly well.  I honestly do not believe that better catering could be provided in any other city of Europe at the moment&mdash;not even by Strasbourg, in spite of that <i>foie gras</i> which makes my mouth water even to think of it.  Everything was perfect, and in exquisite taste.  As the party was held of a Friday, as we say in the West, the buffet could not be opened until midnight, by which time most of the guests were fairly ravenous and did full justice to the excellent fare.</P>
    <P>It was a most interesting gathering. It is a long time since Dubliners had the opportunity to rub shoulders with a real live prince...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We continue on then and we are told that, as well as catering very admirably for the entertainment of these visitors, cultural activities are not forgotten. That is only what one would expect from the Department of External Affairs.  The writer says that Mr. So-and-so</P>
    <P>&ldquo;is also quite an accomplished dancer, although I did not notice him among the performers during the &lsquo;Walls of Limerick&rsquo;, which demands a certain amount of physical endurance, as well as terpsichorean grace.  The Swiss Minister, on the other hand, seemed to revel in the cavorting, which evidently is an essential element in this traditional dance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We may not have had the luxury hotels, but I suggest we have had something far better, which will add to the grace and the standard of entertainment in our capital city.  If the Department would only hand over the whole of this matter of tourist expansion and development to that Department, I am sure it would provide a useful field for their undoubted talents in that direction.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's statement with <Col N="1986" /> regard to investment, we are told that there is investment of the class to which I have just referred and which the Minister had certain strong views about in the past.  He says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is, however, a wide range of useful capital work which private investors cannot be expected to undertake and which, therefore, must be done on a collective basis by the State.  There is investment which, though expected to be directly remunerative, is beyond the resources of private enterprise to undertake or to finance; power development is an example.  There is investment, such as land reclamation and afforestation, from which the return may not be immediate or conspicuous enough to stimulate private enterprise.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think the Minister himself has expressed doubts whether the aim that he has set before himself, in these enterprises which he regards as of such a productive nature that they should be able to service the debt incurred upon them, is likely to be realised.  In dealing with agricultural development, in column 1635 we are told:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This total outlay of £6,250,000 is being treated as proper to be met from borrowing, a course suggested by its developmental character but which will, in the end, be justified only if the expected increase in agricultural output is secured and is consolidated by an improvement in competitive efficiency in the export market.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So that the investment of these Marshall Aid funds will not have repaid their expenditure unless we are in a better position to compete with the Danes than the Minister for Agriculture leads us to believe is the case at present.  We have reference to the risks.  The arguments for and against are so skilfully balanced in the Budget statement and the paragraphs so beautifully sandwiched&mdash;that in regard to the risks in State investment, for example, being confined to a comparatively small paragraph towards the end of the section&mdash;that one wonders whether the exposition of the principles has not been weighted in such a way that any Minister might be able to <Col N="1987" /> argue an entirely different point of view and even to come to conclusions contradictory of what might seem to follow from the premises in that statement.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the repatriation of external assets, we are told that savings should increase and manpower should be gainfully occupied, but that there is a risk of a lowering of living standards if home production does not expand in such a manner as to compensate for the loss of the income derived from the external assets.  One thing about this Budget statement is that it does give the country very useful information about this question of sterling assets and the problems of repatriating them which are not at all as simple or as beneficial to the national interest as some ministerial spokesmen would try to lead the country to believe.  I hope the Minister will get his colleagues to study and indeed he himself might study some of these principles from which he seems to lean away and which seem to have been put in as a stop-gap lest this runaway juggernaut car of the Coalition should get completely out of control.</P>
    <P>The national income, we are told, was £350,000,000 in 1949 and in 1938 it was £154,000,000.  Was an income of £154,000,000 in 1938 not more valuable and not likely to purchase more than £350,000,000 in 1949?  I have read a calculation showing that the total amount of our sterling assets at present, having regard to the fact that the cost of goods has risen about two and a half times over the pre-war level, is not in fact any greater in terms of the goods it might be said to purchase than in the pre-war period.  We are told we ought to bring these assets back and apparently some people consider that the very fact of bringing them back, irrespective of whether they are spent on consumption goods leaving nothing behind or put into projects that can never hope to provide a return financially or to be described as productive in the proper sense, is better than leaving them where they are.  We have the advice now of people who condemned the transfer of these assets to this country in 1938 as thoroughly unwise <Col N="1988" /> and foolish.  They were described at that time as being a cushion, a shield or protection against our finding ourselves in the difficulties in which countries like New Zealand found themselves when they had to go with their hats in their hand to London, in the depth of a trade depression, to try to borrow moneys to make up in some way for the assets they had allowed to be dissipated.</P>

      <P>The Minister in the Seanad last year referred to the dangers of this policy at column 142 of the Seanad debates of 26th October. He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;From one angle, it is very good to enthuse about capital development here at home and at times hearts might beat a little bit faster when they hear of these sums of money increasing from £700,000 up to £7,500,000 over a period of the financial year.  But sending that money into circulation through the hands of the community, into which the money must get when expended, has, of course, a very definite inflationary effect.  Unless it were to lead to an immediate production of goods&mdash;and very little of this money as expended in this way is to lead to an immediate production of goods&mdash; there is bound to be inflation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is an admission.  The Minister continued:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;So at once, while I am pursuing this desirable course...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>How it can be desirable if no goods are produced as a result of its operation and when the Minister says that, in order to counter inflation, greater production of goods is the immediate necessity is perhaps to be explained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;...of making a tremendous increase in capital development, do not forget the other side, that I may be weakening the value of the Irish £ and, with the high rate at which Government expenditure is running, our capital account and current account and with our situation in <Col N="1989" /> respect of balance of payments, I am not too sure...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Neither am I.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...but Senator O'Brien has said he agrees that one may take the risk and, even though in the short run what you do may have an inflationary effect, it may be necessary to take the risk in order to get certain desirable objectives achieved.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is this risk that is spoken of and which has been described as being perfectly legitimate?  The Minister has been assured that it is perfectly legitimate from every point of view to do what he is contemplating doing in this Budget.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons, apparently, that he is being urged to do it and why it is beneficial is that the investor may get better terms and more security.  He may get better terms and higher yields for his investment in Government funds at home than he is likely to get elsewhere.  He will not have the trouble of risking what the private <i>entrepreneur</i> has to risk, the competition of trade, the trouble of going into the market and fighting his way there.  He will comfortably invest the money that he has, probably his savings, and, in the words I have quoted, it is hoped he will get a higher return.  Who is going to pay for this higher return?  Is it those enterprises which up to this year the Minister had contemptuously described as being incapable of paying their way?  Even the best of them did not fulfil the strict principles that the Minister then had.  Are they going to pay?  If they are not going to pay, still less are those projects of social and human improvement which we hear so much about and which, in fact, are only going to add to the national debt so far as their financial results are concerned. If the State has to give a higher return as well as more security, it may well happen, as the figures I have given of the charges which the taxpayer has to bear for even the sums which are being borrowed this year suggest, that the cure may be very much worse than the disease.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Many countries,&rdquo; the Minister stated, &ldquo;are carrying a heavy burden of debt.&rdquo;  Of course they are.  Countries <Col N="1990" /> that have been through the war, or that had an armed neutrality on a scale that we had not, may have a heavier burden of debt.  It was stated by the Banking Commission before the war that we had no reason to boast, that the Scandinavian and other small countries had very small accretions of debt, if you measure the debt by the amount per head of the population. When the Minister takes credit to himself for being able to tell us that the amount of taxation is only 23 per cent. of the national income and has not substantially increased, it seems to me that the figures show clearly that it has increased.  &ldquo;On a broad view, Government borrowing and spending has not imposed an increased strain on the economy.&rdquo;  It has not imposed an increased strain on the economy because money was not borrowed to anything like the same extent.  There has been more borrowed in the past few years than during the whole of the period Fianna Fáil were in office.  In any case, we had the war period then. You would not have borrowing for the enterprises because you had not the materials to carry them on, even if you wished to.  The point is that we are only starting off.</P>
    <P>It is rather early for the Minister to assure the country, before it has even received the first impact of his new policy, that it is not going to impose an increased strain on the economy. He tells us that he means &ldquo;that they should produce the revenue sufficient to service the loan charges either by yielding a direct return or by increasing the national income and so augmenting the yield of taxation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What does he mean by increasing the national income?  If a drunkard spends his weekly salary of £5 or £6 in the public house and the Exchequer reaps the benefit, there may be some advantage to the revenue, but surely there is not an advantage to the country.  It seems to me that it would be more legitimate for the Minister to argue that his aim is not in fact production but spending, that the more money that is put into circulation the more is likely to be spent on goods on which taxes are paid and the revenue, as in the case of tobacco and spirits this <Col N="1991" /> year where you have larger releases, will, of course, bring in very much larger and in fact swollen sums of money to the Exchequer.  If you regard that as a desirable aim, then the spending of millions of pounds extra may, from a certain financial point of view, be quite all right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>To get more money when the President of the United States had stated that the whole world was being plunged into a terrible situation at the end of 1947.  The Minister talked about savings, but he has given us no information to show whether, in fact, the margin of savings is sufficient to meet the needs of private enterprise if he is to spend anything in the nature of £34,000,000 and to raise that by borrowing. There is a certain amount of money available for investment.  Last year the Minister stated that about half of the money came from the external assets which were realised and the other half from savings.  But the burden of Government borrowing has increased enormously and the Minister has given us no estimate of the total outlay of money which will be required for private capital purposes as well as public capital purposes and how that is to be divided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a number of pious remarks about private capital.  &ldquo;Private investment is being encouraged in many ways,&rdquo; the Minister tells us.  Perhaps that is the reason why we are not given any information as to the amount of money required by private industrialists and others.  &ldquo;The State can indirectly promote repatriation for productive domestic development by maintaining conditions favourable to private investment in our own resources and by its own investment and financial policy.&rdquo;  Then he goes on to refer to the danger that the import surplus, when these assets are brought back, may go merely to increase current consumption, not into capital <Col N="1992" /> investment.  Direct capital expenditure by the State is a net addition to domestic capital development only in so far as it does not restrict or delay private domestic investment which would otherwise have taken place.  In fact, the Minister tells us that he is going to depend very largely on Government funds for the financing of some of these enterprises.  The sterling investments might gradually be replaced by Irish Government securities though, in doing that, he recognises that there may be an inflationary tendency and that the Government will have to take extreme care that there will be no adverse consequences.  Last year, the Minister said, about one-fifth of the total national expenditure went in capital expenditure and that he considered it too high, having regard to the level of savings.</P>
    <P>There are some estimates here&mdash; they may be right: they may be wrong. We are told that £50,000,000 in 1948 represented the value of new capital goods brought into use and increase in stocks and work in progress, and £51,000,000 in 1949.  It seems extraordinary if there is only an increase of £1,000,000, to ½ per cent., in the 1948-49 period in respect of capital goods brought in, increase in stocks and work in progress.  However, the point I wish to make is that, not savings but Government funds are to a very large extent going to be the method of financing some of these projects. We have, of course, the Marshall Aid Fund.  I recognise that the Minister has to expend on the projects which are most likely, in the long term, to develop our national production, the credits in that fund.  He suggests that he is going to finance other items of capital expenditure from it.  What I do not understand is why, if that fund is available and if there is necessity for developing long-term capital projects which, thanks to the generosity of the American people, we are in a position to do from the Counterpart Fund, we should not have confined our programme to such activities instead of taking over, in addition to what the Marshall Aid Fund and other Government funds are being asked to undertake, the items of expenditure which <Col N="1993" /> in the past had always been met in the ordinary way from revenue.</P>
    <P>With regard to the private investor, I think it will be admitted that, so far as the development of our trade is concerned, we are very largely dependent upon him.  In the export trade, for example, if the problem of the balance of payments is regarded, as it is in England and elsewhere, as the central one, the development of our exports must be one of our primary aims.  I think everyone will agree that it is the private undertaker who is going to look after our export trade.  There is no incentive in this Budget to that private <i>entrepreneur.</i>  There are no allowances, no incentives, no relief from taxation and no allowance for the reequipment of his factory.  Very extensive allowances and very great facilities are given in another part of this country to induce people to start industries there.  Factory sites are presented free.  Factories are actually being built at public expense.  I cannot believe that the Minister thinks for a moment that the type of project which he is now going to ask the public to invest in is going to give better results in the way of building up our exports or even in giving permanent employment than private enterprise in the long run will give.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that if we proceed in the other direction we are going to be in for a period of State planning.  We are going to control investment; we are going to control capital; we are going to control the enterprises and, in the long run, we are going&mdash;as is too often the case in this country&mdash;to leave it to the State to initiate new schemes and to provide employment instead of trying, as far as we possibly can, to induce private investors to work themselves and to go ahead.  I have no objection to private investors getting a reasonable profit. I do not think any Minister on the <Col N="1994" /> Government side who has had experience of administration in the past will deny that they are entitled to a reasonable&mdash;not an unreasonable&mdash;return on the moneys they invest.  I would be as strong as any member of this House against industrialists or distributors taking undue profits.  I feel, however, that in the state in which the world is at present and in our own state of development, we may take a wrong turn and, to make quite sure that there is room for the private investor&mdash;not to crush him out; to give him every encouragement&mdash;the Minister should have given more attention to the problem than he does in this Budget.  It is entirely taken up with State projects as if they were the be all and the end all and as if there could be no other useful aim economically than to go in for State enterprises.</P>
      <P>Take the question of housing.  The Minister, in the Seanad, remarked on the &ldquo;inefficient attempts to catch up on these arrears in the interval between the wars&rdquo;.  I think we can point to a fairly good achievement during that period.  In ten years I think 140,000 houses were built.  The Minister referred to the fact&mdash;I think in the same speech&mdash;that inflation has already had its effects on house building.  Even the Taoiseach has admitted that housing is in a very special category.  He said, in a speech dealing with this question of capital investment, as it is called&mdash;a speech delivered to the Clonmel Chamber of Commerce:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A great deal of money was being spent on housing, involving the sacrifice of assets now yielding a money income without adding to the national income.  That loss must be replaced. He was almost ruefully aware of the difficulties attached to the Government's projects&mdash;a wasteful application of capital, and that people might overlook that to invest you must have funds.  We were fortunate in having external resources to supplement current savings.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But these external resources are no greater now than they were before the war.  The point is that instead of enabling the people themselves to spend them properly, according to their <Col N="1995" /> own desires, or leaving the money in their pockets, the new idea is that the State can do it better.  It is not alone in Whitehall that the Civil Service or the Minister knows best what should be done.  That is the position also in Dublin.</P>
    <P>We object to housing subsidies being borrowed.  We remember that the Minister's advisers, when they had a different opinion, suggested that subsidies should not be granted in a form involving the creation of long term debt; they should be met from year to year.  Now it is suggested that every single penny should be borrowed.  The excuse the Minister gives is that this is a wholly abnormal situation, spreading the exceptional cost of houses over a reasonable period.  In what way is it abnormal?  Does the Minister suggest there is going to be a considerable reduction in the cost of materials or labour in any reasonable period of years?  Does it not stand to reason that for a very long period this constructional work of building hospitals, houses and schools must go on, and that even when the programme is completed, there will be the question of wastage and work must go on permanently?</P>
    <P>When the Minister's advisers were of another opinion they disapproved very strongly of that course.  It would be improper, they said, to admit into this category items which, as in the Swedish budget I spoke of, should be amortised for a short period of years into a special fund.  It would be improper to admit into this category items of expenditure like the provision of school buildings and Civic Guard barracks, though they possess a certain capital character on commercial practice analogy, but, in the life of the State, they are recurrent needs that should be met from the Budget.</P>
    <P>Will anybody deny that that is the position?  We have, up to the present, paid for schools.  If we are going to borrow for schools and hospitals, why not borrow for every constructional work?  There is nothing abnormal about the building of schools.  The costs are likely to continue somewhat as they are, but, even if there be a <Col N="1996" /> reduction, the Minister is not treating this as abnormal in the sense that it is going to be dealt with in the next two or three years.  He has devised and proposes in the future to implement, as far as he can, this whole principle of borrowing to meet expenditure that was normally met every year.</P>
    <P>There were some other remarks, in view of the Minister's feeling that he has the consolation of knowing he is getting the approbation of those who condemned these practices so strongly in the past, to remind him that in the 1938 Banking Commission Report they mentioned in what, I think in present circumstances, is a singularly appropriate phrase, that borrowing to meet expenditure of dead-weight debt might provide too easy a recourse to the creation of such debt&mdash;might provide an insidious facility for evading obligations which ought to be discharged in cash as they matured.</P>
    <P>They went on to state that it is the general view, not alone of politicians in opposition to Government, but of economists in general&mdash;and no doubt it was largely responsible for the views put forward in that report&mdash;that the people must be protected from the dangers of having a Government that refuses to face its responsibilities, refuses to pay its way, but is devising shifts and expedients and getting into debt by not making proper provision at the time or not exercising suitable discretion and avoiding such expenditure altogether.  The temptation, they say, is to make concessions in the present with the knowledge that the responsibilities will fall on the future. It is an opportunity that often presents itself to Governments and we cannot very well blame the Banking Commission if they held the view that it was necessary to check-mate, restrain, constrict the Government in its opportunities for borrowing.</P>
    <P>What is extraordinary is that the economists, who said that they believed that particular philosophy at that time, should now come forward and enable the Minister to boast that he has professorial thought&mdash;I am afraid it is more academic than practical&mdash;in advising him that he is quite right and safe and that it is a desirable policy to mortgage the future to <Col N="1997" /> the extent that he proposes in the very large scale long-term commitments upon which he is now embarking.  We used to be told that the dam was very light in 1947, that it was scarcely sufficient to hold back the flood of inflation, and it was more a miracle of Providence than any design of man-made Government that prevented its being broken through.  But apparently the sluices are now open and we are going to have a full flow.</P>
    <P>In this statement to which I refer you might argue anything you like, that repatriation is a good or a bad thing, that it is a dangerous policy to embark on wholesale borrowing, that it is not likely to succeed; or, on the other hand, that it is a necessary thing and will give desirable results. The Minister is in the position of a tight rope walker and when he tells us that he is giving a remission, a very trifling one, to the amateur wrestling association, I think that he is, perhaps, remembering the shadow-boxing that used to take place between himself and some of his ministerial colleagues in connection with these financial matters, questions of credit and so on.  Perhaps we shall see the Coalition groups themselves entitled to some such remission in the future when they transfer whatever wrestling exhibitions that now go on in private to the public platform.</P>
    <P>So far it has been largely shadow-boxing on their part, but we remember that the Minister told us that we were the only civilised country practically which allowed the banks to control credit.  We remember that he told us, lest we might think that he was a very conservative Minister, that he would rather be classed with the monetary cranks, like Deputy Cowan and Deputy Flanagan, and so on.  Quite recently the Minister went to the Seanad and, in the same way as he has changed his mind about capital investment and the worthwhileness of some of our national enterprises, the policy of dead-weight debt and borrowing, he has also changed his mind about devaluation. He has told us that, even if all these barriers in the way of Acts of Parliament were not there at all, he is not at all sure that on a general balance of consideration as to what is best in the national interest we should <Col N="1998" /> not devalue in the same way as the British have done.  He assured the Oireachtas that the banks are only doing their job.  It was certainly very hard on the Minister that, following on the statements of some of his colleagues, he had to go to the Seanad and he, who had been so eloquent in telling us that we were the only State that had left the control of credit to the banks, in sackcloth and ashes had to announce there that he had recanted his heresy.</P>
    <P>The Minister, together with his friends composing the pressure groups in the Coalition, is rather in the position of a convert.  He reminds me of the landed proprietor in this country who, like certain other people, had to change his religion at a certain time in order to keep his estates.  He presented himself to the Synod.  The Protestant Archbishop was in the chair. He said: &ldquo;What have you come for, my good man?&rdquo;&ldquo;I have come to get my estate.&rdquo;&ldquo;Oh, not that surely!&rdquo;&ldquo;Oh well, to change my religion.&rdquo;&ldquo;Oh, not to change your religion, but the error of it.&rdquo;&ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;Transubstantiation and the Trinity.&rdquo;&ldquo;Oh, not the Trinity&mdash;Transubstantiation.&rdquo;&ldquo;Whatever your Grace pleases.&rdquo;  That is the position into which the Minister for Finance has been driven.  It is a case of whatever the pressure groups in the Coalition require him to say or do.  That is the principle underlying the Budget.</P>
    <P>At column 132 of Seanad Debates of 26th October, 1949, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No doubt, the banks had in mind the question of the price stability of corporation stocks and how freely they are marketable at any given time and also how freely they are marketable if thrown on the market in any big quantities, and having taken a view of that the banks made up their minds that in regard to the corporation they had alternative investments of a better type.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was in connection with the Dublin Corporation loan.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;One cannot blame the commercial banks for taking that financial consideration into account.  There is a good deal of clamour that the banks should think more about the <Col N="1999" /> provision of amenities like housing. But the banks probably say that it is for some authority other than banks to deal with that.  They would probably pass the matter on to the Government and say: &lsquo;If you can improve the situation by some other method, maybe we could lend you the money, because the investment might become a more profitable one.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So much for the control of credit by the banks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the House that I shall not spend an hour-and-a-half, as Deputy Derrig has done, in practically re-reading the Minister's Budget speech.  I think the real need to-day is a more equitable distribution of the wealth of the country.  Let us picture for ourselves 100 persons, two rich, eight comfortable, 60 poor and 30 very poor; that is how wealth is distributed to-day in this country.  Yet, we have Deputy Derrig speaking for over an hour-and-a-half without giving us any indication of what he would consider a suitable alternative to the Minister's Budget.  Last Thursday at column 1785 of Dáil Debates, Deputy Lemass said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is clear that if he attempts to draw off from the amount available for investment this year any sum approaching half the total amount he intends to borrow, not merely will he stifle normal private enterprise but he will force this country into a position in which all private enterprise will cease.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I press home one point?  In the greatest hour of need that this country has ever known in the last war it was State intervention that saved us and not private enterprise.  I listened carefully to Deputy Derrig.  His one idea seemed to be that private enterprise was the solution for all our ills.  Let us discuss this in a dispassionate way. Private enterprise and capitalism control industry here and the community has to make good the disadvantages that accrue to those people private enterprise can no longer employ to make a profit out of them.  Private enterprise and capitalism have given <Col N="2000" /> us the slums and the airless hovels and it is the community's purse that must provide the hospitals and sanatoria to heal the victims.  Private enterprise and capitalism have given us the wounded from the factories and workshops and it is the community's purse that must provide the hospitals to cure them and bring them back to normal health and conditions of living again.</P>
    <P>Is Deputy Derrig serious in suggesting that social enterprise is to be the ambulance man and the mess cleaner of private enterprise?  He speaks of there being no room for private enterprise. What do we find?  We had a case recently of the General Textile Company, Athlone, where the chairman of the credit corporation made the following statements: that the General Textile Company had created an all-time record when they asked for £200,000 as capital last year and got £7,000,000 subscribed in 15 minutes. That is the private enterprise that Deputy Lemass and Deputy Derrig have advocated in this House during the past week.</P>
    <P>Let me say in all seriousness that the problem of reconciling private enterprise and private profits with public welfare is not soluble.  They can be no more reconciled than fire and water because one extinguishes the other. The Deputy quoted for us for nearly an hour, from the important statement we had heard from the Minister for Finance.  Let me say that the statement the Minister made in introducing this Budget is one of vital importance to the country and I hope that many people outside this House will read and study that statement.  The Minister is to be congratulated in so far as the statement embraces an economic survey, the question of national debt and private and public investments.  It is a masterpiece.  Let me say however, and let nobody have any doubts about it, that I still hold the view that neither this country nor any other country can borrow itself into prosperity.  Let that be clear.</P>
    <P>We heard quite a lot about the Electricity Supply Board.  Deputy Lemass said last Thursday that we were not going sufficiently fast in spending money in the production of electricity <Col N="2001" /> here.  I got certain information arising out of a question recently in the Dáil as to the financial position of the Electricity Supply Board.  I was informed that in 20 years ending March, 1950, there was £22,680,930 given to the Electricity Supply Board and during that period they have paid no less than £12,059,396 in interest alone.  We have paid back in that same period in redemption of the whole of the £22,000,000 the magnificent sum of £963,840.  You might therefore say that for every £ I pay for an electric light, 6/- goes for interest alone. Deputy Bartley last week asked a question about the amount and the cost of the loans given under the Gaeltacht Housing Acts, 1929 to 1949, and he got an answer to the effect that there was a total of £173,117 given in loans.  Of that £96,311 was given at 5 per cent., £73,381 at 4¼ per cent., and, of course, when the rates of interest went down, £1,021 at 3¼ per cent.  This is the important point, that of the £160,888 advanced, the cost of repayment including principal and interest will amount to more than twice the sums issued.  I suggest to Deputies on all sides of the House that it is about time to stop playing politics, as many Deputies are doing here, and that we should deal with the problem that faces us because this thing cannot go on.</P>
    <P>Apart from the national debt, which I understand now reaches £160,000,000, there is a municipal debt of over £40,000,000.  I speak with some intimate knowledge of the position in my own city.  The Cork Corporation have paid in the past 12 years £767,027 interest on money borrowed to do socially desirable things.  In other words they have had to pay £63,980 per annum for interest on money borrowed. What do we find at the other end? Our rates are 31/6 in the £ and less than 2d. in the £ is for housing.  Are these not questions that every Deputy should think seriously over?  We are sent here to deal deliberately with these grave issues and these problems and I submit we are not doing it.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee on this night week addressing a meeting of his Party in O'Connell Hall, O'Connell Street, <Col N="2002" /> dealt with the Budget and let me say without any prejudice that the statement which I am about to quote was a most damaging and a most unpatriotic statement to make about this country or about the people who have charge of the affairs of this country. Amongst other things he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is proposed to take no less than £106,120,233 out of the savings of our little community, to spend these millions in its own interest and the interest of the political Parties which constitute the Coalition.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government proposes to launch the State on a career of unbridled extravagance in which every public interest and the resources of the industrious, thrifty and honest elements were to be sacrificed to the urgent need to buy political support at any price with the savings of the people.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from a speech reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> on 3rd of this month, a speech made in the O'Connell Hall, O'Connell Street, this night week.  The Deputy went on, and it is most interesting to hear him say it:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The screw is to be put on the banks to do what Mr. McGilligan has admitted the public are not prepared to do.  That is the explanation of the cold war which the Coalition spokesmen have been waging on the Irish banks.  The banks naturally, because they had certain traditional standards of conduct in these matters, were apparently refusing to become the instruments whereby the cautious thrift of their customers was to be fully explored and exploited.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I ask: is that a statement which a thorough Irishman would make with regard to the financial position of this country?  Speaking further about the banks, he says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Unless the banks stood firm and the people supporting them, the State was heading for financial <Col N="2003" /> chaos.  Inevitably in its train would follow hardship and suffering and widespread unemployment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>An ex-Minister of this House made that statement about the banks, who have taken £33,000,000 in net profits alone during the past 25 years from our people on a paid capital of only £9,000,000.  I suggest that such statements are very detrimental to the State.  If it means anything, it is telling the banks not to help the Government that is dealing with the financial position of the country to-day.  There is no other interpretation that can be put upon it.  I would like to know the extent of the banks' assets, in addition to their £33,000,000 net profits.</P>
    <P>I have been listening to Deputies, hoping that I would hear something practical.  I would not mind from which side of the House a practical suggestion came.  Not one seemed to give a thought to the question of how we have been treating our old age pensioners or the mothers of children.  No more important work is being done in this country than is being done by the mothers who are rearing families for the nation.  We are spending millions of money on many things but I know of nothing that would give a better and more lasting result than the expenditure of £1,500,000 or £2,000,000 on our children, so that they would grow up to be healthy men and women.  That is not possible at the moment on what they are getting.</P>
    <P>What are we doing about unemployed people?  It would be well if those who are in safe positions, who have good investments and security for the future, would consider the position of the man who is thrown out of employment and who has to go to the labour exchange and perhaps sign on there for the rest of his life.  We give him a fixed sum of 16/- a week to clothe and feed him for the seven days of the week.  Deputies speak for one and a half and two hours, trying to score political points, forgetting the people who made it possible for us to be here and who were responsible for the establishment of this State.  I do not speak with political prejudice but I would expect that Deputies would have some realisation of their responsibility. <Col N="2004" /> There are serious changes about to take place in the world.  There is a social revolution taking place in the world to-day and none of us can tell what the economic and social position of this country will be in the near future.</P>
    <P>I would like to know how the national income is being spent.  It would be interesting to know how much is spent on food, wages, rent and interest charges.  The Statistics Branch should be able to supply that information.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the Government and the Minister for Finance should immediately consider the advisability of increasing the old age pension and family allowances.  It is not good enough that, where there are three children in the family, allowance is paid in respect of only one.</P>

      <P>That is all.  The problems that we are faced with must be dealt with in the near future.  Deputy Derrig or any other Deputy may blame this Minister or the last Minister but I have always made it clear that I could not blame them because we are not in control of our credit and our money. There is no pandering to a Socialist State.  It is a dishonest statement to say that this country is well on the road to a Socialist State.  I take my stand with the Archbishop of Australia who stated recently that it was contrary to right order that the control of <Col N="2005" /> money and credit of a country should be in individuals or a group of individuals. It should be the function of the State.</P>
      <P>It is wrong that we have to pay £12,000,000 over a period of 20 years so that our people may get electric light. It would be well if some of the Deputies realised that there are thousands of families in this country who have in their homes only a candle and an oil-lamp and that they are contributing their share to the taxes as well as some of the wealthy magnates for whom all the sympathy is expressed here.  I would suggest&mdash;and I hope the Government will take heed&mdash;that we must have more equitable distribution of the wealth of this country.  I appeal on behalf of the old age pensioners, the widows and orphans and the unemployed. Do not forget that the unemployed are question marks for each and every one of us.  It is not merely a matter of statistics.  They are human question marks.  The sooner we realise that, the sooner we will be doing something for our country.</P>

      <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with many of the remarks of the last speaker.  It is a big burden on people who want to get a roof over their heads that the rent should be unduly inflated by interest charges. Deputy Hickey quoted a reply which I got from the Minister for Lands to a question, which showed that these charges can very often be out of due proportion to the facility granted.  It seems to me that the remarks of Deputy Hickey do not make a consistent whole.  I cannot see how you can avoid borrowing and, if you do borrow, I think you will have to pay for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House subscribe to the principle of borrowing, provided borrowing is for projects that are well worth while.  If anybody looks back over the annual Budget statement for a number of years, he will find that the Fianna Fáil Budgets did include borrowings.  The borrowings in this Budget cover the <Col N="2006" /> same things as the Fianna Fáil Budgets and some things which the Fianna Fáil Budgets did not include. I am not approaching the question of borrowing from the point of view of principle, but the proportion of borrowings in the Fianna Fáil Budgets to the total amount was much smaller and the number of things considered to be of a capital nature is much greater now.  The borrowing to meet the deficit in the present Budget represents 14 per cent. while the comparable figure in Fianna Fáil Budgets on no occasion exceeded 2 per cent.</P>
      <P>I am not so much worried about the amount; what I am considering is the uses to which it is being put and what benefits will result.  I naturally examined the question in relation to the conditions in my own constituency.  I see that the Government has changed its attitude regarding the turf industry and has increased capital investment in it.  My only regret is that there was any break in the turf policy or else that this change did not take place sooner.  Quite recently the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that he found difficulty in recruiting men for the turf schemes upon which he now looks more kindly and upon which he has agreed to spend money. My reply to that is that when he stopped the hand-won turf scheme with a slap the people who had been earning good money on that scheme cleared out of the country immediately.</P>
      <P>I know that the people in the cities got heart scald from the bad turf during the last years of the emergency. We all know, however, that we had most abnormal weather from about the middle of 1946 for nearly a year and a half and the public view of turf was largely coloured by that and that in turn had an effect on the politics of the turf situation.  In my opinion it was regrettable that it was turned into a political question, and we have had large emigrations from these districts for that reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I ask myself whether the money is going in any other direction which will benefit these districts I turn naturally to the question of roads and I find that in parts of my area the people lack bus services because the <Col N="2007" /> county council has not enough money for the repair of roads and bridges.</P>

      <P>The borrowing of money, as I have pointed out, is not frowned upon on this side of the House, but we certainly feel that borrowing to meet a deficit and to pay for things which in the ordinary course of events should be met from revenue is false finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Housing grants, as in the past, should be financed from revenue, but I can see the need at the present time for borrowing for housing.  In spite of <Col N="2008" /> their having been increased the grants for housing are not sufficient to enable a man to build a house for himself even when he supplies his own labour.  Even if members of his family can build walls and do carpentry work he cannot build a house with the financial facilities at present available.  In my opinion borrowing is necessary to meet that situation which has also been adversely affected by the fact that suppliers in some towns are not willing to give credit to the ordinary builder as they did heretofore unless the person concerned is prepared to put down a deposit of £100.  That is the position in Galway City at the present time and not only has it crippled and hamstrung building under the Local Government Acts but the Minister for Lands finds that he cannot get supplies in the Galway area to implement his schemes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick) Joseph Blowick">

      <P>I have only the information of applicants who have told me that they cannot get on with the work themselves.  I do not know what the Minister's official information is on the matter but people have come to me and made this complaint.  There is a good deal of money in the country and in a county like Galway where in one part the people are comfortable and in the other poor the people who are comfortable can build houses and they have first call on the timber, etc., which the suppliers hold.  That is the present position and the Minister for Lands can take my assurance that unless it is remedied in some way it will interfere very seriously with building west of the Corrib.  I have had complaints from people who wanted to build houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to deal too much with housing, but it seems to me that something must be done on the lines suggested by Deputy Hickey when he spoke of municipal housing.  We all know that the rents of houses in urban areas are prohibitive and I do not know how that can be met but it seems to me that if the organised workers and the municipal authorities got together it should not be beyond their <Col N="2009" /> ability to do something to ease the position.  I heard that after the first world war the municipal authorities in Vienna had a problem of this sort and met it by some system of municipal finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event it was carried out successfully for a period in Vienna but it was stopped by international vested interests which had some influence in the League of Nations.</P>
      <P>The fact is that the cost of houses is almost prohibitive.  At the present time the Minister for Local Government is preparing a scheme for differential rents in urban areas.  He would not be engaging on a difficult task of that sort unless he himself were satisfied that there was a real need for it.</P>
      <P>The main characteristic of the Budget has been referred to by many speakers, that is, the complete change of outlook of the Minister for Finance and those for whom he speaks in relation to a great many matters.  Possibly there is a great deal of elasticity allowed to a politician, but when we find the professors of economics taking part in the same acrobatics we have to sit up and take notice.  People who signed a very conservative Banking Commission Report before the war and who are now in the Seanad have swallowed everything they said at that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>In those days, the housing grants were financed not out of borrowings but out of revenue. Even then, the scale of house building, even on those conservative lines, was denounced by the people who are prepared now to accept as a useful and wise experiment the financing of that very same service out of borrowing. We know that the science of economics is not an exact science, but surely there ought to be some more consistency in it than is evidenced by these people who hold themselves <Col N="2010" /> forth as economic scientists.  We politicians have not, I think, made any more notable somersault in regard to this matter than that to which I have just referred.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in so far as he is prepared to borrow money to finance worthwhile capital projects, has the full support of this Party.  We are pleased to see that he is prepared to find money for these purposes, purposes which he denounced in round terms when he was in Opposition.  We welcome his change of outlook in that respect.  He will get all the encouragement which Fianna Fáil can give where a project of that kind finds favour with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister claimed, when he was in opposition, that the Fianna Fáil bill was £10,000,000 or £15,000,000 too great, that if he got into power, without in any way curtailing services which were being provided, the cost, through economy and efficiency, could be reduced by this £10,000,000.  It is interesting to note that the figure of the last Fianna Fáil Budget was £65,000,000 odd and that this year the Minister proposes to spend £87,000,000. That is £22,000,000 more than the Fianna Fáil Budget.  One must remember that Fianna Fáil provided the transatlantic air service, they had a hand-won turf scheme as well as a machine turf scheme, and generally the poorer areas had a prosperity that had never come their way before.  Now with this huge bill, the standard of these areas has been reduced, the young people who were employed at home have gone away and have been lost to the country and the question the people ask is: &ldquo;What is being done with the money?&rdquo;  That is the question which we in this House, as representatives, put to the Minister.  The national debt when the war broke out was somewhere in the region of £70,000,000 and when the war was over and we handed over the Government, it was £95,000,000. That is to say, that in the whole period of nine years from 1939 to the end of 1947, during all that terrible emergency and war period, the national debt was increased by only £25,000,000. Now, in two years, the present Government has increased the national debt <Col N="2011" /> by a further £50,000,000.  Fianna Fáil carried on with an increase of £25,000,000 during the war.  We are entitled to ask on what grounds such an enormous increase in borrowing can be justified, in view of the fact that in rural areas employment has decreased.</P>
    <P>I do not think I could offer any fairer comment on this Budget than the comment that was made by the <i>Irish Times</i> a day or two after the Budget appeared.  They gave a very non-committal summary of its provisions and this very interesting statement was made.  It made some reference to the Minister's conservative outlook on finance and said that the financial proposals &ldquo;represented a thoroughly sensible policy of masterly inactivity.&rdquo; I do not think I could add anything to that.</P>

      <P>Every country town in Ireland provides an example of the elderly gentleman who usually wears a black bowler hat, who has become so conservative that he fears to use credit and in almost every town there is the enterprising younger man who knows his business, who is not afraid to use credit when he can use it advantageously, and who is fated ultimately to acquire the business of the elderly gentleman with the bowler hat.  His premises grow rustier and dustier, his windows grow more full of flies and he has a comforting feeling that his savings in the bank are rather larger than they were.  The feeling of safety he enjoys consequentially grows greater every day, until he finally reduces his expenses to the purchase of a crust of bread and a glass of water; he does not buy boots and so does not come out any more; and ultimately, when nobody has seen him for two and a half years, he is respectably buried in a lonely grave and 90 per cent. of his neighbours have forgotten he exists, but his intestate estate reveals that he has £7,942 to which cousins in Australia are the sole heirs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question we have to decide is whether this country has reached a stage in its career when it should assume the black bowler hat of prudence <Col N="2012" /> so that its independence may be buried in a solitary grave and somebody better equipped to use the resources of this land shall take our country over and do with it what we might have done.  I am quite clear that this Government is right in making up its mind that our people desire to use the resources of which we dispose to the maximum advantage, that our people desire to pay what they owe and that our people desire to ensure that every year an expanding production and a more effective utilisation of our resources will secure not for a few wealthy residents but for all our people a higher standard of living than they have hitherto enjoyed.</P>
    <P>I anticipate no prospect of a group of millionaires in Ireland and my advice to any young man or woman who considers that the supreme goal of life on this earth is the attainment of monumental wealth to go elsewhere in search of it, for there is no prospect of any individual becoming a millionaire in Ireland.  I hope there never will be.  There is no possibility in this country of one man owning hundreds of square miles and thousands of men and their families getting a bare existence out of that land, while the owner, through the medium of rack rents, enjoys perennial wealth.  We put an end to that in Ireland and it will never be allowed to come back. But when we put an end to a situation which created an aggregation of great wealth in few hands, unless we were fools, and there were those who hoped we would be fools, we would not tolerate the consequences of terminating the possibilities that arise from the control of wealth by individuals, because, if you have no fountain of capital from which to irrigate natural resources, national production must wither and die away.</P>
    <P>If you are resolved that in so far as is practicable every man shall be his own master, shall have his own home and own his own farm, you have to reconcile yourself to the fact that such small proprietors do not ordinarily dispose of great capital sums as do those who own hundreds of square miles or great factories or vast properties. But a wise democracy contituted of property-owning men and <Col N="2013" /> women replaces the characteristics of an uncontrolled capitalist State with the power of the people's Government, acting for the people, prudently to use credit so that the resources of the State may be made to fructify.  In the last analysis, everybody in Ireland, whether farmer, doctor, lawyer, trade unionist, shopkeeper or otherwise, lives out of the land.  The only natural resource of consequence the Irish people have is 12,000,000 acres of arable, or potentially arable, land.  On the user of that land and on the volume of production from that land will be determined the standard of living of all our people.</P>
    <P>Deputies who are familiar with rural Ireland will long ago have noted this significant fact, that one of the relics of the landlord system in this country is the isolated instances where demesnes and home farms of the landlords have in them systems of field drains and ditches as well designed and as efficient as any in the world, and one may often ask oneself why did that degree of development stop at the farmer's fence and extend not a yard into the rented land where the people lived?</P>
    <P>The answer is grim but true.  It was our grandfathers and our great-grandfathers who made those drains at a penny a day, and they could not have been made except by famine labour&mdash; it would have cost too much.  This Government resolved that the grandsons and the great-grandsons of those who dug those drains for a penny a day would, in our time, enjoy that same amenity on their own holdings, with the comforting knowledge that those who made them would be amongst the most highly-paid technicians in the society in which we live, because those drains and those improvements are being extended to every acre of tenanted land in Ireland to-day, not by famine labour at a penny a day, but by great machines operated by highly-paid technicians, every one of which machines it was possible to buy because we borrowed money.</P>
    <P>Let us face this fact.  If we had been afraid to borrow, we might have sat down and reconciled ourselves to the fact that, for all time, whatever individual <Col N="2014" /> effort might attempt upon the land of Ireland, not 70 per cent. of a just return upon the effort would ever be available to our people, because the land they worked on was robbed of its capacity to produce by the fact that it was not in a condition to produce what it could and should do.  There is not a Deputy who does not know that, if the instrument of credit were not brought to the relief of that situation, that work could never be done and we would have passed into the ignoble category of the gentlemen in the black bowler hats turning green and gradually going down hill because they prefer to be misers rather than to be enterprising businessmen.  Is there any Deputy who deplores the investment of our people's savings in increasing the capacity of the land to produce?  If there is, is there any Deputy who can suggest any other method by which we could have made the land do what we are making it do to-day than the method we employ?  Is there anyone who doubts that, if by investing in the improvement of land you can make that land produce 30 per cent. more than it otherwise would for the same effort, it is the essence of folly to forbear from the investment?</P>
    <P>It is tragic to hear a Deputy like Deputy Bartley hugging himself in the happy thought that when Fianna Fáil were in office borrowings were microscopic. Of course they were.  That is what has us the way we are.  There was not a drain dug in the whole of Ireland since 1931.  Is not that an interesting fact?</P>

      <P>When they came to face the prospect of the possibility of a wide expansion in land improvement at the end of the war, no time was lost in drafting an Arterial Drainage Bill which was presented in this House as the foundation upon which was to be built a programme of drainage hitherto without precedent in Ireland.  But what was it in fact?  It was an Act of this House which finally delivered the Board of Works from the annoyance of people asking them why they would not drain the land of the country.  It was an Act which provided that no <Col N="2015" /> drainage might be done in rural Ireland which did not constitute part of the drainage of a catchment area of an arterial river; that no officer in the Board of Works would be engaged, directly or indirectly, in drainage work except as part of an arterial drainage scheme as defined by that Act; and the programme of drainage envisaged under that Act held out the hope that about the year 2150 they would be getting round to some of the larger rivers.  It was a fine comprehensive programme to avert unemployment in the 22nd century.</P>
      <P>That was not our idea of getting on with the job, the fundamental difference between us and Fianna Fáil being that we believe in the land and they do not.  That is the fundamental difference&mdash;that we on this side of the House do not believe in the proposition so often enunciated by the Fianna Fáil Party, that there is nothing that our people are capable of producing in this country which cannot be produced better and cheaper somewhere else.  I have heard that doctrine enunciated time and again by members of the Fianna Fáil Party and it is the key to their whole miserly, beggarman's approach to life.  They expect everyone in this country to be a beggar for charity, because they proceed on the assumption that our people and our country are incompetent to compete with any other people or country in the world.</P>
      <P>On this side of the House we are not interested in any production in Ireland which has not the promise of being better in quality and better in value than anything else produced in the world.  We do not believe in inducing our people to embark on competition with the mass-production industries of the United States of America; but we know that there is in our people's natural ability, that there is in the climate and soil of this country ability to produce a wide range of articles for domestic consumption and foreign exports that can take their place in any market in the world, price for price and quality for quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, for one, as Minister for Agriculture in this country, would never wish to see <Col N="2016" /> produced on the land of Ireland any agricultural product that was not equal or superior to the best that any other country had to offer.  It is in the conviction that we are well able to attain that standard that this country is resolved to make the physical qualities of the land the farmers own equal, if not superior to, those of the land their grandfathers and great-grandfathers were constrained to improve for the landlords who are no more.  After the land has been restored, are we revolutionaries if we maintain that those who work the land and produce the wealth out of which all the rest of the people live are entitled to have the minimum amenities which their city-dwelling neighbours enjoy?  Is it wrong to say that people living in the country shall be entitled to wash and cook and clean without having to carry every drop of water 50 or 100 yards from a neighbouring well?  Is it wrong to make provision, where the farmer is prepared to make his contribution too, to enable the farmer to put running water within reach of his wife, when the humblest resident of any town or city in the country would consider life without that amenity unthinkable?  Is it shortsighted or reckless to bring within the reach of the small farmer the amenity of light and power?  I will defend the proposition that it is an affront to a human being to force any man to do by physical effort that which he can make a machine under his control do.  Is it wrong to provide on the small farms of Ireland that small farmers who, God knows, have enough physical effort already, if they are to live at all, should be relieved of so much of it as they can be relieved of by the installation of electricity on their holding?  I know that there are certain aristocratically-minded persons who ask: &ldquo;What kind of life are we living in when country people want electricity?&rdquo;  But the bulk of the Deputies of this House come from small farmer stock.  Few Deputies of this House are more than two generations removed from homes in rural Ireland where mothers and fathers, grandmothers and grandfathers were constrained to perform every task with great physical effort. I do not think they think it wrong to lighten that burden hereafter, or that <Col N="2017" /> the money required to do so would be improvidently spent.</P>
    <P>Is it wrong to build schools?  There are schools in this country that would bring the blush of shame to a primitive African tribe.  They are broken down horrors.  Now, we can do one of two things.  We can embark upon a 50-year programme and we can reckon that in a wrong school of that kind, 5 per cent. of the pupils will get tuberculosis or some other disease and die.  We can reckon that 50 years is two generations and that, therefore, twice 5 per cent. must die.  Or, we can say: &ldquo;If my child were one of the 5 per cent., it would not console me to know that 95 per cent. of the children had passed through that school unscathed. My concern would be that my child was dead and need not have died.&rdquo;  Is it effeminate on the part of this Government to say that they will not recoil from borrowing in order to ensure that those children shall not die?  I think not.  I know that there was a view strongly held and stoutly enforced that financial rectitude demanded in certain circumstances that you should not build new schools or replace old ones until you had the cash in hand and that if that meant a limited number of schools, well, you could not have omelettes if you did not break eggs.  I want to state quite clearly the view of this Government on that.  No appeal to financial rectitude will induce this Government to purchase a reputation untarnished in a financier's estimate by the expenditure of the life of a single child of any citizen in this State.  We intend here and now, so fast as resources and manpower will allow, to eliminate the school calculated to destroy the health of children learning in it; to obliterate the slum and to establish citizens of this country in tolerable homes; to build such sanatoria as may be required effectively to control tuberculosis in this country; to provide such hospital accommodation as will ensure that no poor person will want for the attention which may mean the difference between life and death.  Now, the alternative is this.  Let us face it. There are in this country an ascertainable number of persons at present suffering from tuberculosis.  We can <Col N="2018" /> make a reasonably probable statistical prophecy of the number of people who will die of tuberculosis over the next ten years, given that we do not add to the number of sanatoria at present available.  Now, we may make up our minds to let them die because we will not build more than may be charged upon the annual revenue without overburdening the taxpayer and exhausting his capacity to produce tax revenue.  There are a great many people in this world who accept that doctrine as the minimum of financial rectitude and economic prudence and, when pressed, they will say that it is better because, if you try to avert these deaths, the economic consequences may be so grave that infinitely greater dangers will supervene.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, undoubtedly, in many orthodox circles in this country. Take my friend, Deputy Hickey.  Sometimes his heart burns with righteous indignation against the hard-hearted capitalists and money changers.  I often wonder, when I hear Deputy Hickey getting so indignant over defects which, I agree with him, are well calculated to excite indignation, where does he discern those defects in Ireland.  If you were to call together the directors of all the banks in Ireland, I doubt if you would find a single man amongst them who would not agree with you and say: &ldquo;Of course, you must build and pay for it over 50 or 60 years as circumstances will allow.&rdquo;  But that is not true the world over.  It is a shocking and an appalling thing to visit a country where the people who work the land are living at a subsistence level which we in this country would consider too low for a store bullock&mdash;people who have no amenities and who are expected to accept death in their families as a normal risk of their daily lives.</P>

What appalled me was to see it on this side of the Iron Curtain. God help the people thus afflicted.  They are denied access to education, even to the amenities that an animal should have.  Ignorance, neglect and oppression may well deliver them into the hands of those who will some day exploit them to their own detriment and to the detriment of the world.  If that comes to pass, it will come to pass as a result of that outlook which I suggest scarcely exists at all.  The truth is there are not conservatives in Ireland.  I suppose if the truth were told some Deputies look upon me as a prop of conservative rectitude, but I am very conscious of the fact, because I have a very clear understanding of it, that if there is anything wrong with me it is that I am a dangerous radical.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Little is all a-tremble.  He regards me as a public danger and I sympathise with him, I am sure.  Hardness of heart, indifference to human suffering, valuing money and wealth at a higher value than human happiness&mdash;I think these things are very rare in most parts of Ireland, and we should be thankful for it.  There is a danger that besets this country, and it is not that we will do too little, but that we will try to do too much.  There is one controlling limit that we cannot change and if we lose sight of it we could wreck the whole ship.  Our policy should be that wherever there is a legitimate necessity pressing and men and material available to abolish it, we should go about the job there and then.  But if we ever lose sight of those unchangeable limitations and seek to do at the one time twice as much as available hands and material are there to effect, we can end up in a wretched, futile morass of half-completed jobs, none of which we will be able to bring to realisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no single task that lies before us that we do not certainly have <Col N="2020" /> the means to complete if we but use those means with prudence and resolution. But if we allow crack-pots, publicity hunters, and vote seekers to dissipate the maximum effort our people are capable of making, for a whole series of irrelevant reasons, the immense programme on which this country has now embarked can be completely shipwrecked.  But it will not be shipwrecked under this Government because if the pressure to wreck that programme becomes irresistible this Government will fall since the members of it will never yield to pressure of that kind.  The reason is that we believe in the policy in which we have asked the people of the country to join us.  We know where we are going.  We have no guilty conscience as to the size of our effort and, rather than see it wrecked under political pressures from one quarter or another, this Government will make way most cheerfully for those complaisant vote catchers who will be more concerned for place and profit than they will be for the ultimate objective of making this country the kind of country it ought to be if we, the Irish people, are to acknowledge it as our own.</P>
    <P>Forestry&mdash;I am often amused at the despairing hopes of some of the opponents of this Government: when all fruit fails, they hope to see cracks or fissures in the interests of forestry clash with those of agriculture.  But they will not see that clash so long as this Government is in office.  All the money that is necessary for the establishment of economic forest land in Ireland and its development is available and will be used to create that asset for our people, that tangible asset of timber and that invisible, but no less precious, asset of a forest background to an agricultural valley to avert the flood problems which would otherwise arise.  The truth is that, properly appreciated, the possibilities of the immediate future are dazzling for our people.  They are dazzling because our people want the right things.  They do not yearn for the kind of wealth that a great industrial civilisation dangles before its people as the prize.  What they want is happiness, peace and dignity in their homes.  I do not exaggerate when I <Col N="2021" /> say that there is no country in the world that can provide these in more abundance for its people than we can. To have a part in the making of that supreme design in our time is, I do not deny, an exciting and inspiring occupation. It would want to be because if there is one thing perfectly certain in the world it is that no Minister of an Irish Government will ever grow rich working for the Irish people.  No one but a fool would take a Minister's salary in this country for the work a Minister must do if he did not feel that he had a part in something which he would be proud to play were he to get no salary for it at all.</P>
    <P>All that depends on this pedestrian consideration: in the last analysis you cannot take a gallon from a pint pot; in the last analysis, Deputy Hickey notwithstanding, you cannot spin wealth from the ether overhead. Wealth is the product of labour and the two things can never be dissociated. Silly men waste their labour on unnecessary physical effort or on unremunerative raw material.  Thus, a great part of what that effort should produce is lost.  Wise men rehabilitate their land, fertilise it, bring within the reach of those who work it all that science and ingenuity can provide so as to increase the effectiveness of the effort that they are about to undertake. But ultimately, be they wise or foolish, their ultimate destiny depends upon whether they pay what they owe, upon whether they understand that wealth is the product of labour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Pay as they go.  That is the secret.  If we borrow £20,000,000 this year, or even £40,000,000, and effectively appropriate from the national income every year the necessary sum to amortise that debt over a reasonable period&mdash;say 30 years&mdash;the financial rock upon which this country stands is as unshakable as the Rock of Gibraltar.  But if in any unhappy day our people having activated the power-house of credit to their service, believe that it can long be made to function, and if they fail to pay their annual tribute, the lubricant of honesty, the whole machine will shatter, <Col N="2022" /> not only itself but the nation which it serves.</P>
      <P>This Government will spend upon the tasks that await our doing whatever sums are necessary to bring unemployed hands and idle materials together to satisfy the legitimate requirements of our people.  Whatever these sums may be, confident in the increased capacity of our people to earn and produce, we yield the annual tithe requisite honestly to pay the debt.  I admit it calls for faith, not only in our people's capacity, but in our people's honesty as well.</P>

      <P>But who never was very apprehensive that those from whom he was separated <i>pro tem</i> would see him alone for very long.  I agree with Deputy Hickey that that is the truth. I remember when the late Deputy O'Donnell was in this House, we used to think he was daft because no matter what subject came up for discussion <Col N="2023" /> Deputy O'Donnell introduced the necessity of providing water for rural houses.  I thought like others that he was daft, but at a later period, I had the courage to go down to his home town of Clonmel and to admit that I had come to realise how profoundly wise he was and how that wisdom was born of an intimate knowledge of the conditions of rural life. It was no small satisfaction to me at a later stage to be the humble means of putting into operation some of the amenities which he had advocated in this House.</P>
      <P>I think, if the truth is told, Deputy Hickey is right, that the payment of rent for money is fundamentally wrong. I think Christianity is greatly the loser that the rigidity of that doctrine was not maintained down to our day but I think it is foolish, in the cause of abstract principles, to recoil from the opportunity of abating urgent evils and to engage in high philosophical discourses while children die and people starve when, with the instruments we have got, we have the means to come to their assistance now.  Perhaps we could go more expeditiously and with less effort if ideal conditions obtained. They do not; we do not live in an ideal world.  We live in an imperfect world. Why wait to do the things that want doing until we have made the world we live in perfect, for if we do, those whom we could help now, will have long sunk under the burden of their woes before we come to help them? Inexpertly, inadequately perhaps, but as best we may, this Government is going to the task of raising the standard of living of our people with all the resources we command and we go to it telling the people that, in the situation in which we to-day stand, an essential concomitant of using public credit is a readiness annually to finance from tax revenue an appropriate annual sum to redeem whatever borrowing is done over an agreed term of years, which I think should rarely exceed 30.  On that basis nothing can stop us.  If we abandon that basis we imperil our whole design.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This last word.  The revenue of this <Col N="2024" /> State is, and will continue to be, out of our expanding production amply abundant to finance a comprehensive policy of this kind, always provided that we have the moral courage to eliminate the remnants of slush that were bequeathed to us by Fianna Fáil. The practice grew up in the last 16 years that wherever you had a troublesome bunch, who could put on the heat, the best way to quieten them was to give them jobs: &ldquo;If you cannot &lsquo;bate&rsquo; them, buy them.&rdquo;  There was established a regular organisation under which, if things got too hot in any particular district, you would build a bog road or you would dig a drain though you were quite well aware that it would sink within 12 months.  If you happened to express that fear you would be told: &ldquo;Oh, you poor gom, what do you care what happens in 12 months.  All we want to do is to employ men now and the least work they do and the better they are paid, the better it will be for our Party.&rdquo;  That outlook has created in our countryside a loathsome tradition in recent years.  I have seen men doing relief works most carefully measure the depth of mud in the bottom of the drain and precisely bisect it so that they would be sure to leave enough mud in the bottom to ensure that there would be another relief grant to do the same work within 12 months.  If they had devoted one half their skill they displayed in that bisection, to the performance of their work, they would probably have earned more eventually but there was that loathsome doctrine, something cute, something clever, to get something for nothing, that Fianna Fáil introduced into rural Ireland.  If that loathsome philosophy remains a charge on the resources of our people, it can well come to pass that our resources will not be adequate to meet the financing of the credit we employ in honourable work but if every man who takes a job takes it on the understanding that if he gets a fair day's pay he will do a fair day's work, and if every man knows he is not employed as a relief worker or a dole man, that he is not regarded as a burden on his neighbours but that the community to which he belongs rejoice that his hands are there to help in the work that is waiting to be done, then <Col N="2025" /> the day will be forever gone when there was permanently in our community a body of men who were a perennial nightmare to their neighbours.  Why do we ever speak of unemployed men as the problem of our society?  Do they not constitute the opportunity of our time?  If instead of ever thinking of them as a problem we glory in their presence as an opportunity, what can we not do if we have the men to do the work?  What could we do if the men were gone and the scope of our exertions was further handicapped, narrowed and straitened by the want of men?</P>
    <P>There is work here for every man in Ireland and for many that return from abroad, wherever they went during the last ten or 15 years&mdash;every one of them &mdash;if the programme outlined by this Government is to be completed in the next ten years.  If everyone will do an honest day's work for an honest day's pay, if everyone will recognise that they are not working, in the last analysis, for somebody else but for themselves, that all the money this Government disposes of belongs to the ordinary average citizen of this State, that this Government has no money of its own to give anybody but that it has the authority of Oireachtas Éireann to appropriate the people's money to certain work that requires to be done, that willingness honestly to work for honest pay, to a good end, should make it possible for this community to employ every employable man in town and country.  Let us not go on calling up out of the vasty deep ghosts of multitudes of unemployed.  Instead of talking vaguely about the unemployed, it should be the duty of every Deputy on this side of the House, if he comes on people who are unemployed, to busy himself in the task of finding out why they are unemployed.</P>

      <P>We want to know if it is because, with all the social services that are available, they do not fit in, because we want to provide somebody who will be the almoner for our less fortunate neighbours and whose instructions will be: &ldquo;Find out if they cannot be made employed and independent.  If that is not practicable, find out why the existing social services are not making such provision as would relieve them of destitute poverty and, if they do not fit into either plan, take power from us to be the curator of hard cases.&rdquo;  It is a sound legal maxim that hard cases make bad law.

Instead of feeling that the best means of meeting the unspeakable misery that it is to a man who wants to work and cannot find work to do is to lament and deplore the fact that something effective is not done, we should try to see if we cannot devise a scheme whereby those who are mobile &mdash;take an unmarried fellow with no family responsibilities&mdash;might not be induced to work some distance from his home where labour is scarce and difficult to get, so as to make room for a man who is married and has family responsibilities in the job near home. Remember, we cannot have freedom and the right to command men where they earn their living at the same time. The Deputy will remember that in Great Britain they had direction of labour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to submit to the Deputy, at great risk to my own political future, that there is a middle course.  I do not believe in directing labour, because I love freedom for great and humble, rich and poor, but there comes a time when you are entitled to say to a man, great or humble, rich or poor, who sits down on his own doorstep and says: &ldquo;When I say I want a job, what I mean is, I want a job within 250 yards of my own home,&rdquo; that he is looking for the impossible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Mind you, there are some people who want that.  Where <Col N="2028" /> you have got a man who is sincerely looking for work and who is prepared to take some trouble to get it what you have got to do is to try to bring the man and the job together.  I think the jobs are there.  I know that in the City of Galway it is becoming necessary to bring the fellows in from the country in lorries because there are not sufficient hands to undertake the work that is progressing in that city. What is on my mind is that we shall not have the moral courage and resolution to complete the job at present in progress, that is, the marshalling of the capital projects we are resolved to complete.  That danger is with us. If there are perhaps three big projects in one area, each urgently wanted, each with its own group desperately anxious to see it under way, all pressing strongly that the matter should forthwith be put in hands, the danger is that we, yielding to that pressure, will concede what we know to be impossible, the completion of the three tasks in one district at the one time, thus creating an acute famine of labour in one centre while work in another centre where there is relative unemployment is, inevitably, postponed.  In fact the work should be undertaken in that area and two works in the first area while the third work in the first area is postponed. The Deputy may rest assured that at this present moment and for some weeks past the map of this country is under careful and constant review with the object of ensuring that in no given place will men and materials run out where there is money and a need to be filled, but that the need, the money, the men and the materials will effectively be brought together there and wherever else it is wanted and that no clash from lack of planning or prudent foresight will result in that most exasperating famine of labour, a famine in one place and irremediable unemployment in the other.  Personally, I believe that over the next short period the drawing on the available hands will provide virtually full employment to the bulk of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That does not dispose, in my judgment, with the remaining problem with which the Deputy and I are familiar in Meath Street, Cumberland <Col N="2029" /> Street and Dominick Street, that is, the destitute poor.  There should not be any destitute poor in this community. At present it appears that our means of reaching them is not succeeding in its purpose.  I would like to see in every district of this city a trained almoner whose duty I would describe: &ldquo;First see if you can put that family on its feet; secondly, if illness or some other consideration makes that out of the question invoke the social services. If you discover, as I believe is the case, that you are dealing with one of the hard cases for whom no provision is made in bad laws and for whom therefore no petition can be made, know yourself to have an overriding function as the curator of hard cases and do for that unprovided case what it is necessary to do.  Then come back and get permanent sanction for the <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement you were constrained to make.&rdquo; In am never easy in my mind at this moment so long as we continue in the knowledge that there may be individuals in our community destitute and poor for whom no provision in existing circumstances under the law can be made.  I do not believe that anybody wants that but I do not believe that anybody except an almoner armed with the wide discretion I suggest could grapple with it with any results.  I believe that a person charged with that definite task among her neighbours in a given area, over and above the relief of that type of distressing case, would also be counsellor, friend and helper to a lot of people to whom it would be a great advantage to have such assistance from time to time.</P>
    <P>I never believed this country to be safer and to have brighter prospects than it has to-day.  Let the Deputies who work themselves into a frenzy over the alleged invasion of this country by foreigners desiring to buy land and invest their wealth in it pause from the fury of their indignation to ask themselves this question: what rich man ever stored his money in a sinking ship?</P>

      <P>I beg the Deputy to concentrate his attention on this significance of these events: some of our conservative financial friends on the far side of the House have cried havoc and declared that this Government treads the path of reckless extravagance that leads to inevitable bankruptcy.  I am directing the attention of the House to the fact that despite the apprehensions of the economists of Fianna Fáil, the eminently practical owners of tangible money bags, having scanned the world horizon not infrequently, arrive with their money bags in this country which the Fianna Fáil economists declare is hell bent for bankruptcy and woe.  The money boys are not bad judges as to whether their bankers are headed for bankruptcy and woe or for prosperity and the safety begotten of sound foundations. I would invite some of my colleagues to temper their growing rage at this largely imagined invasion by the consoling thought that this must be a wonderful country, safe, prosperous and happy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Even conservative.  That draws the money barons to its shore. Mind you, for a country that has 20,000,000 of its people the owners of much property in America and 20,000,000 more the owners of a good part of the surface of the earth outside Ireland, it is queer to-day when we are stricken with terror at the prospect of <Col N="2031" /> an invasion by a few middle-aged financiers.</P>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, anyone who lives in this country within the four corners of the criminal law lives in a free country and will get the full protection of the law, that and no more.  I am much more concerned with some of the native tribes, who would build themselves up again in our time into landlords with attendant serfs, than I am with the terrible invader who threatens us with a bag of money and frightens us with the jingle of coin. Men that set land for money are noisome to me, whether their name is McSweeney or Jones.  It is as old as history that the guilty people in one's own household are often too anxious to divert attention from their own activities on to a foreign scapegoat, hoping that in the unreasoning hatred of the stranger the iniquity of the domestic circle will be overlooked.  The landlords are landlords to me, whencever they may come.  The Land League was born on a parish priest's estate, albeit that it ended on Clanricarde.  From whatever croft they were, whencever they may come, landlords are landlords to me and I will not be diverted from that fundamental concept by being warned of the imminence of our people's ruin by the arrival of any Persians from Persia or Greeks from Greece.  There is only one danger our people have to fear and that is the re-emergence of the landlord; and, with God's help, however often they may emerge, we will find a means to put them down again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For me, people who see in Ireland the safest, the happiest and the best country in the world are a good sign. They say that all good land can be recognised by the number of thistles that grow upon it.  Sometimes it is necessary to cut to thin the thistles out of it, but it would be a foolish man who would pray that the day would ever dawn when his land would not grow thistles any more.  God grant that this country will always be so run that those who look around the horizons of the world, free to choose any country in the world for their permanent abode, will choose Ireland, knowing it to be the happiest and best <Col N="2032" /> country so long as its people are given a chance by having even a tolerable Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister for Agriculture, on behalf of Clann na Poblachta, the two Labour Parties and Clann na Talmhan, that they are perfectly satisfied and that he need not go to the trouble of lecturing them here for a couple of hours and appealing for their continued support.  They are going to give it, even if the Minister turns all the land of this country into a thistle ranch.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture attempted here earlier in his speech to get the people to believe that there was something virtuous in borrowing, but towards the end of his speech he reminded the Deputies, Clann na Poblachta and the other Parties of something that the Minister for Finance said in his Budget speech.  We have heard great programmes put before the people, of all that is to be built and of all the evil that is to be done away with out of borrowed money.  It can be done on borrowed money, but you will take political responsibility for taxing for it.  The Minister for Finance, supported here by the Minister for Agriculture this afternoon, indicated to a number of his own colleagues that this programme may not be carried out, that however desirable it is that no child should get tuberculosis from attending a bad school, however desirable it may be that hospitals should be built for the cure of tuberculosis, if it cannot be done on borrowed money it will not be done.  The Minister for Finance, concluding his Budget speech, on page 65, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The large programme of State investment which is being undertaken to develop the national economy must not be allowed to over-tax our resources or trench upon the capital needs of private enterprise.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The large programme of State investment which is being dangled before every section of our community is to be carried out this year by borrowed money and if it cannot be done on borrowed money, as the Minister for <Col N="2033" /> Finance, supported by the Minister for Agriculture, said, it is not going to be done.  The question is how long, how far we should go with this borrowing in an inflationary situation.  That we can borrow money to the extent of £40,000,000 or £50,000,000 this year no one denies.  It is as easy as rolling off a log.  The Minister has £50,000,000 in the State funds of one kind or another&mdash;the Post Office Savings Bank or various other funds.  He has £21,000,000 in the Counterpart Fund of the Marshall Aid.  We can borrow somewhere between £50,000,000 and £60,000,000 this year, if we like, but what is going to happen next year, if we do, and in the year after that? What is going to happen if we borrow this £40,000,000 and pump it into a situation which the Minister says is inflationary?  We can borrow £40,000,000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture should have addressed that question to the Minister for Finance.  He should have asked him whether a situation is not dangerously inflationary in which we depend for the balance of our payments to the tune of £69,000,000 on invisible trade and whether it is not dangerously inflationary when we fail to balance our international payments, visible and invisible, to the tune of at least £10,000,000, plus, I take it, the £18,000,000 or so from Marshall Aid funds.  We can continue to unbalance our international payments to the tune of £69,000,000 a year for slightly over three years.  It has been estimated by the best economist I know in the country, an economist who has published books and papers on the matter, that our net balance of investments abroad is somewhere around a couple of hundred million pounds.  We have a gross investment abroad of £450,000,000 or so, but the net amount is about £225,000,000, so that if we get really desperately anxious about our creditor <Col N="2034" /> situation and want to get out of that undesirable condition, we have merely to continue to unbalance our payments to the extent of £60,000,000 or £70,000,000 a year for three years and we will be in that grand position which a number of Deputies want to reach of being a debtor nation&mdash;somebody touching his neighbours for the means to carry on.</P>

If Deputy Davin and his friends want to get rid of our creditor position, they can do it within three years by having a visible adverse balance of trade corresponding to what we had in 1949 without some invisible items to balance it.  In order to get rid of it, we can get the Minister for External Affairs to pursue that campaign of his of taxing the tourists, of cutting out the tourists&mdash;the &ldquo;spivs&rdquo; as Clann na Poblachta used to call them.  Get rid of the &ldquo;spivs&rdquo; and get rid of the interest on our external assets and the job is done.  We will be a nice comfortable debtor nation in a few years' time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to tell the Minister for Agriculture that he can keep the old bowler hat he has at the back of the wardrobe.  I suppose he has relegated it to that safe and secure position since he became an optimist. What we in Fianna Fáil want to do is to look the facts of the economic and financial situation straight in the face and act accordingly.  There is no one here need think that the idea of borrowing money rather than taxing to get money to spend is something new. It has been there from the beginning of time.  Many Governments have ruined their peoples through that system and have brought about serious revolutionary changes.  One of the causes of the troubles the French people have been stuck in for the past few years is that, unfortunately for themselves, they had Governments&mdash;I am not blaming these Governments; <Col N="2035" /> they could not get the necessary strength&mdash;who had to resort to this business of borrowing from the Central Bank of France rather than ask the French people to pay the taxes necessary to meet the ordinary current costs of government.</P>
      <P>If the Minister wishes to look up the figures, he will find that they borrowed, in 1946, some billions of francs.  A billion of francs is not so very much, but the result was that, at the end of 1946, the cost of living was exactly double what it was at the beginning. Here that will not happen because we are not a closed economy and the inflationary consequences of borrowing from people who normally save, even if we did it that way, and giving it out to those who are going to spend immediately, would not, perhaps, be all reflected in an increase in the cost of living, an increase in the price costs of various commodities, but would certainly be represented by either an increased price cost or an inflow of foreign goods, or both.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got very much meas on that Minister's financial knowledge, but I will state the proposition as the Minister for Finance sees it, as he stated it in his Budget speech, for those who know something about the matter to judge.  The Minister said <Col N="2036" /> that there has been a slight increase in the lost of living&mdash;not very much&mdash; but that there has been, at the same time, a deficit in our balance of payments to the tune of £10,000,000, plus another figure which I think he did not take into consideration, a sum of about £18,000,000, representing the net increase in our foreign debt to the United States.  We had that disbalance last year when our borrowings were very small, in a year in which the Minister for Finance stated he was going to have such retrenchment that he was going to meet all the expenses of government out of the huge rates of taxation which Fianna Fáil imposed.</P>
      <P>I stated that we can get rid of our nice comfortable or uncomfortable creditor position within two or three years if we wish.  We can achieve another very nice state of affairs if we continue to pile up the cost on our taxpayers for the payment of interest and sinking fund at the rate we have been doing for the last two years and propose to do this year.  The Minister in his Budget speech gave figures which showed that in three years we will have doubled the amount paid out of the Central Fund for interest and sinking fund.  Continuing at that rate of geometrical progression, I calculate that we will only have seven or eight years to go before we reach the stage in which we will have to get in some way or other for interest and sinking fund payments a total equal to the amount of the last Fianna Fáil Budget. We can do that.  We can start on the road and we can keep on that road for one and a half years with the funds at the disposal of the Minister for Finance.  He does not have to ask for one shilling, but he will have to ask somebody to repay it.  The Minister for Finance has already shown what he is prepared to do with the funds at his disposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has already shown what he is prepared to do with any loose assets left behind by Fianna Fáil.  He swept from the Post Office Savings Bank Reserve Fund a sum of £466,000 in order to balance his Budget.  Fianna Fáil was responsible <Col N="2037" /> for the Government of this country for 16 long years.  During those 16 long years we had many years in which we would have been glad to get £466,000 without having to ask the taxpayers for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not take this £466,000 from the Post Office Savings Bank Fund although we had power to do it.  Power to do it was taken by the last Cumann na nGaedheal Minister for Finance and was operated by him. Although we had an economic war and a war in Europe, we never felt ourselves so badly pressed as to sweep that money out of the Post Office Savings Bank Fund.  That money was swept out of the Post Office Savings Bank Fund behind the backs of this Dáil and of the people.  When it was finally announced, the <i>Irish Independent</i> accused me of having done it. When it was pointed out to them that it was the present Minister for Finance, they were not quite so offended about this particular financial operation. As I pointed out, if we increased the payments for interest and sinking fund at the rate at which the Minister proposes to operate, and has operated for the last couple of years, we can reach the point in five or six years when our borrowings are going to cost us as much, if we keep on doubling the amount every three years, as the last Fianna Fáil Budget.  Then we can see what we can tax to provide for all the other things that we want done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance's particular outlook, which was supported by the Minister for Agriculture, that we could not do any of these things like building hospitals or houses unless we can borrow money is not very much out of keeping with the attitude of Fine Gael in the past.  The technique has changed somewhat, but the idea is still the same.  In 1931, the present Minister for Education, Deputy Mulcahy, who was then Minister for Local Government, when we were urging him to build houses, said they could not build houses until the cost of materials fell, until wages fell to such a point that a house could be built <Col N="2038" /> without the subsidy and let at an economic rent.  Two Ministers have indicated that however desirable house building, land rehabilitation and hospitals may be, they are not going to meet the cost of these out of taxation. They are not going to have any political unpopularity accrue to them on foot of building houses or hospitals or carrying on land rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture boasted in his usual way about everything that is going to be done for land rehabilitation, how desirable it was, and how he was going to do it.  By the way, he said that not a drain had been dug under the Fianna Fáil Government. We had been prepared to dig £500,000 worth of drains under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture in 1948-49, but the present Minister for Agriculture would not spend the money on the land reclamation scheme.  We had provided under the land reclamation scheme and the farm improvements scheme a sum of £500,000.  We were prepared to ask the people to tax themselves for that because we said it was good work.  After we left office, Marshall Aid became available.  It was not available the first year and they would not put on a 6d. of tax for that.  However desirable it was to do all these things in connection with the land which the Minister for Agriculture fulminated about this evening, they were not prepared to put ½d. tax on anybody for fear it would have bad electoral results.  They waited until they got Marshall Aid money.</P>
    <P>Even with all this Marshall Aid money, we find according to an answer to a question, that last year the farmers got only between £3,000 and £4,000 out of an expenditure of over £300,000&mdash;the American machinery manufacturers got the most of it.  If the Minister for Agriculture and those who put him into that job had really been desirous for the improvement of the land rather than some vote-catching stunts, they would have continued with that land reclamation scheme during their first year of office.</P>

Do Deputies not remember that statement by the Minister for Agriculture? According to the financial accounts published by the Minister for Finance &mdash;of course, he may not have told the Minister for Lands about this&mdash;about £400,000 was spent on it in the last year of Fianna Fáil.  But the people got no opportunity of availing of it under the Coalition Government until they got cheap money&mdash;until they could put it on the long finger and let somebody else find the money to pay.

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to remind the Minister for Agriculture who has escaped, that he was strongly against the spending of borrowed money or, indeed, the spending of money by the Government, borrowed or otherwise. When Fianna Fáil were spending at the rate of £69,000,000 a year Deputy Dillon, as he was then, came into the Dáil and he almost exploded because of the cost of Government.  He made the calculation that we were spending at the rate of £23 per head of the population and that that was £140 per family.  He asked me across the House &mdash;I was then Minister for Finance and responsible for that awful expenditure which was about half what it is at present&mdash;&ldquo;Do you remember the time you were going around from houseen to houseen in Louth and South Monaghan and how do you think they can afford this expenditure of £140 per <Col N="2040" /> family?&rdquo;  If it was that sum then, it is now well over £200 per family and the Minister for Lands, Deputy Davin, or other Deputies can answer the Minister for Agriculture his question. Do they think the people of this country can afford this expenditure of well over £200 per family?  I believed that the people in the country could afford to pay the £140 because of the way it was raised and the way in which it was spent&mdash;and, in State finance, that is the whole secret of success or disaster.  Our people, if they are prepared to face up to it, can divert a great deal of their energy to capital development and other work but if they are not prepared to divert their energy in that direction it cannot be done without the expenditure of a lot of our existing assets of one kind or another.  A farmer can, of course, improve his own house and spend the whole year at it by letting his land go to wreck and ruin.  The wise farmer is prepared to cultivate his land and at the same time to do some sort of current repairs, in order to enable him to keep the land going to give him the crops and yearly income in order that he can afford to improve his house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government can, by wise finance, organise the energies of the people in such a way that we can have any given reasonable standard of life and that the rest of their energies will be given to capital development.  But we cannot spend all our energy on capital development or we will not have any income, any more than the farmer.  We in Fianna Fáil were quite prepared to ask the people to tax themselves, that is, to divert a certain portion of their energy for the purpose for which the State Exchequer lends the money.  I indicated that if there was a deflationary situation we were prepared, as a Government, by any of the means I outlined, to make provision for an increase in the supply of the money but that if there was a surplus of money in relation to goods we would meet that situation by taking off that surplus. While that is scientifically correct, it is not sometimes politically popular.  The gentlemen opposite, who received the reins of Government a couple of years ago&mdash;having no past to be proud of and very little future to look forward <Col N="2041" /> to&mdash;are quite prepared to run the affairs of this State for their comfort in the immediate present.  They can carry on at this game for another couple of years.  They can saddle, even in an inflationary situation, the future taxpayers of this country with a very gravely increased burden for interest and sinking fund.  If they could continue borrowing for seven years instead of three years, at the end of that time we would have to pay £50,000,000 or £60,000,000 by way of interest and sinking fund and if they could spend our internal assets at the rate of £69,000,000 a year we would very quickly get rid of the external assets that weigh so heavily on some of the Deputies.</P>
    <P>Seeing that Deputy Davin is here representing the Labour Party, I want to remind him that this Budget of the Minister for Finance contains no provision for excess corporation profits tax.  Does that ring any bell in his memory?  Did he ever hear of excess corporation profits tax?</P>

      <P>I was deafened by protests when, Minister for Finance, we decided to abolish it here when the Labour Government in England abolished it.  If there was one argument responsible for the Fianna Fáil minority in the 1948 election more than another&mdash;apart, say, from the allegations of corruption, which were not substantiated&mdash;it was this cry of the Labour Party that Fianna Fáil abolished the excess corporation profits tax because they wanted to give £3,500,000 to the &ldquo;industrial racketeers&rdquo;, as they were called.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil, we were told, could do nothing for the old age pensioners and could not do a lot of other things, but one of the things they were quite prepared to do was to give £3,500,000 of excess corporation profits tax back to the &ldquo;racketeers&rdquo;.  The Tánaiste, during this election&mdash;and I take this quotation from the <i>Independent</i> of 24th January&mdash;promised certain things down in Limerick.  He repeated <Col N="2042" /> in Limerick the promises he made on 100 platforms during the election.  He said that &ldquo;by returning a strong Labour Party the people would have a guarantee that excess profits would be taxed to provide money to subsidise prices and thus reduce the cost of commodities&rdquo;. The people, he said, would have a guarantee.  Three Budgets have come and gone and that guarantee has not been fulfilled.  The excess corporation profits were not put back, in spite of the Labour Party's promise that they would put them back.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party has not lived up to the promises it made, particularly the promise that by returning a strong Labour Party&mdash;not as a Government, but as a strong Labour Party&mdash;the people would have a guarantee&mdash;not a probability, but a guarantee&mdash;that excess profits would be taxed to provide money to subsidise prices and thus reduce the cost of commodities.</P>
      <P>I listened very attentively to Deputy Martin O'Sullivan the other night. Deputy O'Sullivan pointed out that there are a lot of these excess profits knocking around.  He complained to the Minister for Finance on the 4th May&mdash;Volume 120, column 1870:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If profits were excessive in 1948, there is no doubt that they are higher now.  I have had a statement prepared with regard to a number of firms taken at random in what might be described as the industrial group. These were firms concerned with drapery and clothing, textiles, tanning, boots and shoes, confectionery, milling, bakery trade, building materials providers and miscellaneous, totalling 69.  The result shows that according to the last returns available for these companies, <Col N="2043" /> namely, returns for last year, as against the preceding year, there was an over-all percentage increase of 2.3 per cent. after provision had been made for depreciation, taxation and so on.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So the Labour Party, in order to remain as part of the Government, are prepared, not to give back the £3,500,000 that they said Fianna Fáil gave, but profits at the rate of 2.3 per cent. higher.</P>
    <P>The other afternoon, on the Budget debate, the Minister for Finance could not remember whether the members of the Government had voted against the stamp duties tax when it was introduced by myself as Minister for Finance in 1947.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy McGilligan, in column 1671, said: &ldquo;I do not remember,&rdquo; and I said: &ldquo;We will refresh the Minister's memory on that later.&rdquo;  I introduced the Finance Bill of 1947 and into it I put a provision which I thought was advisable to stop the inflationary situation and to attempt to put our buyers here in a favourable position <i>vis-a-vis</i> any foreigners who might come in to buy up property here.  What did the present Taoiseach think of it?  The Minister for Finance cannot remember.  He can refresh his mind by looking up Volume 108, column 1065.  He will find there that the present Taoiseach said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I believe that this additional taxation will merely result in making house property dearer and the provision of houses for people who have only limited means impossible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister is it because he wants to make house property dearer and housing for persons with limited means impossible that he is washing the bibs of the baby that was born in my time?  He is taking great care of that particular baby. Does he want to make houses dearer?</P>
    <P>Lest the Minister for Finance might think that was only the present Taoiseach's idea about the tax, I would ask him to have a look at column 1072 of the same volume.  He will find there that he himself said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...it means that there will be <Col N="2044" /> a rise in the already swollen prices being paid for houses.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is it to bring about a further rise in the swollen prices for houses that the Minister has introduced these amendments to stop any gaps in this particular tax?  Deputy Morrissey, the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, in column 1067 of the same volume, after fulminating over several columns of the Parliamentary Debates, finally exploded:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I can see no case, good, bad or indifferent, that can possibly be made for this increase.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He refers there to the tax.  There you have three Ministers of the present Government who opposed that particular duty tooth and nail.  Not only did they oppose it in the House, but they went around the country threatening the people as to what was going to happen under Fianna Fáil's new stamp duty, and by implication, if they did not do it otherwise, they actually promised they would do away with it.  Instead of doing away with it they are tightening it up.  Another Minister of the present Government opposed that particular stamp duty.  The present Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, at columns 1171 to 1174 of the same volume from which I have already quoted, called it a &ldquo;landlord's tithe&rdquo;; he called it a &ldquo;dirty fraud,&rdquo; a &ldquo;dirty deceitful game,&rdquo; a &ldquo;piece of flatfooted incompetence,&rdquo; a &ldquo;shuffling and cloutish way of dealing with the problem,&rdquo; a &ldquo;dirty wrangle,&rdquo; a &ldquo;vicious and mean jab at those who were defenceless.&rdquo;  That is the sort of legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He is quite prepared to support for another year a &ldquo;dirty fraud&rdquo;, a &ldquo;dirty deceitful game&rdquo;, a &ldquo;landlords' tithe&rdquo;. The Minister for Agriculture wound up his speech on that occasion by saying of this stamp duty, which Deputy Davin and Deputy Dunne, the Minister for Justice and all the rest of them are now supporting: &ldquo;It is a dirty, contemptible, vicious and disedifying proposal, well worthy of the mind of the Minister for Finance who has conceived it, and, to my way of thinking, a disgrace to the House that adopts it: a confession before the world that there can survive here a meanness of spirit that was unknown in this country in the darkest days through which our people had to live.&rdquo;  That is the type of stuff with which the present Ministers deceived a great number of the people.  It is like the corruption they were to prove and dropped like a hot brick in the last three years.  The only miserable little attempt to continue that campaign was made by the Minister for Justice himself, but he had to drop it here in face of public opinion. Corruption and this dirty deceitful game have put the present Government where they are.  It is a heavy price to pay and a dishonourable price; not only are they dishonourable but they are disgustingly brazen about the whole matter.  They laugh now at the people. They spit in the teeth of the people who were deceived by this type of campaign. Deputy Davin laughs and spits in the teeth of the ordinary people who voted for him on the promise that the Labour Party, if they were returned as a strong Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee has given notice to raise the subject matter of Question No. 25 on the Order Paper of to-day and, associated with that question, he desires to raise the subject matter of Question No. 32 on the Order Paper of the 2nd May.</P>

      <P>On the 2nd May, I asked the Minister for Justice &ldquo;whether a prisoner who was sentenced to three years' penal servitude for participation in the theft of a considerable sum of money from the mails at Amiens Street Post Office was released by him recently from Portlaoise Convict Prison after serving only ten months of his sentence; and, if so, whether he will state the grounds of his release.&rdquo;  It was no pleasure to me to put down that question.  I put it down because, on the information that had been given to me, I felt it was my public duty to do so.  The question as it appeared on the Order Paper was not the question as I had drafted it because, in the question as I drafted it, I mentioned the name of the Minister concerned and the statement that had been made to me as to the use which had been made of a car which had been allotted to that Minister.  My purpose in putting down <Col N="2049" /> the question was to elicit from the Minister for Justice what, I hoped, would be a denial of the allegations which had been made regarding the Tánaiste.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, the Ceann Comhairle ruled that part of the question out of order.  If the Deputy is going to pursue that, I think the Chair will have to take notice of what he is doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to allow a matter which was ruled out of order in connection with the question on 2nd May to be introduced in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I had hoped that that would have elicited a denial from the Minister for Justice.  If it did not it was my duty to call attention to the fact that a member of the Government was either lacking in a sense of responsibility of his public duty or had been guilty of an indiscretion. Let me read what appears in the Official Report.  The Minister's reply was as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The answer is yes.  A petition was made to me to exercise the prerogative of mercy and after full consideration of the case I remitted the balance of the sentence.  The prisoner was a first offender, 21 years of age, was married and had one child.  I am glad to say that, as a result of the exercise of clemency, he is now in good employment and his employers, I am informed, think highly of him.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Be that as it may, I have no quarrel with the Minister for Justice if, having listened to representations from anyone, whether he was a colleague in the Cabinet or not, he felt that justice might be tempered with mercy, and that it would be in the public interest to release the prisoner.  That was a matter for the Minister's own discretion. May I say, before I come to read further from the Official Report a supplementary question which I put to the Minister for Justice, that the Ceann Comhairle was in the Chair. Deputy Cowan, after the Minister had replied to my question, interjected:&mdash;<Col N="2050" />&ldquo;The quality of mercy is not strained.&rdquo; I replied to that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is more than that in it. Mercy cannot be used as a cloak for other things.  Would the Minister state if it is a fact that after his release the individual in question was conveyed from Maryborough to his destination in a car allocated by the Minister for Justice to the Tánaiste for the conveyance of the latter and members of his family?  Was this done with the consent and knowledge of the Minister for Justice?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the Minister for Justice found it possible to reply to that supplementary question in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The reply to that question is &lsquo;no.&rsquo;  The prisoner was conveyed in a police car, not a car attached to any Minister.  The Deputy has some information which he should check over before he uses it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The only information I had was, as I have said at the beginning, that this man was released as a result of representations made by the Tánaiste and was conveyed from the prison to his destination in the Tánaiste's car.  I understand from the Minister for Justice, at any rate so far as the latter allegation is concerned, it is not correct and I unreservedly accept his statement because I thought it rather extraordinary that a State car&mdash;even though the Minister referred to it as a police car, it is a State car&mdash;should be placed at the disposal of a released prisoner.  I asked then:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Is it customary for prisoners to be conveyed from Maryborough prison to their destination in a State car?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;So I believe.  I have done so myself in my time including some friends of the Deputy's.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that that remark referred to what happened when I was General Officer commanding the Western Command, in which capacity I did use a State car to convey prisoners to their homes.  If I misled the Deputy in any way in regard <Col N="2051" /> to that matter, I also withdraw that part of that particular statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That eases my mind considerably because I am sorry to say that the Minister did mislead me seriously. I must say I got a surprise when I got the Minister's reply and in consequence I put down the question which appears on the Order Paper to-day:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Justice if he will state the number of persons who were released from Portlaoise Prison in each of the years 1947, 1948 and 1949 and, in respect of each year, the number of such persons for whom transport to their destination was provided by means of a police car.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister was good enough to give me the information.  It appears on the records of the House and I am content to let it stay there.  I then went on to ask the Minister another question relating to this matter.  It is that question the subject matter of which I gave notice that I intended to raise in this debate.  It is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Justice if he will state, with regard to the person to whom Question No. 32 on the Order Paper for the 2nd instant related, the registered number of the police car in which he was conveyed from Portlaoise Prison; the name of the driver of the car in question; the depot or barracks to which it was attached on the relevant dates; the officer or member of the Garda Síochána who directed that the car should be despatched to the prison for the conveyance of the person in question, and the authority on which such officer or member acted.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was good enough to tell me that the person was conveyed in Car No. Z.D. 6966 attached to the Garda Divisional Headquarters at Portlaoise.  He told me that the conveyance was arranged under his authority but I regret to say that he did not inform me who was the particular officer or member of the Garda Síochána who directed that the car should be despatched to the prison for <Col N="2052" /> the conveyance of the prisoner to his destination.  I think that was a very serious thing.  I do not think that the moneys voted by this House are intended to be used for the purposes for which this car was used.  That is a serious matter, but there is even a more serious aspect and it is one which really moved me to put down the question and raise the matter on the Adjournment.  The State should not only be just but it should be merciful. When a person is convicted of a serious offence and is released, no matter on whose representations he is released, I think a certain amount of discretion and restraint should be used in dealing with him.  It would be a very regrettable thing from the point of view of the administration of justice in this country and the observance of the law, if a person convicted of a serious offence, on his release, is to be treated as this prisoner was treated.  I do not know the man.  I have no acquaintance with him.  But I do know this, that it has been the subject of very unfavourable comment in the town of Portlaoise and in that particular area.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister is bighearted. I know that he is a kindly man in his dealings with ordinary people.  I feel that perhaps someone slipped up and that he may be perhaps taking the blame for an indiscretion of some officer.  If it is the Minister himself who is responsible, I merely wish to press this on him, that he should not give me or anyone like me or any other person an opportunity to raise a matter of this sort again.  The Minister can be as clement as he wishes but, even in exercising clemency, there is a certain restraint attaching to his position which he ought to observe.  I trust that, having raised this matter, it will be borne in mind and that neither I nor any other person will ever again be able to say that a Minister, in natural kindness of heart, forgot what he owed to his position and to the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee has been very restrained in regard to this matter to-night.  It is, I think, the experience of persons who have been imprisoned that, on release, they are supplied with transport, either by <Col N="2053" /> means of rail voucher or otherwise.  My only reason for intervening in this particular question is that within the past few days a question arose in connection with a prisoner&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee addressed the questions which he quoted to the Minister for Justice.  He addressed the first question on 2nd May, 1950, and he has quoted the exact words and, I am glad to say, he quoted the exact reply.  I thought, when he put down that question, that he was challenging the right of the Minister for Justice to exercise the prerogative of mercy.  Apparently, that is withdrawn so that I have not to follow that.  But, in case there might be any mistake about it, the power that I exercised was under the Statutory Rules and Orders of 1937&mdash;No. 234. That is the power that I exercised in releasing that prisoner.  Therefore, I have nothing to add, I presume, in regard to the grounds on which I released the prisoner and that is finished once and for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently, the Deputy got information that a Minister's car or a car which he said was ordinarily attached to a Minister was used.  I said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  I again have to <Col N="2055" /> repeat that word definitely&mdash;&ldquo;No.&rdquo; That car had nothing to do with that prisoner.  The Deputy addressed the second question to me to-day.  Again he has quoted it and there is no use in my wearying the House with it.  I gave him the number of the car that conveyed the prisoner from Portlaoise to Dublin and, while not on the defence at all, I want to say that, in the exercise of the prerogative of mercy, there was only one person to whom I could give this boy and that was the person who made the petition. That person was his father.  Under Article 25, I directed that a police car should take the prisoner into the custody of the person who made the petition on his behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee said to-day that he hoped that the Public Accounts Committee would take notice of my conduct.  Again, in a rather loose way, perhaps, I said that I hoped that the Public Accounts Committee would take notice of several other things.  Again, <Col N="2056" /> I do not want to become acrimonious, but I do not think that this is a good day's work for anybody.  This boy is now in suitable employment; he is aged 21; he is married and has a family and, as I said on May 2nd, he is a first offender and his employers think highly of him.  What does the Deputy want to do?  Does he want his employers to dismiss him?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is ridiculous. The question is immaterial.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy except on points of order.  I am not going to follow the Deputy's line at all.  I have done my duty as I am entitled to do as Minister for Justice.  I hope I will always discharge it as well as I have done on this occasion and if I do I will have nothing to answer for to the House, to the country or to my God.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.55 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, May 10th, 1950.</P>
