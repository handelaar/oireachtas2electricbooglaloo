      <P>Most, if not all, minor employment schemes are concerned directly or indirectly with agriculture and as employment in agriculture is specifically excepted from the scope of the Unemployment Insurance Acts, no contributions under those Acts are payable in respect of persons employed on such schemes.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1911" /> With regard to the latter part of the question, it is not intended to amend the present law in the matter.  The question of bringing such workers within the ambit of unemployment insurance is, however, being considered in connection with the new social security scheme.</P>

      <P>Early in 1948 negotiations were initiated with a view to acquiring property which included the Rotunda Picture House and some adjoining buildings and ground for the purposes of a concert hall.  A number of interests were involved in the premises in question and conclusive agreement had not been reached with any of the several parties concerned when in May, 1948, the Government decided, on grounds of economy, that the concert hall project should be <Col N="1917" /> deferred.  The negotiations thereupon terminated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harris</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that the wages of a number of employees of his Department at the Curragh Camp, who were graded as builders' labourers in September, 1948, were reduced last month from £4 18s. 0d. to £3 18s. 0d. per week, and whether he will arrange to have the former rate restored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that since the 1st April a number of men graded as building labourers in September, <Col N="1919" /> 1948, were regraded as general labourers and their rate of pay was accordingly reduced from £4 18s. 1d. a week to £3 13s. 4d. a week.  The regrading was necessary to permit of the absorption of other employees, senior in service to those who were regraded, as building labourers.</P>
      <P>No vacancies for building labourers exist at present and I regret, therefore, that it is not possible to have the men who were regraded reappointed as building labourers with their former rate of pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harris</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister for Defence agree that in view of the increased cost of living and of the fact that some of those men have recently acquired tenancies of county council cottages on the strength of their wages at the time, the reduction is a great hardship upon themselves and their families?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do agree that any reduction in wages is a hardship on individuals, but if the hardship were not inflicted on these individuals it would have had to be inflicted on others.  The fact of the matter is that the volume of work is contracting and it was a question of who would be kept on.  According to what I think is a generally accepted fair code, the question of who would be retained was settled on the basis that those who had the longest service would be retained and that those who had the shortest service would go, and as far as less vacancies were concerned, a man on a higher rate got the option of being retained at a lower rate of pay.</P>

      <P>Exports of hand-woven tweeds are not recorded separately in the official trade statistics and I cannot, therefore, indicate what quantities of these tweeds have been exported to the Netherlands since last November.  The best I can do is furnish the figures for exports of woollen tissues (which include mill-woven tweeds, cheviots, etc., as well as hand-woven and homespun cloths).  Exports to the Netherlands under this heading in the period November, 1949&mdash;April, 1950, were 47,320 square yards value £22,392.</P>
      <P>In the case of France and Western Germany the quotas of £125,000 and £107,000 respectively were, as already stated, for all types of woollen and worsted cloths.  Exports under these quotas in the period November, 1949&mdash; April, 1950, amounted to 25,170 square yards, value £11,326 in the case of France, and 48,240 square yards value £31,143 in the case of Western Germany.</P>

Any arrangement for joint action in the case of any particular scheme should, therefore, be initiated by the local authorities concerned.  As I indicated to the Deputy in my reply of the 21st March last, I am not aware of any such joint scheme for the River Feorish.  I am approving of a simple scheme submitted by the Roscommon County Council for the clearance of obstructions in the section of the river in that county.  I have also approved a similar scheme in relation to a tributary of the river in County Sligo.

      <P>When I moved to report progress on this Estimate on last Thursday I was dealing with the general decline in tillage, and I had shown what were, in my opinion, the reasons for that decline.  I was pleading with influential members of the Parties supporting the Government to try to bring about what change they could so as to ensure that we would not have a continuance of a situation in which public money is being spent for the purpose of telling our farmers <Col N="1939" /> and landowners to grow wheat and to grow beet and other crops of that kind, while the Minister responsible for that Department was engaged in making speeches down the country, which clearly suggested that he had no belief whatever in such a policy, and that, as a matter of fact, much and all as he had denounced these activities on the part of landowners, he had been reduced this year to the sorry state of having to sit in Leinster House with a colleague interviewing some members of the Beet Growers' Association in the hope that some means could be discovered of increasing the beet acreage. I was inviting Deputies to check up that sort of performance with a statement which I have already read to the House, and which I propose to read again in order to ensure that Deputies will understand and that the country will understand that there is no possibility of anything other than a decline in tillage so long as we have on the one hand public statements such as&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;We could restore the pig population in 18 months at the longest, make a profit on every pig, provide bacon for every table in this country, and have an export for Great Britain wherewith to purchase goods we want, because we should have an export which they particularly want. Of the total of their consumption, our production would form an appreciable percentage.  Instead of that, we are to subsidise to the tune of £400,000 the increased acreage under beet, every acre of which will complicate the world situation created by a sugar surplus and every acre of which represents a serious loss to the national income.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement was made in the discussion in this House on the Estimates for 1947.  I am seriously asking those Deputies who are supporting the Government to ask themselves this: How can we have a situation other than that which we have, and why should they allow the Government to continue to spend money in advertising, in conducting a campaign <Col N="1941" /> advising our farmers to grow wheat and grow beet, and to provide against this, that and the other, while the Minister responsible for the industry itself feels at liberty, in this House and outside of it, to speak as I have already indicated?  On the last evening the Minister saw fit to challenge the accuracy of some of the quotations I had given from speeches he had made.  In order that there may be no doubt as to what the Minister actually said, on the 8th February, 1950, round about the time that this public money was being spent in order to induce farmers to grow wheat and beet, the Minister for Agriculture, speaking at Cooley, County Louth, as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of Wednesday, 8th February, 1950, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The plain truth about wheat growing is that, while it is true that you are guaranteed a price of 62/6 per barrel for all the millable wheat that is grown upon the land of Ireland until 1953, every barrel of wheat that is grown represents a heavy burden on the Exchequer which must be met by corresponding taxes payable by our people.  I would prefer to see barley and oats grown on our land which we will dispose of at a profit on our export market in the shape of live stock and live-stock products, rather than wheat which can only be disposed of by compelling the domestic milling industry to buy it and paying them a heavy subsidy on every barrel they buy.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am merely inviting the House now, especially the Deputies on the Government Benches and the members of the Government itself who go out into the open and make speeches, such as that made only a few nights ago by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce urging farmers to grow wheat, to get in touch with the Minister for Agriculture so that, as a result of whatever consultations they think necessary, there may be induced amongst all the members of the Government some clarification of the position and some clarification of what is meant when these advertisements are issued to the public and paid for out of taxation, <Col N="1942" /> while, at the same time, they are talking in several different voices as to what is meant and what it is hoped to achieve by them.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when introducing this Estimate, was very scant in the information he saw fit to give with regard to potatoes.  I was anxious to hear him talk about potatoes.  I was anxious to hear him speak on a matter on which I have been trying for some weeks now to screw some information out of the Minister.  Strange as it may appear to people who look upon this House as a place wherein their business is transacted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the whole of the White Paper, and the black paper, and the green paper, and all the papers that I have before me here.  Strange as it may appear to those who look upon this House as a place wherein their business is transacted, I have not yet got from the Minister that information to which I, as a Deputy, am entitled, apart altogether from the fact that the House is entitled to have that information.  I talked here the last evening about the contract which was negotiated in my time but signed by my successor.  I dealt with the way in which that contract had been implemented from the point of view of the growers here.  I come now to the contract that was entered into in 1949.  I come now to deal with the scant information that I have so far obtained as to what transpired as a result of that conference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall try to get it in one way or another.  I have a certain amount of information as to what took place in relation to that 1949 conference. <Col N="1943" /> I am not entirely in the dark.  I was not entirely in the dark when I first put down a parliamentary question in relation to it.  I knew a fair share about it even then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not enough that I, as a former Minister for Agriculture, should know.  The public should know. We are all the servants of the public. I made a comment here when I moved to refer back this particular Estimate. I assured you, and I know that you did not want the assurance, that I did not crave mercy here from anybody as to whether or not I would get a quiet hearing.  I knew that you were not interested in that assurance.  It will not facilitate the dispatch of business here if I am subjected to a constant barrage from the Minister or anybody else.  I shall not be in the least inconvenienced by that.  Deputies on the Government Benches must make up their own minds as to what they will do in regard to my speech.  I am in the fortunate position that I can have it both ways.</P>
      <P>I was trying to convey to the House that I knew a fair share about the 1949 agreement.  But I want to know more about it.  I am entitled to use this House as a place wherein I can bring out the facts behind that agreement so that the public outside may know.  It is not good enough that these transactions should prove to be satisfactory to the Minister or to his Government, or even to the members of the Opposition. The members of the Opposition are entitled to know what these transactions were, what the background was, the way in which the contracts were entered into and the question as to whether or not the contracts were fulfilled; and, if they were not fulfilled, whether or not any penalty was incurred because of their non-fulfilment. It is in these and some other points that I am interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell the House who made this 1949 contract to sell 50,000 tons of potatoes to Great Britain.  Who advised the Minister that we would have 50,000 tons of <Col N="1944" /> potatoes to sell to anybody?  Was there any consultation with his own officials, whom, I may say, I found for the short time I was there, very shrewd and very safe in these matters?  Was it a case of calling on these gentlemen to say whether or not we were likely to have any quantity of potatoes for export, having regard to the sort of summer we had, or was the Minister just acting as boss of the show?  We supplied, I understand, 26,000 tons of potatoes under that contract.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  My information is that when we found that we could not get the potatoes here in this country, which has always been noted as a potato-producing country, we set off on a chase to procure potatoes anywhere and everywhere.  The Minister, when in opposition, was very good at working up some very beautiful stories here, when we, in the years gone by, were struggling hard to make a Republican of him.  When we were looking for continental markets, he used to work off on these benches beautiful stories in connection with the search for a continental market but when the contract for the potatoes in 1949 could not be filled in this potato-growing country, it is for the Minister to say whether or not he went out to starving Europe in the hope of securing potatoes from war-worn, war-ridden, war-ravaged Europe.  Mind you, strange as it may appear, potatoes were discovered in war-worn, war-ridden, war-ravaged Europe, but they could only be secured on the basis of paying for them in hard currency and <Col N="1945" /> we had not the hard currency.  Finally, terms were reached under which they would take grain from us but, as a result of the tillage drive in which the Minister had been engaged, we had no grain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am stating the case on the most reliable information and, as to the Minister's denials, those of us who know what they mean will not say any more than that.  Now we could not get the hard currency because it was not there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We had not the grain with which to make a barter and we finally went to the Argentine in search of the grain, but when we got the grain in the Argentine, we found that the potatoes were gone from Europe, that another customer had been found.  Of course, the British were all the time waiting, I suppose, for fulfilment of the contract.  I am not blaming the British for pressing the matter and asking that those who made the contract with them should keep it.  We pressed them in previous years when they had sufficient potatoes from the home-grown crop to take from us what they had agreed to take.  What was fair for them was fair for us, and I have no quarrel to pick with them on that score.  When the barter arrangement on the Continent for the Argentine grain had failed, we resorted to other parts&mdash;so the story goes.</P>

      <P>It is wonderful how sensitive the Minister has recently become.  It is wonderful how sensitive he can be as Minister, as compared with the times when he used to stand up here after coming in with the white attaché case from his business, just listen for a few minutes and make any particular speech on any particular matter, irrespective of what it cost the <Col N="1946" /> country.  How sensitive he can be when I am dealing with the subject of a contract made by the Minister and how it was kept.  Having failed on the Continent, we arrived at a place&mdash;I must say I did not know my geography so well until I heard the name of this place, but I know of this place now if I did not know it before&mdash;called Prince Edward Island.  The fact that it was a prince's island did not seem to make any difference, republicans and all that we were.  Finally, we entered into a contract to buy potatoes in Prince Edward Island.  Then, of course, they would only take hard currency and that hard currency could only be obtained from the dollar pool.  I used to hear members of this House who belong to a certain Party make many curious statements when they were crazy to break links of one kind or another.  As well as breaking political links, they used to talk about breaking the link with sterling.  They broke these links during the course of the last election at every street corner in the country, although I think they did not know what they were talking about.</P>

      <P>When the British Chancellor or the office which deals with financial matters in England found what the dollars were needed for, they naturally got in touch with the British Minister of Food and they said: &ldquo;Do you really want these potatoes at all?&rdquo; The British Ministry of Food perhaps really did not want the potatoes but <Col N="1947" /> they wanted to get us to toe the line. They said: &ldquo;These people made a contract with us and they will have to keep it.  They made one with us last year and they made us toe the line.&rdquo;  So the strangling and the wangling went on between the British Ministry of Food and the Chancellor of the Exchequer or the authorities in Britain who decide questions in regard to the release of dollars to countries that are connected in the dollar pool with ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the history of this Government and the history of the past two and a half years of the Department of Agriculture in regard to all these matters with which I have dealt.  Mind you, in introducing the Estimate the Minister did not give us a single solitary assurance as to the attitude taken up by the British in these recent discussions towards him as Minister for Agriculture of the Republic.  I had been expecting evidence here from him, when introducing his Estimate, of the progress he was able to make in Britain when talking to British Ministers, because we had now &ldquo;cleared up&rdquo;, as he used to say himself, and because we had refused to live the lie; because the relationship with the British was now on a different footing altogether from the hypocritical basis on which we had it; because he was going to be, in the new set-up, able to go before the British Ministers and appear to them in an entirely different light from that in which his predecessors were obliged to appear as a result of the confusion, as he alleged, that existed in regard to international status.  Did I not hear the Minister, on a number of occasions when in opposition, address this House as to the way in which Ministers of the Fianna Fáil Government were employing civil servants to go over to do their business in London?  Did I not hear the whole Fine Gael Party from time to time&mdash;from day to day and from month to month&mdash;twitting members of the Fianna Fáil Government when the war was in progress because of our failure to go over and meet our opposite numbers on the other side? Did I not hear all the complaints not <Col N="1948" /> only here but down the country of the way in which we had entrusted the nation's work to a set of civil servants?</P>
    <P>Did I not see the sorry sight in recent times of a Minister for Agriculture of the Republic of Ireland refuse to entrust Irish civil servants, who would do their work conscientiously and well&mdash;refuse to entrust it to these splendid well-informed gentlemen&mdash; with the doing of that work, but depend upon the Danes to sell our eggs, butter, milk and cream?  To the extent that Irish civil servants have ever been called upon to assist their Ministers in negotiations with Great Britain during our time&mdash;to whatever extent that was and will always be resorted to in every country&mdash;even if the charge were correct that it was resorted to in our case more than in the case of any other Government, which I deny, let me say that I would entrust Irish civil servants with the task of selling our produce rather than bring about a situation in which we would have to stand by&mdash;a situation which the Minister permitted&mdash;and allow Danes to sell it for us.</P>
    <P>I invite, then, members of the Dáil, of the Parties supporting this Government, and the influential Deputies&mdash;because, apparently, there are such supporting this Government&mdash; to address themselves seriously to this matter.  Some of these Deputies claim to have been responsible for the External Relations Act and for the codification of our international status: some claim that they are going to be responsible for forcing this Government to give us a social welfare scheme and others claim that, through their influence, they have succeeded in having a number of things done.  I ask some section now supporting that Government to do as some other sections have done in relation to other matters and try to bring about a situation in which, as far as tillage and agriculture in general are concerned, people will know where they are.  I would emphasise that farming is not like shop-keeping, because farming and agriculture cannot be treated as a wholesale and retail business, where, if a man finds he is in need of some goods, he just looks up where the goods are <Col N="1949" /> to be obtained and then says that he will place an order.  Farmers must be told well in advance what the national policy is to be.  Farmers must be told what that policy is to be through the mouthpiece of the Minister who is responsible for the Department which is concerned with their business, through the advertisements issued and, in so far as agriculture is concerned, there must be clarity on the part of those who speak for the Government. It is because there has not been that clarity that we have had the disgraceful confusion which, naturally enough, the Minister would like to smother.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that neither I nor the House got any clear statement in respect of the discussions in which the Minister and his Department have been engaged with the British on a number of heads, which I cited.  It is all right to tell the farmers and the country in general that we have an agreement with Britain on cattle until 195&mdash;.  For example, I wanted to know about our products.  I do not think the Minister could really have been serious when he admitted so frankly that there seems to be no prospect for milk, butter and milk products.  I am not unappreciative of the difficulties that will confront a Minister for Agriculture, or a Government, in certain circumstances in dealing with this problem.  However, I want to tell the House and this Government and this Minister this much about milk: when I was a member, for a short time, of the headquarters staff, which planned the policy for this country, it was one of the subjects to which I gave the greatest amount of attention.  Without making any boast whatever, I am still proud and will continue to be proud of the fact that I did a substantial and useful bit of work for dairy farmers in this country.  I want to give a warning to the Minister and to those who will tamper with or maltreat those who are engaged in that industry.  Although I am not now a member of the headquarters staff responsible for policy, I am still a member of this House, and I will be one of the most unrelenting and one of the most difficult Deputies, in so far as those who will attempt to fritter away what the people engaged <Col N="1950" /> in that industry have secured, and to which they were entitled, in matters of price and otherwise in leading from this side of the House any fight that may be necessary to ensure that these people will not suffer.  Even the scant treatment which they obtained from us will be preserved for them.</P>
    <P>Did I, or did this House, hear from the Minister when he was introducing his Estimate any constructive statement of policy in that regard?  There was, it is true, a speech made by the Minister to the county committee of agriculture in Waterford, a copy of which I have before me.  I have also before me a letter which he addressed to the chairman of all the committees of agriculture in the State enclosing a copy of the Waterford speech.</P>
    <P>On this subject I directed questions to the Minister asking him was what was contained in the speech at Waterford really his mind as Minister.  I suggested to him, as best one can within the limitations of Question Time, that while consultation with the producers was a grand thing, it was sometimes difficult to get agreement amongst producers and that a time must come when, just as in the case of a tillage policy, there must be clarity in regard to this matter.  Where is the clarity to come from?  Who is to conduct the discussions? How long are the discussions with the industry to last?  When is finality reached?  When is the pronouncement to be made as to future policy?</P>
    <P>I know that men in public life, men in politics, men with responsibility, are often tempted to sidetrack making what they know would be an unpopular decision.  There may be occasions when recourse to such tactics would be justifiable but that should be only when such men are dealing with frivolous matters.  When it comes to a question such as milk production and the question of the livelihood of milk producers and their future, the Minister, after all the discussions that he wishes to have with the industry, must ultimately have a mind of his own.  If he cannot find agreement as to the course that should be pursued, the responsibility falls directly on him and he should have the <Col N="1951" /> character, the strength and the courage, irrespective of the cost in a political sense, to face up to the discharge of that responsibility.  That is how I see the responsibility of a Minister. There may be other ways of looking at it.  If there are, I could not understand them.</P>
    <P>On the Estimates last year, as I said last Thursday, we heard something new from the Minister for Agriculture on this same subject but, since then, we have not had a word or a line as to what has happened to the plan which he announced on that occasion. Naturally, I would like to hear about it now.  In order to improve the milking capacity of our cows, the Minister decided that he would start a cow-testing scheme in the Dublin milk-producing area.  He also announced, I believe, the way in which that scheme would be financed.  He told us that it would be his aim to set up at least one artificial insemination station in that area.  I have heard nothing about that since.  I would like to know what happened about it but I was not terribly interested in it because I thought it was the greatest nonsense in the world.  Having made that statement, I will try to explain my reason for thinking along these lines.</P>
    <P>As far as the Dublin area is concerned, as I know it, the cows supplying the farmers and landowners frequently change.  In the main, the producers in that area do not rear calves.  When they want a cow, they generally go to the Dublin market and buy a cow, the best value they can get.  When it has been milked for the season, the milk producer may get rid of her.  I am not saying, of course, that that would apply to every case and to every milk supplier in the Dublin milk area but, in the main, that is the practice in that area, as I see it.  Whatever chance there might be in creamery districts for a cow-testing organisation and for a scheme of using proven bulls through an artificial insemination station for the purpose of improving herds, there would not be, to my mind, the slightest hope of success being achieved in the Dublin milk area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1952" /> Of course, it is the easy place in which to deduct the contribution from the milk supplier, because you have certain control.  It is the place where you could deduct ¼d. or ½d. a gallon from the milk supplier, whether he liked it or not, because he is more or less in the grip of your hand.  That fact would not justify the inauguration of a scheme of that kind in that area at all.  In the Dublin milk area, as I know it, those who breed, breed from Pol-Angus and Hereford bulls for the simple reason that they want calves that will secure, immediately on being dropped, the highest possible price.  Although the Minister last year announced that he was starting the scheme, I have not heard whether he started it or not.  I do not know what progress he has made; I do not know what money he has got into the fund or what contributions he is making from State funds; I do not know what plans he has in mind or has put into execution for the establishment of one or more than one artificial insemination station.  But, in my view, it is no contribution whatever to a solution of our cattle breeding and milk producing problem.  If progress could be made along these lines, it could only be made by starting such a policy in the creamery districts.</P>
    <P>I may have referred briefly to this matter of breeding on some previous occasion in this House.  I have already stated the whole truth when I say that I was deeply interested in farmers who engaged in milk production. There is scarcely a Deputy from a rural area who will not know that, without my giving my reasons why I was so interested.  I have claimed that I secured something for them, and I have told the House what my attitude is to be in the future, so far as that section of the farming community are concerned, but, in addition to having this interest in the matter of price, I had an interest in a subject which is very widely discussed in every country where milk is produced: milk yields.  When the change of Government took place, following certain minor changes I had made in that cattle breeding policy set out in the Act of 1925, the Minister saw fit, one <Col N="1953" /> evening in the Department, having secured just the advice of a junior official as to who was responsible for the change, and having been informed that it was the Minister, and that the official attitude was not in accordance with the lines along which I was thinking, to reverse, without a thought, this decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not a scintilla of truth in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Let no Deputy or person outside think that I am in the least concerned because somebody does not agree with the decision I made, because I admit that it is a complicated matter and I could perhaps find in the ranks of my own Department some men who would not see eye to eye with me in the lines along which I was thinking. Let no Deputy or person outside think that I am talking here because it has hurt me in any way that my decision was reversed, but I ask Deputies and those engaged in this business to ponder over what I have to say now. Politics apparently can be a funny business sometimes and changes made by the electorate, or by some other method with which I will not now deal, can produce the most peculiar results. There is always a tendency, I admit, for men who are lined against one another to try to prove that the other fellow was wrong.  I admit, too, that, when this Government came into office, being human like everybody else, that temptation was there.  The Minister gave us an assurance that agriculture was one matter in respect of which it was inadvisable to have sudden drastic changes.  He said that they created chaos and confusion.  We got that assurance undoubtedly and I was impressed by it at the time, but when he came to this question of breeding cattle for milk, all he had to be told was that it was a ministerial decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do Deputies know why it was a ministerial decision?  I was dealing with officials, some of whom had been there for 25 years, since the 1925 Act was passed and officials are just the same as the rest of us.  They became involved in the operation of that Act; they met cattle breeders all over the <Col N="1954" /> country; they went into their premises and advised them to breed this way, that way or the other way; and naturally it is only reasonable to think that, after 25 years of that, they would not like to see any reversal, because any reversal would be in conflict with what they had been advising farmers and breeders to do for 25 years.  I tried to see that point of view as surely as I am speaking to the House now and to be as kindly towards it as I could.  I did not want to do it suddenly and I had thought it over years before I became Minister.  I had thought over the effects of the 1925 Breeding Act and whether we were getting anywhere as a result of it.</P>
    <P>I had no political prejudice against those operating it and it surely can be said of me that, in following a member of my own Party with whom I am on the most friendly terms, in my intention to reverse the policy which he and his predecessor had operated, I was not trying to expose him.  I was not trying to show up these officials.  I was trying to do something which I thought would have to be done as gradually as possible.  The same, however, cannot be said of a decision on the part of my successor, who perhaps did not give the matter a moment's thought until he received some letters from the breeders concerned showing that I was interfering with their business.  In his case there was a political inclination to show his predecessor as a man who was wrong, but, in my case, I was dealing with a member of my own Party whom I had succeeded.  Therefore, no charge of the kind could be levelled against me, but I really did think, as I think now, that, so far as milk and milk production are concerned, those engaged in it for a living, especially in the creamery districts, were and are not getting a fair crack of the whip through the operation of the Live Stock Breeding Act of 1925.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make that as a case against anybody&mdash;the late Deputy Hogan, who was responsible for it, my predecessor, Deputy Ryan, myself, or even the present occupant of the Ministry.  I invite the milk suppliers to creameries, in whose welfare I can claim to have shown a great deal of <Col N="1955" /> interest, with success, when I was trying to take that further step, to note one thing.  That simple step which I took showed the lines on which I was thinking, the lines I was going to pursue.  It was not good policy that that line of thought which occupied my attention for many years should have been interrupted, should have been brought to an end just with a sweep of the pen.</P>
    <P>In our time as a Government a good deal used to be written in some of the journals, such as the journal of the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, about agricultural Ireland.  They dealt with the whole question of cattle breeding and milk production.  The Irish Agricultural Organisation Society is an organisation subsidised by the State, so far as I remember, on a pound for pound basis.  It is interesting to me now to read some of the articles appearing in that journal.  It was all right to twit Fianna Fáil about the capacity of milking cows in New Zealand.  It was all right to tell milk producers here what could be done in other lands if a wise cattle breeding policy were pursued.  Since the change of Government, agricultural Ireland, as represented through the pages of the journal produced by the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, is as political as political can be.</P>
    <P>At the only meeting of that body I attended while I was Minister, I invited them to give the public some evidence of the work they were likely to do for the dairying and co-operative movements.  I invited them to forget as far as possible the success that had attended any efforts they had made back through the years.  I reminded them that that success was no justification for their continued existence, drawing a subsidy, unless they could show they had something to contribute for the future.  I did not feel like denying them the right in our time to criticise us as they liked on any matter of policy.  They were perfectly free to say what they liked about the policy of the Government of the day, about cattle breeding and other things.</P>
    <P>But, what is sauce for the goose is <Col N="1956" /> sauce for the gander and it is no harm now to draw their attention to the fact that those of us who have watched their activities and pronouncements can notice a substantial and a very unhealthy change.  There is here a problem to be met and it will not be met by the establishment of an artificial insemination station in the Dublin milk producing area or by the introduction of a few proven bulls that will not be used, for the reason I have stated.  It might not be met by the measures I proposed to take and by the policies I had lurking in the back of my mind, but it is a subject of sufficient importance to warrant far greater care and far more evidence of a serious approach by the Minister than merely to brush aside the decision of his predecessor with no thought whatever other than to establish that things would be different, even if they were going to be worse.</P>
    <P>There is no use in a Minister for Agriculture indulging in the sort of special pleading to which the present Minister resorted when discussing this matter of future milk prices, special pleading such as:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not want to hurt the milk producers; I do not want to injure them; surely you do not think I am responsible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was a strange thing to see the present occupant of the Ministry pleading with the organisations concerned in the industry for advice on all those matters.  It was strange, because our experience of the Minister, not only as Minister but as an Opposition Deputy, was that he knew everything, all about milk and milk production and cattle breeding, everything from a needle to an anchor. When I saw the special pleading with the milk producers, I thought it was a very noticeable change.</P>
    <P>There was one passage in this Waterford speech that I think I should read, and it is this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;My advice to the farmers is to adopt the plan which I have outlined here to-day, and I am bound to tell them that I do not believe this opportunity will ever recur.  I am bound to tell them that if they <Col N="1957" /> take the long view now we shall see the greatest period of prosperity for the farmers of this country that they have ever known.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it would be a pity if I were to read further without analysing these words, feeling that they might get sort of lost in your memories:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am bound to tell them that I do not believe that this opportunity will ever recur.  Further, I am bound to tell them that if they take the long view now, we shall see the greatest period of prosperity for the farmers of this country that they have ever known.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is grand.  Deputy Rooney is going to get into his stride. He was not here when I extended my invitation to the members of the Government Parties and explained my attitude to interrupters, but I will not say anything more now; I will give him a chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This statement was made by the Minister to a county committee of agriculture in one of the milk-producing counties of Munster, and having submitted the proposal to the Waterford Committee, he submitted it to every county committee in the country to get their views&mdash;some decided to write and some did not.  Suppose he were convinced that &ldquo;this opportunity will never recur&rdquo; and that I, as a member of the Opposition, ask the Minister a parliamentary question&mdash;as I did&mdash; about his attitude to that opportunity, he tells me that consultations are continuing.  Then I pressed him, asking: &ldquo;In the event of your failing to get an agreement regarding the acceptance of the offer, what are you going to do about it?  Are you going to let it slip?&rdquo;  So is it any wonder that I would invite the Minister to tell us now?  This opportunity might never recur as far as the Minister knew, and the Minister is in possession of knowledge which no other individual in the State would have.  He would be entitled to make a forecast&mdash;if he were a normal man&mdash;which could be regarded as being entirely different from that which might be made by a member of a county <Col N="1958" /> committee of agriculture who would not be armed with that knowledge.</P>
    <P>It does not matter whether I agree with the proposition contained in that document.  I am not the Minister for Agriculture; I am not responsible for the Department of Agriculture; I make no prophecies of what the future of this industry will be over the next five years because I do not know.  The Minister has that responsibility; the Minister is the Minister; the Minister knows facts which I may not know. He has made a statement which is not one which might be made wildly at a public meeting, but one which was made as a result of careful thought. He not only made this statement at the meeting but afterwards he issued it to almost 30 committees of agriculture with a covering note.  This is the opinion of the Minister and it must also be the opinion of the Government because, in a properly governed country, such an opinion should be submitted to every member of the Government. If it is the opinion of the Minister, speaking to his colleagues in the Government, that the acceptance of this proposition would result to the agricultural community in prosperity that was never known before but if, through lack of knowledge or courage, or through sheer cussedness, the county committees of agriculture and the creameries committees wished to refuse, has the Government no responsibility? Does the Government not lead? Who is ultimately responsible for making a decision?  Is anybody responsible? Are we to be governed only on the basis of what is popular or unpopular? Are we to consider the political comfort of those who happen to be members of the Government rather than take our courage in our hands when a member of the Government, speaking with the knowledge and approval of the Government and knowing the circumstances of the world outside, is satisfied that the acceptance of this offer will mean to the farmers of Ireland a prosperity that they have never known before?</P>
    <P>The taking of long views is a matter for the Government who are charged with the formulation of national policy. Anybody who knows farmers knows <Col N="1959" /> that it is not reasonable to expect that they would take the long view because they are not in possession of the facts which would enable them to take it. Therefore, if there is justification for the forecast, we should be told what it is.  The Minister has kept to himself all the information that induced him to think and speak along these lines. It is not a matter for the public or for the farmers to plan long-distance policy; that is the responsibility of the Government.  He went on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whereas, if they take the short view, in my judgment we are starting on what well may be for our industry the beginning of the end.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This thing is dangling for all these months.  I tried to get a statement from the Minister some weeks ago as to what his attitude would be, but there has been no statement from the Minister who is responsible for advising the Government as to what course should be taken.  Now we are discussing an Estimate for so many millions&mdash;millions do not matter; whether it is £20,000,000 or £30,000,000 is neither here nor there, so I do not know what the actual size of the Vote is; it does not matter as it is only £15,000,000 or £16,000,000.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Dillon, the Minister for Agriculture, had a conversation with the Minister for Finance about the butter subsidy.  It was costing a lot of money and with milk turning out to creameries that formerly went into home-made butter as well as the suspension of the provision of the Road Transport Act, he had got a fair <Col N="1960" /> success in the supply of milk to creameries.  Now, the Minister for Finance will look kindly on any proposition to reduce the weight falling on the Exchequer and, as well as being a Minister for Finance who naturally must save money if he sees the opportunity, he is a Minister who would not know very much about farming.  After getting his benediction for this particular scheme, the Minister for Agriculture proceeded to make a speech about it.  Apparently, someone intervened and said: &ldquo;This will not do.&rdquo;  Of course, the Minister, having committed himself, having made a statement, whether it is right or wrong&mdash;after all, there is a fair share of the old pride there&mdash;is not a man who can swallow it.  No matter who the devil swallows anything else, he will not swallow it. There is too much of the Dillon in him to swallow the pride.  Anyhow, the pressure came on, that this could not be done, that it would be bad political tactics.  There were some Deputies opposite who had a special interest in milk producers and who had made promises to make not a reduction but an increase in the price of milk.  I do not want to talk about promises, as they do not mean anything anyhow.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Having been persuaded to go ahead with this policy, the Minister saw the end of the year and said to himself: &ldquo;I will have a butter surplus; what am I to do about it?  If I have a butter surplus and have to export it and sell on the British market, carrying a subsidy, I can only look back on the days when I used to talk about feeding John Bull at the expense of the Irish taxpayer; when I used to make speeches from these benches and used to denounce Fianna Fáil for the <Col N="1961" /> policy of feeding John Bull at the expense of the taxpayer.&rdquo;  Then the Minister said to himself: &ldquo;I am going to save myself irrespective of what happens to the Coalition Government, irrespective of those who are playing for votes, or refusing to put the policy in motion.  I am going to leave myself at the end of the year in the position that if I happen to have a surplus that can be sold only on the basis of paying a subsidy from the Irish taxpayer, we will have the mighty James Dillon, Minister for Agriculture, saying to the farmers and milk producers: `Did I not invite you to take the other course and tell you that if you did not, this would be the result?  Did I not ask you to make the decision and advise you of the right course, and am I not a wise man?' &rdquo;&mdash;and no one refers to the fact that he is the Minister, that it is he who should lead and decide.  It is for the Government to make policy known.  I could not see myself a member of any Government responsible for a Department so important as this, if I knew the facts as the present Minister claims he knows them, which induced him to make these statements, and shivering and shaking there in a job that he says is not paying him well enough, sitting there and allowing an industry to continue along lines that, in his own view, can result only, to use his own words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whereas if they take the short view in my judgement we are starting on what well may be for our industry the beginning of the end.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>and then we have all the boloney that follows usually from the Minister.  Is there a line or a word in the concluding portion of that speech which indicates that it is the Minister and the Government who have ultimately the responsibility to make a vital decision?  I have asked him what were the prospects of selling on the British market butter, cream, cheese and other milk products and &ldquo;None&rdquo; was the reply I got. Surely, on an important matter such as this, we should have from him a clear statement.  In some recent speeches the Minister has shown that he has suddenly become aware of the fact that without the dairying industry much progress is not likely to be made in an agricultural sense.  Whatever decision we make in regard to increasing the income of those who milk the cow and send the milk to the creamery, uppermost in our mind should be a desire to place now in the hands of those engaged in that business every weapon that will enable them most successfully to meet any situation that may present itself at home or abroad.</P>

      <P>Whether I can read or not, does not matter two hoots.  The Minister is not going to disturb me with that sort of talk.  I have here before me several extracts from speeches in which we were given the assurance that, when we became a Republic, we were going to be able to do business with our neighbours outside on a basis different from that on which we used to do business.  We were going to be put on a different plane so that when our Ministers went over to the other side they were going to be treated in a way in which no Ministers who had left here before were ever treated.  I am anxious to get from the present Minister for Agriculture a statement showing the effect of the political changes that have taken place, and the way in which these have strengthened his hand to discuss with the British the price for our surplus butter, the price for our bacon and the price for our cheese, and whether or not they were going to allow in any fresh cream.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to have from the Minister a statement showing whether or not he regarded himself ultimately as the person responsible for advising the Government on matters of policy&mdash; even of arguing with members of the Government who would not know the facts as well as he would&mdash;of advising his 12 colleagues in the Government and saying to them: &ldquo;As far as agriculture is concerned, as far as milk production is concerned, as far as cheese and chocolate crumb are concerned, and as far as cattle breeding is concerned, here is the policy that I recommend to you.  I have consulted all the interests concerned; I have consulted <Col N="1964" /> the creameries and I have consulted the county committees of agriculture. I have got letters of approval from some of them, but I was repudiated by most of them.&rdquo;  His colleagues would not be likely to know the facts as well as he would know them.  He would say to them: &ldquo;I know them, and here is the policy which I recommend to you.&rdquo;  Having put that over as his policy and having got approval for it from his colleagues, he would then say to the country: &ldquo;Here is the policy for the next five years.&rdquo; To those engaged in the production of milk and in other forms of production he would say: &ldquo;Here is the policy of the State.&rdquo;  That process of reasoning may be wrong, but if I happened to have the responsibility that is now the Minister's, and if I believed in the statement contained in the Waterford speech and circulated to the creamery committees of the country, I would not remain in office after hearing from them, after having their views and after having consultations with them; but I would determine what the policy was going to be.  I would feel that it was my duty to do that whatever the result might be as far as my political future was concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this is Question Time.  I have found myself unable at Question Time to get the Minister to answer questions which I have put to him.  It is because of his failure to inform me, and because of the fact that he has a slick tongue and tries to conceal things, that I have been endeavouring for the last hour to get this information from him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely a Minister in the Republic of Ireland who has established relations that never before existed with our nearest neighbour, and who made an agreement in 1948 when he came into office, an agreement which he recommended to this House and which he said offered unprecedented <Col N="1965" /> advantages to the farmers of Ireland, even though, on the first occasion when we had a surplus after the agreement was made, it could not be sold to our nearest neighbour, would answer the questions which I have put to him.  The Minister knows, in regard to the agreement which he made in 1948, that he recommended it to this House in the language which I have quoted here.  He said that it offered unprecedented advantages to the farmers of Ireland, but in 1950 he comes into this House and tells us that there is no market for our surplus butter, no market for our cream, no market for cheese, only a very poor market for eggs and no market, in fact, for anything only a few dry cattle.</P>
      <P>In view of all that, will the Minister explain to us what has happened to the agreement of 1948 and what has happened to the undertakings which we got in regard to the improvement that was to take place in the relationship that was to exist between ourselves and our nearest neighbours as a result of the policy pursued by this Government?  The farmers in the County Monaghan would be delighted to hear the Minister answer these questions, especially having regard to the statements which he made to the electors there on the last occasion and as to the assurances which he gave them as to the policy that he would pursue.  Those electors would be glad to hear the Minister for Agriculture address himself to the questions which I am asking himself now.  Will he tell them what has become of the agreement which he lauded to the skies a few months ago?  These are questions that I would like to hear the Minister answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in July, 1948, in recommending the 1948 agreement to the House, said that it offered unprecedented advantages to the farmers of Ireland and remunerative prices for all agricultural produce. <Col N="1966" /> These were the words which the Minister used when asking the House to give its approval to that agreement, but on the first occasion on which we had a few cwt. of bacon to sell to the people at the other side we had to pay a subsidy on it out of the producer's pocket.  I am now asking the Minister to tell us what is going to be the milk policy for this country in the next five years?  He is asking me whose policy he reversed in five seconds.  He is asking me what I would do with the surplus butter.</P>

      <P>If the Minister, when replying, would say to the House and to the country whether he intended to deal with the matters to which I have referred and would announce his policy it would be far more constructive than shooting questions across here at me. I am merely telling the Minister, and those who know me best know that what I am stating is a fact, that if the responsibility were mine nothing would induce me&mdash;no fear of my political future&mdash;to do anything other than what would be in the public interest. The Minister once said to a deputation: <Col N="1967" />&ldquo;What about my political future, if I do that.&rdquo;  As far as I am concerned, whatever policy was agreed to be in the national interest would be the policy that I would operate.  I invite the Minister to do that and I invite the Deputies supporting him to induce him to do that so that we may know where we stand.</P>

They are like everybody else. They think of themselves first as a nation.  To tell you the truth, although the Minister succeeded in securing their help and assistance to sell our produce, I would rather see someone else selling it.  I would not give them any butter.  I would try some of the other fly-by-night customers to see if they want any surplus butter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has protested because I have stated I would sell surplus butter to the Russians.  I would.  I would sell it to anybody who would give me the best price for it. If the Minister protests against that, then I want to know why he bought barley from Iraq and sorghums from God-knows-where.  It is not &ldquo;sorghums&rdquo; they should be called; it is &ldquo;sour-gums&rdquo;.  I have stated my view with regard to milk and there can be no ambiguity left as to where we stand. The Minister did announce what he had achieved with regard to the sale of eggs.  Remembering his appeals here at Question Time over a period that he was engaged in delicate discussions with the British, I cannot for the life of me now make up my mind as to how delicate these discussions were.  When I see the results, in so far as eggs are concerned, the only delicacy is in the result upon those who are engaged in the poultry industry.</P>
      <P>In 1947, I happened to be discussing with the British Ministers subjects such as those we are discussing now. When we were discussing poultry and poultry expansion, I remember saying to the British Minister of Food:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is no use in our spending money now in an effort to expand this industry unless there is some reasonable prospect of continuity in the matter of price, such as would yield to the producer a fair profit having regard to the cost at which feeding stuffs will be available.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that agreements are agreements. I know that one cannot make a Government or a Minister responsible for tacit understandings on particular matters.  One can only talk <Col N="1969" /> about what is in a particular agreement. But it is no harm to examine the background behind the expansion effort and compare it with the announcement of the price that has been secured as a result of recent talks.</P>
    <P>About the same time that I was over there in 1947 our friends, the Danes, were there too.  They were discussing prices with the British Ministers for the same commodities which we had to sell.  We were assured by the present Minister for Agriculture of the Republic of Ireland that he would be on a different plane altogether when meeting his opposite number across the water.  Plain and common and unnoticeable as we were in the days when we were discussing prices, almost side by side with the Danes, we somehow managed to get more than the present Minister has got.  We got that &ldquo;more&rdquo; and we brought it back here.  I have here speeches made by the present Minister for Agriculture and by the Leader of the Fine Gael Party then to the effect that we had succeeded in placing the poultry industry on a sort of home assistance as a result of our efforts.  We were only common, ordinary men&mdash;not Ministers of the Republic of Ireland at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The new Republicans came along and clarified our international status.  They assured us that everything would be all right in future, that we would no longer live a lie and that our hens and chickens would lay twice as many eggs as they laid before. Yet, back in 1947, we were able to secure advantages for that industry that were described then as &ldquo;placing the poultry industry on home assistance.&rdquo; How, I ask you, could those to whom responsibility was so suddenly and so unexpectedly transferred from the point of view of the public meet those British Ministers?  The British were really trying to give us an advantage; they gave us an advantage over and above the Danes.  Why did they do that in 1947?  They did it at a time when the accusation was made that Fianna Fáil were too proud to meet the British Ministers. That accusation was still made during <Col N="1970" /> the war years when some of those who now carry responsibility wanted to force us into the position of begging from the British in circumstances in which they would naturally request that we should do something else in return. They wanted to humiliate us then.  We went over there after the war notwithstanding the many statements about the unwisdom of our policy during the war by those who now carry responsibility. The British met us in 1947 and treated with us, plain and all as we were.  There were then no splashes in the English papers about drowning the British with eggs or roasting them with something else.  There was no nonsensical talk about fly-by-night customers, about how we should treat those who had been frequenting our business house all down the years. Without any of these flashy, big black headlines, we were able to get from the British in 1947 something that the Danes could not get.  What happened since?  Are we not entitled to be told what happened?  Are we not entitled to get from the Minister an account of what happened since?  I do not know whether it was the Danes did the business for him, but I think he had resort to a considerable extent to the assistance of his own civil servants, as well as to Danish co-operation.  We had discussions, delicate or otherwise, in 1947 and we got more than the Danes.  I do not know that any Minister is entitled to keep information from the House as to why we could not get more now than the Danes are getting.</P>

      <P>The Minister in opening his speech on the Estimate expressed the opinion that if Deputies would only be careful in the statements they made in this House, it would have a very beneficial effect.  There is no doubt that is a true statement, but how the Minister for Agriculture should have seen fit to make it was what surprised me.  I was always of <Col N="1971" /> that opinion myself, and when I look at the egg and poultry scheme, and think of the background behind this development effort as I saw it, when I see what is happening to-day in spite of the assurances we obtained from the Minister&mdash;that he was going to announce a two-year policy, that he was going to keep producers informed two years in advance of the prices they would get, that from the very moment a chick picked its shell, in fact immediately the chick came out, the Minister for Agriculture of this Republic could say: &ldquo;If you happen to be a laying chick you are going to produce eggs that will be worth so much in two years' time&rdquo;&mdash;I am driven to the conclusion that the Minister's promises offer a strange contrast to his performances.  The Minister who gave these glowing assurances and who the other day expressed the view that it would be a grand thing if Deputies would only be careful, in 1947 ranted around the country denouncing us for making such an agreement.  Now the same gentleman, who by the grace of God if not by the will of the people occupies the position of Minister for Agriculture, when confronted with these statements, withdraws and explains that he did not know the background.  Withdrawals and explanations in that belated fashion are of no use.  While I can sympathise with the Minister in inviting Deputies to be careful in their statements, I feel constrained, when looking back on my 27 odd years here, to recall that many a time I listened to Deputy James Dillon making statements that I felt were sure to do us a grave national injury.  Many a time I expressed secretly to myself the very same thought that he expressed the other day, and I only wish that these sentiments had been fully accepted in former days by those who came in here to engage seriously in doing the country's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now come to pigs and bacon&mdash;pig's cheek for the Irish and subsidised bacon for John Bull, as Deputy James Dillon, when in opposition, used to say.  The Minister for Agriculture now tells us that he would be delighted to see the <Col N="1972" /> Irish consumer charged 5/- a lb. for back rashers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>When I think of all the ranting that went on about pigs and bacon since the present Minister came into office; when I think of the glowing future that we were told lay before us &mdash;maize to burn, pigs roaming round all over the place, an export market for our surplus bacon&mdash;and a profitable one at that&mdash;enough bacon at home for everybody at the right price and no word about a scarcity of back rashers, no recommendation to eat pig's cheeks because they were good enough for John McCormack and James Dillon&mdash;I am again amazed at the change in the Minister's attitude.  Even the poorest man in Ireland might have tastes far different from the Minister for Agriculture, who has to live on the paltry allowance of £1,500 a year after income tax has been deducted.  He might have a taste for a back rasher when the Minister might wish to get pig's cheek.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But what happened to this unprecedented opportunity?  What happened to these unprecedented advantages that were secured for us under the 1948 agreement and that have resulted in our sending a few cwts. of bacon for a while without a subsidy?  Lo and behold, after a few weeks there was a draw on the funds of that detestable organisation, as the Minister for Agriculture used to term it, the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  There was a draw on the funds of that commission about which we used to hear so much.  Commissions, controls, Fianna Fáilism, 15 heinous years, 15 years of corruption, 15 years of squandermania!  We cannot <Col N="1973" /> but remember all that has been said here along these lines and all the glowing promises that were made&mdash;lashings and leavings of bacon for everybody, back rashers included; bacon for export; the means with which to acquire the goods we needed here; remunerative prices; maize at £1 a cwt.; everything lovely in the garden!  After a couple of years, the Minister for Agriculture, who spoke so loudly and for so long about Fianna Fáil commissions and so forth, had to go back to the Fianna Fáil commission that is still in existence, the Fianna Fáil commission that had accumulated certain funds, and get this Fianna Fáil commission to subsidise the price of bacon which we had for export and which could not be sold without a subsidy.  I would point out to the House that that subsidy was not taken from the general taxpayers and it is on that point that I protest most, because if a subsidy of any kind is called for, it should be a subsidy from the national Exchequer and not one drawn from the pockets of those who produce the commodity, the sale of which on a foreign market has to be subsidised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>You never know; there may be circumstances in which that has to be resorted to.  I am not ruling that out.  I am not expressing my opinion on the principle and certainly I would not say off-hand that I would not believe in doing so and so and so and so.  Apart altogether from the principle of subsidising exports, look at the condition of the pig and bacon business now.  There is complete and absolute chaos in that business.  There was never the slightest approach on the part of the Minister to remedy that position.  I understand that a deputation of bacon curers at one time&mdash;and maybe others, too&mdash;approached him and they decided they would tell him why they were there.  It is not many who came to him who were allowed to tell him why they were there&mdash;his attitude was that he knew more than they who came to discuss any particular matter with him knew; that it was only a <Col N="1974" /> waste of time to be listening to a man who has come to tell you something which you already know yourself, and the Minister's way of saving time was to say: &ldquo;Gentlemen, I am very glad to see you.  I know why you are here. I will tell the story.  Here is the answer.  You may go home now.&rdquo;  That is excellent.  Of course, I should say that he is only an underpaid man who has offered himself as a sort of sacrifice to agriculture, who has dragged himself out of business, come from across the counter and said: &ldquo;Agriculture is in a depressed condition.  Here is the bacon business about which I know everything.  I am a bacon producer.  I have been a bacon curer.  I am a bacon wholesaler, retailer and consumer.  I know all about the business and, therefore, boys, you have nothing to tell me and you may go your way.&rdquo;  As a result of his enormous knowledge of that bacon business and of the way in which he has treated it, there is not a man on God's earth&mdash;certainly not in this little earth of ours&mdash;who knows where he stands in relation to this business, from top to bottom.</P>
      <P>Just consider the state in which this business is down the country and along the Border and see what is going on there and what, apparently, will continue to go on.  It has been a convenience from the Minister's point of view, I agree, in a way.  It will not always be a convenience.  It will become an inconvenience.  When I think of the condition to which this trade has been reduced by a Minister who, if he ever claimed anything, claimed to know all about it!  This was really the one business in regard to which at all times he held himself up as a person who could put it on its feet if only he could get to the position where Fianna Fáil meddling with it would be brought to an end!  Having now been in that position for two and a half years, he can only export the surplus bacon for sale by going to the very institution which Fianna Fáil had established and drawing on the fund which had been built up by the producers.</P>

      <P>I have here a quotation of a statement which he made at Skibbereen on 6th June, 1949.  He made the same statement at Cavan but I have not the quotation.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Dillon said that one of his constituents in Monaghan had remonstrated with him and asked him to prevent what he called `suckers', but what the people of Connaught called `bonhams', from being smuggled over the Border.  When he asked why the young pigs were being smuggled, his constituent said: `Twice the price here was being paid.' &rdquo;</P>
      <P>They were going the other way at this particular time apparently, although it would be difficult from the statement to know which way they were going.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I said to him, so long as they are prepared to pay us two prices for suckers we will let them have all the suckers they want,&rdquo; said Mr. Dillon. &ldquo;I have no objection to one sucker paying two prices for another sucker.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That statement was inviting somebody to commit an illegality.  After all, I put down a question on this matter here.  I wanted to know why it was that the Minister saw fit to employ preventive officers along the 300 miles, roughly, border between ourselves and the Six Counties in order to prevent farmers, traders or others from exporting pigs to a market in the Six Counties in which they could get £12 10s. 0d. to £13 per cwt. for pork, produced from feeding stuffs sold in the Six Counties at 18/- a cwt.</P>
      <P>I wanted to know from the Minister why it was that we were obliged to pay men to prevent these people from taking their pigs to that profitable market.  I was told by the Minister that there were only two centres, which he mentioned, in which the British Ministry of Food would accept bacon and pigs from us.  That is what he told me in this House.  If that is true, why did he say, in several public speeches, that one sucker could export another sucker as freely as he liked so long as he would give two prices for it?  I saw that speech which was made in Skibbereen and read in the local papers a speech made in my own county dealing with the same matter in the very same words.  In view of these statements, could you blame some of those who are attempting to take pigs across in order to sell them in that market? They are being brought before the courts, charged with the offence, although the Minister for Agriculture says that he has no objection to one sucker taking another sucker across, if he gives two prices for the sucker.</P>

Was he within the law, as Minister, in advising <Col N="1977" /> people who were smuggling pigs, even if they were taking two prices?</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister the question as to why he was preventing people from selling pigs recently.  I would not mind but it is costing us a considerable sum of money to maintain these staffs along this long land frontier. Why should we pay them to prevent our farmers from getting from the market that is at their door 50/- to £3 a cwt. more for pigs than they could get at home?  It is not fair to those who regarded the Minister as being a man in authority, as head of the Department.  He knew the law.  He knew what was the policy of the State. They said: &ldquo;if we have that advice from him, we are naturally entitled to take it.&rdquo;  In recent weeks the Minister's best political friend has been brought before the court.  I admit that the charge against him was dismissed because it was found that he was within only 30 yards of the Border, and the district justice very sympathetically and very considerately stated that there was a good deal of room for doubt.  Most of the local people, who have a good knowledge of the circumstances there, are aware of the fact that poor neighbours of my own, in the poultry trade, and otherwise, who attempted to take poultry across the Border over the last three or four years, in our time, had their lorries confiscated.</P>

      <P>I have pleaded with the Government that, where an ordinary citizen is induced by a statement of the Minister to do something which is afterwards found to be illegal, and when a charge is dismissed against him, the State should consider&mdash;not <Col N="1978" /> only in the case I have referred to, but in all cases&mdash;paying adequate compensation to the individual concerned for the inconvenience caused.  Knowing the sympathy and understanding that there is for the individual concerned in this case on the part of people who know the facts intimately, I felt I was voicing their opinion in urging the Minister for Finance to make adequate compensation to him and to the many other people who have paid stiff fines for attempting to do the same thing, not only in relation to pigs, but in relation to poultry as well.</P>
      <P>The Minister would do no harm to anybody if he explained to the House and the country what has become of the large and growing market for pigs and bacon which existed in Great Britain and of which he assured us in his Estimate last year, and why it is that our surplus, in so far as we have any, could only be sold recently by the payment of the subsidy to which I have referred.

      <P>In so far as the Minister has a policy at all, it has resulted in <Col N="1979" /> his making a dour prophecy that one business had already closed down&mdash;we are informed since that that was not correct&mdash;and that there was a prospect of another doing likewise.  These would be interesting matters for the Minister to deal with when he is concluding.  My advice may not be worth anything, but I would advise that, in future, there is no use in telling farmers and producers that you will drown them in maize meal at £1 a cwt. if in a few weeks' time the cost is 30/-.  There is no use in having them switching from day to day &mdash;from advice to grow their own foodstuffs to an assurance that you will lash in imported feeding stuffs at ridiculously low prices and so on.  I was never associated, as the Minister claims to have been, with the bacon-curing business.  I am not engaged in the wholesale or the retail business but, at the same time, I know that if you want to do something tangible and effective about the bacon business you will not do it by talking about suckers and the sale of one sucker to another sucker at two prices, or by going down to your constituency and promising maize meal at £1 per cwt.  You will not increase the pig population by bringing about a situation in which you import barley from Iraq and sorghum from Queensland.</P>
      <P>You will not achieve the purposes which you allegedly set out to achieve when speaking on the Estimate last year, desirable and laudable as they are, by any of this flamboyancy or wild talk.  I should like to hear from the Minister in this regard, just as in the case of milk production and cattle breeding, an outline of a reasonable policy and not this talk about telling his good friends, the bacon curers: &ldquo;I will build a State factory right beside every private proprietary concern,&rdquo; when everybody knows that that was only bluff.  You will not make progress by throwing out your chest and threatening to build a State bacon factory beside every proprietary concern in the country, because those who own these concerns know that that is bluff and they are sure to call it, with the result that the public will merely laugh at you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you want to make progress in this <Col N="1980" /> regard, you will have to change and there is evidence that that is happening. The Minister is becoming a nice, mild and placid man compared with what he used to be.  He can sit and take it fairly well now and that is a great thing.  I can imagine how hard it must be for the Minister to listen to anybody but himself and it is a great pleasure to me to see that I have disciplined him to the point that he has been able to remain here for a fairly long time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>With regard to the land rehabilitation project, we do not know a great <Col N="1981" /> deal about it, so far as its operation is concerned.  The Second Stage discussion of that Bill took seven hours and the Minister, having decided that he had been very polite and courteous to the House in introducing it, apparently came to the conclusion that there should be no discussion at all, that we had no duties as an Opposition.  In one interjection during the seven hours' discussion of a Bill which provided for the spending, if words mean anything, of £40,000,000 of borrowed money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That Bill is an Act and discussion on it is over.  I want to bring the Deputy back to the fact that we are discussing the Minister's administration of his Department and not what he said during the discussion of that Land Rehabilitation Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what I was proposing to discuss, but you will admit, Sir, that one has to get into one's stride.  What I meant to discuss was the administration of the land project, the discussion of which was described in that fashion by the Minister, and to say now that I am very pleased that, even though it is only recent, the Minister has changed his attitude towards this House.  It is a wonderful advance.  When we discussed the operation of this measure, the provisions of which we cannot now alter or amend, I was somewhat suspicious that, in the administration of Part II, things would not work out as rosily as we were given to understand they would by the Minister.  I must confess that I am still in doubt about some of the things that may be attempted under Part II.  As I say, we do not know much about it.  I can only see that there is a great deal of money being spent on staff, organisation and machinery, and it seems to take a very long time to get Part II into its stride. If the sums of money the Minister has given are likely to be expended upon the rehabilitation of land under Part II, I am still very doubtful whether or <Col N="1982" /> not we could not more usefully apply some of that money.  I have the notion that, when rehabilitation work is undertaken by a State organisation, it is going to be very costly.  I am not thinking of the contribution which the farmer has to make at all.  When you give civil servants the impression that you have enormous sums of money to spend, they can make a great showing by building up a costly staff and organisation which does not justify the effort and the expense.</P>
      <P>As far as that part of the land project is concerned, I want to warn the Minister that he should be very careful as to the sort of work undertaken. He should make sure that the cost per acre will bear some reasonable proportion to the value the community will get from land reclamation.  There is a tendency for people to leave the land and get away, especially from small holdings in backward places or heavy land where the overhead expenses are high.  I fear that under this land project if we deal with any substantial area we will be dealing in an expensive way with land that will be hard and costly to maintain and that we may not get the value we hoped to get from it.  That is something the Minister and his Department must keep in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us come to Part I of the scheme, which provides an excellent opportunity for landowners who want to do the work themselves.  Having made that statement, I want the House to realise that I have some criticism to make of Part I of the scheme in its operations as I see them.  When we were discussing the Bill, I expressed the view that this was like the farm improvements scheme.  The Minister rejected that view.  Of course, that was a Fianna Fáil term and was not swanky enough. We had to have the &ldquo;land rehabilitation scheme&rdquo; or something noisy and loud that would smother the feeble and petty approach made by Fianna Fáil to the problems confronting the landowners. I did not mind that, as that is part of the Minister's style.  I knew that when Part I came into operation it would prove to be more or less like the farm improvements scheme, except <Col N="1983" /> that the contribution to the landowner who did the work was 25 per cent. greater under it.  There are parts of it to which I would take exception.  I tried to explain that the scheme as operated was top heavy.  There may be a reason for this.  I feel I am justified in making this charge that it is top heavy, because when officials get in charge that is what they do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The remarks I am making are in no way directed against the Civil Service or the Department of Agriculture. Officials, whether local or national, would do what I think has been done in the operation of this scheme and I am about to show the way in which I think it is operated. When I as a landowner apply under Part I, my application is sent on and reaches the district headquarters.  It is sent out to the local man, who inspects the work which I have proposed in my application form to undertake.  That part of it is all right; but why he does a number of things to which I will refer now is something that we should know, as I see no reason for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He apparently goes back to his office and starts to produce a map of my holding&mdash;not of the work which I have proposed.  He will not prepare the ordinary type of estimate we used to get under the farm improvement scheme, setting out the work, so many perches, and so on, keep a copy himself and send the other to the farmer. He actually prepares a map of the holding&mdash;roads, bridges, fields, drains and all the rest&mdash;and sends it to his district office, where two, three or four other fellows start to produce more maps, about three, which have to be separately produced.  One is sent back <Col N="1984" /> to the farmer, one is retained in the office and one is sent to the overseer, the inspector or the supervisor.  The result is that for every day spent in the country by an overseer two and a half days have to be spent in the office. Even after that, the office staff in the district office is larger than the staff engaged in the country.  What is it all for?  What is it hoped to achieve by this preparation of maps and all the rest?  If a farmer makes an application to have an acre of whins or rubbish dealt with&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is a fact that in some districts the outdoor staff has had to be called in by the district office in order to enable them to complete the work.  If the Minister is not aware of that, it is he who is the Rip Van Winkle and not Deputy Aiken.  I want some information as to why this has to be done in such an expensive fashion.  There may be justification for it.  Those who think there is not&mdash;and they are very many&mdash;should know what the reason is because, when people come to a conclusion that something is mysterious, if they are told why it is done they say: &ldquo;After all there is something in that; maybe it is all right.&rdquo;  Therefore I not only want information on this matter but I want the Minister to keep an eye on it.  I know that in saying that most of the effort is being spent on the office instead of on the country I am saying something that is known to be fact by thousands.</P>

      <P>The farm buildings scheme is being operated.  I addressed some parliamentary questions to the Minister on both these schemes in the last couple of weeks.  I really was anxious to find out because of my knowledge of the deep-seated prejudice of the present Minister against anything that originated in the mind of his opponent.  I have not got all the information to which I feel I am entitled and which I would like to get.  I have no fault to find with anything I know about the administration of the farm buildings scheme, except that I think that it is treated by the Minister and his Department&mdash;to use a country expression&mdash;with the cold breath of a step-mother.</P>

      <P>I want to be assured of that because I genuinely thought so&mdash; perhaps unjustifiably as we are not always just to one another in the conclusions at which we arrive.  The Minister for Agriculture is one man who, I suspect, has a deep-seated prejudice against anything designed by his opponent.  I would not put it past him in certain circumstances to treat it in a manner not in keeping with the treatment meted out to the land project which is an entirely different matter.  All those who work on these <Col N="1986" /> schemes, who are employed by the State, are all of equal importance and should be treated alike.  I have no evidence but only suspicion that this might be the case.  If the Minister has any such prejudice he had better mend his hand before he commits himself because when he commits himself he is hard to move.</P>

      <P>It is all very well for the Minister to show concern for the Irish consumers.  Every time the subject of <Col N="1988" /> tomatoes and tomato-growing is discussed here, the attitude of the Parties supporting the Minister and who approach him privately is a plea on behalf of the consumers of tomatoes in Gloucester Street and similar streets. I will make this point in regard to that attitude.  I suppose it is fair to say we all have an interest in the consumers who live in Gloucester Street, in the Gloucester Streets of this and every other city, but if the Minister is terribly concerned about the price at which they will get tomatoes, is it not a strange thing that he does not show the same concern for making 75 per cent. flour available to them as it is being made available to the people who are able to buy it at the existing price?</P>

The consumers in Gloucester Street might find the ration of butter not adequate for themselves and their families and they might like to buy an extra pound, so long as they know we have a surplus that we cannot sell, even to our friend John, without a subsidy&mdash;at least, according to the statement made by the Minister.  Would they not think it a desirable thing to get an extra pound of butter above the ration at the ordinary price?  Would they not like to get additional sugar?  These poor people whom we would all like to see getting everything at a low figure would, no doubt, like some additional sugar.  I understand that sugar, from the point of view of the working man and his family, is one of the most essential items.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>One would not know who controls anything now.  The Minister tells us that he would like to give these people cheap tomatoes.  I say that these same people would like to get cheap sugar, butter, flour and oatmeal and other items that they now cannot get an additional supply of unless at an inflated price.  The Minister says that he will not afford any protection to an Irish industry that has grown in 15, 16 or 17 years, but I would like to emphasise that it is a very desirable industry to develop here.  I admit there is something to be said for the Minister's point of view, and much to be said about the desirability of cultivating a greater taste for tomatoes and making sure they are available at reasonable prices.</P>
      <P>As an agriculturist, I cannot accept it as wise policy that the Minister should charge the House and his own Government with imposing on the agricultural community £700,000 in relation to the boot and shoe industry, which the Minister claims is being borne by the agricultural community, while at the same time he silently permits a section of the community to be treated in that fashion.  When it comes to a question of affording the necessary protection for an Irish industry in which good employment is given, and when the Minister is challenged with not taking action with regard to the saddling of Irish industry with this £700,000, he retorts: &ldquo;Would you close down the boot factories and the tanneries?&rdquo;</P>

If he refuses to take effective steps to rid the Irish farmers and their sons and daughters and workers of a burden like that, and if he asks me will I close the boot factories and the tanneries, by way of reply I put it to him: why should he, as Minister, not afford to this industry the same sort of protection as enabled Irish capital to develop the boot and shoe industry? Why should we not be allowed to develop the tomato-growing industry?</P>

      <P>I have read the comparisons made by technicians, as to our climatic and other conditions, with the conditions that prevail in Holland.  It must be admitted that if we can do anything at all we ought to be able to produce all the tomatoes we need.  We were making progress in that direction, as in the case of the boot and shoe and other industries.  It involved some expenditure and somebody had to pay for it.  But if we have to pay for the boot and shoe industry in the way in which the Minister has charged, why should not the tomato growers demand that those who act for them will see to it that the policy that has resulted in the expansion, in an industrial sense, will be applied in relation to their business, and the Minister will not allow any deep-seated prejudices of his own to influence him in deciding national policy?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is an effort to get the Minister to face up to the situation in <Col N="1992" /> regard to this 5 per cent. stamp duty. Deputies will remember that this particular tax was brought forward in 1947 as part of a scheme to provide moneys for the subsidisation of foodstuffs. It was an effort to take money from a point in the economy in which there was inflation and to use it to reduce the cost of living and so prevent an inflationary spiral due to an increase in the cost of living causing greater wage and salary increases, these increases again adding to the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Over a long number of years the stamp duty on the transfer of property stood at 10/- per cent.  That was put up to £5 per cent. and the Minister at that time opposed the increase very vigorously.  He recently admitted that he did not remember he opposed it.  As a matter of fact, when I was referring to it on the 3rd May this year on the Budget statement, Deputy MacEntee, at column 1671, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Would it be in order to ask the Minister if it is a fact that, when this stamp duty was first introduced, he opposed it?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply was:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not remember.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is strange that the Minister did not remember.  This stamp duty was not put on 16 or 18 years ago.  It was put on only a couple of years ago.  The Minister had to study this particular section of finance legislation because he has introduced several amendments to it.  He has, even in this particular Bill which we are discussing, introduced further amendments in order to tighten it up.  The Minister does not remember now that he opposed it, but when it was under discussion in the Dáil in 1947 the Minister, at column 1072, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It means there will be a rise in the already swollen prices paid for houses.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If it meant, according to the Minister's view in 1947, a rise in the already swollen price for houses, does it mean that to-day, and is it to secure a rise in the already swollen price for houses that the Minister has introduced it? If the Minister was convinced in 1947 <Col N="1993" /> that that would be its effect, he surely has a very short memory if he forgets that such a disastrous consequence was likely to flow from a tightening up of legislation designed to secure the 5 per cent.  The Minister was not the only member of his Party, or of the group of Parties associated with him, who opposed this 5 per cent. very bitterly. The Taoiseach, then Deputy Costello, at column 1065 said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I believe that this additional taxation will merely result in making house property dearer and the provision of houses for people who have only limited means impossible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Was the Taoiseach talking with his tongue in his cheek when opposing the 5 per cent. stamp duty at that time? Did he really believe that it would make house property dearer and the provision of houses for people with only limited means impossible?  If he was not talking with his tongue in his cheek when he expressed those sentiments, is it for the purpose of making houses dearer, and for the purpose of making the provision of houses for people with only limited means impossible, that his Government is now promoting the amendments to the Stamp Duty Act which are designed to secure that any loopholes that were in the original legislation should be closed?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture intervened&mdash;he was then Deputy James Dillon&mdash;and he also expressed dissatisfaction at the increase in the stamp duty.  He expressed his dissatisfaction in his usual exuberant fashion. He called it &ldquo;a landlord's tithe&rdquo;; he called it &ldquo;a dirty fraud&rdquo; and &ldquo;a dirty deceitful game, a piece of flat-footed incompetence,&rdquo;&ldquo;a shuffling and coltish way of dealing with the problem.&rdquo; He went on to call it &ldquo;a dirty wrangle,&rdquo;&ldquo;a vicious and mean jab at those who were defenceless.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am glad that I have succeeded in getting some of the Deputies who are supporting this Coalition Government on this particular measure <Col N="1994" /> into the House because some of them may prove so bold as to speak their minds on this particular matter.  A number of them were at one time of the same mind with regard to this 5 per cent. stamp duty as was the then Deputy Dillon.  They, too, like him, regarded it as a &ldquo;dirty fraud,&rdquo; and &ldquo;a dirty deceitful game,&rdquo; and so on.  We would like to know from them now if they have changed their minds in this matter.  Do they still regard it as &ldquo;a dirty fraud?&rdquo;  If they so regard it, why are they supporting the Minister for Finance in imposing it upon the country?  Have they any respect for the opinion the present Taoiseach then expressed?  He said it would make houses dearer and houses for people with limited means impossible.  Do they still believe that?  Is that the reason they are supporting the Minister for Finance now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance cannot sidetrack the issue by saying that he did not remember opposing this particular stamp duty.  I told him that I would remind him of his attitude in the past upon the matter at the conclusion of his Budget statement.  I did so remind him on the Second Stage of the Finance Bill.  He has had time in the interval to look up the matter.  He must know that the quotation I have given is accurate.  He must know now that he then believed this stamp duty would cause a rise, to quote his own words, in the already swollen prices being paid for houses.  Is the Minister for Finance satisfied that the costs of houses to those who are looking for them are so low that it is no harm to cause a rise?  Will he now admit that his opposition to the 5 per cent. stamp duty was purely fraudulent?  The purpose for which that stamp duty was imposed was clearly and carefully explained at the time.  The members of the Dáil were asked for their co-operation. The co-operation of those who are now supporting the Government was sought in order that we might successfully grapple with the then inflationary pressure and do something tangible towards reducing the cost of living.  The money that was gained as a result of the increase in stamp duty was applied directly to a reduction in the cost of living.  The Minister, in his <Col N="1995" /> answers to recent parliamentary questions, has quite clearly shown that that policy was effective.  He has quite clearly shown that the increase in stamp duty and the other moneys collected under the Supplementary Budget of 1947 had the effect of reducing the cost of living between the autumn of 1947 and the spring of 1948. There are a number of Deputies here who were at that time promising a much greater decrease in the cost of living than the Government of the day thought the taxpayers could afford. Some of them actually promised 30 per cent. reduction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>My opinion has already been stated on this particular matter. <Col N="1996" /> It would be interesting for the House to have the Minister's opinion on this matter.  It would be particularly interesting to have his opinion on the opinion he expressed about this matter in 1947.  It would be interesting to have his opinion on the opinion that the present Taoiseach then expressed and on the opinion of the present Minister for Agriculture when he described the stamp duty here as &ldquo;a dirty, contemptible, vicious and disedifying proposal, well worthy of the mind of the Minister for Finance who has conceived it and, to my way of thinking, a disgrace to the House that adopts it, a confession before the world that there can survive here a meanness of spirit that was unknown in this country in the darkest days through which our people had to live.&rdquo;  There, the Minister for Agriculture, then Deputy Dillon, was expressing in his own inimitable way the opinion of all the members of the present Coalition Government.  It is all very well for Deputies on the Government Benches to smile now and to say that they will not have to face the people for another couple of years.  Even if the people's memory is short, I think they will retain some recollection of the complete <i>volte face</i> in the opinion and attitude of the Coalition Government on this particular matter.  It is not as if the Minister were short of cash. The Minister feels that he can raise about 50 per cent. more cash for public expenditure than the previous Government felt they could raise.  He has, as everyone knows, adopted a very facile way of raising money; he does not have to raise it through taxation. He does not have to ask the taxpayers of this year to pay for the expenses of Government.  He can postpone it.</P>

      <P>The Minister, of course, will have to tell the House, if this amendment is carried, how he will raise the money otherwise.  I think that it is really too bad that the Minister feels that he can browbeat, not only his colleagues on the Front Bench into supporting him without any explanation of his change of front but that he also feels that he can also browbeat all the other smaller groups into supporting him in this regard.  The smaller groups that have made possible the election of this Government have been all against the imposition of taxation of any kind.  They have been very much against the imposition of this tax.  They were going to borrow all the money that was required for government&mdash;some of them were going to print it&mdash;but now they are prepared to stand behind the Minister in raising money in this way.  It is no harm to remind them that the Minister himself, even though he does not now remember it or has conveniently forgotten it, <Col N="1998" /> was very much opposed to this particular matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not had at any time given any explanation to the House as to why he has changed his opinion.  It is a matter of some moment because many hundreds of thousands of pounds are being raised in this way.  People who have to pay this tax will be very dissatisfied unless the Minister can explain to them that it is absolutely essential that the money should be raised in this manner. It is bad enough for the person who has to pay a 5 per cent. stamp duty to fork out the cheque the Revenue Commissioners may demand from him, but it is worse if there is not a word of explanation from the Minister as to why the money should be raised in this way.  No one wants to see the price of houses increased.  If the Minister is of the opinion that the continuance of the stamp duty will add to the price of houses, he should tell the people why he wants the price of houses raised.  The Taoiseach also, I think, should intervene in this debate to explain to the people why his Government is attempting to make it impossible for people of limited means to buy their houses.  We all know, of course, that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance in 1947 were talking with their tongues in their cheeks. If they had given any study to the matter they would have realised that the effect of the duty would not be what they were prophesying it would be.  As a matter of fact it has had a completely opposite effect from that which they then foretold.  However, if the inflationary situation which this stamp duty was designed to meet has passed&mdash;and the Government's actions in the matter of raising funds for Government expenditure show that they believe, or at least that they are prepared to hold that it has passed&mdash;I think this stamp duty should be dropped.  It was never meant to be permanent.  It was meant merely to cope with an inflationary situation.  The methods by which the Minister has sought to maintain this stamp duty, <Col N="1999" /> while he was acting completely in opposition to the spirit in which it was introduced, has driven the Minister to all sorts of expedients.  He has given the Revenue Commissioners additional powers exceeding anything they have ever had&mdash;power to refuse to give a clear certificate to anyone paying the duty, lest they might discover afterwards that he was subject to a higher duty.  Deputy Little has already referred to that on the Committee Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not and I do not propose to discuss it.  I am only saying that the methods by which the Minister is attempting to collect this particular duty, in face of what he said about it in the past, are anything but desirable.  If the Minister would drop this particular duty at the present time, he could allow the Revenue Commissioners to give a clear certificate to lawyers and others that they have paid their stamp duty fees.  That in itself would be a very desirable outcome.  Not only did the Ministers I have already quoted oppose the stamp duty when it was being imposed but the Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke at great length on it.  He opposed it very vigorously and he wound up by saying: &ldquo;I can see no case, good, bad or indifferent, that can possibly be made for this increase.&rdquo;  He said he could see no case, even after he had been listening for days to the case made for it at that time.  If he could not see any case for it then, he certainly has made no case for it since.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance are asking the Coalition Deputies to walk into the Lobby to support the Minister in the absence of any case being made for the continuation of the stamp duty at the present time.  I think that that is not only bad administration of the Department of Finance but bad government.  It should be explained to the people why the Government feel that the particular duty should be imposed.  They all have collective responsibility for it.  One of the promises the Taoiseach made was that <Col N="2000" /> the Government would act in the spirit and the letter of the Constitution in regard to collective responsibility.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if the Minister could not see his way to accept the whole of this amendment, I should be glad if he would let the House know whether he himself would not introduce an amendment and make a concession to a certain degree.  If he cannot see his way to reduce the £5 to 10/-, perhaps he could go at least some of the way towards meeting the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though he could not relieve the transfer of all houses from the 5 per cent. duty, perhaps he could see his way to relieve new building, that is, building taking place at the present time or that will take place during the next couple of years, of the burden of the 5 per cent. and allow the 10/- rate to apply there.  The people of the country are spending a great deal of money on housing.  We know the only way the housing shortage can be relieved, other than by mass emigration, is that a number of new houses should be built.  Even if the stamp duty were left on old houses, houses built two or more years ago, it would be an encouragement to people to get ahead and build new houses for sale if the duty were reduced now to 10/- on new houses built.  The duty was aimed largely, as was explained at the time, at the transfer of old houses from one person to another in a period during which the prices were going up by leaps and bounds.  We all know that in 1947, houses changing hands within a few months had very much increased in value.  There was a real gain for some speculators to come in, buy houses and re-sell them within a couple of months.  That particular sort of transaction was killed by the stamp duty.  Now that the supply of building materials has improved, more new houses are becoming available and there is not the same demand for the old houses that went to famine prices in 1947.  The Minister, I think, could very well, from the point of view of getting more new building and getting <Col N="2001" /> it rapidly; reduce the £5 to 10/- in regard to the new houses, as I have indicated.  I hope that when the Minister is concluding the debate on this particular amendment he will give the explanation I have asked for.  I have reminded him exactly of what he said when the stamp duty was first being imposed.  I think the House and the country are entitled to know his present attitude, to know whether he really meant what he said in 1947 and, if so, whether he is carrying on this particular duty irrespective of the ill-effects which he then foretold simply in order to get money.</P>
    <P>We all want to see the Government collecting the amount of money that is necessary to run the country but we want to see it raised in ways in which it would have the least possible ill-effects. It would be a grave hardship if houses were made dearer, as the Minister foretold, by a £5 duty of this kind.  If the Minister is still of that opinion, he should seek to repeal that particular duty.  If he does not believe it, well, then, it is a different matter. At any rate, an explanation is due from the Minister as to his attitude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The remarkable thing about this duty is that if the House were free to vote on it there would be an overwhelming majority against it. Strong objection has been taken, not merely to the duty but to the way it is being imposed by, I may say, certainly the whole of one section of the legal profession, solicitors and the Incorporated Law Society.  Members on the Government Benches made fairly effective speeches in dealing with it last year.  Still the duty remains now purely for financial purposes, without regard to public interest or to respect for the law.  The hardship to people buying houses is obvious.  You will not get any sort of a decent house for people with modest means under £2,000.  Just think of the duty on a £2,000 house, at the rate of 5 per cent.  According as the price goes up, it runs up to a big sum for, say, a young person in clerical employment.  For a member of the professional classes, who would pay perhaps £5,000 for a house, the duty would be £250.  It just makes all the difference for a person who can scrape together a certain amount of <Col N="2002" /> money and who can get loans up to a certain proportion of the price of the house to have to meet the price.  It becomes impossible for him when a duty of this kind has to be paid.  The fact that the Minister has already remitted it in Section 16 of the present Bill indicates in a factual way that he believes what he originally said, that this duty is a bad tax.  It was quite justifiable as an emergency tax for a year or two but, as a continuing tax from year to year, it is just a bad tax. The Minister was pretty shy when I asked him to give a clear exposition of Section 16 the other day.  He said it was obvious on the face of it.  He might have told us how much the Revenue Commissioners anticipate will be the loss on the remission given in Section 16.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a remission of the 5 per cent. duty and I am arguing from the remission to the 5 per cent. duty.  It remits the 5 per cent. duty where public bodies and utility societies are involved and it is an indication of a dawning sense on the part of the Minister.  I would like to encourage him to go farther now that he has gone that far.  It has, of course, obviously led to the legal profession, in protecting their clients, evading the law.  I mentioned the other day that evasion of the law on the part of lawyers. Lawyers are supposed to be officers of the court.  It is their duty to stand over the repute of the law and if they go in for evading the law it brings disrepute upon the law.  The Minister, in reply, said that lawyers would starve if they did not spend their time evading the law.  That brings one back with a shock to the kind of cynicism that existed in this country before we got our freedom, when lawyers were unfortunately subject to an attitude of mind which was entirely foreign to the country or to our instincts, who simply were in the law for what they could make out of it without any reference whatever to the public interest.  It was exactly that attitude on the part of the lawyers which inspired Pearse with such hatred of the cynicism attaching to the law at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2003" /> That, I hope, will be shaken off because, not merely does it bring the law into disrepute but it is also economically bad for the country.  Fair bargains make good friends and knit society together properly and if our legal leadership breaks down that sort of confidence people have in contracts, and so on, and if evasion of the law takes place, obviously it will have a bad effect on business.  If that standard is set, it leads to what the Americans call the shyster lawyer who, departing from the law and evading the law, drifts into the position of being able to defend criminals and to create a criminal class.</P>
    <P>The effect of a tax like this is that each year the Minister must bring in what you might call Draconian measures to stop the gaps.  There were clauses brought into the 1949 Act. Section 27 was one which covered about four printed pages.  That was the first time, I think, in which powers were taken by the Revenue Commissioners to set aside the effect of the adjudication stamp.  That was one of the measures which was consequential on this evasion of the law and it has given a dictatorship to the Department of Finance which they can enforce.  It is true that here and there you get a sub-section where the commissioners take power to remit the penalties if they like, showing that they have complete power in the matter.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to say that the Revenue Commissioners are very sensible men and will not enforce their powers or impose unfair penalties.  If, by any mistake or chance, the particular document is not stamped in time, the duty can be doubled and in case of the 25 per cent. duty&mdash;which, of course, does not arise in this section except as being consequential on what I am saying&mdash;you would have to pay 50 per cent. of the whole price of the house as penalty.  The thing is simply fanatical and it is not at all uncertain that some time or other you might not get a Revenue Commissioner who was fanatical enough to impose such hardship upon the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>It arises in this way, that these Draconian measures follow the evasion and the evasion arises out of the fact of the hardship of the tax. There is the difficulty for lawyers, when they are taking part in the transfer of property, of not being certain that it is only the 5 per cent. and not the 25 per cent. that might have to be paid.  The Incorporated Law Society made representations, sent deputations to the Minister and have done all that one could reasonably expect from them. They cannot go on strike.  They cannot start a revolution.  They cannot do anything that is unconstitutional.  They are officers of the court.  In their attempt to defend their clients and also to preserve sound conveyancing they have done all in their power to try to bring reason to the mind of the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister, himself, has two views on it.  When he was free to express his view, he was against this tax.  At present he is in favour of it.  I suggest to the Minister that he should meet the profession as far as can be done when this Bill comes before the Seanad, reduce this tax as much as possible and, at the same time, remove those clauses which are putting a blister upon any transfer of property.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea in the amendment is simply to restore the position where the tax was 1 per cent., or, as on the scale below £500 under the old Act, in the case of an Irish citizen, and to leave the 25 per cent. in the case of a foreigner.  There is an objection to the tax in regard to Irish citizens disposing of property at home and that objection is threefold.  It is objectionable from the point of view of the individual citizen.  It is objectionable from the point of view of public policy.  It is objectionable from the point of view of the legal profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this tax was initially proposed, all these objections and points of view were advanced.  It causes me a certain amount of amusement when I recollect that on the occasion that this tax was <Col N="2005" /> introduced by the then Minister for Finance objections were voiced by some of us who were supporting the then Government equally with the present Minister, who was then in opposition. Although I seldom find myself in agreement with the Minister, that was one of the occasions on which, on one point at least, we were in agreement, because it was foreseen both by him and by some of us that the particular system would stimulate evasions and lead to consequences objectionable from the public point of view.</P>
    <P>What exactly is the position?  I have said that there were three objections. The objection from the point of view of the individual citizen is that it is, in effect, a tax on his property which comes into operation if it has to be disposed.  It is a tax which affects the value of his property, because if a person is going to bid £1,000 for a house and knows at the same time that he will have to provide, as the purchaser, £50 for tax, he will take that into account and will reduce his bid to £950. It, therefore, has a reducing effect on the value of the property to the vendor or owner.  It is, therefore, as a first point, objectionable as a tax on the value of property to the individual.</P>
    <P>It becomes particularly objectionable when one recollects that for many small people, people who are not in the opulent class, people who are in fact in a relatively struggling way, one of the main ways of saving, one of their assets, an asset to be there for their dependents if anything should happen them or after their death, is the purchase of a house.  A house is a very important part of the property of such small people and this is a tax which hits them severely and which comes into operation at just the critical time, when it is desirable to realise their assets by selling or when the house has to be sold after the death of a father to secure money for his dependents.</P>
    <P>A number of arguments can be advanced from that point of view and there are other arguments which can be advanced from the point of view of people looking for a house to buy. The young married couple are frequently mentioned in this connection, but there are many people who, when getting married, regard the purchase <Col N="2006" /> of a house as one form of investment which is something in the line of an insurance as well.  Apart from the difficult problem of securing accommodation, there are often strong arguments for buying a house, if they can. Here straight away the State steps in and by imposing this tax makes it more difficult for these people and, as they would be the purchasers, it works out that it taxes them at the critical time, at a time when we should be encouraging them instead.  It is a peculiar thing that in many ways we encourage the development of families. The Minister himself administers a code where relief is given in respect of children for income-tax purposes and there is also the system of children's allowances.  While we do that, here is a case where we tax the setting up of the unit of society, the family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>And the &ldquo;we&rdquo; is very appropriate in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with this objectively, without following the Minister on that at the moment.  The &ldquo;we&rdquo; I will explain in a moment, too. In regard to the individual, it is a tax which, unless there is strong justification for it, should not be imposed. From the public point of view which is the second objection, a code of this nature stimulates ingenuity towards evasion, as was pointed out when the tax was introduced.  I think I remember the Minister saying across the House to me when I mentioned that a number of ways of evading it could be found: &ldquo;Do not give them away,&rdquo; but the point is that there were evasions, as has been proved by the very introduction of the section last year and the section this year and as anticipated by anyone with experience of the business, evasions induced by increasing this tax to a point which made it considerable, so considerable that it was worth while seeking methods of evading it.  Then with the inherent difficulties of making any such provision watertight, as the tradition of our law lies, it was manifest that such legislation would provoke these attempts at evasion, would provoke distinctions and would result in loss to the State through evasion and loss to the individual <Col N="2007" /> through legal costs in particular cases and to complication and difficulty in administration, quite apart from the repercussions on public morality, even though it is not considered immoral to evade a tax.  These are the objections from the public point of view and they, too, are substantial.</P>
      <P>In all these circumstances, such a tax should not be imposed, unless there are very strong reasons for imposing it, and these reasons should be something more than the expediency of raising money, since money can be raised in other ways.  It requires something more than a need for funds on the part of the Minister to initiate such a tax or to maintain it.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke of &ldquo;we.&rdquo;  The point is that, in 1947, when this tax was imposed, there were two specific reasons, apart from the need of the then Minister to finance the subsidies on the foodstuffs which were then subsidised, to justify this tax.  Some Deputies, including the present Minister, even in face of these reasons, did not think them sufficient to override the reasons I have already given.  The Minister of the day did, but, in any event, there were these two reasons to be given and let us see the force of these reasons at present.  The first was that, after the removal of certain controls, in the unstable and excited situation that naturally followed on the cesser of hostilities and the apparent start of a move towards normality, there was a tendency to speculative dealing in property.  There was a tendency on the part of some people to speculate and purchase property and to have property changing hands with profit to the negotiators at any particular time.</P>

    <P>That situation was aggravated by the attitude of some more cautious people who had brought property earlier and who felt that perhaps this might be the time to get out and by the very definite shortage of accommodation, due very largely to the influx into the City of Dublin, coupled with the fact that, owing to emergency restrictions, building had been practically at a standstill during the war.  All these circumstances conspired to make it desirable to put some curb on the transfer of property <Col N="2008" /> and naturally a tax of this nature, a tax on transfer, would suggest itself and it had something to commend it in these circumstances.  That was the view of the Minister at the time and much could be said in its favour, as it was said then.  Therefore, in that regard it resolved itself into a question of whether that need plus the need for money, was a stronger argument than the arguments against it.  People to this day will have differences of opinion on that but what I want to urge on the Minister is that, whatever weight was to be attached to that argument in 1947, the same weight does not now attach to it, if any weight at all does attach to it.</P>
    <P>In fact, on the Minister's own showing, the only case that can be made for the tax at the present moment is that he requires the revenue.  No case can be made from the point of view of a tax on the individual.  No case can be made from the point of view of public policy, as in the working of it it has actually been proved that there are pernicious aspects associated with it.  There is no reason in regard to the speculation in property, as the price of property has fallen to more normal levels and no undue speculation is taking place.  These reasons do not apply.  Take all the arguments together and assemble them and ask the Minister to take his own arguments, which may surprise him.  However, to keep this on a purely objective plane, let us suppose we take it that his arguments at that time were sincere.  Let us take his own arguments with the arguments now advanced and ask him what is the case for keeping it on.  It is no answer to me to say: &ldquo;You put it on.&rdquo;  We did, under another set of circumstances; and even if the Minister said that we put it on and we were wrong, and even if we were wrong, it is no answer to the case now for removing it.  It is no justification for the Minister to say that we put it on, whether we were right or wrong, if it is wrong in the present circumstances to keep it there.</P>
    <P>Those are the main arguments for removing this tax.  The argument in regard to the 25 per cent. tax is not really relevant to this amendment, except in so far as it explains the form in which the amendment is proposed, <Col N="2009" /> and it is relevant to that extent.  The point is that this amendment leaves the 25 per cent, there on the non-national. At that time, there was a good deal of talk, again from the Minister and his Party and associates, as to the danger arising from the purchase of land in this country by persons from outside. That danger was represented as being of very great magnitude, by people on both sides of the House.  Since the change of Government, some Minister&mdash; I forget which, perhaps it was the Minister for Lands&mdash;has said that there is no serious buying up of property by non-nationals.  Be that as it may, at the moment the Minister is not being pressed to remove that tax.  There may be still a case for keeping the 25 per cent. tax there on non-nationáls, although perhaps it even more than the 5 per cent. tax gives rise to an attempt to evade the Acts by all sorts of legal artifices.</P>
    <P>The essential thing is that here we have an annual Bill in which the Minister is free to revise this matter and for the second time he is forced to complicate an already complicated code because he wishes to close a loophole where he knows that, even as it is, evasion is going on.  Everyone who knows anything about it knows of certain cases, the Scotch case and the English case, which have been more or less tacitly followed here, and evasions of the spirit of the tax by the device of two agreements in certain cases. That has been acquiesced in actually by the stamping authorities.  There is a further difficulty arising from the alterations in respect of adjudication, and so forth.  All these things are piling up.  There is a dissipation of effort and of the community's money and in the last analysis unnecessary costs.  It results in a certain flow of money to the Minister, which, while considerable, is not of such huge magnitude that the Minister should not be able to compensate for it in abolishing the tax.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in all sincerity and as objectively as one can do it, conscious of the past, conscious of the arguments that have been advanced, conscious of the Minister's present difficulties, conscious of all the facts of the case, I <Col N="2010" /> think one can urge and press on the Minister that now is the time to restore the position in regard to transactions in property amongest nationals at home to the position obtaining before the Finance (No. 2) Act was passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 16 has been brought into the argument, not on the amendment but probably in relation to it.  There is no loss on Section 16. It was never intended to catch the particular type of transaction, that is now exempt, under the Finance Act of 1949. The reason for relief&mdash;the relief was always intended to be there&mdash;is that the consideration paid for the houses acquired from the bodies mentioned in Section 16 was always the actual cost and there was no profit on the transaction at all.</P>
      <P>On the amendment proper, Deputy Little has called this a harsh and oppressive tax, as driving a lot of lawyers to the position where they may shortly be described as shyster lawyers. When the Deputy resumes his practice, as I suppose he has, and when this goes ahead in the inner lawyer's circle, he ought to be made president of the shysters' association, as it was he who put on this &ldquo;harsh and oppressive&rdquo; tax.</P>
      <P>I know Deputy de Valera wants to deal with the point objectively and is thinking of the past&mdash;but certainly he was thinking of it rather hurriedly and put it from him as quickly as possible. No one on that side of the House can speak with any sincerity about the removal of this tax.  It was put on by them.  Deputy de Valera&mdash;transferring his remarks into language that will be understood&mdash;means: &ldquo;We of Fianna Fáil operated this peculiar device; while we were administering a code intended to give relief to families through family allowances, we were at the same time taking an opposite course and preventing the provision for families by this oppressive tax.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree that lawyers are necessarily shysters because they think of ways, perfectly legitimate ways, around taxation.  We expect lawyers to do that and we meet them on each Finance Act and try to mend the loopholes <Col N="2011" /> they have found.  No one can say they are acting in any immoral or dishonest way.  Deputy Little has used the word &ldquo;shyster.&rdquo;  Deputy de Valera does not agree, but it is Deputy Little's phrase that I am borrowing in this argument.  The lawyers are perfectly entitled to do that.  They have found two ways&mdash;probably there are others&mdash; and in so far as they make any great hole in the tax we will take steps to meet them year after year.  We do not do it restrospectively: they get for their clients the benefit of the good legal advice they gave on the particular methods they adopted to find a way around the phraseology of the Act.  I do not think there is anything wrong in that&mdash;I have been in the legal profession&mdash;that they should do this and I think it is absurd for the Deputy to use the language he has used about them.</P>
    <P>With regard to the main argument of the effects that it is producing for us here, the tax&mdash;so I am told by the people who put it on&mdash;has bad social repercussions, is bad from the angle of the individual and is bad nationally.  It was all these things when it was put on.  I assert that it has less of these things now, as the circumstances have changed.  I wish that Deputy de Valera, in a cooler moment, would read his own speech to-night and I think he would realise that he uses a good deal in the way of argument that fortifies the application and continuance of the tax, that could have been used to damn the tax when first put on.  He said that hostilities have ceased, that there is an approach to normality, but there are speculators around and house property is very scarce, that it is because house property is scarce that the speculation has started.  House property is no longer as scarce as it was. There are houses idle.</P>
    <P>In those days, the situation being that house property of a particular type was scarce and that people who wanted houses could be held up to ransom by the owners of houses who wished to sell them, I objected to the tax on the grounds that it was going to be transferred to the purchaser. That was the case in those days but it <Col N="2012" /> is no longer the case.  The case which is now supported by Deputy Vivion de Valera and Deputy Little was made in 1947 on the No. 2 Finance Act in these words by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Aiken, in column 1070 of the Official Report of 29th October, 1947:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think 5 per cent. is enough.  In other circumstances, if there was a bigger inflationary trend, perhaps the right thing to do would be, as Deputy McGilligan suggests, to go further. But I think 5 per cent. is enough at the moment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then I interrupted&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To cheapen houses?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;and he replied:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Not to cheapen houses&mdash;to get money from the vendors of houses.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In column 1916, on 13th November, 1947, the then Minister for Finance, winding up the debate, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is the vendor whose price is going to be reduced by the 5 per cent.  The 5 per cent., instead of going into the vendor's pocket, is going to go into the pocket of the Treasury.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Remember that that is the result which was claimed for the tax in those days when house property was scarce and house property was changing hands quickly.  It was the man who had bought the house at a high price who could hold up the purchaser to pay a high price.  In the situation now, without the slightest doubt the 5 per cent. is going to come from the vendor.  I am taking it from the Excheuer.  It transferring it to the Exchequer.  It may have been believed but I did not credit it then; I did not think it a likely result in those days but circumstances have changed.</P>

      <P>I made that interruption to the Deputy to try to make him say what he said on that tax.  I argued that that tax was not going to be paid by the vendor.  That was the gist of the argument used by myself, the present Taoiseach and the then Deputy Dillon, but circumstances have changed.  Go around the city and you will see houses of the £5,000 type billed <Col N="2013" /> at less than half that and they do not find a purchaser.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed it is not because of the tax.  There are other circumstances.  That situation having arisen in which there is a superfluity of house property of a certain type, there is no danger that the tax will be paid by the purchaser.  There was not merely the danger, but almost the certainty, that it would be paid by the purchaser in 1947.  That is my reason for continuing it.</P>

      <P>If I am asked to give the money back to those vendors who held the purchasers up to ransom and then burned their fingers later I say that there is no case for giving it back.  The case is made that it is imposing a hardship on purchasers but I do not believe that is the case.  I believe it was the case in 1947.  I gave £6,000,000 back on the taxes on beer and tobacco and having given those remissions I do not see why I should be expected to give £480,000 back to the vendors of houses.  I do not propose to give it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with the attitude of the Minister and the Government to the tomato industry, and I had shown, in so far as I went, that while the Minister for Agriculture apparently disapproved entirely of the industrial policy of the Government, he invited me to say if, in certain circumstances, the agricultural community were burdened, as he claims, to the extent of £700,000 in relation to one industry, what I would do if, by changing that policy, factories manufacturing boots and converting cowhides into leather were to close down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not speaking here as one who claims to know a great deal about the tomato-growing business; I am merely speaking as one who looked upon that industry and its development as very suitable in a country like this.  I have been endeavouring to show that so far as I know there is nothing exceptional in our climatic conditions or in the general circumstances in which tomatoes are grown here except that we were admittedly backward, and because of our history it followed almost as a certainty that we would be backward and that it was going to take a considerable time to bring us into line with other countries whose history is different from ours.  It was because of these facts that my predecessor and myself endeavoured, in every way we could, to encourage that business and to induce our people to put their money into the development of that production.  It was in order to extend these activities that the Gaeltacht scheme was mooted.  I have the feeling that the Minister for Agriculture is, as I have claimed, a man of deep prejudices.  He is a man who, once he commits himself, cannot be induced to change his mind.  Every Deputy can remember the sudden way in which he expressed his opinion upon the Gaeltacht experiment.  In fact, he gave us to understand that the whole scheme was going to be abandoned.  At least, he gave us to understand that that portion of it, dealing with the erection of <Col N="2017" /> houses, which had not matured was being abandoned, but apparently pressure was brought to bear upon him and this scheme was allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>Now, here is an interesting story. The Minister has flung across the House at me the price that is now obtainable for Irish tomatoes.  I have been drawing attention to the fact that we imported last year £250,000 worth of foreign tomatoes, and that, as a result of the manner in which this desirable development was being treated by the present Minister for Agriculture, those engaged in the business saw fit to come to Leinster House one night to see Deputy Dr. Ryan and myself.  I think, Sir, that if the records of this House are looked up, it will be found that for the last 2½ years I have not tabled one single Parliamentary Question dealing with this matter, and if I have not I had a reason for not doing so.  I will tell the House what it was.</P>
    <P>On the night that those gentlemen came to Leinster House, I happened to be engaged elsewhere.  That has not happened to me very often, but I did happen to be engaged that night and Deputy Dr. Ryan met those gentlemen. I joined them later.  I did not know what had transpired or what case they had made, but, immediately on my arrival, one of the members of this association said to me: &ldquo;We want you to raise in the Dáil some question such as so and so concerning tomatoes,&rdquo; and proceeded to outline what was in his mind.  I suppose what was in his mind could be taken as representing what was in the minds of all those who were with him.  I said: &ldquo;My friends, I will do no such thing.&rdquo;  I said to them: &ldquo;If you are really interested in having this business of yours looked after by the Minister, as I think it should be, and as I think it deserves to be, I warn you not to get me or my likes involved on your side, or on the side of the case that you are making because, as sure as I raise a question in Dáil Éireann about the tomato growers and the manner in which they were treated last year and identify myself with them, then so sure will that seal the fate of any case you have to make because,&rdquo; I said, <Col N="2018" />&ldquo;immediately I do so, the Minister for Agriculture will seize upon the opposite view, whatever it is, and being a man who can certainly muster words and arguments to justify any course, you will there and then reduce this whole effort, which is a desirable effort, to the point in which it will become a political wrangle as between myself and the present Minister for Agriculture.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have said that, if the records of the discussions in Dáil Éireann since the change of Government has taken place are looked up, there will not be found in them a single solitary question from me as to what was happening in the Gaeltacht or elsewhere for the reason that I believe, whether rightly or wrongly, that my doing so would have had an injurious effect on matters of development in which I was keenly interested.  I suggest that, irrespective of political feeling, and irrespective of the lengths to which political prejudices can be carried in one form or another, and making due allowance for the charges that I have made in this case, the Minister for Agriculture is a particularly bad victim of deep-seated prejudice towards the views of his political opponents.  I say it is not a good thing for Irish industry or for Irish agriculture that the present occupant of the Ministry of Agriculture should behave in that fashion.  I may not like the present Minister for Agriculture or he may not like me, but for the life of me I do not see why that fact should be allowed to interfere with the development of a business like this.</P>
    <P>If I know of anything that is suitable to our people and to our climate&mdash;it has been found suitable in other countries&mdash;and if we have been backward in producing it in the past, then I think that, at some point, we should be prepared to pay the price to overcome that backwardness and so get out of that rut, in the same way as we have aimed at producing the leather, the boots and the shoes which our people require.  The present Government pretend or they announce &mdash;I withdraw the word &ldquo;pretend&rdquo;&mdash; and they certainly claim that an industrial policy of development is a desirable policy.  I approve of and I agree with that, but I want that applied not <Col N="2019" /> only to boots and shoes but to other aspects of our economy.  The position anyway that was reached was this, that I had honestly to go before those men, not in a public way but in a private way, and I had to admit to them&mdash;I did not know what their political views were, I am sure most of them were people who had no sympathy at any time with the political views which I have held&mdash;in a room in Leinster House that if I were to identify myself with them in urging a particular case or in urging a particular development, that my advocacy of that would have been enough to kill it, having regard to the prejudices of the present occupant of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>All that I will say on that matter is this: if the present Minister for Agriculture wants to ride the horse of the poor people who want tomatoes, let him ride that horse as long as he likes and whip that horse to death in making that claim.  He may be as interested as any of us in the poor.  I am sure he is interested in seeing to it that they can get the things we all can get.  But there are other things of which, apparently, national policy has deprived them now.  If the Minister is right in concluding that the farmer and his worker and his worker's children must pay more for their boots, then there is something to be said in favour of giving reasonably adequate protection to an industry that has developed surprisingly over the last ten or 12 years and that is just on the threshold to far greater things.  In relation to that, as well as in relation to other matters, we shall make far greater progress when we succeed in eliminating the prejudice that has grown up in the last two and a half years and which influenced the making of decisions that can now be reviewed in retrospect and the effects of which can be clearly shown to have been disadvantageous to the people as a whole.</P>

      <P>I was amazed to find one item in the Book of Estimates, an item I thought had long ago disappeared out of the Book of Estimates.  It refers to an enterprise about which the present Minister for Agriculture does not like to hear very much.  I was amazed to find provided in the Book of Estimates a sum of £4,528 for the payment of salaries to a number of temporary flax inspectors employed by the Department <Col N="2021" /> of Agriculture, subsequent to our being given to understand that the Department of Agriculture, over which the Minister presides, had long since abandoned this policy of flax growing.</P>

      <P>If, on their abandoning this policy, they had decided to send home these temporary flax inspectors, who, up to then, had been moving about West Cork, Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal telling the farmers to grow flax, how to grow it, the way to rett it and how to handle it, there might have been some sense in it.  The growing of this crop had been denounced by the Minister repeatedly when challenged by me and others as to the manner in which he, as the spokesman for the Irish producer, had conducted the negotiations with the customer in relation to the price at which we would dispose of it.</P>

      <P>I think I am.  What is the purpose of spending £4,528 on the payment of salaries to inspectors for inspecting the growing of a crop which the growers have been repeatedly told they should not grow.  At the same time as we are spending this money in paying inspectors to roam around the areas I have mentioned, certain instructions have been issued by the <Col N="2022" /> Department of Agriculture, ever since the failure of the Minister to negotiate a suitable price last year; the Garda Síochána have been kept very busy in Monaghan, for instance, ensuring that the notices relating to pollution and the penalties provided therefor by the law are exhibited prominently in all those areas in which the farmers normally grow flax in order, I suggest, to discourage them.  The Minister for Agriculture tried a bit of bluff with the Northern spinners in a fit of bad temper.  Finding that the bluff did not work he did not, as he has not done in several other matters, step down.  The bluff was called.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister tried to bluff and the bluff was called.  The Dillon pride was greater than the concern the Minister had for the flax growers.  He has pleaded, as he pleaded on so many occasions: &ldquo;Sure, I did not want to hurt the flax growers of Monaghan; sure, I did not want to hurt the flax growers of Cavan and Donegal and West Cork; sure, it was not my intention to injure them in the least.&rdquo;  The attempt was made to pull off the bluff and, when the bluff did not work, it was followed by the little fit of pride.  The Minister went down to Scotstown and he made there a speech which he has repeated here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister went down there advising the farmers not to grow any crop for which there was only one customer.  That was very peculiar advice coming from this particular Minister, the Minister who has so often told us in the past that we have really only one customer of any importance for our agricultural produce and that he was not really interested in what he very gently, very politely and very courteously described as fly-by-night customers. It seems extraordinary that he should have told the growers of Monaghan that they should not interest themselves in the growing of a crop for which there was only one customer, <Col N="2023" /> that they should engage in the production of other cereals and root crops, that they should convert these into something that they could walk off the land, and that now, when some of them have taken his advice and are walking them off the land, they are being prosecuted because they acted on his advice in taking these animals across the Border.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to tell the House why this amount is being provided for flax inspectors in view of the attitude which he has adopted.  In 1946-47 the amount provided for this service was £4,147, in 1947-48, £4,331, in 1948-49, £4,488, in 1949-50, £4,690 and the estimate for 1950-51 is £4,528.  That is to be paid out to temporary flax inspectors who, according to the policy of the Government, are supposed to be employed in supervising, advising and helping those engaged in the growing of a crop in which the Minister has no confidence and the production of which, by his statements and activities, he has done everything he possibly could to ensure would be discontinued here.  So far as I can find out in most other countries to-day for one reason or another the growing of this crop is encouraged. I cannot for the life of me see&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may think that that is a very neat sort of question. Does the Minister believe in the policy which he is pursuing himself? If this is an item for which he is asking the Dáil to vote money why does he not get up and say: &ldquo;I am justifying this item, as I believe in the wisdom of growing flax because I see opportunities for it, because, as Minister for Agriculture, I shall take the responsibility of trying to secure the highest possible price and because it is my duty to do that,&rdquo; rather than take up the attitude he has repeatedly adopted in this House, that he accepts no responsibility whatever for this crop, that he will have nothing to do with the Northern spinners, that he objects to their accents, that because of their accents he will have nothing to do with them, that he wants the same price for flax as is being paid to <Col N="2024" /> Six County growers as a result of the subsidy that is being paid out of the Exchequer of the Northern Government? How can he defend a demand for the same price for flax growers here as is being paid to flax growers in the Six Counties if at the same time Northern egg producers are getting 4/1 per dozen for their eggs while our eggs will be worth no more than 2/- per dozen in 1951?  Why not make the same case in regard to eggs as he is making in regard to flax?  Does not the same objection in regard to the growing of flax hold in regard to eggs? Is it not as clear as amber that this whole ramp of the Minister, in regard to flax, was the result of his disappointment when he was trying to wring a higher price from the Northern spinners?  I do not blame him for trying to get a higher price, but when he failed, instead of accepting his failure and trying to make the best job of it, he starts off and asks growers who want to grow flax as long as&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>They want to grow flax as long as there is a market for it, and there is a market for it.  Do we not know that if there is official hostility to the growing of a crop, if we have a Minister bringing in an item like this for which he will have to provide and at the same time ashamed to mention the fact, and wanting to use his position as he has used his position to discourage the growing of that crop, that will have a detrimental effect on the growing of flax?  There are people down the country whose politics are so deeply-seated that they will be influenced to an enormous extent by the attitude taken by the Minister in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Just as men have been induced to smuggle pigs across the Border on the advice of the Minister, so too will growers who wish to grow flax and who have been growing it when there was a reasonably good market for it, be influenced by the Minister's attitude.  I cannot see what justification there is for having this item here unless we have coupled with it a readiness and a willingness on the part of the Minister, who asks us to vote this sum to pay these men, to justify its being here and <Col N="2025" /> to show how much he is behind the effort to grow flax.  I say from the information I have obtained in most countries in Europe where flax has been grown in the past, that the growing of flax is being encouraged.</P>
    <P>There is not, I suggest, from the admissions which we have had from the Minister, the same long-distance security in relation to any crop, as far as price is concerned, as would entitle the Minister to stand up in this House and denounce flax growing as a wartime crop.  It has paid for a good many years now; the price is not too bad yet and there is a prospect that that price will continue for some time. Other countries are encouraging the growing of flax.  Certainly, if on the one hand we are providing money for the development of its production in the areas in which flax is grown, we should have some degree of consistency on the part of the Minister who is asking us to vote that sum.  Whatever little slips he may have made in the past in regard to this business, however objectionable these men who met him from the Six County spinners' organisation may have been, he should now say to himself: &ldquo;I am going to continue to provide this sum so as to give growers whatever help and encouragement they may need and I want to tell you that next year I, as Minister, will conduct negotiations on their behalf with the spinners of the Six Counties and I will make the best case for the highest possible price.  If you are satisfied with the price I am able to secure, I will throw in whatever effort and moral encouragement I can give so as to expand the acreage while the price justifies it.&rdquo;</P>

Why do you not do your duty and see to it that if you are spending money in the development of this crop, there will be a reasonable return from that expenditure? <Col N="2026" /> It may seem a small matter for the reason that the cultivation of this crop is confined to West Cork, Donegal, Monaghan and Cavan.  Deputies from other areas may have no interest in it.  I have raised my voice in this House on this matter on a number of occasions because I think that of all the hopeless performances that have been given by the Minister for Agriculture in the discharge of his responsibilities nothing was so lamentably poor and hopeless as his handling of the flax situation.  I say, then, that there should be a change of heart.  I say that no Minister should be so big in his boots, as it were&mdash;no Minister who has admitted so often recently that he was knocking at the door for 15 years to get this job&mdash;that he will not climb down and admit he made a mistake. If a man canvasses so strongly to get a job like that he should not be so big in his boots that he will not climb down and admit: &ldquo;I made a bit of a <i>faux pas</i> here and, while I am here, I shall have to mend my sails and steer another course.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We are entitled to demand this change from him.  I mentioned here already, in the course of this debate, that there are other Deputies supporting this Government who must be interested in this flax growing, as I am, because they live in the area although, maybe, not so much in the centre of it as I do.  I should have thought that some of those Deputies who claim to represent farmers would have seen fit to bring that pressure to bear upon the Minister. No matter how difficult the man may be of approach, no matter how hard it may be to reason with him, still, he gave way on the Gaeltacht tomato scheme in the initial stages and he gave way in respect of a number of issues when pressure was applied.  I should think that it would be the duty of farmer Deputies, and especially those who support the Government and who claim to speak for farmers, to see to it, without any intimidatory effort at all, that a change would take place in regard to this matter, too.  The Minister for Agriculture may think <Col N="2027" /> and say what he likes in regard to this matter.  I know the constituency represented by the Minister fairly well.</P>
      <P>I think I know the constituency I have had the honour so long to represent, and its people.  I know that if many of his County Monaghan constituents were to speak their minds, if many of his most enthusiastic supporters and backers in County Monaghan were to speak their minds and exclude the political considerations which unfortunately often influence people in approaching a subject like this, if these considerations could be excluded, there is not one of them who has grown flax&mdash;whether Unionists, Protestants, Hibernians or whatever they may be&mdash;who would not agree 100 per cent. with every word I have uttered here.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister this.  He must admit and the House I think will have to admit that people who work on the land deserve to get some guidance as to what sort of business they can engage in with some degree of certainty.  These people deserve to be told that there will be continuity and that there will <Col N="2028" /> be a prospect of getting a reasonable return.  We have got only one assurance from the Minister.  He has dry stock, dry cattle, on the brain.  Mind you, cattle prices and cattle agreements are all right but cattle prices have fallen before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Never mind what I would love.  I am as interested in the price of cattle as any farmer is.  I have not so many but what I have mean something to me.  I am not a wealthy man who could afford to scoff at £1,500 a year, as the Minister does.  I cannot scoff at sums of that size which appear to be just a mere trifle to a man like the present occupant of the post of Minister for Agriculture.  Therefore, it would not pay me at all if cattle prices or anything like that should fall.  In addition to that, there is no prospect of my being able to get a living for myself and whatever family I have except from the land.  These few cattle mean something to me, even looking at this matter from the selfish point of view.  I am not so old but at the same time I have seen things happen before, in world conditions such as we are experiencing at present, as far as the cattle trade is concerned.  My suggestion is that it is not enough to give to the House, to the country and to agriculture in general an assurance for two, three or four years as to the price of dry cattle.</P>

We want to secure for those who are engaged in <Col N="2029" /> that business at least as much freedom as they require to develop along the lines they think will give them the best returns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We think that if freedom for the farmer is being lauded, as it has been by the present Minister, the farmers who produce milk should have, if they disagree with State policy, some system of official investigation to see whether or not something better could not be done for them.  In fact, we want to secure the implementation of the assurance we got here from the Minister when he was recommending the agreement of 1948 to this House in these words.  I quote from Volume 111, column 2587.  When the question arose as to whether that agreement could be discussed in this House in conjunction with the Estimate, the Minister, addressing the Chair said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is my impatience, Sir, to deal with them...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He was referring to the agreement, only the heads of which had been published.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...and to disclose their advantages which brings them to my mind. Let us be clear about it and, if we are to discuss their merits, I shall open the matter now.  If, on the other hand, it is decided to postpone discussion on that matter I must with reluctance await the pleasure of doing so on another occasion.</P>
      <P>An Ceann Comhairle: The Chair would like to know how far they cut across agricultural policy.</P>
      <P>Mr. Dillon: They create quite unprecedented advantages to the agricultural industry of this country.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is two years since the agreement that has been described in these words was presented to the House and the country.  We had from the Minister, when introducing this Estimate, an admission that bacon had to be subsidised, that butter could only be sold to our best customer carrying a subsidy <Col N="2030" /> and that, in fact, dry stock was the only matter in which we had any security at all.  I say that the farmers are entitled to have a clearer declaration of policy than that.  It is the Minister's duty to give the farmers that declaration, to give them some lead.  If the Minister is hesitant and refuses to give that declaration, it is surely the duty of those Deputies, who are supporting this Government, and who claim to represent the farmers, to put on the screw and to compel the Government&mdash; because this is a Government matter and not merely a matter for the Minister&mdash;to make that clear declaration.  If they are not prepared to make that declaration, how about the Minister for Agriculture, who has admitted that he is making such tremendous sacrifices to stay in the Department of Agriculture at a salary of £2,500, presenting himself before the farmers and letting us see what the farmers have to say as a result of the failure that has shadowed him ever since he took office?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, had tabled a motion to refer back the Estimate.  It is rather unusual for a Deputy supporting the Government to do so.  I feel, however, that the problem we have to face in regard to agriculture is of such grave importance that a question of loyalty to any particular combination of Parties or any other question should not be allowed to stand in a Deputy's way in presenting a case for a reform of agricultural policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had during the last few weeks a sorrowful tale of the depopulation of rural Ireland.  We have been told that the population in every area of rural Ireland has decreased.  The Minister himself, in introducing the Estimate, admitted that that is so. He admitted that the adult population of rural Ireland has fallen by over 50,000.  The only justification he could advance is that that fall had been steady over the period of the Fianna Fáil Administration and is still continuing. The question is, how are we going to arrest that drift of our entire population into the larger towns and cities and into the emigrant ship?  At <Col N="2031" /> present, more than one-fifth of our total population are crowded within a radius of five miles of Nelson's Pillar. It is possible, it is even probable, that in the next five years the world will be engaged in war.  It is probable that this capital city will be subject to atomic bombardment.  It is possible that one-fifth of the total population of this country may be wiped out in one night.  We must ask ourselves, even if that were not so, is it wise to have so large a proportion of the population crowded into one urban centre while the potential sources of the nation's wealth are left completely or mainly undeveloped?</P>
    <P>The case was made, in the introduction of the Estimate by the Minister, that there has been a very considerable increase in agricultural production.  I do not think, however, that the figures available to us justify that assertion. I have here the Irish Statistical Survey for 1948-49.  It shows that the index figure for the net volume of agricultural output in 1938-39 was 100.  During the war years, that output increased to as high as 112 in 1941-42, and was again as high as 112 in 1944-45.  In 1947, it declined to 98 and in 1948 it was 97. Last year, I discovered as a result of a question which I asked, it had risen to 102.  Therefore, we find that the net volume of agricultural output is 10 per cent. below what it was during two of the emergency years when, as we know, supplies of fertiliser and other raw materials for the agricultural industry were difficult to obtain.  That figure of 102 is 3 per cent. below the average figure for the whole eight years of the emergency period.</P>
    <P>I think that sufficient attention is not being given to this aspect of the problem.  Figures are thrown at us in various forms to prove what the Minister would like us to believe but we have the ordinary official sources of information whereby we can check those figures.  On the official statistics, we find that, while there have been increases in various agricultural exports, the total volume of agricultural production in the nation has not increased. That is the first and most important consideration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2032" /> I am one of those who supported the election of the present Taoiseach as head of the Government and the election of his Ministers as members of the present Government, on a ten-point programme which was presented to us, which included the promotion of increased agricultural and industrial output. I am not satisfied that really sufficient energetic steps have been taken to promote the increase that is required in agricultural output.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave a number of figures here showing the various trends of production.  These figures were confined to certain items of agricultural production.  They showed an increase in 1948.  These are the figures for the first quarters of 1947, 1948, 1949 and 1950, and, though they show an increase up to April, 1949, they show a decrease for the first quarter of this year in regard to egg production.  Egg production in the first quarter of 1949 was 1,848,000 great hundreds, and, for the first quarter of 1950, that had gone down to 1,683,000 great hundreds. Cattle exports for the first quarter of this year are below those of the first quarter of last year.  Thus we see that the 2 per cent. increase in output over 1938 which we have secured may not be sustained much further and there is very little likelihood, unless there is a more vigorous policy adopted towards agriculture, of our being able to reach the volume of output of 1942 and 1945.</P>
    <P>When we consider these facts&mdash;the reduction in the population-of rural Ireland, the failure of our agricultural industry to expand as it ought to in the present favourable circumstances, the decline in employment in agriculture and the low income of those engaged in the industry&mdash;most Deputies will agree with me that I am justified in asking the House to send back this Estimate for reconsideration.  No greater deception has ever been put over on the people of this country than the attempt during the past couple of years to represent the farming community as being rolling in wealth. The total income of agriculture is £105,000,000.  That is the figure given by the Minister in his Budget statement and it represents the total income of all the people engaged in agriculture. Divide that total income between <Col N="2033" /> 600,000 odd people&mdash;and some of them are perhaps very odd who remain in the industry&mdash;and you will find that the income of each person working on the land is approximately £3 5s. Od. per week.  That is not such a huge income and I am afraid the Minister has an entirely wrong conception of the prosperity and wealth of the rural community.</P>
    <P>Recently, in the Seanad, when dealing with a proposal which outlined a co-operative farm in which each person was able to earn the standard wage, plus a small bonus, the Minister said that that income was utterly insignificant, that he knew people on 30 acres who would laugh at such an income and who were able to drive into his town in their rubber-tyred traps, and some, he said, were even thinking of buying a Ford car.  I do not know what kind of Ford car a small farmer with a family would be able to purchase on an income of approximately £3 per week.  The Minister, living a sheltered life as he does, probably does not realise how the people who struggle on the land have to live.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to point out that, in putting down this motion, I am simply seeking to secure a real and drastic reform in agricultural policy.  Over the past 25 years, agricultural policy has been bedevilled by Party politics.  We had a so-called Fianna Fáil agricultural policy and a so-called Fine Gael agricultural policy and the farmers were the victims of that political wrangling in which there was no merit.  There was never any real sound basis of contention as between these two Parties in regard to agricultural policy.  It should have been possible for both Parties to combine in formulating the best possible agricultural policy, but that would not suit Party politics.  It was necessary for some people on the Fine Gael side to denounce wheat and tillage generally, and for other on the opposite side to denounce the unfortunate bullock, but the plain working farmer who was a supporter of Fianna Fáil went on rearing the despised bullock and the plain working farmer who was a supporter of Fine Gael went on growing wheat, beet and all the other despised crops.  The reason was that the farmer is a man of practical <Col N="2034" /> common sense and that his industry, his entire enterprise, has been hampered and hamstrung by the jealousies and hatreds between the political Parties.  I think it is time to end that.</P>
    <P>I was told in this House that I had publicly criticised the policy of the Minister for Agriculture because I had some personal ill-will against the Minister.  I want to disabuse the mind of every Deputy in regard to that matter.  I want to make it clear that I was reared in a home where the Minister's distinguished father was highly honoured.  Brought up in that environment, I came into this House with a very strong admiration for the personality of the Minister.  I have never completely lost that, but, from the very first day I came in here, I found myself in complete disagreement with the Minister on most questions of agricultural policy.  Almost before I was three months here, I found the Minister voting along with what he regarded as the hated Fianna Fáil Party against a motion proposed by me.  He has repeated that on a number of occasions.  Practically every proposal I submitted to the House was opposed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I do not know why that should be, but it is probably due to the fact that we have approached agriculture from different angles.  The Minister has approached it from outside, from reading about it; I have approached it from inside, having been born on the land and knowing what it means to produce crops and to endeavour to find a market for them.  It is necessary to state that in order that there may be no misunderstanding. I think it necessary to state that this motion, so far as I am concerned, has been put down with the definite intention of extracting, not only from the Minister but from the Government, a clear-cut declaration of policy designed to increase the output of agriculture, designed to bring about not a fictitious increase based upon the favourable world circumstances of the present time, but a real increase in the volume of agricultural output.</P>
    <P>I want to secure that there will be a real increase in the number of people gainfully occupied on the land and obtaining a decent livelihood there.  I <Col N="2035" /> want to ensure that the agricultural industry can face the future with a reasonable measure of security against the problems of the present day and the world conditions of the present day in which all nations are living in a state of dread and insecurity.  Is it not appalling to find the Minister for Agriculture, when introducing this Estimate, declaring that the production of grass provides more employment than the production of tillage crops?  The only place that I know where there are large numbers of people permanently employed pushing up the grass is in the cemeteries, but outside the cemeteries does not everybody know that the ploughing and cultivation of the soil, the rearing of crops and the feeding of them to live stock provides a great deal more physical employment than watching the grass grow?  Every Deputy, regardless of Party, should take serious note of that particular point.  The Minister quoted some figures, but they just go to prove that there are three types of lies&mdash;lies, damned lies and statistics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are serious, we will consider that there are three main lines upon which the improvement of agriculture must be sought and secured. The first is, to ensure that those engaged in agricultural production receive a reasonable reward for their work.  People do not leave the land for any futile or foolish reason.  A few will always venture forth into the wide open world, but the majority settle down in their own localities, provided there is an opportunity to live there. The first essential of agricultural policy, therefore, must be to ensure that the margin of profit in agriculture and the income of the individual farmer is sufficient to give him a decent living and enable him to employ <Col N="2036" /> workers and give them a decent living also.  That is the first essential.</P>
      <P>The second essential is that sufficient capital be made available for the development of agriculture.  References were made to developing the cement industry on another Vote and it was pointed out that a certain amount of capital was being set aside to expand the cement industry.  You cannot expand any industry without capital&mdash;yet it is the settled policy of the present Minister to deny agriculture the capital it requires for development.  The third essential to a sound agricultural policy is better technical education and assistance for those who are engaged in it.</P>
      <P>On the first and most important question, that of reasonable remuneration for those engaged in the industry, I have indicated how low the present general income is.  I have indicated how low the income of agriculture is if you spread it over the total amount of agricultural land in this country. Divided over the 11,500,000 acres, it gives an income of £9 per acre.  That is, roughly, for a 30-acre farm, £270, which is not a big income for a holding which has to support a family and provide some employment also in order that it would be properly worked.  To give an increased income, there must be such a price for each item produced on the farm as will give a reasonable profit to the farmer over his cost of production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we all know, during the years of the emergency a commission on post-war agricultural policy investigated this whole question.  Three reports were presented.  The first was in the nature of one of those vague and unrealistic statements which we get from time to time in regard to agriculture. The second and third minority reports made some attempt to get down to realities in regard to agricultural policy and they sought to outline ways and means by which reasonable prices could be secured and by which markets for agricultural produce could be safeguarded and stabilised.  Now to-day, we are not considering the post-war period: we are well into the post-war period and probably we are moving on to the pre-war period for the third world war.  In my opinion, we are not <Col N="2037" /> dealing realistically, and our Government is not dealing realistically, with the question of ensuring that a reasonable market will be available for agricultural produce at reasonable prices.</P>
    <P>One of the Minister's first acts on obtaining office was to proclaim from the housetops that he would bring into this country unlimited quantities of cheap maize.  I do not know how the Minister tries to reconcile that policy with the policy of &ldquo;one more acre under the plough.&rdquo;  It is very easy to chant that nursery rhyme: &ldquo;One more cow, one more sow, one more acre under the plough.&rdquo;  But you cannot expect farmers to go on putting one more acre under the plough year after year unless they are assured of a market for their produce; and you cannot assure the farmers of that market if you are prepared to allow unrestricted and unlimited imports of cereals of all kinds.  I think the Minister has never faced up to the full implications of that contradictory policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say: &ldquo;When I advocate `one more acre under the plough' I am advocating that farmers should plough an additional acre and feed the crops to their own stock.&rdquo; Does the Minister realise how silly such a policy is?  Why would any farmer till an extra acre to grow a cereal crop if he could buy as good a cereal on the market at a less price than he could produce it?  The net result of a policy of unrestricted imports is to drive farmers out of tillage.  Of course, the Minister realises that, and that is why he tried to make the case that grass provides more employment than tillage. One of the tragedies that have occurred during the last two years is that on the one hand farmers have been driven away from tillage and that, on the other hand, the Minister has been unable to carry out the promise which he made to them that he would give them unlimited supplies of cheap maize.  He discouraged tillage by holding out the promise of increased supplies of feeding stuffs and he was unable to fulfil that promise, with the result to-day that we have neither enough homeproduced feeding stuffs nor have we an alternative at a suitable price.</P>
    <P>We find that many of the branches <Col N="2038" /> of the agricultural industry which expanded during the period immediately after the depression have now begun to decline again, the poultry industry and others.  There has been a certain set-back which could have been avoided if our agricultural policy had been fundamentally sound.  The Minister may produce all the figures available to him in his Department to show that grass provides more employment than tillage, but I believe, and I think every sane person who knows agricultural conditions will realise, that the best system of farming, the system which gives most employment, the system which gets the most production from the land, is the system of rotational cropping.</P>
    <P>In that rotation grass may take its place, and an important place, but there must be changes of cropping over the years.  I have known many successful farmers well who have worked their land for many years and their fathers before them and who have got a very high output from their farms in all those years and whose farms are still in good and fertile condition.  The rotation was almost invariable: three years tillage crops; two years meadowing; three or four year of grass.  There you had a perfect rotation giving a change of crop which is beneficial to the health of the soil and which is calculated to ensure that if the land is properly manured it would yield the maximum output.  With such a rotation, if it were adopted all over the entire country, you would have a tillage acreage somewhat similar to that of the last year of compulsory tillage. Nobody has suggested in this House that compulsory tillage should be continued. The general feeling, I think, is that it had gone on long enough and that the time had come to give the farmer a free chance of producing the maximum from his land in his own way, but I think that everybody will agree that the removal of compulsory tillage should have been accompanied by a resolute effort to induce farmers by means of an incentive to keep the maximum acreage under tillage. Instead of that we find that since 1947 tillage has declined.  The area under tillage in 1947 was 2,300,000 acres; in 1948, 2,084,000 acres; in 1949, 1,903,000 <Col N="2039" /> acres.  You have a steady downward tendency which if it is continued must add still further to the depopulation of rural Ireland and a decline in the output of agriculture.</P>
    <P>I may be asked what the Minister could have done during 1948 and 1949 to induce &ldquo;one more acre under the plough&rdquo;; what he could have done to secure the system of mixed farming which I have advocated, the system of rotational cropping.  His first duty was to encourage to the maximum extent the production of both wheat and beet.  Those two crops are produced for human consumption and our country is capable of producing 100 per cent. of our needs of those two crops.</P>
    <P>We are living at a time when the question of imports from the dollar areas is becoming of a very serious magnitude. Surely it should be the Government's intention to restrict those imports as far as possible by producing within our own country our entire requirements of sugar and flour.  Instead, however, we have had very substantial imports of both those items as well as of other cereal products.  Over £10,000,000 was sent abroad, mainly to dollar areas, in the last year for cereal produce which could have been produced within our own country and we are in the humiliating position to-day of having to borrow the dollars to purchase those goods.  We are sinking our country into debt, importing goods which we could with an intelligent and well directed agricultural policy produce in our own country.</P>
    <P>I have indicated that we imported £10,000,000 worth of agricultural produce in 1949.  We imported 5,814,000 cwts. of maize valued at £5,500,000; we imported 2,588,000 cwts. of wheat, valued at £3,300,000; we imported 552,000 cwts. of sugar, valued at £906,000 and we imported 221,000 cwts. of barley, valued at £352,000, making a total of £10,000,000 worth of world produce which we could produce here and for which we had to borrow dollars.</P>
    <P>I have dealt in a general way with the various agricultural products of this country and with the various articles <Col N="2040" /> that were imported.  I intend to deal now in a special way with particular products of the agricultural industry. I will take oats as number one on the list and I take it very advisedly, because the Minister spent one hour upbraiding me for daring to mention oats in the House.  I will deal with oats fairly comprehensively, because I think I can claim to know as much about that crop as any Deputy.  I worked in the harvest field when I was seven years old and I went with corn to the merchants before I was ten.  I have known the whole process of producing and marketing oats for a very long period. I know the feelings of those engaged in the production of the crop, particularly when they have to cope with adverse weather conditions, and, worse still; with adverse markets.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, in column 605, Volume 119, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Deputy Cogan to talk to me about oats, Deputy Cogan, who deplored that oats worth their weight in gold were exported from this country!&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister thereby challenged me to dare to mention oats here and, because he has flung down that challenge, I will not for one moment avoid it.  I will go to the very root of this whole question.</P>
    <P>In 1948, compulsory tillage was in operation.  I mention this matter because this particular crop was on the Minister's hands during the past year and was marketed by him.  In 1948, the farmers were subject to compulsory tillage and, in order to comply with the tillage Order, it was necessary for them to grow oats in addition to other crops.  Apart from being compelled to grow oats by governmental Order, the farmers were appealed to to grow oats by the Minister in a special appeal over his name issued in March, 1948. As a result, a very substantial acreage of oats was grown and the yield was exceptionally good.  Knowing this, I asked the Minister, on August 4th, 1948, what were the prospects of a market for that crop.  The Minister replied most emphatically that he could assure me that the farmers would get a reasonable price for the crop, whether they sold it for cash or converted <Col N="2041" /> it into animal food; in either case they would be assured of a reasonable price.  I found, however, when the market opened, that the merchants were afraid or unwilling to pay more than a very inadequate price for the oats.  They were influenced in the main by a statement the Minister made that imported maize would be forthcoming in large quantities at a reduced price.</P>
    <P>I wrote to the Minister on 8th September, drawing his attention to the serious problem created.  I pointed out that there were a number of farmers who had oats over and above what they required for their live stock and for other feeding on their farms and that they found it necessary to market the surplus crop.  I asked the Minister to take some steps to ensure that they would obtain a reasonable price, particularly in view of the fact that he had appealed to them to grow oats and that, in fact, they had been compelled to grow it.  I pointed out, further, that there were numbers of farmers who, in order to benefit their own industry and help out the general policy of increasing production, had taken land in conacre and paid high prices for it, thus incurring considerable debt in the growing of crops, and I said they would be ruined if the market price was inadequate.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not reply to that and I wrote again on 22nd September. I still did not receive a reply and I wrote again on 15th October.  In the meantime, the Minister made a public statement declaring he was unwilling to do anything to relieve the position. About the middle of November, the Minister went abroad and during his absence the acting Minister, Dr. O'Higgins, approached me and mentioned that the Government were introducing a scheme for the purchase of oats.  I was delighted and I said the whole situation had been relieved, but I regretted that the scheme had not been put into operation at an earlier date.</P>
    <P>That action was taken by the Government in the Minister's absence and I had no doubt that on his return he would emphatically endorse it.  He did not set it aside, but I think he gave it very faint and inadequate approval.  At any rate, the scheme did result in the <Col N="2042" /> purchase of nearly 20,000 tons of oats. The Government guaranteed a price to the merchants and the merchants were required to hold the oats in store for the Department.</P>
    <P>The result was that that oats was held in store until August, 1949. Then portion of it was released on the home market, and over 10,000 barrels were exported to Germany.  I asked the Minister later in the House what prompted him to export 10,000 barrels of oats to Germany at a time when everybody in this country knew that there was a serious shortage of oats.  The Minister's reply was that he exported that oats mainly on instructions given to him by the Fianna Fáil Party.  I do not know how the Minister justifies such a statement. For 20 years he has been denouncing the Fianna Fáil Party in all the moods and tenses, and it seems an extraordinary thing that he should go to them for advice as to how he would deal with this difficult problem in regard to the disposal of oats.  To me it seemed that his excuse appeared to be the most pitiful exhibition of infantile ineptitude that ever was given in this or in any other assembly.  It was just as if children who had done something wrong were to blame some big, bold boys for advising them to do it.</P>
    <P>That was the only excuse which the Minister offered to this House for sending out of this country in 1949 oats that was urgently required for our own use.  The poultry keepers in this country, in particular, would have greatly welcomed that oats as a foodstuff for their poultry over the past few months.  Let it be clearly understood, since some people have suggested that this oats was not of good quality, and let it be realised that it was of the best quality.  It bushelled over 40 lbs., it was dry and of first-class quality.  Why the Minister should undertake to send that oats out of the country is a question which the farmers and all sections of the people have been asking over a long period. The only answer which the Minister can give in regard to his whole policy on this oats is to denounce those who suggested that he should take a reasonable attitude on the matter, and in <Col N="2043" /> particular to condemn those who sponsored that programme.</P>
    <P>Speaking in this House on the 22nd February, 1950&mdash;I am quoting from the volume and the column to which I have already referred&mdash;the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am not a patient man and I do not pretend to be.  I cannot conceal my contempt for the fraudulent hypocrisy of somebody who has the impudence to agitate in the country, against my strong remonstrance, for the tomfool oats scheme that Deputy Cogan was responsible for and then to come up, eighteen months later, to beat his breast, bemoan its consequences and try to blame it on me.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, I want to say, first of all, that when I hear anybody, whether he be a Minister or not, saying &ldquo;I am not a patient man,&rdquo; I always feel there is a bully.  I suppose Hitler said, when he went into Poland, that he was not a patient man, and that Mussolini, when he went into Abyssinia, said that he was not a patient man.  The Minister says, &ldquo;I am not a patient man.&rdquo; I have not patience with those people who boast about their impatience.</P>

I do not think there is any precedent in this House for such a condemnation of a Government by a member of the Government.  I want to say that that scheme was not a tomfool scheme.  It may have been a Tom Higgins scheme, but it was a sound scheme, and events proved that it was sound.  The Minister had to admit, at a later date, that not one shilling of the taxpayers' money was lost as a result of putting that scheme into operation.  The oats was purchased from the farmer who got a fair price for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was in 1948.  It was held in store until August, 1949, without any loss to the taxpayer.  It enabled the ordinary working farmer to get a price for his produce and to carry on.  If the scheme had not been opposed, it ensured that a certain quantity of oats would be carried over by the Department to meet the deficiency of 1949.  Unfortunately, portion of the crop which was very urgently needed in this country was exported, but, apart from that, the scheme was fundamentally sound, and the reason why I am stressing that is because it is desirable that we should have, in order to protect our farmers, a governmental purchase scheme which could be put into operation any time when there appeared to be a surplus.  There is no need for the Government to intervene when the ordinary market is able to consume the entire produce, but in some years, due to a combination of circumstances, as happened in 1948, when there is a large acreage and a good yield, there will be a surplus&mdash;it may be oats in one year, barley in another year and some other product in other years&mdash;and so it is highly desirable that we should have some type of State organisation to relieve the producer of that surplus produce and hold it over to make it available to the community at a later period.  I say that because we all know how violent the fluctuations can be both in regard to acreage and in regard to yield in the agricultural industry.  We know that last year the yield of oats was exceptionally low.  There was also a falling off in acreage, but the yield, as I say, was exceptionally low, and as a result of that there was a serious shortage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason why I am stressing this matter is because this is something that may arise at any time and in any year, and it is one of the things which the farmer should be safeguarded against.  He has to cope with many hazards.  He has to cope with the weather, both in the growing and in the harvesting of his crops, and so I say he should have some reasonable security in regard to the marketing of his produce.  There is no need for any <Col N="2045" /> very elaborate scheme of control or organisation.  All that is needed is that the State should possess granaries and that when there is surplus grain portion of that surplus should be taken into the granaries.  The Minister, in connection with this scheme last week, did stress the fact that the quantity of oats purchased under the scheme proved to be only a comparatively small percentage of the total quantity of oats grown, but that point is of no material value.  The fact that the Government stepped in and purchased the oats had a steadying effect on the market and did ensure that farmers generally would be able to get out with a certain reasonable profit.  Is it too much to ask that even now this tomfool scheme will be reconsidered as future policy in regard to grain surpluses, particularly in regard to barley and oats?  In the main these crops are feeding stuffs for live stock.  While the Minister may say there is no need to intervene in regard to those crops since they are feeding stuffs for live stock, I think it is in the interests of everybody concerned that the acreage under these crops should be maintained and that the people engaged in their production should have a reasonable incentive to go on producing surpluses which can be held over under the scheme I have outlined from year to year thereby ensuring that we will always have ample feeding stuffs for our live stock, poultry and pig-producing industry.  The Minister appears to be obsessed with a blind confidence in imported maize.  Why he should be so obsessed I do not know.  We managed in the past and other countries have managed with their own produce.  If we can get maximum output from our own soil we should be able to ensure that our principal live-stock industries will be self-sufficient so far as feeding stuffs are concerned.</P>
    <P>I think it is desirable that our pig producing industry should be based mainly on home produced feeding stuffs.  I think our poultry industry should be based mainly on home produced feeding stuffs.  Dr. Henry Kennedy outlined a very comprehensive scheme under which the pig producing industry could be carried on, and expanded on home produced potatoes <Col N="2046" /> and barley.  During the last couple of years that industry has been dependent upon fluctuations of imported feeding stuffs.</P>
    <P>I shall deal now with potatoes.  In the course of the Minister's performance here on 22nd February last the Minister accused me of being responsible for the falling-off in the acreage under potatoes, and for the inadequate supplies available as a result of that falling-off.  He went so far as to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Deputy Cogan would not be found dead in a field of potatoes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Like the Minister, I have not got the slovenly habit of disposing of my dead body in all kinds of unexpected places. I have no ambition to be found dead anywhere but, as a farmer who has been growing potatoes all his life, if I have to be found dead anywhere there is no place I would like better than a field of potatoes in full bloom. What was the real reason for the falling-off in the acreage last year?  Was it not due to the fact that the farmers, having produced potatoes on a very large scale in 1948, failed to secure a market for them?  It is true that we kept the British to their guarantee of accepting 50,000 tons, but we know how the farmers were penalised in supplying those potatoes during the latter part of that year.</P>
    <P>When the farmers went to the Minister to complain about their difficulty in disposing of that particular crop, the Minister told them to boil the potatoes for their pigs.  When some of them said they did not keep pigs, he said he would supply them with pigs.  When they told him they had no sties, he told them he would supply them with sties.  He went further; he said there was a world glut of potatoes. He told these farmers about the dainty ladies from London who were out in the fields in Britain picking, picking, picking potatoes.</P>
    <P>Subsequently we had Deputy Corry giving an impersonation here of the Minister for Agriculture impersonating the London ladies picking, picking, picking potatoes.  I do not intend to give an impersonation now of Deputy Corry impersonating the Minister for Agriculture impersonating the dainty <Col N="2047" /> London ladies picking potatoes.  I do think that the whole policy of the Minister towards the potato growers at that stage was one of intolerance and contempt.  The farmers then decided to cut down the acreage under potatoes and, simultaneously with that, the clerk of the weather decided to provide the most adverse conditions for the growing of potatoes.</P>

      <P>I think it would be somewhat difficult to teach manners to Deputy Keane.  It is essential that the largest acreage of potatoes should be grown.  I am satisfied that a scheme such as that advocated by Dr. Henry Kennedy, combining the production of potatoes and feeding barley for the pig producing industry with the skim milk by-product of the dairy industry, would provide the soundest means of expanding the agricultural industry generally and would be a source of increased wealth to the farmers who produce potatoes.  It must be remembered that potatoes can be grown effectively and successfully on land which is not of very high quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not consider that the Minister has a great deal to boast about in regard to the development of the poultry industry.  When he took office, eggs were being sold at a minimum price of 3/- per dozen.  There was at the time a general tendency toward wide expansion in the industry.  The farmers generally were concerned as to how far they should go in further expanding that industry, putting more money into it and keeping the industry going.  They appealed to the Minister for guidance in the matter and the Minister promptly guaranteed them that the price of 3/- per dozen would continue.  I do not know what grounds the Minister had for giving that <Col N="2048" /> guarantee but, in my opinion, it was a guarantee which should not have been given by a responsible Minister. I am sure he could not have sufficient facts to guide him in regard to that pledge.  Here is the pledge which was given by the Minister in May, 1948:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It used to be the rule that when egg supplies increased the price went down.  That is no longer true.  We have made an agreement with the British Minister of Food that the more eggs we send to the British market the more they will pay for our eggs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That pledge was given in a poultry periodical over the signature of the Minister and, in addition to the rather rambling signature, we have the portrait of the Minister which Deputies can see.</P>
    <P>I think it was irresponsible on the part of the Minister to have given that pledge to ordinary people of small means, thereby encouraging them to go in for increased expenditure in the provision of additional houses and additional equipment for the poultry industry.  The equipment and housing of poultry do involve considerable expense.  The poultry industry is one which is conducted mainly by farmers' wives and farmers' daughters.  They are not people of unlimited means. They are not people who can afford to suffer losses and, because of that, the Minister should have been a little bit more careful about giving definite pledges that the price would remain unaltered for a long period of time&mdash; to say, in fact, that the more production increased, the more prices would go up.  Instead of that, we find that within less than a year after the Minister had made that promise, or before the end of the year in which he made it the price was &ldquo;increased&rdquo; from 3/- to 2/6.  It has now been further &ldquo;increased&rdquo; for the coming year to 2/-.  If the price goes on &ldquo;increasing&rdquo; at that rate, the poultry producer will be called upon to give away an egg along with every spoonful of salt.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister cannot control the price of exported eggs, but I have the feeling that he has been very, very unsuccessful in conducting negotiations in regard to this particular item of <Col N="2049" /> agricultural produce.  I do not think the Minister was wise, when he went over to England to negotiate on this particular question, to start shouting to the British people: &ldquo;We will drown you with eggs.&rdquo;  The net result of that rather juvenile cry was to arouse the interest, and perhaps the opposition, of all who were engaged in poultry production in Britain.  The consequence was that pressure was brought to bear upon Mr. Strachey, the then Minister of Food, to reduce the price offered to Irish producers in order to discourage imports.  It must be remembered that the price paid to Irish producers did not affect the price paid to British producers.  British producers are guaranteed a certain minimum price. It is interesting to note that the price paid to producers in Britain for eggs at the present time is a minimum of 3/9 as against 2/6 here.</P>
    <P>The Minister has the habit of saying that the British are a reasonable people.  I do not agree with the Minister. I do not think they are reasonable people.  It is not reasonable to say to the producer: &ldquo;Two shillings is good enough for you but we are prepared to pay a minimum of 3/9, or an average of 4/1, to our producers in Britain and in the Six Counties.&rdquo;  That is not the action of reasonable men. I think the Minister is only making himself look foolish to describe people who offer him that price as reasonable men.  Our costs of production are as high.  if not higher, than the costs of production in the Six Counties and across in Britain.  Nevertheless, the Minister says that the British are reasonable people when they give us approximately half the price they are giving to their own producers.  This is an industry in which, as I say, the women of rural Ireland are mainly interested. The Minister, I am afraid, has betrayed the interests of those people.  He has failed to safeguard them adequately. He has, in his anxiety to catch the headlines in the British newspapers, aroused opposition to the import of eggs into Britain.  To-day, instead of being prepared to take more and more eggs and to give a higher and higher price, I believe their entire policy now is to discourage the sending of any eggs <Col N="2050" /> at all except during what is known as the off-season, the latter part of the year.  I feel that on this question, as in regard to the oats, the Minister has let down and betrayed his own people, the ordinary working farmers and their wives and daughters&mdash;the farmers who grew the oats and their wives and daughters who reared the poultry and brought about an increase in the production of eggs.  Those people have been badly treated.  If the oat growers had been better treated in the first year of the Minister's administration, there would be more and better feeding available for the poultry keepers at the present time.</P>
    <P>Deputy P. O'Reilly and myself tabled a motion some time ago asking that a better price be paid for bacon pigs.  When that motion was tabled the price being paid for bacon pigs was as low as 180/-.  The Minister had guaranteed that it would not be less than 190/-.  As a result of that motion which we tabled and of its unanimous acceptance by the House the price of pigs has increased somewhat during the past few months.  However, prior to that, considerable damage was done to the pig-producing industry.  There is no doubt that there has been a general falling off in the number of people keeping sows for breeding purposes and that we were facing a grave danger of the industry declining again if something had not been done.  I know that the whole position of the industry is unsatisfactory.  The statement of the Minister, when introducing his Estimate, to the effect that two bacon factories may have to close down is one of grave importance.  Nobody wants that to happen.  It should be the duty of both the Government and this House to ensure that this industry is kept going.  The price of feeding stuffs generally has increased very substantially during the past few months. The price of pigs has somewhat increased but the increase has not kept pace with the increase in the cost of producing pigs.  It is rather tragic that there is not a little more security in this industry.  It is tragic that the Minister has not been able to secure for whatever surplus we may have available a reasonable price from the reasonable people about <Col N="2051" /> whom he talks so much.  I have often felt that the Minister should endeavour to approach the other suppliers of the British market with a view to securing their co-operation in obtaining a better price for our produce in that market. The reasonable people in Britain have played one supplier of their market off against another.  They have played off the Irish against the Danes and they have played off the Danes and the Irish against the New Zealand farmers both in regard to butter and to bacon.  The Minister referred in this House to-day to the Battle of Clontarf.  I hope he does not hold any spite against the Danes because of a battle which was fought in the year 1014.  He should meet those people and seek their co-operation in getting a decent price from the British Government for our surplus bacon, if we have any to spare.</P>
    <P>I indicated at the outset that it is the duty of the Government to ensure that the Irish producer gets a decent price: that those who work hard on the farms are kept there through their industry being adequately rewarded. Because I hold that view and because my views have clashed with those of the Minister in that respect over a number of years, I have found it necessary to table this motion.  The one particular aspect of ministerial policy which has interested me more than any other has been the attitude which the Minister has taken up during the present year towards those who are engaged in supplying the milk to our creameries.  For a long time past there has been an insistence from all sides of the House that the price of milk supplied to the creameries is not adequate.  I think that it was in 1946-47 that the price was last fixed. Since then there has been no increase whatever although since that time there have been substantial increases in production costs.  So far from offering the producer any increase in price, the Minister, this very year, decided by a proclamation which he issued in Waterford that the price ought to be reduced.  He presented to the whole dairying industry a sort of ultimatum which said, in effect: &ldquo;I am offering you a reduced price of 1/- per gallon. If you do not accept this reduction <Col N="2052" /> you may fare worse next year.&rdquo;  That was the nature of the ultimatum presented by the Minister to the dairy farmers.  What motives prompted him to present that ultimatum it would be difficult to guess.  Surely he must know that the dairying industry is the main basis of the agricultural industry.  He stated in this House even last week that the dairying industry provides very substantial direct employment.  In addition to that, it provides the basis of the live-stock industry and of the pig-producing industry and it is also supplementary to the poultry industry. All the other branches of the agricultural industry developed, in the main, around the dairy cows.  Yet, the dairy cow is singled out by the Minister for attack.</P>
    <P>The Minister claimed, I think, that it would be difficult to maintain the present price, but he did not advert to the fact that the farmer who keeps cows is subject to the Agricultural Wages Board and has to pay a fixed minimum wage to his workers.  Why should the Minister single out the dairy farmers for a cut of 16 per cent.?  One can imagine the answer he would have got if he had gone to the Federation of Rural Workers, for example, and asked them to accept a similar cut.  He appears to be angry and offended because the dairy farmers have rejected unanimously his offer of a price reduced by 16 per cent.  Does he seriously think he would have received a different answer from any trade union had he gone to them and asked them to accept a cut?  He did not, under any circumstances, dream of asking any trade union to accept a reduced wage. He thought the simple, unorganised, farming community could be persuaded by his eloquence to regard a price of 1/- per gallon as being greater than the existing price of 1/2.</P>
    <P>His whole approach to the problem was dishonest.  He adopted the tactics of the professional cattle dealer who goes to the fair and makes an offer for a beast and who has around him a number of underlings&mdash;tanglers they are called in some places, blockers, in others.  They go around and try to beat down the farmer, to break his morale. One approaches the farmer in a friendly <Col N="2053" /> way and says that this buyer is the best buyer in the fair and that, if his offer is not accepted, he never comes back.  Another says that other fairs have been bad.  They think the poor, simple gom from the country does not know the value of his cattle.  Another will come along and bid a very low price.  All these men are assisting the big buyer in his effort to beat down the farmer.  In the same way, when the Minister made his offer in Waterford of a reduced price, many of his henchmen of various kinds wrote anonymously to various papers, boosting the Minister's scheme and hinting how unwise the dairy farmers would be if they rejected his generous offer of a guaranteed reduced price for five years.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of that offer, which to my mind, appears to be dishonest.  The Minister said that he could not guarantee what would happen if the farmers rejected it, but that if they accepted it he could guarantee a price for five years.  I maintain that if the Minister has power to guarantee a price for five years, he has power to guarantee the existing price.  In guaranteeing 1/- per gallon, there is a number of hazards the Minister has to take.  No one knows what the price of the exported surplus will be.  No one knows to what extent production will increase. The Minister has to take all these risks in guaranteeing 1/- per gallon.  There is no reason then why he should say that, if we reject his offer, he cannot guarantee the existing price.</P>
    <P>Those tactics were adopted simply to browbeat and intimidate the creamery suppliers into accepting a lower price for their produce at a time when the suppliers' costs are stabilised. They have been increased over the past two or three years, and they are at least stabilised now to the extent that they cannot be reduced.  As far as wages are concerned, at any rate, there is no likelihood or possibility that agricultural wages will decline.  We must accept the view that, having put a floor under the agricultural wages&mdash;which was a desirable thing to do&mdash;there is an equally binding obligation upon the Minister <Col N="2054" /> to put a similar floor under the price of the farmer's produce.  If the Minister cannot see his way and does not think it is possible to increase the price, at least, he should stabilise it for five years at its present figure with, if you like, an arrangement by which that standard price can be lowered or raised according as costs, accurately ascertained, are lowered or raised.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I, as an Independent Deputy, and a number of farmer Deputies, have been agitating with the Minister over a long time to take steps to have costings accurately ascertained.  He has flatly refused to meet that demand.  Every time the question was raised he turned it down. He even went to my own constituency, Wicklow, to denounce any proposal for an investigation of costings.  I regarded that as a declaration of war on me personally.  I do not know how the Minister intended it.</P>
    <P>At any rate, he went there and made a ridiculous statement that any investigation of farmers' costings would reveal that they were making more than they pretended.  The Minister made that statement knowing perfectly well that his own statistics prove that the average income of each person engaged in the agricultural industry is less than £3 10s. Od. per week.  We can never make headway in agricultural development unless we have honesty in those who are administering Government policy.</P>
    <P>There is no use in getting up on platforms saying that the farmers are making plenty of money.  It has to be proved.  The Minister has been challenged to prove it on a number of occasions, but has always run away from it.  I pointed out on another occasion, some months ago, that the average income of each person engaged in agriculture was £3 5s. Od. per week. The Minister said that that was ridiculous and that he would disprove the figure.  When he came to reply, he did not mention it.  He is very careful to ignore any point which he knows he cannot answer.  He will deal at very great length with, perhaps, fictitious arguments which he may create himself simply for the purpose of destroying them.  It is time that there was an <Col N="2055" /> honest, disinterested and impartial investigation of farmers' costings.  It is time that the lie was nailed that farmers have been profiteering over the past few years.</P>
    <P>The committee of agriculture of which I am a member sent to the Minister for Agriculture a proposal that that committee would be empowered to acquire a typical farm and to run it for the purpose, first, of investigating farm costings and, secondly, for the purpose of demonstrating modern and up-to-date methods of farming.  The Minister, without giving any explanation or excuse, turned down that proposal.</P>
    <P>He would not sanction the acquiring by the committee of agriculture of a farm and the running of it by the officials in an efficient way, in order to ascertain, so far as it is possible to ascertain them, agricultural costings, and also as an educational factor.  The former Minister, Deputy Smith, agreed to have a costings investigation introduced, but apparently, on consultation with his Department, later decided against it.  The present Minister was pressed to reintroduce the proposal and he has declined to do so.  He has, it is true, told us he has set up some kind of costings investigation within his Department, but I do not regard an investigation within the Department as being an independent, impartial and disinterested investigation.  Any investigation of farm costings must be controlled by a joint committee representative of the farmers and of the Department, if you like.</P>
    <P>In regard to the beet-growing industry, I must say that the Irish Sugar Company showed initiative and enterprise in agreeing to set up an impartial investigation into costings.  They secured the appointment of a joint committee representative of the factory and the beet growers' association and I think that investigation served a very useful purpose.  It showed how costs were built up in the production of a crop and it had the effect, also, of spot-lighting the most efficient method of production.  I am quite confident and satisfied that an impartial investigation of costings which would be accepted by <Col N="2056" /> farmers and by the consuming public would have the effect of ascertaining accurately what it costs to produce the various commodities produced on the farm and what are the profits of the ordinary farmer.  In the second place, it would have the effect of eliminating in efficiency by showing how costs could be reduced.  A number of farms would be investigated and the various costs compared.  The yields would be compared and the methods would be compared and in that way much real information could be collected which would be of immense value to the Department, in the first place, and to the farming industry, in the second place.</P>
    <P>To a great extent, the whole approach of the Department over the past 50 years to agricultural problems has been unrealistic.  I suppose it is inevitable that it should be, because they are, in the main, an advisory Department.  We know that if a man is appointed to advise a businessman on how to run his business, he will scarcely ever be as practical a businessman as the man who has to make a living out of it.  The same is true of a Department which sets out to advise farmers.  I am not decrying the value of the information they can give, information ascertained by various scientific means and experiment.  That is all of immense value, but it is time they got into closer touch with the realities of agriculture.  I had the experience of being present&mdash;I quote this as an instance&mdash;at the filling of a silo.  We all know how valuable ensilage is as a feeding stuff.  It was filled under departmental inspection and I had the experience of seeing that silo emptied afterwards into the manure heap. Nothing will ever appear in any Department document or report in regard to that demonstration.  It was not an experiment; it was a demonstration of how easy it is to make ensilage and how valuable it is as a feeding stuff.</P>
    <P>There has been over all the years a good deal of window dressing in regard to the Department and a good deal of failure to disclose information which does not suit the Department and a tendency to boost information which suits the Department, and particularly <Col N="2057" /> information which suits whatever Minister happens to be head of the Department. In the same connection, I have since ascertained that the same type of silo, the circular concrete silo recommended by the Department for a long period of years, has been denounced now as being unsatisfactory, and that a simpler type, the older type of pit silo, has been recommended, thus showing how easy it is for the Department to make mistakes, even with all their technical knowledge behind them.  On the other hand, we blame the farmer for not being more efficient and getting more production, when a Department, with all its resources, its resources of science, education and knowledge gathered from other countries, can make mistakes year after year and advocate things which are not advantageous and not in the best interests of the industry.  Why then should there be so much blame placed on the average farmer if his crops sometimes fail or if there is sometimes minor mismanagement?</P>
    <P>These are all questions which require consideration.  I think, therefore, that the suggestion I have made of a realistic investigation of costings, controlled jointly by representatives of the farmers and representatives of the Department, would be the first real step towards putting agricultural <Col N="2058" /> policy on a realistic basis.  Never again could anybody come in here, and, in a loose, general way, say that the farmers were rolling in wealth and that the banks were bursting with their money, and, on the other hand, never again would it be possible for farmers to exaggerate their position.  There would be detailed and well-documented evidence of the costs and I am quite sure that, if such an investigation were carried out fairly and honestly, it would show that the people engaged in milk production, just as in other branches of the industry, ought not to be subjected to a reduced price this year or in future.  If there is to be a guaranteed price for five years, it ought to be on the basis of maintaining the present price.  If it is proved that costs increase, the standard price could then be increased and, if costs decrease, the standard price could be reduced.  The proposal to impose a 16 per cent. reduction on those engaged in that very vital industry was an outrage and I am glad that it was not agreed to by the dairying industry, as such.</P>
