      <P>The most important element in this matter of fishing, in my opinion, is the consumption of fish, and for that reason the most important person to be considered is the consumer of fish.  We have a conflict arising out of that to be settled as best as we can settle it in the interests of the industry.  We have the rival claims of our own fishermen and the demands of the fish trade to be allowed to import fish on their own terms and conditions.  That problem is not one for which it is easy to find a solution.  If the consumption of fish has not improved, I think it a fair assumption that the industry cannot make any greater progress.  The drop in the landings of fish from 1948 to 1949 is rather considerable.  According to the Trade Journal for March, 1950, the landings in 1948 were 365,000 cwts. and in 1949, 202,000 cwts.  The value dropped from £557,000 to £441,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was mainly herrings and mackerel that declined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we will have to be reasonable in the matter of herrings and mackerel.  I do not think they can be sold fresh, as they used to be during the first world war.  The market for cured mackerel in the United States disappeared about the end of the first world war, and that killed a very important industry.  An important change took place about the end of the first world war.  The sailing nobby was engaged very largely in the catching of shoal fish, like herrings and mackerel and there was a good market to be got for them fresh, apart altogether from the cured market.  The sailing nobby has been replaced by the engined trawling boat.  The change is, I think, a good one.  The reason is that the trawler is more likely to give you a variety of fish and to give it to you fairly regularly.  On the question of regular supplies, the size of the boat is a very important factor, while the regularity of supplies has an important bearing on the consumption of fish. We all know that if you cannot give a regular supply, you are likely to lose your customer.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to note last night that the Minister is prepared to provide all facilities in reason for the inshore fishermen.  I think, however, that the decision to depart from the smaller boat and to get a larger type of boat is a wise one.  It would, in any event, I think, become inevitable, and for one very important reason, namely, that the type of boat we have been using, particularly on the west coast, was such that the fishermen confined their activities mainly to the fishing of our own bays and inlets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="563" /> A great deal of complaint was made, largely by themselves, that this intensive fishing of the bays and inlets was damaging the spawning beds, and that something should be done about it.  The result of it was that where a fisherman came, say, from Dingle to Galway he was looked upon as an enemy.  That was all due to the fact that the capacity of the local boats was not sufficient to take the fishermen out into the more profitable fishing grounds.  On that question, I still think that if the views of the fishermen are to be accepted in the matter, the foreign trawlers&mdash;the big trawlers&mdash;are doing a fair amount of damage to the spawning beds because, as it is alleged, the three-mile limit is not sufficiently far from our shores to protect those spawning beds.  I do not know what truth is in that.</P>
    <P>I imagine there is very little use in discussing the question of the three-mile limit here, because, I understand, it is a matter for international agreement. It has been recommended here from time to time on behalf of our inshore fishermen, that something should be done by the Irish Government to secure an extension of that limit.  I should like to repeat that request myself this morning.  As regards the trawlers which come around our coasts, I do not think that they do their best to avoid infringement when fishing close to our shore.  They come into our harbours and ports for shelter; they are very welcome to do so, and are given all the facilities available, but in a great many cases they do not reciprocate the hospitality they receive, and very often they throw out their fishing gear on the way out and fish in the grounds that are preserved for our own men.  I do not want to say that is going on on a very large scale, but at the present time it seems to me that we have a much larger number of foreign trawlers on our shores than has been the case for a very long time. Therefore, I think the Department should press on the Department of Defence the necessity of keeping an extra vigilant watch during these months.</P>
    <P>One cannot discuss this question of sea fisheries without confining one's <Col N="564" /> remarks almost entirely to the Sea Fisheries Association.  When that association was formed, the Government of the day handed over the control and direction of the sea fisheries almost entirely to that body. Now, I do not think that it has been a very effective instrument for the job. First of all, it is not an association at all in the ordinary sense of that word inasmuch as that a person who wants to get any facilities from it has to become a member.  It is obvious that a man would become a member on the chance of getting gear or getting a boat, and that, if he does not get what he wants, then he is no longer an active member.</P>
    <P>It has also happened that people who have got facilities and have paid off their loans, also have lost all interest in the association.  We have had the position created whereby, according to the information supplied to me by the Minister, there is a membership of over 4,000, of whom only about 2,700 can be regarded as effective members.  Of these, about 1,100 have paid up their share calls, and about 1,500 or more are in arrears. Now, it is in relation to that position that I should like to make a reference to Muintir na Mara.  The Minister last night castigated Muintir na Mara.  I think that Muintir na Mara is a rather hopeful development so far as organising the fishermen is concerned.  I attended most of the annual meetings of the Sea Fisheries Association, and I may say that that body had the appearance of being dead or moribund. Some of the officials had usually to turn up and make a quorum.  That position was changed as a result of the emergence of Muintir na Mara. The meeting at Westport last year, at which I was not present, and the meeting this year were very lively meetings indeed.  The discussions at them showed the keenest interest possible in our fisheries.  I, like the Minister, am not quite satisfied about some of the information which that body has given out.  In any event, there is a conflict between it and the information supplied by the Sea Fisheries Association.  I take it that the information supplied by the Sea Fisheries Association has been compiled from <Col N="565" /> official statistics.  However, all the members of Muintir na Mara are members of the Sea Fisheries Association, and if the latter is to be revivified, if it is to be made a live organisation, that will come about, I think, through the activities of minority groups inside the association.  That is how it will be brought about.  For that reason, I am inclined to welcome the formation of Muintir na Mara.</P>
    <P>On the question of the general development of the Sea Fisheries Association, I do not think that it has, at any time, shown any great evidence of ability to bring about a general development.  It has, for instance, been given sums of money for that purpose all down the years.  That information is given under the sub-heads to the Vote, but if one examines the expenditure under that heading, one will find that very little money has been spent for that purpose.  I conclude from that that the association has not got the jizz and the go in it which produces new ideas.  For example, in 1934-35 they spent nothing. The same happened in 1935-36 and you have the same down along the line until after the war.  The year 1947-48 would appear to be their best year. They spent £9,900 for that purpose in that year and in 1948-49 they spent £2,200.</P>
    <P>With regard to boats and gear, I think the Government will have to do better in the matter of providing for that particular service.  The Minister knows that the price of boats is far greater now than it was pre-war.  He told us last night that a 50-foot boat now costs something in the region of £5,000.  The sum provided this year for that purpose is £75,000 and, if one makes allowance for the necessary expenditure on gear and other ancillary matters in relation to the provision of boats, that sum does not appear to be a very large one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may take it that I will buy every 50-foot boat available in any yard in either Ireland or Scotland, and the money will be available for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fair enough. With regard to marketing, refrigeration <Col N="566" /> is one of the most important items.  I know that the association had some idea of providing refrigeration around the landing ports.  That should help to solve the problem of gluts.  It would also help to ease transport problems.  One of the principal difficulties in the Aran Islands, for instance, is the problem of transport. The regular service is once a week and during the period of the year when the men are getting their largest catches they are not always able to get the fish into Galway.  They have either to cure it or dispose of it as best they can by sending it out in their own boats to County Clare.  The difficulty that exists in relation to transport precludes them from utilising the ordinary marketing services provided for them. In my opinion refrigeration would go a long way to solve their present problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that. If it proves successful I hope it will be spread all round the coast where there is need for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will forgive me if I mention once more the necessity for providing as much as possible against rivalry and competition in the fishing grounds near the coast.  I think the Minister should go ahead with the provision of larger boats to cope with the rivalry that exists in the bays and inlets.  That is the only way in which that problem can be dealt with because, if the men have larger boats, they will go further afield.  The problem has become a sore and difficult one in recent years on different parts of the coast.  It has even led to actions in the law courts.  I hope the Minister has not such an objection to deep sea fishing as will prevent him from going further still in relation to the size of the boats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are testing a 65-foot boat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is good.  Facilities are a <i>sine qua non</i> where these <Col N="567" /> larger boats are concerned.  I had a comment to make on this question last year in relation to the provision of boatyards.  The Minister told us then that he intended providing an extra boatyard in Meevagh.  There had been a boatyard there at one period, but it had been transferred by the association to Killybegs.  That Killybegs boatyard is still in commission, and the Minister announced last year that he would establish another in Meevagh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>He also announced that one would be established in Dingle.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that on the figures for boats issued Donegal and Kerry are the two principal fishing counties on the west coast.  They have the largest number of engine boats.  Quite obviously they would have first claim.  But Donegal already had a boatyard, and there is a whole stretch of coast from Donegal to Kerry which has no boatyard.  I had a letter from the Minister last year after the Estimate had been disposed of; he wrote apparently to every Deputy who raised points to which he did not reply when closing the debate.  In reply to my representations about boat building facilities the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As to the setting up of boat building yards by the association, it will naturally take some time to develop fully plans in contemplation under this heading but, so far as the Minister is concerned, he will welcome proposals in due course for the provision of such a facility at Galway.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was more or less turning the problem over to the people who were interested in it on the west coast. Naturally enough we had to find out who could help us in the matter.  The first body I approached was the Galway Chamber of Commerce because I felt they would be bound to have among their membership people who would have some knowledge of the <Col N="568" /> matter.  I do not know how far things have progressed since last year.  I believe the chamber of commerce has been in touch with the Department.  I hope the Minister will give us some information about it when he is replying and I hope, too, that the information will be favourable.</P>
    <P>When I refer to the west coast I mean that stretch in particular which comprises the three counties of Galway, Clare and Mayo.  We have not had such development there as the nature of the coast and the fishing tradition would entitle us to.  The Sea Fisheries Association has built up a large membership. Of that membership the western region has about one-third of the effective membership.  I gave the figure last night of 2 or 3 per cent. for boats issued.  About a year ago I received certain figures from the Minister and, looking into the matter since last night, I find that about 4.5 per cent of the motor boats issued was given to that region.  In my opinion that is not an equitable distribution for that particular stretch of the coast.  I know that the Department has turned over this matter of the issuing of boats and the general administration of the fishing industry to the Sea Fisheries Association and it is on the shoulders of that body I must place the blame.</P>
    <P>There, again, one comes back to the effectiveness of the association in putting its point of view forward.  If it was as effective a body as the new group Muintir na Mara appears to be, though it does not seem to have established itself yet on the west coast, this problem would not be quite as bad as it is in that particular region and the position in regard to the provision of boats would not be so unfavourable. I want the Minister, therefore, whatever agency is at his disposal, to come to the aid of the west coast in the matter of the issue of boats.  We have heavy emigration there.  I believe that if there was a genuine effort to mobilise the best of the young men, whose fathers were fishermen, and who have some acquaintance with the fishing business, and if some effort were made to give some little training where they require it and to equip them with boats, that the landings of fish, the <Col N="569" /> figures of which are given from time to time in this trade journal and elsewhere, would be greatly increased.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Deputy get me a dozen fellows in Connemara who would attend a fishing school if I provided it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will promise the Minister this much, that I shall look for them.  I did my best last year to see if I could not put it over to the Minister to provide a boatyard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a question of spending sufficient money to bring them there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to say it is a question of money because we had the difficulty during the war of not being able to get boats or equipment and the strange thing is that, although we could not get boats and equipment, the catches and the landings were much better than pre-war when boats were being resumed by the association from people who could not make them pay. That has always been the experience in the fishing industry.  It experienced a boom in the first war and there was also a boom in the last war but judging from the figures reported in the trade journal, a decline has again set in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, no.  The landings for inshore fishermen are rising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I know what the Minister says is quite true, that the landings of wet fish from 1945 to 1949 increased from 57,000 cwts to 70,000 cwts., but taking the various years separately, the figures were: in 1945 to 1946 the landings increased from 51,000 to 52,000; from 1946 to 1947, from 52,000 to 61,000; from 1947 to 1948, from 61,000 to 68,000, and from 1948 to 1949 the increase has been only from 68,000 to 70,000.  It may be that there is some substance in what Muintir na Mara says, that the heavy imports of fish are responsible for it.  I am not prepared to accept that without further investigation.  I am inclined to believe myself, from the increased figure, that the consumption of fish has gone up somewhat in the country.  I do not at all accept the statement that our people are not a fish-eating people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably not.  It is very hard to know where the circle begins in this question, whether the absence of a regular supply of fish has interfered with consumption or whether it is that the lack of desire for fish has an adverse effect on the catches of fish. I am not at all satisfied that the people will not eat fish.  The Muintir na Mara people say that the importation of fish &mdash;of course, I take it it includes preserved fish&mdash;went up from 24,430 cwts. in 1947 to 70,360 cwts. in 1949.  The 1949 imports were value for £587,515.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I know there is a good deal of smoked cod being consumed in the country, and I do not think it is all Irish smoked cod.  I believe that the consumption of fish is going up, and that it will go up still further, that there is an increasing market for whatever supplies we can land here ourselves.  That is the most hopeful feature of this whole business in my opinion.  We shall have to try to reconcile the conflicting interests. You have people like Muintir na Mara and the fish traders at daggers drawn.  I do not know whether Muintir na Mara asked the Minister for an inquiry, but I think the fish traders did.  I think the Minister should grant an inquiry and let everybody have their fling.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a public inquiry. It is one like the Commission on Emigration, which has been going on for month after month without any information as to what is happening. Could the Minister not set up a public inquiry of some sort and let everybody who is interested come in and have his say?  I think that would help a great deal to remove many of the misconceptions that seem to be hovering around this matter.  It is not a question out of which anybody wants to make political capital.  There is no political capital that I know of that can be made out of it but, in any event, we have a large coast line and we have first-class harbours.  We have, I think, a tradition of fishing that is capable of forming a basis of a much larger fishing industry and, with the new aids and facilities provided for fishermen, I think we should go all out to make the best possible use of them.  That cannot be done on the west coast, in my opinion, unless some more intimate interest is taken in that particular part of the coast than has been shown heretofore.  On the east coast and the south coast the problem is not quite the same. The east coast people have practically a monopoly of the Dublin market. Their transport difficulties are not so great, and they are in closer touch with things.  On the west coast it is quite different.  I think that in relation to promoting the industry and advancing it on the west coast, we shall have to get down to the question of regional marketing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that it is not an easy matter to arrange, but I know that it used to happen when imports of fish were more freely available, that at a place like Athlone, for instance, you had fish on the train on which you travelled going up to Dublin brought from Galway, while on the train which passed you at Athlone, there was a consignment of fish from Grimsby or some other place across Channel.  I am not saying that sort of thing has been happening since the beginning of the war, but it brings to your mind the necessity for some sort of regional marketing, if it can be arranged. There is no reason why fish landed at Dublin should be brought down the country and fish landed down the <Col N="572" /> country brought to Dublin.  If that can be avoided, it will do away with extra transport costs and also ensure that the fish will reach the consumer in a better and fresher condition.</P>
    <P>I welcome the statement by the Minister that he is to bring in proposals for the stricter control of the importation of fish.  That importation has been going on for some time and it was operated by the issue of licences. The complaint that has been made by the fishermen is that the Department of Fisheries apparently issued these licences <i>ad lib.;</i> in any event, they say that they were very often issued unnecessarily. That is a matter that requires examination because we know that fish has been scarce on many occasions and, since the end of the war, it has been kept up at a fairly high price.  That, of course, warns off the consumer.  Meat is dear, and I think that the time is opportune for getting the public to use fish to a larger extent. The fish, however, must be there in variety and at the right price.</P>
    <P>In connection with the administration of the control of imports, I should like to see the Sea Fisheries Association or the Department or whoever will be in charge of the job consulting with the fish traders' organisation and with the active membership of the fishermen's associations as represented by Muintir na Mara or any other group who takes sufficient interest in it, so that all unnecessary friction will be removed and these two sections or any other section or interest involved will have an opportunity of seeing where the public interest lies in the matter and being made to understand that the interest of the consumers must be the first concern and must be attended to as it ought to be.  Peace and harmony in all the facets of the industry should be the first objective if progress is to be made.  I earnestly ask the Minister to take whatever steps are open to him to see that all these conflicting interests are reconciled.  Perhaps it would be a good thing if the Minister let some light into this inquiry that has been going on and let the public know what it has been doing.  If the information so far brought to his notice as a result of the inquiry <Col N="573" /> warrants the holding of a full-dress public inquiry, I think he ought to hold it.  It will educate the public and probably educate the people who think they know this question in every detail.  They will probably learn a good deal from it also.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the allocation of the new boats which the Minister promised last night the west coast will not be neglected.  I should like to see one or two at least of these 50-foot boats placed on some parts of the west coast. I believe that that type of boat would justify itself much better than the smaller type which had been issued heretofore.  Whatever efforts the Minister puts into this job, whatever new ideas are recommended to him for experiment, I want to assure him that in his endeavours in that direction he will have the fullest co-operation of this Party, because this is an industry which should be second in importance only to agriculture and is capable of much greater development than has heretofore been its lot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>As usual, I propose to join issue this year again with the Minister in connection with his whole fishery policy.  The Minister will recollect that last year I clearly indicated what I thought might be a more reasonable approach to the developing of fishing, not as the small little industry which we have been content to leave it for a number of years, but into what it should be, not a subsidiary to agriculture, but something on a par and on a level with the agricultural industry.  A brief survey of the small countries of Europe will show in an absolutely unchallengeable way that there is a future for fishing.  All that is required is a little bit of constructive effort.  My only regret is that the Minister, who is a lion in the Department of Agriculture, is over-conservative, I think, through no fault of his own, in the Fishery Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am going to start right off by striking a serious note of warning and putting it on the records of this House that I think the Minister may kill the fishing industry for all time if he is going to hand it over to the Sea Fisheries Association as at present <Col N="574" /> constituted.  I have had the harrowing experience of watching these people at an annual general meeting engaging in one of the dirtiest wangles I have ever seen.  Those present at the meeting refused to pass the annual accounts and the big stick of the proxy vote was brought into play and all kinds of subterfuges adopted to get the annual accounts of the Sea Fisheries Association passed by that body.  That does not show any harmony.  Is it fair or is it right that we should hand over to an organisation which is in that state of flux and in that unreal position the control of our fishing industry?  I think the Minister is treading the path of suicide so far as the fishing industry is concerned unless something is done to correlate and co-ordinate what are the genuine interests in the industry.  At the moment we have Muintir na Mara and the Sea Fisheries Association at each other's throats.  There is merit in both cases.  Neither is wholly right, but certainly that problem will have to be resolved before you can pass over the control of the landing and marketing of fish in this country to any organisation.</P>
    <P>One thing that the sea fisheries branch of this industry have never adverted to or have never tried to analyse is the difficulty presented by the fish themselves and by the way the fish are running.  It is quite true that for many years, particularly in my area in West Cork, very large schools of fish were running.  In Eyeries and Allihies you had the best mackerel fishing in Europe, but it has gone.  The fish have wandered from that particular run, and we do not know when they will come back.  The position the Minister has to face now is that, in the main, the fisherman has to follow his fish, and has to get out into the sea after his fish.  The Minister is going to stand indicted by me in this House if he does not quickly get away from the suicide craft he is asking the fishermen of this country to fish with.  The day of the small boat is gone, and it is gone forever, and the sooner we face up to that and the sooner the Minister adjusts his mind to the fact that the men have to go out into the sea to follow the <Col N="575" /> fish and fight for the fish the better for the fishing industry.  You cannot do that without proper boats.  Fifty-foot boats are all right in their own way, but we will find as time goes on, indeed in the very near future, that even the 50-foot boat will be outmoded. If we are to go for the big craft let us go for it in earnest.</P>
    <P>The fishermen of this country are good, game fishermen, who are prepared to work if there is a good return for their labour.  Some of them working under the most difficult conditions, have succeeded in rearing families and raising a bit of money to enable them to buy a better boat.  The Minister must face this problem.  I know that he has decided that he will insist on a 10 per cent. deposit on a boat, but in view of the legislation which is coming into this House, by which we are going to reduce the deposit necessary for a house to 5 per cent., the Minister should adjust his mind to the fact that where there is a good fisherman with a good crew he would be justified in allowing, and we would be justified in demanding, a 5 per cent. deposit for a boat.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister through the Sea Fisheries Association has expressed the opinion that he will not go less than 10 per cent.  But if boats get bigger the cost of boats and gear will become so high that fishermen will have put down £500 as deposit.  I think that is unreasonable when you are trying to build up a new industry.  I will not take sides as I did not take sides between the Sea Fisheries Association and Muintir na Mara.  I want one harmonious body which will recognise what is good in each and what is best for the industry.  I think that the working fisherman who has a decent record and has something to show for his years of work should be entitled to all the consideration that this State can give, and if through the circumstances of rearing a large family, large domestic commitments, he finds himself without £500 with which to buy boats and equipment it is a very ungrateful State that does not see that he gets it anyway.</P>
    <P>I differ fundamentally with the Minister on the whole theory of fishing.  We <Col N="576" /> have agreed to differ, but again I would urge upon him that he will have to consider&mdash;not as he told me in an airy fashion in this House buying fish from England in a lacuna period&mdash;but finding Irish trawlers manned by Irishmen that will fill any lacuna in the inshore fishermen's market.  I know that the Minister will get up and gibe about the trawl fishing company that lost £50,000, but I am amazed looking at their record that it did not lose ten times as much. It never had a chance; it was not properly run and nobody in it knew anything about running it.  Why should we be pilloried because of a failure which took place in a different period? Even if it were to cost a bit of money initially to have Irishmen going in Irish trawlers to fill the lacuna periods it would be better than having any foreigner, Belgian, Dutch or French, giving us a supply of fish when there is a shortage on the home market.</P>
    <P>I have been warned that I am transgressing too much on the time of the House and I will conclude on the note that fishing has never taken its proper perspective in this country.  The reason is fundamentally the fault of the Fisheries Department which the Minister controls because they are too conservative. They have never faced up to the problem caused by the modern drift of the fishing industry.  There is a future for building subsidiary industries by way of freezing, canning and even fishmeal if we have surpluses of appropriate edible fish.</P>

The people in West Cork want boats, engines and nets and then we will do the fishing and the Minister can do the talking.</P>

      <P>I am very disappointed that most of the promises made to our fishermen have not been realised.  It is very disheartening to any public representative who refers year after year to things that are of vital importance to fishermen to experience the dead hand which retards progress. I am referring to harbours in North County Dublin, one harbour especially that is of vital importance to the fishermen in that area, Loughshinny. We have hard-working, industrious fishermen in Loughshinny who have succeeded in getting larger boats but they cannot bring them into the harbour except on a very favourable tide.  The Minister in reply to parliamentary questions over the past two years told me that this work would be carried out.  These industrious fishermen who are getting larger boats have no harbour into which to bring them and that is a very serious and discouraging position for fishermen who are anxious to live by the sea and by fishing and to supply our people with fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Bartley, made a very practical suggestion about larger boats.  Whether we like it or not we are definitely faced with the position where we will have to supply our fishermen with larger boats.  The day of going out into the small bays and catching fish as our grandfathers before us caught them is gone.  If we are to supply our people with fish and protect one of our national industries we must face the problem in a practical way.  I am not at all satisfied with this piecemeal method of dealing with the industry.  Compare our fishing industry with the fishing industries of countries which have built up the industry on a national basis and one finds that, especially in North County Dublin, the industry is dying fast and those families which have a long tradition of fishing are leaving and trying to secure <Col N="578" /> work elsewhere.  The reason they are going is that a number of them have often been hungry and often on the dole despite their efforts to make a living from the industry.  That should not be so in a country like ours.</P>

      <P>I will answer the Minister in a few minutes.  There is no use in our standing up talking and &ldquo;codding&rdquo; ourselves that we are doing this, that and the other for the industry.  We are doing nothing for it. The ordinary citizens are talking about the price of fish, as well they might, because, for the ordinary consumer, fish is a very expensive commodity. The fishermen tell you that they cannot get enough to pay for the transport of the fish.  What is wrong with all this marketing system?  Can nobody handle it in a practical national way?  Are we to remain at anchor without making any progress whatever?  We go to meetings and we listen to the grievances of the fishermen, and then we meet the housewife, who tells us that she cannot buy fish because it is a shocking price.  We meet other fishermen who tell us that their gear has been destroyed by foreign trawlers, and, when one makes <Col N="579" /> representations with a view to getting compensation for them, one finds that it is nobody's business and that the boat which should have protected them was away somewhere else.</P>

I am not trying to score any political points against the Minister in this matter.  The Minister may be in his present position for a while, but some other Minister will supersede him, and I hope that whoever takes on the job will handle it in a national way and will not measure the importance of that industry by the yardstick of a sum of £1,000 or £2,000.  We will have to put <Col N="580" /> the industry on its feet or let it die and import all the fish we need.  There is no use in &ldquo;codding&rdquo; ourselves in this matter.  This idea of depriving practical fishermen with a long tradition of fishing of the opportunity of securing a boat if they are unable to put down 10 p.c. is unnational and wrong.  Surely we have enough inspectors to enable us to find out all the circumstances, and if a practical case is put up by certain fishermen, these fishermen should get a boat, even though they are unable to put down the 10 per cent.</P>

      <P>I am not in the habit of interrupting Deputy Timoney. I was put out of the House some time ago for interrupting one Deputy once. I could delay the House for two hours in telling about the position of sea fisheries when we took over and about how difficult it was for the Sea Fisheries Association to encourage the fishermen at the time even to buy a decent boat and to get a type of boat more suited to them.  That was the big difficulty the officials found, because these fishermen were slow to get away from the old yawl they used.  They are now taking a more intelligent view, but at that time the boats had almost to be forced on them, because some of them had no experience of large boats.  In the 30-foot boats they had they could go to sea only on a reasonably fine day, but if we are to have an adequate supply of fish all the year round we will have to provide larger boats for our fishermen in which they can go to sea in bad weather.  We want to ensure a co-ordinated transport service for fishermen so that they will not have to depend on the Dublin market.  Reasonably good markets for fish could be developed in the large towns throughout the country.</P>

    <P>The Minister referred to quick freezing plant.  We have been advocating the installation of quick freezing plant <Col N="581" /> around the coast to deal with gluts of fish.</P>
    <P>The fish-canning industry should be improved and extended.  We have the raw material and if we had such an industry it would obviate the necessity to import canned fish.</P>

I would like to see the canning industry developed. That industry has good prospects. The same applies to the fish-meal industry, which has succeeded in other countries.  I am judging by reports from other countries.</P>
      <P>With reference to the private inquiry regarding the fishing industry, I agree with other speakers that private inquiries are not to be recommended, because if you go out in the open and have a public inquiry you will get constructive criticism, and possibly destructive criticism, but you will be able to discriminate between the good and the bad, and you will not have a report that is agreed to behind closed doors. While the men who have taken on tasks of that kind are honourable, decent men, from my experience of public life, I believe that a public inquiry is more beneficial than a private inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Muintir na Mara, as an organisation representing fishermen, has been trying to do its best.  It has tried in its own way to show up the grievances of the various fishermen and the need for boats, harbours, modern facilities and various other matters.  Possibly, at their last two general meetings <Col N="582" /> misunderstandings occurred, but that is only natural in the case of people who have grievances.  When they attacked the Sea Fisheries Association they were attacking an organisation set up by the Government, and instead of attacking the Sea Fisheries Association, they should have attacked the Government, because it is the Government who are responsible, and the Sea Fisheries Association are only carrying out the policy of that Government.</P>
    <P>We could be talking for a year, but it would do no good unless an enlightened view is adopted by the Minister and the Government in dealing with the Sea Fisheries Association, so that our fishermen will get decent boats, harbours, proper facilities, fishing tackle, and other things to catch their fish, and to help them to market the fish, so that the consumers will get fish at reasonable cost.  Under a constructive Minister and with a practical policy being carried out by the Department, we would be in the happy position that the fishing industry, instead of being worth a few hundred thousand pounds, would be worth £5,000,000 or £6,000,000 within the next few years.</P>

      <P>I could very easily repeat what I said on this Estimate two years ago, but I shall not waste the time of the House.  I would like to endorse what Deputy Collins has said about the need for having trawlers to enable the people to get a supply of fish.  I will read for the Minister a telegram I received from the Cork fish trade yesterday week: &ldquo;No fish in Cork yesterday.  No fish in Cork to-day, and prospect for the week hopeless.  Can anything be done?&rdquo; I had a talk with representatives of the Sea Fisheries Association, who told me that the Cork fish trade would get a supply of fish last Wednesday by importing it from England.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason they gave me was that there was a fog around Cork.  If the people of Cork City could not get a supply of fish in mid-summer, one can well understand what the <Col N="583" /> supply position would be throughout Cork County.  I am quite satisfied that the Minister is sufficiently aware of the necessity to do something.  I seriously suggest that we have never boldly endeavoured to deal with the fishing industry as we should.  Instead of spending £100,000, we should have spent at least £250,000 initially to see what could be done for the fishing industry.  I have in mind not only the 80,000 people in Cork but the people in the inland towns.  How much fish can they get?</P>
      <P>Deputy Bartley referred to the marketing of fish.  That is a matter to which the Minister should give some attention.  There is something wrong with the marketing of fish.  I picture Cork City, surrounded as it is with water, and with fishermen from Kinsale, Crosshaven, Ballycotton and Baltimore.  Yet, in mid-summer, for three days, in Cork City there was no fish.  If I were talking for another hour, there is nothing I could say that would be more convincing than that as to the need for a thorough examination of the activities of the Sea Fisheries Association. I will conclude with that because I am quite satisfied that the Minister will be sufficiently interested to deal with the matter.</P>

      <P>Most people in the country who are past middle age will remember that it was the general feeling that the fishing industry could be developed here to be a good second, at any rate, to the agricultural industry. I think that, since that time, over a period of 20 or 30 years I am speaking about, there have been people working on this question who were sincere about it and tried to get a solution.  I remember that the first time I got interested in this was when I saw in the paper <i>Sinn Féin</i> long ago that we taught the Scotch, that the Scotch had to come over here to learn the methods from <Col N="584" /> our fishermen and that the result was that you had a thriving industry in Scotland and for some reason or another our fishing industry had gone to the bad.</P>
      <P>I can say myself that, whilst I have not got anything like the intimate knowledge of the industry that Deputies like those who represent the Gaeltacht area have, I have been interested in it in a general national way.  I have always hoped that a solution would be found that would enable us, in the first instance, to supply the home market with the fish required directly for consumption, that we could have a canning industry associated with it to use any surplus, and that we could have even the fish-meal and so on associated with that as well.  There seemed to me always to be hope that these ideas or ideals could be realised.</P>
      <P>My first great shock was when I spoke to a man in this country who had a great deal to do with the fishing industry.  He tried to convince me that there was really no hope in a large way for the fishing industry here. His views were that, for a successful fishing industry, it was necessary to have a very large market and a very large fishing fleet.  The idea seemed to be that you would need a large market to which you could bring sufficient varieties of fish to meet regularly, through averaging, the constant and varied demand.  He felt that continuity was essential if the consumer demand was to be kept up.  He also pointed out that the larger boats would have to be based on places where they could get fuel supplies&mdash; in those days it was coal&mdash;and also the minor requirements for the industry. In other words, he tried to point out to me that, as far as this island was concerned, if there was to be a fishing industry, it would somehow have to be associated with or based upon a centre in England.  I must say that I thought that was absurd, though he held the view very sincerely from his practical experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister began to speak on this Estimate, I got a start, as he seemed to be directly interpreting a view that I had been considering for a <Col N="585" /> long time, that was the possibility of integrating&mdash;that was the word I used myself&mdash;the deep-sea fishing with the inshore fishing; in other words, using the large trawler for the deep-sea fishing and the smaller craft for the inshore, with the result that there would be an integration of the two.  He disposed of that, I suppose as a result of some careful examination of the question, and I am sure there must be really some good reason for doing that.</P>
    <P>Without going into much detail, I would like very much if the Minister could give us from his Department the sort of survey or report that we might expect from a commission of inquiry if it had been set up.  I am not a great believer in commissions of inquiry myself. I think that state Departments, running over a period of years, have an accumulation of knowledge which is probably quite sufficient for our purpose. They can give us the necessary survey.  The Minister himself indicated what could be done.  The first thing would be to show us the comparative fishing grounds, to show us what the possibilities of our own grounds are.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very valuable. I think information of that kind should be given to Deputies from the Department, so that they would have the broad view of these subjects which those whose business it is to consider these matters from day to day get as a result of their inquiries and their efforts.  The first thing we need always is some idea of the consumer demand here for fish.  I do not agree with the Minister when he said that nobody wants fish, or something equivalent to that, that we are not a fish-eating people, and so on.  That may be as a result of various things that have happened, but we would eat fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the average person likes to have variety in his diet and I do believe that our people would eat fish if they could get it as easily as they get other food.  Meat, for instance, is the one I have in mind.  The difficulty is that you do not get the regular supply and then there is the question of price.  I am glad to see that the Minister is a convert to protection in <Col N="586" /> one particular instance, at any rate. He apparently is an all-out protectionist so far as the fishing industry is concerned.  I welcome that from him.</P>
    <P>In the case of fisheries, however, there is more involved than protection from the outside competitors.  There is the question of the competition of other foods.  You have the competition of meat.  The question always will arise whether the alternative food to fish can be procured at a cheaper price relatively.  The complaints I have heard about fish in recent years have been that the relative prices are always too great, from the fish side, to make it a popular food.  Obviously, if the industry is to thrive we must have the demand from the consumers. That demand can be stimulated in a variety of ways.  It can be stimulated by education, but the best stimulus is to have it constantly available when required and to have it available at prices competitive with other foods.  I think neither of these things obtains at the present time.  I do not think that those who want fish can get it regularly when they want it or the type that they want, nor do I think that they can get it at a price that would be regarded as a competitive price with alternatives such as eggs or meat. I know that the prices of these alternatives are also high.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that because these were high there was a chance for fish&mdash; yes, if the price of fish can be brought down.  That can only come by efficiency in the fishing industry, in distribution and by some other things.  The first thing, obviously, is that we want a survey showing the extent of the demand, its local intensity and the varieties of fish for which there is a demand.  It would be valuable if we could get a clear idea of what varieties of fish are most favoured and as to what extent we can supply these varieties from our sea fisheries.  The next matter on which I should like to see a report is the question of the organisation of our markets.  Everybody knows that there is a tremendous difference between fresh fish and stale fish.  If you can get fish fresh&mdash;some fish, at any rate&mdash;it is a delightful <Col N="587" /> food.  If it is stale, it is the sort of thing you do not want to eat at all. The question is: Can we organise our marketing of fish so that we can have it fresh in the market and of the type of fish that is required?  I do not know what varieties are most in demand and I do not know fully what varieties we are capable of supplying regularly.  If we had a survey or a statement from the Department indicating these varieties, it would help anybody who might want to do some constructive thinking on this matter and, incidentally, it might help the Department itself to crystallise its ideas on these matters.</P>
    <P>In this country we have one day in the week which is a fish day.  At certain seasons we have additional days.  On these days we have a peak demand. It would be ideal if you could arrange to meet the special demand on these days and the normal demand on the other days.  I do not know how the one day, or Friday, peak can be met if you want the fish fresh.  The deep freeze, of which the Minister has been talking, has been thought of by many as a solution of our problems.  I do not know. As far as I am aware I have not eaten fish that has been subjected to the deep freezing process, and I do not know whether as a food it is as palatable or as nutritious as fresh fish. I doubt it.  I doubt very much if it is either one or the other.  If you want to stimulate a demand I think our main effort should be to try to supply the markets with fresh fish.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of the marketing, I would remind the House that regional marketing has been suggested. That is running counter, in my opinion, to the ideals of the man I mentioned earlier&mdash;the man who thought that a big central market was the most important thing we could have, but that a big central market was not, unfortunately, available with our population or in our circumstances at all.  Therefore, I do not know to what extent it is possible to meet the advantages of the large central market with those of regional marketing.  It appears absurd, as Deputy Bartley pointed out, that you should have fish sent from Galway <Col N="588" /> to Dublin and then sent back again to Galway.  There may be, in the end, a good reason for that procedure, but at first sight it does look a bit absurd.</P>
    <P>The next question, coming from the consumer to the market, is that of supply.  Personally I think it would be very desirable indeed if we could have around our coast people who have little holdings and who can, with fishing as a part-time industry, get a decent livelihood between the two. If that were at all possible it would be of great national advantage.  It would be particularly advantageous from the point of view of the Gaeltacht, which is affected very much by this problem, and it would be of social value too. One of the things that naturally disturb you when you are thinking of the Gaeltacht and the possibility, for example, of spreading the language from the Gaeltacht, and also from the point of view of rural depopulation, is that, in endeavouring to get rid of what we call the congested areas and to provide economic holdings there&mdash; which means enlarged holdings&mdash;we are, by that process, taking away the people from these areas.  At any rate, we are leaving fewer behind.  If you can plant them somewhere else, very well.  However, if the net result is that you take people from the land in those areas so that ultimately they will have to find a living elsewhere you are diminishing the number of people in the rural areas and, from the language point of view, you are diminishing the concentration of speakers of the language, which concentration, from the language point of view, is particularly valuable.  But if it were possible to develop the fishing industry so that you would have small holdings with a family being comfortably maintained by part-time fishing, it would be ideal.  It was for that reason that I welcomed, I may say, the approach of the Minister in regard to this particular question&mdash;provided he would not give up the idea of trying to integrate the deep-sea trawlers with the smaller inshore boats.</P>
    <P>I happened to be in one of the islands of the Hebrides some couple of years ago.  There was a great complaint there that some firm which used to send larger boats and get the supplies <Col N="589" /> that were caught locally, were making excessive profits and&mdash;the usual complaint&mdash;that the local fishermen were not getting a fair amount from it.  It seemed to me that there was a possibility that we might by State action organise so that, with the larger boats, we might do the outside fishing in order to obtain the particular type of fish we require as well as to obtain a greater certainty of supply&mdash; that we would base these at particular points, and use them as a means of helping and collecting and marketing some of the local catches.  That idea may come from not having as intimate a knowledge of the industry as those who are engaged in it locally.  It is an idea which, however, I should like to see investigated, and if it is impossible I should like to know why it is impossible.</P>
    <P>Generally, I have a feeling that we have not got down, as others have expressed here, sufficiently to the details of the organisation and particularly the question of marketing.  If marketing and demand were related properly to each other, then we would have an idea as to what would have to be done to meet the demand by way of supply.  The examination which, I am sure, the Department has made of our imports and so on over a number of years ought to give them the information which they could make readily available for us.  They have it, I am sure.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister does not regard this particular Department as a mere sideline of the Department of Agriculture. It is a most important Department and, if it can be developed, whoever does it will be doing a great national work.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to inland fisheries, too.  I listened very carefully, because on a previous occasion here I intervened in a debate.  I forget at the moment what gave rise to it, but it was a question of handing over the fishing rights to the riparian owners&mdash; those who owned the banks of the rivers.</P>

      <P>I was altogether against that; I felt it was doing the <Col N="590" /> wrong thing; I felt that, if we were going to proceed in that matter at all, we ought, when we took up these from private owners or groups, to keep them in public ownership and I think the Minister indicated that was what he proposes to do.  I think he is perfectly right in that.  I would have liked if the Minister developed more his ideas in that regard.  There are considerable difficulties in it.  I think his idea was to allow the owner to fish in his own particular stretch.  That looks all right at first, but certain areas on the rivers would be much more profitable than others and the point is how are you going to manage that and whether the fishing of the river as a whole might not be unduly interfered with by allowing a free hand to the owner immediately on the bank.</P>

      <P>The idea I had was that you would have lanes down from the road to the river bank and that these would be looked after by the public authority, whichever public authority it is.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of trespass, I do not know how the Minister proposes to deal with that.  There would be questions of trespass and the owners would be looking for some sort of compensation.  They would hardly regard being allowed to fish with rod and line as sufficient compensation for trespass along the bank if you are to have free fishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, on the whole, the idea of putting inland fisheries in charge of a public authority and proceeding somewhat along the lines indicated by the Minister is a good one.  I hope the inland fisheries can in that way be <Col N="591" /> satisfactorily developed.  I hope the best constructive thought that is available anywhere in the House will be devoted to this and that the best minds in the Civil Service, the best organising minds, will be devoted to developing this industry, because it is an extremely valuable one.  I do not think past failures to achieve success ought to deter us from going on trying.</P>

      <P>There is probably no Estimate on which it is so difficult to segregate established facts from argumentative statements of opinion as the Fisheries Estimate, or, indeed, on any consideration of our problems in connection with this industry.  Everywhere one looks, in any examination of the problem presented to those desirous of seeing a proper development of the fishing industry, anomalies and paradoxes crop up on every side.  For, I suppose, 15 or 20 years, I have held as axiomatic views which, on listening to people with first-hand knowledge of the industry, I am reluctantly compelled to discard.  There are, I think, however, a few things emerging from the present debate that present themselves, to me, at any rate, as being abundantly clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope neither the Minister nor Deputy de Valera will feel aggrieved if I say that, in my opinion, both of them have the same approach to this industry and that both of them are wrong for the same reasons.  Let me <Col N="592" /> put it this way.  I think it was on this Estimate last year&mdash;I am not quite sure, perhaps it was in a conversation I had with the Minister&mdash;that the Minister referred to the necessity for preserving amongst those engaged in the fishing industry their present pattern of life.  I think on another occasion he described it as the prime function of the Department of Fisheries to maintain and defend against all interests the livelihood of the inshore fishermen.</P>

Deputy de Valera to-day referred to the desirability of the development of that type of economy which we have at the moment and the extension of that type of economy where the agriculturist and small farmer of four or five days in the week is the fisherman of the other two.  With all respect to both the Minister and the Deputy, let me say that, in my view, is a completely wrong conception of the potential value to this country of the fishing industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>

      <P>In any event, Deputy de Valera and the Minister view our fishing industry as something small, something that is not to-be regarded in the same light as a big vital industry capable of increasing the wealth of the country.  They regard it as a sort of handmaiden to agriculture, and not as an industry in its own right. In my view the correct approach to the fishing industry is the biggest possible approach.  I know that the Minister has expressed&mdash;he expressed it last <Col N="593" /> year&mdash;a deep distrust and dislike of the idea of the creation of a deep-sea trawling fleet.  In my view it will be impossible for the Minister to make a job of this section of his Department until he gets rid of that mistaken idea.</P>
      <P>On the last occasion on which Deputy S. Collins spoke in this House&mdash;I think it was on the Estimate for the Department of Defence&mdash;I felt compelled, as a result of what he said, to attack him in the roundest and most unmeasured terms possible.  I should like to balance that attack to-day by saying that I have seldom listened in this House to a speech with which I found myself in more complete agreement than the speech which Deputy Collins made here to-day.  The Minister's statement of his view as to the prime function of his Department is one which, as far as it goes, I cannot quarrel with, but I do suggest to the Minister that by that statement he indicates that there his function ends, and he discloses by his statement his lack of any conception of fishing as an industry that is a good second, at any rate, to agriculture.  The fishing industry in Scotland and England is not a part-time industry.  It is a highly organised, well-capitalised industry which is earning big profits for British economy.</P>

      <P>That may be so at the moment, but I presume the Minister has seen a recent article in the <i>Economist</i> which ascribed the reason for that&mdash;the suggested flight of fish from the waters surrounding Britain and Ireland.  Has the Minister seen that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There were two articles. I am having them reprinted for the Deputy's information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may consider that that article provides an answer to the demand for a deep-sea trawling fleet.  My submission is that it does not, but that it merely underlines the necessity for a deep-sea trawling fleet.  The Minister seems to imagine always that there is necessarily <Col N="594" /> a conflict between the interests of the inshore fishermen and the idea of a deep-sea trawling fleet.  I cannot concede that point to the Minister at all. In my view a deep-sea trawling fleet would provide employment for members of families for whom there was no place in inshore fishing boats.</P>
      <P>The main cry which one hears from fishermen, whether they be from Donegal, Galway, Kerry or Cork, is for improved facilities, for improved fishing gear, for bigger boats, for slips and for harbours.  The Minister referred to the commission of inquiry which has been in existence for the past two years.  I think it would be of great assistance to the Minister if, instead of his commission of inquiry, he had some sort of fact-finding tribunal which would give him an answer to four or perhaps six of the questions that have been posed here by different Deputies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to do so before I finish.  Deputy de Valera touched, to my mind, on what is the real problem in this question; but, having touched on it, he did not follow it to its logical conclusion.  The real problem which the Minister has to face, the problem that faces the Irish fishing industry and upon the answer to which depends whether this industry can develop to the dimensions suggested by Deputy S. Collins, is the problem of creating an increased public demand for fish.  The Minister stated last year&mdash;I think he also stated it in the previous debate on this Estimate&mdash;that we were not a fish-eating people.  I would suggest to the Minister that part of his function should be to create that increased public demand for fish.  I am not suggesting that he should attempt to coerce people into eating fish, but I do suggest to him that he could pursue the policy which was pursued for some time in the past, namely, a propaganda campaign over the radio and through the newspapers to increase the consumption of fish at home.  The obvious answer is, of course, immediately made that Deputy Hickey complains that the people of Cork cannot get enough <Col N="595" /> fish.  But I suggest that the reason why the Cork people cannot get enough fish, and the reason why the Dublin people have to pay high prices for fish when there is a scarcity of supplies is that the people of Ireland do not normally eat enough fish.  That may sound like a paradox, but it is one of the paradoxes to which I referred at the outset of my remarks.  If we could create an increased demand for fish, a demand of a steady nature, then, in my submission to the Minister, the fishing interests, if assured of that steady demand and if assured of an expanding market, would so combine and organise as to ensure that the commodity which we now find so scarce and so dear was made available in greater quantities.</P>
      <P>The Minister states that the landings of fish are increasing.  The figures bear him out in that, and, as Deputy Bartley has pointed out, the public demand for fish is increasing.  All that I am asking the Minister to do is to assist in accelerating that increasing demand.  I would suggest to the Minister that the deep-freezing, to which he referred, canning and curing could be more extensively resorted to than is attempted at the moment.  I would suggest to him that there should be a fresh examination of the whole system of marketing fish.</P>
      <P>Above all, I would suggest to him that he get out of his head this prejudice against deep-sea trawling, and the idea that under no circumstances will our people become a fish-eating people.  Without having any statistics to support me and merely as a result of observation, I would say that the quantity of fish consumed by our nearest neighbours across the water has doubled in the last ten years and more fish is eaten in England to-day than ever before.</P>

      <P>My last opportunity for personal observation was 12 <Col N="596" /> months ago.  Deputy Bartley referred to the landing of imported wet fish in 1949&mdash;70,000 cwts.  To that, exception was taken rather vocally by Muintir na Mara.  I do not know the rights and wrongs of the dispute between the Sea Fisheries Association and Muintir na Mara, but were the Minister to set up such a fact-finding tribunal as I have suggested, we might get an elucidation of the causes of that dispute and the rights and wrongs of it.  Some of the questions which I would suggest the Minister should pose to this fact-finding tribunal would be: first of all, taking the over-all period of 12 months what increase in boats and personnel would be required to fill the existing demand for fish; secondly, to what extent would the industry require to be subsidised in order to be so expanded to meet that demand; thirdly, what is the number of towns, particularly in the Midlands, which never, or hardly ever, receive adequate supplies of fish?</P>

      <P>That is a complaint that is very seldom made about me. First of all, I would appeal to the Minister to realise that his primary job is to create an increased demand for fish. I would appeal to him to get out of his head the idea that we are not a fish-eating people and never will be a fish-eating people.  We have a good deal to learn from the French, Italians, and other continential peoples in so far as our dietary habits are concerned. In so far as the Minister has control of the Department of Fisheries, I would suggest that he should assist in that particular work.  I would like to urge upon him, too, what was urged so vigorously and ably by Deputy Seán Collins; that is the necessity for a deep-sea fishing fleet not controlled by any private interests, but controlled by some public authority set up under the aegis of the Minister's Department and operating not for private profit but in the interests of the people of this nation.</P>

      <P>We are being eternally told that we are not a fish eating people.  What encouragement do we get to be a fish eating people? Supplies are irregular.  Prices are rising.  I have here some of the prices that I got from a fish merchant in Cork.  He says that the price for cod here is ? per lb.; it is being sold in England for less than 1/- per lb.; plaice is 2/1 here and ½ in England. The fish merchants never receive anything like 50 per cent. of their requirements. As often as not they only receive 10 per cent.  As regards hake, they only get about 5 per cent. of their requirements.  Deputy Hickey told the Minister of a telegram which was received by all the Cork Deputies saying <Col N="598" /> that there was no fish available in Cork last week.  The Minister said there was a fog.  Judging by results, I think there must be a continuous fog.</P>

      <P>Imported fish.  May I point out to the Minister that in the first week of June 200 stones of British fish were imported into Cork City from Milford Haven?  Twice in June we had to import fish.  If that is the situation in the middle of summer what will it be like in the winter months?</P>
      <P>I am told that the total amount of fish handled by the Sea Fisheries Association last year was 70,000 cwts. That equals 2½ lbs. of fish per head per annum.  The actual consumption of fish is 7 lbs. per head.  Of that 2½ lbs. are got from the Sea Fisheries Association and 2½ lbs. are imported cured, canned and smoked fish, and the balance is made up by some other supplies. I have a letter here from a fish merchant in Cork in which he describes hake as the beefsteak of the fish trade and he says that the best hake fishing grounds in Europe are off the south Irish coast.  There are 300 British, 500 Spanish, several French and Belgian trawlers and not one Irish trawler fishing in these grounds.  The only hake we can get in Cork City is obtainable when one of these trawlers is disabled and comes into Cork.  Surely the Minister does not expect our people to be a fish-eating people if they have to pay twice the price that the English people have to pay for their fish and if they cannot get supplies regularly? I know this has been going on since before the Minister took office but it is only when Deputies are requested by merchants to approach the Department that these merchants are given a licence to import certain quantities of fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="599" /> Deputy Collins spoke about the necessity of providing larger boats and so far as I can see there is no other way out of this difficulty.  Is the Minister satisfied to have all these foreigners fishing off our coasts?  The Minister laughed when I mentioned the number, but there is no doubt that there is a much larger number of foreign trawlers fishing there now and the number is increasing all the time. It must be a profitable game for these people when they can come over to fish off the Cork coast and take fish back to sell in France and Spain, and even send some of it back here to be sold. I think there is something radically wrong with a state of affairs under which we, living in an island like this, are not able to supply our people with fish at a pretty reasonable price.  Most Deputies feel that they should not speak at great length on this debate and I have no intention of doing so either, but I would point out to the Minister that if he wants to get larger boats the people of Cork are in a position to build these boats for him.  We have docks there which are quite capable of building them, and the construction of these boats would provide much-needed employment while the docks are waiting for larger vessels to come in for repair.  Finally, I should like to impress upon the Minister that we shall never get our people to become a fish-eating people unless they have regular supplies and unless fish is made available at a price as reasonable as that at which it is sold over in England.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been pointed out by many Deputies that the fishing industry is second only in importance to agriculture and, as the present Minister has introduced a land rehabilitation scheme for the improvement of the land of this country, perhaps it would be no harm to suggest that in order also to promote the fishing industry, he should initiate what I might call a fishing project.  He has set aside £40,000,000 for the land project, and perhaps he could find money somewhere, even by deducting say at least £2,000,000 from that £40,000,000, for the improvement of the fishing industry. <Col N="600" /> We might consider the improvement of the fishing industry from the point of view first of all of the conditions under which fishing is carried on, the landing of the fish, the marketing of the fish, and the encouragement of the consumption of fish in larger quantities. Certainly, the Minister and his Department are doing all they can to provide the fishermen with proper boats and fishing gear.  Now that boats are being built in greater numbers, I hope that their distribution in the various fishing areas will be uniform, and that no particular area will get a larger number than that to which it is legitimately entitled.  I represent a very important fishing area and while numbers of applications have been made for the 50-foot boats, so far only one has been actually allocated and delivered.  We hope that in the near future we shall get at least four in the Cahirciveen area.  In connection with deposits, I know that under the last Government, a 50 per cent.  deposit was required to obtain boats and gear.  The present Minister reduced the deposit to 10 per cent. but at present, I understand, it is necessary to make a deposit of 20 per cent.  I hope that in the near future arrangements will be made by the Minister whereby at least a good fisherman will be able to get a boat on a deposit of 10 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>A special meeting of the Sea Fisheries Association has been called to deal with that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that but even with the 10 per cent. deposit, if there is a case of hardship and there is a fisherman with a good record, I would suggest that if he can make a deposit of 5 per cent., he should not be deprived of a boat so as to enable him to carry on his ordinary occupation.  In regard to the protection of fisheries, I would say that recently the work of protection has been very good but I do not know if the corvettes are really successful.  I understand they are rather expensive also, when being used in that capacity.  Might I suggest that fishermen here and there might be equipped with the necessary arms by which they would be able to deal with foreign trawlers when they come within <Col N="601" /> our territorial waters?  Perhaps they could be given special concessions or remuneration to carry out that work in addition to carrying on their calling as fishermen.  It has been suggested that the three-mile limit might be extended to five, seven or ten miles, but I do not see what would be the object of that if we cannot sufficiently protect our waters within the three-mile limit.  Some Deputies seemed to be in favour of deep-sea trawling but personally I fail to see how deep-sea trawlers and inshore fishermen can carry on side by side.  In this country, where you have had not such a big demand up to the present at any rate for fish, my idea would be that with deep-sea trawling you would have a glut of fish from that source alone and there would be no market for fish coming from the inshore fishermen. The result would be eventually that the inshore fishermen would be wiped out and that would be disastrous.  I hope that the Minister, in his wisdom, will not bring about that situation by which the inshore fishermen would be. wiped out for the sake of the deep-sea trawling.</P>
      <P>As to the landing of fish, it is necessary that we should have suitable piers and slips.  While it is not exactly the duty of the Minister for Agriculture and his Department to erect and improve piers, still I would like to draw his attention to the Reenard Point Pier at Cahirciveen in connection with which an inspection was made two years ago by the engineers from the Board of Works.  While the sum necessary, namely, £64,000, has not been exactly allocated, I understand that the Fishery Department has to make some report in the matter. Perhaps the delay in connection with that report is holding up the improvement and expansion of the pier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is a matter connected with net fishermen who were deprived of their nets under a recent Act of Parliament. I understand that some of these have not yet been compensated. In some cases that may be their own fault in not supplying the information required, but as these people were deprived of their calling there should not be any undue delay in giving them <Col N="602" /> the compensation to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>In connection with the protection of fishermen, it would be well if some look-out stations were manned and equipped around the coast.  While we have one in Bray Head in Valentia and one at Bolus Head, they are still, more or less, derelict, but could very easily be set in order.  Perhaps if they had been in working order some months ago the tragic drowning accident which occurred there might not have taken place.  Of course, that is a matter for the Department of Industry and Commerce, but if the Minister would make a recommendation that it should be looked into I am sure it would hasten matters.  On the whole, I must say that the fishermen feel that the Minister and his Department are doing their best under difficult conditions. They have such great confidence in the present Minister that they feel sure that, within a certain period, everything possible will be done for the welfare of the fishermen so that they can successfully carry on their work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="Mr. Breslin Mr. Breslin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Breslin</NameTxt>
      <P>As everybody is aware, this Vote is of the utmost importance to thousands of fishermen around our coasts.  Even at the best of times fishermen eke out a very precarious livelihood in following their calling.  During the years of the war the fishing industry enjoyed a certain amount of prosperity. Despite the difficulties of that period and the shortage of boats, gear and oil, the fishermen did pretty well on the whole.  Now that we have entered on more normal times and are meeting with a good deal of outside and up-to-date competition, many people in close touch with it feel that the industry is now passing through its testing time and that the organisation behind the fishing industry is passing through a very severe test.  The Minister will recollect that after the 1914-18 War the prosperity that the fishermen enjoyed during that period was followed by a disastrous slump during which hundreds of fishermen around our coasts sold their boats and gear and got out of the industry.  None of us wants that to recur in the years that lie ahead.  We want to see the industry <Col N="603" /> prosper and a good many more fishermen engaged in it than there are to-day.</P>
      <P>I said here before and I repeat that we are only nibbling at this question of the fishing industry.  If successive Governments were in earnest about developing the industry and building it up as we would like to see it built up in this island of ours, we should have a separate Ministry for Fisheries and let the Minister devote all his attention to building up what should be in the first three of our industries in this country.  After agriculture, I would say that fishing should be one of the most important industries and that this should be one of the most important Estimates coming before the House.  If Deputies were paying proper attention to it, this Estimate would be debated here for some days. Other countries have built up, under great difficulties, a great fishing industry and the same should be possible here.  When I say that we should have a separate Ministry, I do not for a moment intend to disparage the present Minister in any way.  I feel that the Minister for Agriculture has so much to do and so many things to look after, as was evident during the last three weeks during the debate we had on his Estimate, that he cannot give to this industry the attention that it certainly deserves. All Governments seem to agree on one point, namely, that fisheries should be handled as rather the Cinderella of Governments and should be debated with agriculture.  Until we have that separate Minister and separate Department dealing with this important industry I do not think that we will get anywhere so far as building up the industry is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the good work which the Sea Fisheries Association has done in the past, and undoubtedly it has done a great deal to help the fishing industry, we in Donegal feel that it does not pay proper attention to the cured herring fishing, which for years has been the backbone and the mainstay of the industry in Donegal.  We contend that the association leaves it to the fishermen themselves to look after that <Col N="604" /> important part of the industry and we think that the time has now come when it should pay a good deal more attention to that branch of the fishing industry and help the fishermen to get markets and also guarantee a minimum price for the herrings.  If the herringfishing industry fails in Donegal, it will have a disastrous effect on the fishing industry generally.  For years the cured-herring industry and the work in connection with the catching of herrings in Donegal have employed thousands of people and we are afraid that if something is not done to ensure that the herring industry is given some attention by the Sea Fisheries Association it will lead to more emigration.</P>
    <P>I agree with other Deputies who have spoken on the question of the home market.  The home market has not been developed at all and the Minister should pay more attention to developing that end of the business.  There are various towns that certainly would buy fish if there were any facilities to ensure that supplies would be fairly regular.  It is a very strange thing that even in the maritime County of Donegal if hotels want to ensure a sufficient supply of fish they must order it from Dublin.  In many instances, we have fish from Killybegs and other ports being sent to Dublin and from there being sent back to hotels in Donegal. That shows very poor organisation and the association responsible for it is not deserving of very much credit.  There may be difficulties in the way, but the association has taken over this problem and it is up to it to find a remedy and to ensure that the various towns throughout the country that will be only too glad to get fish, not alone on a Friday, but on one or two other days of the week, will have supplies made available for them.</P>
    <P>I also agree with those Deputies who have talked about the importation of fish.  It is an extraordinary thing that after so many years of native government we still have to import sufficient fish for our markets.  If our industry had been looked after there would be no need to import fish, and it is an extraordinary situation that we still have to carry on that same old method.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="605" /> I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the need for helping the fishermen by erecting piers and slipways in various parts of Donegal.  We have from time to time made application to the Department for grants, and in that connection I should like to say that the Donegal County Council has never yet turned down one of these applications when they found out from their engineer that it was needed, but the Department often inform us that they have examined the question and that their information is that the fishing industry in the particular area would not justify the expenditure.  Our point is that if we had a slip or pier at the particular point in respect of which we had made application the expenditure would certainly be justified, because the fishing industry would benefit and more fish could be caught if the fishermen had landing-places at various points on our rocky coasts.  We get that reply from time to time and it is a reply with which we are not at all satisfied, because we who have local knowledge know where the fishing grounds are and know where the piers should be situated.  Where the Department cannot see their way to give a large grant for the erection of a pier, I would ask the Minister to consider the building of small slips which would be very useful for the landing of catches by small boats.  All these things have a bearing on the fishing industry and we should help these fishermen in the matter of landing-places and in the matter of making the existing landing-places safer.</P>
    <P>County Donegal has recently been responsible for focussing the attention of the Government and of the Minister on this question of poaching by foreign trawlers, and we hope steps will be taken in the future to ensure that no foreign trawler will be allowed to patrol for half a day or a whole day within three miles of our coast.  That has been and is being done, and, as I say, some of these trawlers spend 24 hours, and others less, trawling within one or two miles of the shore, and if the people lose their tempers, it is only natural.  I hope that from now on steps will be taken to ensure that this will be stopped, and that our own <Col N="606" /> fishermen will be enabled to enjoy the fruits which are being taken elsewhere by these foreign trawlers.</P>

      <P>Anybody listen ing to the Minister's introductory statement on the Vote for Agriculture, as I did, and to his introductory statement last night on this Vote will have noticed the marked contrast between the two statements.  It struck me very forcibly that his speech on agriculture showed, as befitted the occasion, profound care and preparation.  It was a speech which was obviously well prepared, but it was evident to me, and I am sure to others, that the dynamic drive and energy which was written all over that statement was entirely missing from the Minister's speech last night on Fisheries.  The speech, to my mind, was very largely a defence of the Sea Fisheries Association and, to some extent, a denunciation of certain individuals attached to Muintir na Mara.  I speak on behalf of the ordinary member of the public, and I suggest that the public are not interested in any way in the Sea Fisheries Association, as such, or in certain members of Muintir na Mara. They are, however, seriously concerned with the fact that they have not got an adequate supply of fish and that, when fish is available, it is available only at prices beyond the amount which the ordinary housewife can pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My purpose in rising to speak in this debate is to disturb the feeling of complacency which characterised the Minister's speech.  He seemed to indicate that things were not too good but were not too bad and that we should leave them alone.  That was largely the policy.  I have been listening to speeches on this Vote for a considerable number of years and I am bound to say, in the light of what I heard last night, that no great improvement can be recorded.  All previous holders of this office seemed to move along in the same way as we are now moving and I am convinced that the view I have held for some time is correct, that is, that Fisheries is the unwanted stepchild of the Department of Agriculture. I agree thoroughly with Deputy Breslin when he suggests that there <Col N="607" /> should be a break away from the present form of administration.</P>
    <P>Is it not obvious, since fish cannot be secured throughout the year in the quantities in which it should be secured and can be secured only at prohibitive prices in many cases, there is something radically wrong with the whole organisation?  This is particularly the case since round about the middle 20's.  One has only to examine the figures of the personnel in the fishing industry in 1925 and to compare it with the position which obtains to-day to see the startling position that personnel, so far as full-time occupied fishermen are concerned, have halved and part-time fishermen have decreased by 25 per cent.  It is suggested&mdash;and this is always the excuse, no matter what Minister is in office&mdash;that we are not a fish-eating people.  That is perfectly true, but how could it be otherwise?</P>
    <P>Some Deputies expressed an interest in the exact figures and I have gone to some trouble to find out what the position is in regard to consumption here and to relate it to the position in other countries which might be looked upon as being similarly circumstanced. According to a return issued by F.A.O. for 1947-48, the consumption of fish per head per annum in Denmark is 28½ kilograms, a kilogram being a fraction over two lbs.; in Sweden, 23¼ kilograms; in what is known as the United Kingdom, 13¼ kilograms; New Zealand, 11½ kilograms; Ireland, an island nation, 2¾ kilograms.</P>
    <P>To dismiss the question, therefore, simply that we are not a fish-consuming community is merely to ignore the problem altogether.  As Deputy de Valera pointed out, there is one day in the week that is, for obvious reasons, meatless.  I put it to the Minister&mdash;and no one knows it better than he does because he knows the traditions of the country&mdash;how many families in the country can rely on a fish dinner as an alternative to meat on Friday?  Rural Deputies in the House will answer that fish, as far as the rural community is concerned, is practically nil.  I know small towns <Col N="608" /> and villages&mdash;some of them, mark you, along the coast&mdash;where practically the whole year round fish is unobtainable.</P>
    <P>That is a deplorable position, but it has not arisen during the past 12 months or during the past two years or five years.  The position, in fact, was somewhat better shortly after we got our own Government and I would quote, in particular, the period from 1925 to show that, after a long extension of home government, the home fishing industry has deteriorated.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that there will have to be a radical change.  I agree that as the Minister presides over one of the most important, if not the most important and difficult Ministries in the State, with his hands fully occupied right, left and centre, and with new schemes like the rehabilitation scheme thrust upon him, it is utterly absurd to think that with all these responsibilities he can also deal with what is regarded as&mdash;if not an equally important industry&mdash;the nonetheless very important industry of fishing.  I suggest that the industry has suffered because of lax administration from the top.  We need somebody in this House&mdash;if not a Minister, a Parliamentary Secretary or a person of that type&mdash;who will be here at call to give the House an account of the stewardship in the Ministry more often than unfortunately is the case at the present time when the only discussion on fisheries occupies three or four hours in the year.  Until we have a person of that type and until the House as a whole, irrespective of Party, insists on a change of that kind, you will have the miserable presentation of the fishery position that we have to-day and that was presented, I am sorry to say, in that form last night.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately in this House, on this Vote, as on the Vote for Agriculture, we have to face again the position of the square peg in the round hole.  I appreciate the speech made by Deputy Martin O'Sullivan, but I would like to point out to him that a large portion of the responsibility is his and his alone.  Speaking at the conclusion of this Estimate on <Col N="609" /> the 25th May, 1949 (column 1991 of the Official Debates), the Minister stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Remember, we are not a fish-eating people.  Since 95 per cent. of us are good, pious Roman Catholics, we have to eat fish on Friday, but we are damned if we will eat it any other day.  I would not eat fish if I could get out of it.  I detest fish. Why anyone should feel bound to eat fish I do not know.  I detest the stuff and I always did.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Speaking on this Estimate last year I drew the Minister's attention to a few matters, and I would like to know what has been done since.  The first was the position with regard to Ballycotton. I pointed out to him in column 1978:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have been approached in this matter by the Ballycotton Development Association on a few occasions and I have been informed that the man in charge there is not prepared to recommend the purchase of any extra boats in the district until the pier there is extended and protection afforded to those boats.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Representing portion of the tax-paying area which must pay for these boats, <Col N="610" /> I want my share for my constituents. The present boats have no protection and they are being damaged and damaged severely.  I mentioned the matter one year and gave the Minister 12 months&mdash;I said I did not want to press him as I wanted to give him a chance&mdash;to have the pier extended.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle himself is aware that the matter was brought to the attention of Cork County Council by me and we sent recommendations to the Minister in that respect, but we have not heard from the Fisheries Department since.  It is about time that this Department woke up from the Methuselah state it is in.  As Deputy O'Sullivan said, if somebody took charge of it and woke it up we would find ourselves getting somewhere.</P>
    <P>In that little village we have some of the best sailors, I might say, in the world.  We have men there who must on several occasions each year risk their lives going out in the lifeboat to rescue distressed ships off the coast. They got the very highest honours for their work in that respect that could be given in either of the two islands.  There is no protection for them or anybody else at that pier.  We are now in the position that the young men growing up have no further room.  If they buy a boat, there is no place in which to keep it and, as I pointed out on the last Estimate, we will lose these young men, one by one, who have to go elsewhere to earn a livelihood which they are denied at home.  That is why I am concentrating as far as possible on this one spot.  If I am put to the trouble of having to get up here again on the question of Ballycotton pier I will give trouble enough in this House in regard to it, both on the Adjournment and otherwise.  I can stand for so much, but I will not stand for it all.</P>
    <P>Although we pointed out to the Minister the position as regards foreign trawlers, he came along with a smiling face to tell us that they only came in for shelter in stormy weather.  I am sorry the Minister is not in the House. I had an amusing experience a month or a fortnight afterwards of seeing Deputy Con Lehane very busily engaged in Bantry canvassing nine <Col N="611" /> Spaniards for votes for Deputy Murphy. Those gentlemen are only distressed persons coming in for shelter! I am sorry the Minister did not succeed in getting as far as Bantry, but anyone who travelled the town of Bantry during the election period would be struck by the fact that some 25 per cent. of the population there at that period were the crews of either French or Spanish trawlers, and there is no fear that they were trawling outside the three-mile limit and there is no good in pretending that they were.</P>
    <P>It is a scandalous state of affairs that while we have facilities for the supply of all our needs in fish we should have to pay foreigners £300,000 or £400,000 a year for foreign fish. There is no justification for it.  There is a livelihood there for our own people and our own people are entitled to the facilities.</P>
    <P>I, in common with other Deputies from Cork, got a round-up last week in connection with the position there. Last Tuesday I happened to go to what we call the English market in Cork and travelled around the stalls.  At every step I was stopped and asked to look at the condition of the stalls and was told that they had nothing to offer the people except salmon at 7/- a lb.  I saw that for myself.</P>
    <P>Because the Minister does not like fish and would not be seen dead along-side it, like wheat, does not mean that other people who have a different taste from the Minister would not like a bit of fish for their breakfast or their tea. Fish is a luxury to-day for the rural community.  It cannot be got at all, good, bad or indifferent.  I am being quite frank.  I am not blaming the present Government for it.  I say that the present Government made a mistake when they put in charge the man that they did put in charge; but that is all.  Imagine any Minister in charge of a Department expressing himself in such a manner in this House.  It was not in one of his wild periods, before he was brought into control and the curb and the bit put on his jaws, as in agriculture; it was on 25th May, 1949, when, speaking as <Col N="612" /> Minister for Agriculture from that seat there, he said he hated fish, that he disliked the stuff.  That is a very bad lead from a Minister in charge of that particular Department.  The Minister should at least control his tongue.  I may not be too good a hand at controlling my own at times but, thank God, I am free of all responsibility except responsibility to my own people.</P>
    <P>I may say-that-the fishing industry has been a neglected industry.  There is very little use in talking about protecting the inshore fishermen against the trawling fishermen when you import £300,000 to £500,000 worth of fish.  There is £500,000 to be earned by somebody in this country rather than abroad.  That is my anxiety.  I do not want to take up the time of the House in regard to it, but I hope to hear from the Minister the definite reasons why he has taken no steps in regard to Ballycotton pier.  I do not want to be put to the trouble of having to raise this matter here by question and on the Adjournment, and if I am not successful in that way, I will get some other means of raising it that will be very distasteful to the Minister concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to stress the point in regard to inshore fishermen as against deep-sea trawling.  I believe that if we can encourage the smaller men along the coastline, even with smaller craft, to carry on their economy and maintain their little holdings and at the same time eke out an existence as fishermen, it is the best in the long run.</P>
      <P>The larger craft could be worked on a commercial basis supplying large centres and would help to compete against the foreign trawlers but, if you put one system in competition with the other, you will defeat the whole object of your economy and destroy the livelihood of the small men around the coast who are the backbone of the Gaeltacht and of the fishing industry in those districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point that I made some time ago in regard to handing over fisheries to riparian owners has been raised here to-day.  I regret to state that <Col N="613" /> the Minister seems to forget the fundamental point in that regard.  In one statement he claims that under his new proposal he is prepared to establish what he calls a central fishery board, a central authority, and that he is prepared to recognise farmers as owners and, in the next breath, he states that, even though he recognises them as owners, he is not allowing them to establish their right; he is not allowing them to develop fisheries adjacent to their own lands.  I claim the fundamental point is missed there.  Why talk about restoring their right if you do not allow them to develop their right, or to use their right as riparian owners? I think that is a fundamental point and that the State should not come in and dictate to those men.  The Minister went so far as to say that he would allow them to fish with a rod and line up their land.  That would give them the same right as a tourist from outside.  I admit at the same time that it would be essential for the State to develop a stretch of river and get all to co-operate.  If these men are to be denied the right they should have at all times, that is, the right to these fisheries which were taken from them by landlords 60 or 80 years ago, that will be against all fundamental democratic principles.  I will refer to that when the Minister is bringing in his new proposal.</P>
    <P>There is a question on compensation for men who were deprived of netting on fresh waters.  Under previous legislation, certain difficulties arose, and I understand the Minister is now bringing in an amending Bill to clarify some of those points.  I appreciate that.  As a matter of fact, in our district in County Kerry the workers were compensated but received compensation as low as £40 or £50 for a long period of work for the owner of the fishery. That is all they received in some of those cases.  I would like to make that point when the matter is being introduced, that these men should get some reasonable compensation.  The rate of compensation allowed under that Act was not at all in keeping with the years of employment of these men in the particular fresh water fisheries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="614" /> I am in agreement with all the Deputies who referred to the provision of facilities for fishermen&mdash;slipways and piers.  I am glad that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance is present, as I understand that there would be co-operation there between the Department of Fisheries and the Department of Finance.  In that way, we can appeal to both Departments to make grants available for the provision of slipways and the repair of piers.  We have sent in several applications from County Kerry in regard to these matters.  I had several motions before the Kerry County Council asking the Department to consider these proposals, as the fishermen in some cases were not able to land safely.  In another case, in Cromane, County Kerry, where men engaged in salmon fishery wanted boulders removed from the fishing grounds, it would cost £200 to £300 to clear them, and we have not received any consideration of it.  That is my contention on this Estimate.</P>
    <P>The question of marketing has been raised.  In Cahirciveen we have a development association which put up proposals to the Minister in regard to a freezing plant.  I claim that, in the period when you have a glut of fish, if you have a plant like that in an area, with proper facilities for storage, you could then transport fish to all the towns inland.  If the Cork, Donegal and other areas round the coast have such plant and equipment, there could be an all-the-year-round delivery from those points inland, which would prevent the imports of fish from outside in the slack period. The American system is well worthy of consideration and our people in Cahirciveen recommended to the Minister to consider the new type of freezing plants now on sale and offered by the American people, which would be very suitable for our trade here and for this type of development.  We worked it out in detail and gave the costings and the accommodation.  In Cahirciveen, as well as in other districts&mdash;in Dingle, for instance&mdash;at certain periods there is a glut of fish and it is a question of rush and hustle to try to get it away to Dublin or across channel, perhaps <Col N="615" /> at not very satisfactory prices. Whereas, if we had some alternative, a system whereby you could deal with a greater quantity of that glut of fish and utilise it for distribution at a later date, that would help towards a solution. At any rate, it would be well worth consideration.  It would solve all our difficulties in regard to the complete exclusion of imports.  Perhaps there would have to be imports of fish at some stage, but I would like to make that point.</P>
    <P>On the point made by Deputy Palmer about fishing boats, we have made certain recommendations from time to time with regard to fishermen along the coast and I would like to support Deputy Palmer in regard to that matter.  We seem to have got&mdash;except in one case&mdash;no response or satisfactory recognition of our claims on behalf of the fishermen down there. There again, I appreciate the difficulties and know that the Minister and his Department are doing their utmost to meet us, but we still persist in making the claim that we must get our quota, as in common with all other areas we are entitled to it.</P>
    <P>I believe that some adjustment in regard to the sea fisheries is necessary. I am not criticising the Sea Fisheries Association unduly.  I know that probably the system under which they operate is difficult, but I think the time is opportune, especially when the Minister is contemplating new legislation in regard to a central fishery authority, to make some adjustment of the whole fishery organisation of this country, including the sea fisheries.  He will probably re-establish it on different lines and have more co-operation from other sections of the fishing industry than at the moment.  Until something is done in that direction, there is no good in criticising unduly or in blaming them for one thing or another without being fully conversant with the facts.  I am not in a position to criticise any section of that organisation, because I have not the full facts.  I want to say again that the Minister, his Department and this Government &mdash;and every Government which we have had in this country so far&mdash;regard the <Col N="616" /> Fisheries Department as a sort of a sideline, with the result that it is not getting its proper place in our economy, in our Departments and in our Government which it should get.  It is tied up with agriculture.  I support the suggestion that it should be a separate Department, because I feel that it is not receiving the respect to which such an important industry is entitled. Unless that is done and unless you have a new outlook altogether and a new personnel attached to the organisation and work of that Department, you will find Deputies coming back here year after year and making the same statements on this Estimate.  Almost every Deputy who spoke on this Estimate to-day has more or less reiterated statements which he made on the same Estimate 12 months ago.  I was present in the House then and, with very slight adjustments, it is obvious that the same line of thought exists to-day as existed then, and the same type of criticism which was made then was made again to-day.  That in itself proves that there has been no advance&mdash;that we are coming back and blaming one section of the organisation as against another. Unless the Minister comes along, as he did in connection with the land rehabilitation scheme, and says: &ldquo;I want £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 for this Department,&rdquo; we cannot hope for very much.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBrennan" hpid="Mr. T. Brennan Mr. T. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is conceded by everyone that, this country being an island, the fishing industry is second only to that of the basic industry of the country, agriculture. In the old days of Sinn Féin the industry was considered of such high importance and as having such great potentialities that when the first Dáil was setting up the different Ministers it was decided that fisheries should have a separate Department.  That position obtained during the lifetime, I think, of the first Dáil and of the second Dáil.  We got control over most of our country in 1922, and I do not consider that the fishing industry was involved in any controversy as between ourselves and Great Britain at the time of the Treaty.  I think we had full control to deal with the matter of fisheries.  Why we ever allowed that all-important industry to be regarded <Col N="617" /> as worthy only of a subsidiary Department, with only one Minister to deal with another Department and it I do not know.  We have now had 26 or 28 years' experience of the system whereby the fishing industry has been controlled either under a single or a dual Ministry.  We have had a number of years' experience of the Sea Fisheries Association.  Despite all that experience, it is obvious to-day that our fishing industry and its potentialities have not been taken advantage of.  Those potentialities, as they appeared to those who were responsible for the establishment of this State&mdash;if they were ever there&mdash;have not, apparently, been taken advantage of. I am not going to apportion blame in any way.  I do not feel I am qualified to do so.  The fact is that this all-important industry has not been taken advantage of and developed properly, with the result that it has made no strides worth talking about during the 26 or 28 years of the lifetime of this State.  Can we give any reason why the industry has not been developed on a larger scale? To start with, we have not fully developed either the distribution or the marketing of fish, and perhaps that is one of the reasons why the industry is not quite what it should be.  We must now ask ourselves why we have not looked after these aspects of the matter.  There must be some good reasons, and I should like to hear the Minister tell us why the distribution and marketing of fish throughout the country has not been developed not alone since he came into office but during the years since the foundation of this State.  The fact that these steps were not taken reacts not alone against the proper development of the industry but also, in different ways, against the fishermen.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies have complained about the excessive price of fish at present.  My information is that, in so far as fish landed by the fishermen who have boats from the Sea Fisheries Association is concerned, it is sold and must be sold at a controlled price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those fish are sold, and must be sold, at a controlled price.  They are sold in the Dublin market by some representative of the Sea Fisheries Association. <Col N="618" /> When there is a plentiful supply of fish, the controlled price is not realised, for the simple reason that there is plenty of fish in the market, and I suppose the demand controls the price.  In some cases fish may be sold 50 or 60 per cent. under the controlled price.  The retailer who buys that fish from the fisherman, if I am informed correctly, at 20, 30, 40 or 60 per cent. under the controlled price, when selling that fish over the counter to the ordinary housewife, gets his full controlled retail price, so that when the Almighty sends a plentiful supply of fish those engaged in the industry have to put up with the slump price, but the people who eat the fish still have to pay the same price.  I think that is wrong.</P>
    <P>I am glad to know that the Minister is about to take steps to meet a situation such as this.  When we have a plentiful supply of fish, and there is a surplus over the amount required, the surplus fish should be stored in certain areas throughout the country, so that when the lean period occurs there will be a plentiful supply of fish for the country as a whole, thereby obviating the necessity of the Sea Fisheries Association or any other responsible authority having to import fish during the lean period.  That, to my mind, would be one way of developing the sea fishing industry.  It would be one way of meeting the demand for fish, and it would play a very important part in helping those engaged in the rather hazardous work of fishing.</P>
    <P>Take the price of a boat at the present time.  The cost of an average boat, with modern gear, I am informed, is somewhere in the region of £5,000.  Of that £5,000 the applicant has to lay down £1,000.  He agrees to sell his fish to the Sea Fisheries Association and the repayment of the £4,000 is made to the association by way of a percentage or portion of the catch.  That individual has a big outlay, if I am informed correctly, between insurance and other items. Indeed, the cost to the boat owner would be in the region of £300 or £330 a year.  He has already deposited £1,000, and there is handed over to him £4,000 of public money, representing <Col N="619" /> the value of the boat.  Every step should be taken by the Sea Fisheries Association or the Fishery Department, or whoever is responsible for the recoupment of such money as I have referred to, namely, £4,000, to ensure that the boat owner gets every opportunity to make his living by the boat and is placed in a position to meet current expenses in the running of the boat and honour his obligations with regard to the £4,000, in the shortest possible period.</P>
    <P>One reason why we should have storage stations distributed all over the country is because that man, having put down £1,000 and received a boat worth £5,000, of which £4,000 is public money, should be guaranteed at all times a price for his fish; let the demand be there or not for all the fish he catches, he should receive a price commensurate with what would give him a decent livelihood and place him in a position to meet his current expenses.  He should receive that price for all fish, and the quantity of fish not utilised or in demand should be put in cold storage and distributed to the public during the lean fishing periods which we have generally over the year. There is an obligation on the responsible body to ensure that that man is placed in a position to repay the money to the general public purse within a reasonable period.  At the same time, he should be given an opportunity to make a decent living for himself.</P>
    <P>I understand, on the question of importing fish, that certain nonnational bodies can register in this country, and the very fact that they can register gives them a licence to come into the Port of Dublin or somewhere else and dump their fish.  That should not be allowed, because if we want to develop the fishing industry, we must give encouragement to those engaged in it.  We must give them some incentive and we must save them from outside interference in every way we can in order to ensure that, whatever be the result of their work, the fish they catch will be disposed of in the best interests of the individual and <Col N="620" /> in the best interests of the community. Why should we allow non nationals, when it suits them, to come in here and dump their fish at the Port of Dublin or at some other port in competition with the fish caught by our own nationals?  To allow that to happen is not playing the game with our own people and is not giving them the protection to which they are entitled. The Department should be concerned to see that, when public moneys are handed over to those engaged in the fishing industry to purchase boats, the purchasers are put in a position to enable them to repay the loan they get which, in some cases, represents four-fifths of the cost of a boat.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I wish to direct the Minister's attention, and that is the necessity for carrying out improvements to our harbours so that our fishermen, when they have catches of fish, will be able to land them without either a risk to their boats or to themselves personally.  In the case of Arklow Harbour, we have what is known as a sand bar.  It silts up perhaps two, three or four times in the year, with the result that neither fishing boats nor commercial boats can get in or out of the harbour.  That has occurred from time to time when there were plentiful supplies of fish outside the harbour.  In that situation the boats could not go out.  On other occasions, it has happened that when the boats had good catches they could not risk entering the harbour, and so had to go to Wicklow or some other port to make a landing of the fish.</P>
    <P>The bar has been in a very bad state this year.  Thanks to the three Departments concerned&mdash;the Fisheries Department, the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Board of Works&mdash;the service of a dredger was secured.  The work of dredging went on during the winter, but the work was only half done, when the <i>Faugh a Ballagh</i>, the dredger concerned, was recalled for repairs.  I know that we have the sympathy of the Fisheries Department so far as the dredging of the harbour is concerned.  I am taking advantage of the presence of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister <Col N="621" /> for Finance who is in charge of the Board of Works, which is concerned in this, to refer to the matter.  It is a pity that the job was only half done. It would be a greater pity still if, during these summer months, the work of dredging was not completed.  If its completion is not resumed until the winter months, the value of the dredging already carried out will be rendered useless.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know about that.  I have first-hand information about it.  At any rate, at the moment the channel half-way across, or perhaps a little more than half-way, is clear; but the remaining portion has still to be cleared.  If the dredger were available, it would be desirable to have the work carried out and the job finished in the summer months.  If that were done, we possibly could look forward to another 12 months before appearing before the Minister again to ask him to use his influence to have the bar cleared again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have a proposition to put up to the Minister in regard to that too.  At the moment I am speaking about keeping the bar open until such time as the big job, which we hope will eventually be carried out, is set on foot.  I hope, if the Minister is there, that he will be 100 per cent. in support of us in getting that big job done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasBrennan" hpid="Mr. T. Brennan Mr. T. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not expect that because I think you will be a lucky man if you are there for two more years.  I am urging on the Minister how important it is for the harbour commissioners in Arklow to have this job completed during the summer months.  I understand that the <i>Faugh a Ballagh</i> will not be available until late in August or early in September. <Col N="622" /> That might be too late to start completing this job.  If the <i>Faugh a Ballagh</i> is not available, then I suggest that a proposal, backed by the Minister, should be put up to the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Board of Works to have a Dutch dredger employed on the completion of this job.  If it were undertaken now it probably would be completed in three weeks, but if the work is delayed until mid-August or early September it will mean making a fresh start all over again on the work that was undertaken last December. I might mention that the cost of the dredging that was carried out from the 1st December last until some time in May was between £8,500 and £9,000, of which the harbour commissioners had to pay £750.  That sum is hanging like a rope around their necks and will continue to do so until they are able to collect enough revenues to pay it off.  I would ask the Minister to give every help he can to ensure that the dredging of the bar will be completed before the bad weather breaks.</P>
      <P>If we have to wait for the <i>Faugh a Ballagh</i>, those who are in a position to judge are of the opinion that it is more than likely the work carried out during the months from May to December on the sand bar will be undone.  I am sure neither of the Departments concerned would wish to have £8,000 or £9,000 thrown away to sea, so to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In this Estimate we are faced with two main problems. We are faced with the problem of providing adequate supplies of fish for the home market and, at the same time, ensuring adequate protection for the inshore fishermen.  I was glad to note in the Minister's introductory statement that an increased quantity of fish was landed during the year.  It is some satisfaction to know that.  It was also satisfactory to learn that there has been an increase in the number of persons engaged whole-time and part-time in the fishing industry.  It was gratifying to learn that the Minister is willing to give fishermen all the facilities they require.  It is admitted that the inshore fishermen in many <Col N="623" /> areas are yet in need of boats, gear and so on.  If the Minister is determined to supply them with all the necessary facilities, that will go a long way towards helping them and towards ensuring adequate supplies on the home market.  We cannot, of course, say much in view of the proposed introduction of the codifying measure in the near future.  A good deal will depend on that and we shall have to wait to see how far it will help the inshore fishermen and improve the position in the fishing industry generally.</P>
      <P>The Minister dealt with the rights and wrongs of the dispute between the Sea Fisheries Association and Muintir na Mara.  I am not connected with either of them and I do not propose to say very much about them.  It may be that the Minister found it necessary to dwell on the rights and wrongs of that dispute, believing, as he obviously did last night, that the line taken by Muintir na Mara was not at all times the correct one and I think he was justified in making the points he did. The Minister stated that he was having a memorandum prepared on the problem of the shortage of fish throughout the country.  I come from the sea coast&mdash;the mouth of Cork harbour&mdash;and I can tell the Minister that people living five miles away from me never see a bit of fish.  I hope that in the preparation of this memorandum it will not be a matter of dealing solely with Dublin, Cork, Limerick and the large towns.  I hope it will cover the entire country, taking in villages of a certain size.  It is quite true that there are towns and villages at the moment where the only bit of fish the people ever see is a small bit of salt fish, and they are lucky if they can get that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that it was his aim to ensure that all the fish on the home market would be put there through the activities of the inshore fishermen.  I believe it is essential to concentrate on the home market to see how far we can extend the demand for fish.  Deputy Corry quoted from the Official Reports in order to show that the Minister had expressed a dislike <Col N="624" /> of fish.  I think we must at all times be honest and candid in discussing an Estimate and I think the best approach in such discussion is to leave out all personalities.  I am not interested in whether or not the Minister likes fish. I would be surprised to learn that he does not like it.  We have always been told that fish is good for developing the brain.  At some period of his life the Minister must have eaten a lot of fish, because his brain is very well developed.  Good luck to him for that!</P>
    <P>I was not in the House last year when this Estimate was under discussion, but I have since read the debate on it.  Several Deputies spoke of the advantages of deep-sea fishing. Last year, in his introductory speech, the Minister pointed out that inshore fishing was not economically perfect; but he stated that it was founded on something more perfect&mdash;an Irish way of life.  Further on, speaking on the same theme, he said that their way of life is part of a social pattern they have woven for themselves as part-time fishermen, part-time farmer.  That is correct up to a point.  He mentioned the arguments against the possible views that might be expressed by those Deputies who were in favour of deep-sea fishing.  His views on trawling were very strong.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the sordid horror of the modern trawler trade is a servitude to which some people who value money more than life are entitled to subject themselves.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He opposed that way of life in favour of the more gracious way of living by inshore fishing.  It is our duty to express not our own personal views on this matter, but the views of those who sent us here.  In all constituencies there are people engaged in different types of livelihood, and we have to take into consideration their views as a whole.  I can see the difficulties facing the inshore fishermen. I know places where adequate protection has not yet been given to them, through no fault of the Minister.  They are waiting for gear and proper boats in Cork harbour, Blackrock and elsewhere. Taking the matter as a whole, I do not think sufficient attention has been given to those areas where the <Col N="625" /> people cannot be classed as part-time fishermen.  I admit that part-time fisherman part-time farmer is a grand way of life, but if the Minister would cast his eyes on those areas it is not the sordid horror of the trawler and modern industrial ideas that is the difficulty, but the sordid horror of the way in which the people have to live.  I am thinking now of towns like Kinsale, where the sole occupation is that of fisherman.  There is no hope of any other type of occupation for these people; their livelihood is connected solely with the sea. We have a responsibility to face in their regard.  We have an obligation on us, of which the Minister is aware, to provide as far as possible employment for all our people irrespective of whether they live on the sea-coast or inland.</P>
    <P>If we take into consideration the dire distress under which some of these people have had to live for years past and under which they are still living, we must ask ourselves the question: &ldquo;Is inshore fishing adequate, so far as these people are concerned?&rdquo; I remember occasions when these poor people brought in good catches and, because there was a glut in the market, they could not get buyers.  Things may be somewhat different under the co-operative system introduced by the Minister, but yet when people are solely dependent on fishing for a livelihood, we should not be content with talking of their graceful way of life and the beautiful atmosphere surrounding their little homes.  We have to face the hard realities of life.  It is no use saying to them: &ldquo;Let you continue as others before you did,&rdquo; because they cannot continue their present mode of existence. It is a hard sight to see some of our young men around Cork harbour year after year, going to England and other foreign countries looking for employment on ships and trawlers which we should be able to provide for them here at home.  The Minister may say, of course, that deep-sea fishing will not pay.  Perhaps that is true; I will go so far as to say that inshore fishing of itself will never pay.  One statement made by the Minister last night was very significant.  I am glad to see the <Col N="626" /> Minister giving full consideration to inshore fisheries in so far as guaranteeing a good market price is concerned, but there is no use in guaranteeing a price unless we have a sufficient number of consumers to buy on the market.  The question arises are we satisfied, even though there has been some increase in the quantity of fish landed, that that increase is sufficient?  I believe that it is not sufficient, because for these increased landings of fish we got a ready market.</P>
    <P>Deputies have spoken about the supplies available in Cork.  I do not want to repeat these statements, but I would say to the Minister that he was mistaken in his statement last night that fish was not available in Cork on Monday.  The people of Cork, so far as I know, do not usually go in for fish on Monday.  They might have a bit of cold meat left over after Sunday, but the fact is that people down there&mdash;a certain proportion of them, at any rate&mdash;will not wait until Friday to eat fish if they can get it. Can we put fish on the market for them?  I am not suggesting that the Minister should have to put the fish on the market just when they require it.  I believe that we cannot get supplies in that way overnight.  I realise that regularity of supply is one of the most difficult problems that we have to face.  Perhaps even if we had more trawlers to engage in deep-sea fishing, and an easterly wind came along when they put out to sea, their trip might be quite fruitless, but yet I believe that inshore fishing and deep-sea fishing could be made complementary one to the other and we could then perhaps put supplies on the home market as they were required.</P>
    <P>On the 26th April last I addressed a question to the Taoiseach as to the amount of fish imported during 1949. Without going in too much detail into the answer, I may say that it indicated that the total quantity of fish of all kinds imported during the year was 70,360 cwts. of a total value of £578,514.  Even allowing for all the fish that our inshore fishermen were able to put on the market, we had to import fish to the value of £578,514. That proves that we have a market <Col N="627" /> for an additional quantity of fish to the value of £600,000.  I believe that if we are going to leave the question of supplying this fish to the inshore fisheries alone, the danger may be that, as in the case of other commodities in this country, people may say: &ldquo;As long as we have a guaranteed market why should we bother about increasing the quantity to be put on the market?&rdquo; You cannot compel them to do that, and I quite realise that, even with deep-sea fishing, we could not have a guaranteed supply at any particular time.  The question is: should we go in for deep-sea fishing if there is no use in sending out a few trawlers at a given time with the knowledge that they can return within a certain time limit with plentiful supplies of fish?</P>
    <P>The question was asked here last year&mdash;and it indicated a view I expressed often myself in other places&mdash; would it not be possible for our fishermen to work in co-operation with our still small navy?  Down at Ringaskiddy, near Haulbowline, we see our naval boats high and dry at the moment.  I do not know what we want them for.  Would it not be possible even to barter them for a few decent trawlers?  Round the south coast and in various parts of the country we have the material in the way of splendid specimens of manhood who are anxious to adopt this way of living. If we brought them into our navy and gave them a training for the work, it would be most advantageous, because the Minister must realise that the younger generation are not perhaps willing to endure the same amount of hardship and the trials and sorrows through which their fathers before them went.  The younger generation realise that if they stay at home to work as fishermen in the inshore fishing industry&mdash;that is, if they have no other jobs in which to employ their idle time&mdash;there is going to be many a week in the year when they will not have a penny in their pockets, whereas if they take it into their heads to emigrate they are at least guaranteed better conditions, better wages and certain facilities on trawlers in other countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="628" /> I, of course, fully understand that it would be useless, in fact madness for us, to think that we can go into this industry on the same scale as other countries have been conducting it for years, but I think we should realise that countries such as Norway, Denmark and others have set a headline for us that we could copy with advantage. There is no use in our thinking that at present we can go half the distance they have gone, because while supplies from foreign trawlers are flooding the English market, we are not justified in thinking that we have a guaranteed market at all times for our surplus fish, but there is one point to which we should give close consideration. If we were to operate deep-sea fisheries, even on a small scale, would it be possible for us to utilise fish for purposes other than human consumption?  The Minister, of course, mentioned as against deep-sea fishing the question of iced fish coming into this country.  It is perfectly true also to say that our people use a lot of salt fish and a considerable quantity of that is imported.  We do not know where it comes from; we do not know what way it is done up, but yet people have to use it.  I believe there would be a ready market here if you could get a sufficient quantity of certain types of fish required for fishmeal.  I believe that towns such as Kinsale are crying out for some assistance in this way and though each Department fails in turn to give help, I believe the Minister's Department could assist to a certain degree, even by the utilisation of surplus fish for a canning industry.  It may be said that we have it already, but that in itself does not secure enough for us.  I believe there is an opening there and that there is an obligation on us to go into the matter in full detail to see if there is a possibility of taking advantage of it.</P>
    <P>In connection with deep-sea trawlers coming within the three-mile limit, the Minister mentioned that very often they came in for shelter.  Perhaps, as we say down the country, they come in for the good of their health.  The Minister also mentioned about blowing a whistle for bringing in the fish.  I can assure the Minister that we never <Col N="629" /> blow a whistle to bring in the foreign trawlers.  They do not come in for the good of their health, but to catch fish for the good of their pockets.  I am not in a position to measure the distance accurately, but I have seen foreign trawlers coming in very near and getting fish there.  Perhaps the Minister may be right with regard to the idea of building 50-foot boats.  I believe that the only way to get around this question of foreign trawlers coming within the three-mile limit is to put our fishermen in boats which will be able to go beyond the three-mile limit and carry on fishing against the invading trawlers.  Deputy Corry mentioned about these trawlers being in Bantry.  We know that they are all over the place.  It is up to us to see if we cannot put our own fishermen in proper boats in order that they may be able to fish beyond the three-mile limit and by doing so secure adequate supplies of fish for the home market.</P>
    <P>Of course, it all comes down to the question whether we can put sufficient supplies on the home market.  Before that question can be answered we must ascertain what is necessary to supply the home market.  Deputy Martin O'Sullivan made a very good point when he spoke of the work and the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture.  In this island country it seems strange that fisheries should be just a small part of another Department which is concerned with problems in the heart of the country.  Surely the Fisheries Department is of such importance that there should be a separate Minister in charge of it.  I am not saying that the present Minister is not capable of being in charge of it.  But, in fairness to the Minister, I must say that I believe that agriculture on its own is sufficient for any Minister.  This is just a small section of it groping in the dark, as it were. There are men in that section for years who are experts at their work.  Yet, because they are more or less isolated, or because there is more or less a fifth column system all around them, the fact is that they cannot get out. I believe it is vitally necessary, owing to the advantages which some of us believe are in the fishing industry, to <Col N="630" /> put the section in such a position that they can strike out independently on their own.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of piers. Deputy Corry referred to certain correspondence in connection with certain piers in County Cork.  In fairness and justice to the Department, I must say that our local authorities do not recognise their own direct responsibility in the matter.  They fail to realise that the upkeep of such piers is of importance to them and of vital importance to fishermen in the various areas.  We have had instances where the Department offered a certain grant towards the cost and the local authorities refused it on the ground that they wanted the Department to pay the whole cost.</P>

      <P>In fairness to the Minister, I must say that while he was out of the House the point was made that there were certain requests made by the Cork County Council in connection with Ballycotton pier.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I was coming to.  The question arose while the Minister was out of the House and the responsibility was put on him.  In fairness to him I am pointing out that that is not the case, that there is an obligation also on the local authority to face up to their side of the question.  So long as we have that responsibility locally, there is no use in our attacking the Department in connection with a responsibility which is ours directly.  In that connection I should like to refer to the question of a pier at the Old Head of Kinsale.  The Department has offered a grant for that and we have agreed to put up our share and are waiting for the work to commence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the attitude and the views expressed by various Deputies on all <Col N="631" /> sides of the House, I hope it is not too late to consider the question of how far inshore fishing will provide adequate supplies for the home market at a fair and proper price.  If we can find no other solution for that problem, will we face up to the responsibility of putting fish on the home market, to a certain limited degree, by means of deep-sea fishing?  I realise that the Minister is doing his part in providing boats.  Perhaps another 12 months will prove whether the intake of fish by inshore fishing is sufficient in itself.  I am glad to inform the Minister that if he wants boats built we have a new boat-building yard in Crosshaven which can supply these boats.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The more one examines this problem the more one realises its national importance.  Perhaps some of us who are interested in our own constituency are sometimes inclined to take a partial view and pay attention just to the problems which arise in our own constituency.  But I think the more you look at it the more you realise the tremendous importance of the fishing industry as a national problem which should be tackled. Some speakers to-day made that point very well and pointed out that the Department of Fisheries is almost the Cinderella of the Government. The Minister will have a very severe task before him in battling with Finance and with the Government if he is going to carry out the wishes of the House as indicated in this debate. He mentioned in another debate that the population of the country was going up.  I think that he will admit that that is largely due to the development of industry in Leinster and in Dublin.  But if you take the outlying areas around our coast you will find that the population is not going up in those areas.  Here we have a potential industry in connection with which we could develop a population of the very finest types. That applies to every country.  Fishing is a magnificent industry and one <Col N="632" /> to which great attention and considerable expenditure are devoted in other countries because it is regarded as an essential part of defence in these countries.</P>
      <P>In Newfoundland and in other places the fishing industry was always regarded as the backbone of a navy.  For that reason I would support the suggestions made here to-day that more attention should be given to the protective ships.  The Minister promised, I think, last year that he would try to get aeroplanes to protect our shores.  He has not told us in his opening statement what his general policy with regard to defence of our fisheries is.  He did make a strong point of a particular prosecution and of what had been done by putting the law into motion, but there is something which must be done before the law can be put in motion, that is, actual physical protection by means of the proper ships.  He told us in a debate in the Seanad about the plans for selling the corvettes and the M.T.B.s as not being suitable, but he had to try to buy other ships which would be more suitable.  He has not told us how far he has been able to make progress in that matter, which is a very vital aspect of the defence of our fisheries.  We will not get rid of the nuisance until fishermen in other countries realise that the Government is really serious about dealing with the matter.  Because it is not serious, we get unfortunate incidents where shooting takes place; people get their tempers up about it due to the fact that we have not dealt with the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>Would the Deputy not consider it wiser to leave matters which are <i>sub judice</i> out of the debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not for a moment enter into the merits of that particular case, but I point to it as a symptom, which I consider reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a bit reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>It is realistic.  When I raised some years ago the question of the protection of our shores abuse was <Col N="633" /> heaped upon me by the Minister.  He now realises that it is a permanent problem which faces every Minister, and which can only be dealt with each year as it arises.  I do not think that his abuse at that time was justifiable.</P>
      <P>There is just one detail which I would like to mention, Passage, where the tragedy occurred last year.  I asked especially that the owner of that boat should get another boat, and that the boats generally should be looked over and if possible renewed. Above all, I would consider any scheme which might be evolved to deal with the insurance of the fishermen in the future as a very vital matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lehane, following upon what Deputy de Valera had already said, referred to the question of markets. There is no doubt that one of the key problems is the creation of a market. The old discussion as to whether the demand goes before the supply or the supply before the demand is one that arises in a very acute form here.  If the supply of fish were there&mdash;and judging by the statements of Deputies from different parts of the country the supply is not there&mdash;people actually would buy fish.  I myself know of mountain farmers who would be delighted to get fish if they could.  A market can only be created by examining the whole situation as to how fish can be put into the rural areas.  I may say that the attitude taken up by the Minister on the Estimate last year, when he decried the eating of fish and said that he detested it, was not helpful.  It may be expressing his own point of view, but it is not helpful to the development of the industry itself.  If you say that others will say it and shrug their shoulders, and there will be a tendency against the development of the market as it should be developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the Minister should try to make sure that people are taught how to cook fish properly.  If he had got fish cooked as it is cooked elsewhere probably he would not have developed the distaste for fish that he has.  Very often our fish is cooked badly, and it is sold in a condition that is not attractive, and all that is part of the whole problem.  It is outlook and organisation from the market <Col N="634" /> supply point of view and from the demand point of view which is very definitely lacking.  The authorities on diet point out that fish is an extremely valuable and useful diet.  We cannot say that the average person living in Ireland gets too much of any food and could not do with a really good fish diet.  There are plenty of places where even potatoes run short and people do not get the chance of eating meat every day, and if a supply of fish were properly put before them it would add immensely to their well-being.</P>
    <P>The problem of keeping fish arises, of course, and I would like to know if the Minister knows anything about the attempt which was made in Waterford City to preserve fish and sell it. I think it was not a success, but I would like to know if the Minister knows anything about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; plenty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that if smoked fish, salt fish and tinned fish of certain kinds were sold all over the country they would be bought up. There was a little industry in Youghal at one time where they tinned sprats or whitebait or sardines.  It was a prospering industry until the man who was running it died, and I think it is a matter that requires to be looked into again.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his colleagues have been making quite a number of promises.  I counted a number and I hope that he will carry them out.  He promised the aeroplanes and ships to protect the industry.  He promised a school of fishing, and I do not know if he is able to tell us anything about the progress of that school.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Also he has promised us a very grandiose scheme for the wholesale development of the fisheries, a co-operative organisation, in which we wish him luck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to be annoyed with my remarks.  It is a pity that he cannot take the statements made with every intention of <Col N="635" /> being constructive by the Opposition without having to get irritated&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a wonder that those words do not choke you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and keeping on grunting.  It is difficult to know what on earth he is saying.  He has also promised us legislation with regard to the inland fisheries.  If he carries out half his promises he will not do too badly.</P>
      <P>A question which has aroused a good deal of controversy during the debate has been the question of the deep-sea trawler.  The Minister has found a number of reasons why it should not be developed, but I think Deputy Desmond put the case very well when he said that, while the inshore fisheries should not be impaired or interfered with, a certain development of the deep-sea trawler could be used for supplementary purposes because the inshore men cannot supply all the fish required in continuity. One or two deep-sea trawlers could not possibly do great damage to the inshore men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>You can hardly say it was lost by us because that experiment was commenced before we came into office.  It was ultimately closed down by us and I remember that at the time it was not well organised by any means, and the criticism made of its original organisation was very severe.  The whole thing was a sort of scandal at the time, but I do not intend to go back to that now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I do believe that an attempt should be made again on a small scale for the purpose of supplementing the inshore fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="636" /> Then, again, there is the problem of the harbours.  Deputy Desmond mentioned Ballycotton.  The trouble with all these harbours is that they all seem to be under different authorities. Some of them are under the Department of Industry and Commerce; some under the Board of Works; and some under the local authority. Between them all, the Department of Fisheries can do very little.  I know that they are going to do something for us in Ballymacaw, but, dotted all round the coast, are these harbours under these various conflicting authorities, and it is not easy to get the average members of a county council to be interested in fishermen or their problems, so that the whole matter of the harbours should be brought in some way under the control of the Department of Fisheries so that they could go ahead seriously to develop these harbours properly.  As Deputy Breslin has pointed out, the need for slips here and there in sheltered places along the coast is very acute.</P>
    <P>With regard to inland fisheries, Deputy Flynn some time ago introduced a Bill to deal with riparian rights and there was an extraordinary exhibition of ineptitude on the part of the Government in dealing with it. Deputy de Valera pointed out the necessity for having some control over riparian rights, so that the whole matter could be straightened out. There are a number of farmers in my constituency for whom the problem is very acute, and I may say that it is not confined to that constituency, but is to be found in other parts of the country as well.  I hope the Minister, in his concluding remarks, will elaborate somewhat on how he proposes to get proper control so that the trustees will be able to ensure against poaching and so on.  I do not know whether the Minister intends to deal with anything but trout&mdash;he mentioned only trout&mdash;but I think he should elaborate in his reply and tell us how far he proposes to go to remedy what he must realise is a very acute question at present.  If it is properly done it will have a very big effect on the tourist traffic, which is one of the big sources of income for this country.  We shall look forward <Col N="637" /> to the Minister's elaboration of his views on this point.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary how unmarineminded the Government are.  I suppose it is one of the evil traditions left us that, although we are an island, we do not seem to take full advantage of the seas around us.  I should like also to emphasise the importance, from the point of view of building up the very finest type of population, of a proper development of this industry.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that certain Deputies, in dealing with this Estimate, have been good enough to express some commiseration with the Minister on the ground that the responsibility for agriculture would be enough and that to add thereto responsibility for the Department of Fisheries is to impose too heavy a burden.  I should like to ask this question and I ask it in the same friendly spirit as that in which the original question was addressed to me: what has been left undone by the Department of Fisheries in the last 12 months?  We have introduced and passed three formidable Fishery Bills which consolidate the fishery legislation of the last century. We will introduce on next Tuesday a comprehensive Bill to reorganise the entire sea fisheries of this country.  In the last 12 months we have issued more boats, more boats are abuilding and more are on order than have ever been in the history of the Sea Fisheries Association since it was first established. I move to report progress.</P>

There has been no change in that policy.  So far as the Dicksgrove group is concerned, I am informed that a co-operative society representing a substantial number of the local milk suppliers has been formed in accordance with these provisos, with the object of taking over the group, and representations have been made to me that steps can now be taken to transfer the group to that society.

Proposals affecting the Butt Bridge area which are being considered are the construction of a new road from Amiens Street to the quay east of the Custom House and the construction of a new bridge over the Liffey east of Butt Bridge. In connection with these proposals, an origin and destination census of traffic using Butt Bridge was taken last year and the results are under examination by the corporation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an odd thing, in connection with this Fishery Estimate, that Deputy Little should depart from what has been on the whole a constructive and helpful discussion to denigrate the work that has been done because a great deal of the work that has been done, has been done by the Sea Fisheries Association during the years of the Fianna Fáil Administration.  But this queer corroding hate which the Fianna Fáil Party has allowed to bedevil its members drives Deputy Little into the pretence that no progress has been made, in the hope thereby to discredit me.  I have not the slightest hesitation in directing the attention of the House to the very material progress that was made not only in the past two years, but in the previous ten years.  In 1935 the Sea Fisheries Association had four depots in this country&mdash;Dublin, Arklow, Cork, Galway.  That is all the immediate contact they had with the fishermen.  To-day, the Sea Fisheries Association has depots, that is, either a boatyard or a centre such as Killybegs or a fully-authorised agent permanently resident, at Clogherhead, Loughshinny, Rush, Howth, Wicklow, Arklow, Wexford, Kilmore Quay, Passage East, Dunmore East, Helvick, Ballycotton, Cork, Castletownsend, Baltimore, Schull, Bantry, Caherciveen, Cromane, Dingle, Quilty, Aran, Galway, Roundstone, Cleggan, Murrisk, Achill Sound, Killybegs, Rossbeg, Burtonport, Kincasslagh, Bunbeg, Magheroarty, Port-na-Blagh, Downings, Meevagh, Portaleen.  Does that suggest no effort to meet the problem of reorganising the fisheries of this country?  And now, on next Tuesday, please God, a Bill will be introduced into this House asking the Oireachtas to reorganise the industry on the basis of that framework from the bottom up so as to try out to the limit of the resources of this State the ability of the inshore fishermen alone, <Col N="655" /> furnished with every instrument that modernity can provide and every facility that prudent outlay of money can purchase, to supply adequately the domestic market at a price which the domestic consumer can reasonably be asked to pay.  That experiment will not be abandoned in a year or two years.  It will be carried on permanently should the evidence of eventual success emerge and, in any case, for a sufficiently long time to convince everyone who is honestly interested in the welfare of the inshore fishermen whether, in fact, under any circumstances, they can be so organised as effectively to provide for this market.  Does that suggest that the Department of Fisheries is the step-child of the Department of Agriculture, that it is treated as an insignificant branch of agriculture and that it is forbidden to come in contact with the outside world?  I am authorised by the Government to say that no accommodation required at any port in Ireland which it is decided by those competent to decide is necessary to provide fishermen with adequate facilities will be held up for 24 hours by the want of money.  There are no strings to that and there are no qualifications, but there will be no pier building where the sea does not roll-because there are a lot of people in this country who would like to build piers in their own backyards. That day is done.  What port facilities are necessary for use for the convenience of genuine fishermen will be provided the moment competent expert opinion certifies that they would be useful and practical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I desire to reiterate that I appreciate the spirit in which the apprehension was expressed that pressure of work might relegate the interests of the Fisheries Department to a secondary place, I have a duty to inform the House that I am not aware of any such relegation and if it exists I want to know of it.  I do not think there is upon me a duty to apologise to the House for the volume of work done by the Fisheries Department in the past 12 months.  Three Inland Fishery Bills have been passed, and a <Col N="656" /> Sea Fisheries Bill has been drafted for submission to the House.  There are more boats issued, more building and more on order than ever before in the history of the Sea Fisheries Association. Two new boatyards are building, one at Dingle and one at Meevagh.  There are two more in contemplation, one on the west coast and one at Baltimore.  There has been the greatest quantity of prime fish landed by the inshore fishermen in recorded time.  More fishermen are being employed than at any previous date, and there are more boats working with Irish crews than at any previous date.</P>
    <P>Will any Deputy suggest to me what more can be put in hand because, if he can, I want to put it in hand, and we have the means and the resources to put it in hand?  There is nothing requiring to be done that is not being done for the want of the will or the way.  If there is something requiring to be done which is not in hand, it is due to nothing but the ignorance of the Minister for Fisheries, and I am asking Deputies to repair that ignorance if they can and, presumably, Deputies of this House are as competent a body to correct any lacuna in the information requisite adequately to deal with this problem as any other body in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputy Palmer mentioned a pier in Kerry.  The general undertaking I have given applies to that.  Deputy Breslin stated that we were not sufficiently sympathetic about grants for small slips and piers.  I want to be clear on this.  The smallest pier in Ireland or the most insignificant slip is just as important in the eyes of the Department of Fisheries as is Killybegs, Arklow or Galway, provided that it corresponds to this test: if constructed does it genuinely serve the interests of fishermen, does it provide safe accommodation for them and, when it is constructed, will the local authority undertake to maintain it? There is no use in my asking this House to provide money to build a pier or a slip if I am fixed with notice that when it has been made safe and sound the local authority intends to let <Col N="657" /> the sea sweep it away.  I have no power to maintain piers or slips.  It is the statutory duty of the local authority, and I cannot use fisheries money for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Let nobody be backward in coming forward to bespeak a pier or a slip because at the moment there are not boats in sufficient number <i>prima facie</i> to justify it.  The Department of Fisheries will be glad to help in building up the number of boats and to make a pier in anticipation of building up that number where the slightest rational prospect of doing so exists. But there is no use in asking the Department to lay out a capital sum, the annual charges upon which will be twice as great as the maximum quantity of fish that ever has been landed at that place within the past 120 years, because that calls for a degree of optimism which even I am not able to ask the House to join in.</P>
    <P>Deputy Breslin complains that Donegal hotel owners and retailers must order their fish from Dublin.  Let it be understood that the Sea Fisheries Association will be glad to supply orders for any area of the County Donegal from Killybegs.  It is a free country, and if somebody wants, in the exercise of the prerogative of a free man or woman, to order fish from Ballycotton, surely the House does not expect me to issue a prohibition?  If they want to get supplies of fish from Killybegs, we will be glad and happy to supply them, and I would be grateful to Deputy Breslin, who is now present, if he would make that widely known.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan apprehended that the question of increased demand might wait on increased landings and that the Department and the Sea Fisheries Association might recoil from the risk of creating greater landings in the absence of demand.  There is no need for apprehension on that score. We propose to proceed on the basis that there will be a demand for the largest quantity of prime fish that the inshore fishermen can be equipped and induced to bring there, and we accept the assignment of creating a market for any quantity, however great, that they land.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="658" /> I would remind Deputies that those inshore men who elected to become members of the Sea Fisheries Association are, for almost every category of prime fish, entitled to deliver it to the Sea Fisheries Association for a guaranteed price, and they can leave the problem of marketing to us.  They do not have to worry.  If they do not want to, as some of them have not wanted heretofore, join the Sea Fisheries Association and so create marketing problems for themselves, this is a free country; but I am going to ask the Oireachtas to provide that hereafter no one but members of the Sea Fisheries Association will be allowed to land fish for sale on the shores of this country.  That is an arrangement which we can more properly discuss when it comes before the House by way of legislative proposals.</P>
    <P>Now, those who know this trade will not, I hope, subscribe to the usual fraud about whiting.  Muintir na Mara is very strong on the subject of whiting.  There are seasons of the year when whiting shoal like herring or mackerel, and it is not an uncommon practice with some of the more obscurantist of the fishermen to go and scope little whiting as you would herring or mackerel, and then make the welkin ring when they do not get a guaranteed price thereafter.  There are seasons in this country when small whiting are about as saleable as a fish's tail, and nobody knows that better than the minority of chancers who scoop them out of the harbours and dump them on the piers.  Let us fix the chancers with notice now that, little and all as they got in the past for this kind of activity, they will get nothing at all for it in the future.  The Sea Fisheries Association has been designed for honest fishermen, and they constitute the vast majority of the men.</P>
    <P>There are two Deputies, and when they speak on the Fisheries Vote&mdash;God forgive me&mdash;my hackles begin to rise. One is Deputy Corry on account of his brazen face, and the other Deputy Little on account of his oleaginous hypocrisy.  Imagine Deputy Corry waltzing in here to make a bitter complaint, a raucous complaint, about <Col N="659" /> Ballycotton, and of how the suffering citizens of Ballycotton are oppressed by the Department of Fisheries when the Department of Fisheries has been waiting 18 months for the Cork County Council to make up its mind as to what it wanted to do at Ballycotton.  In December, 1946, the Cork County Council was asked to submit proposals for Ballycotton, and were told that the Department of Fisheries was sympathetic.  We have written and written and written, but they are still shaking like a jelly on the plate down in Cork.  Deputy Corry, like the young Lochinvar who comes out of the west, why did he not go down to the Cork County Council, of which he is a member, in the last four years and throw his handspring there?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He is in a minority in Dáil Éireann, too.  Let him go and roar at the Cork County Council, and if he can get the Cork County Council to make any rational recommendation in respect of facilities at Ballycotton, I want the Cork County Council to know that the Department of Fisheries is ready, willing and anxious to get on with the job, and that nothing is going to stop the Department of Fisheries except the vacillation of the Cork County Council.</P>
      <P>Deputy T. Brennan raised one point which I am grateful to him for bringing under public attention, and that is, that the allegation is not infrequently made by the retailers and wholesalers of fish that they are obliged to charge the prices prescribed by the Government for fish.  But they never feel themselves under the same compelling obligation to pay the prices prescribed by the Government for fish &mdash;and that is the maximum price.  The fact is that the retail and wholesale prices are maximum prices, and if there are any who have had any doubt about it heretofore, let them know now that, provided they do not charge more than those prices for fish to the consumers, they can charge as little as they like and, the lower they go, the more praiseworthy citizens they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="660" /> I grieve for their anxious scruples lest they cut across the fundamental policy of this State by charging less than the maximum prices for fish.  I rejoice in this opportunity of providing an anodyne for their delicate consciences. They are as free as air to charge as much less than those maximum prices as their public-spirited solicitude suggests they will wish to do.</P>
    <P>Deputy T. Brennan spoke of nonnationals coming here and fishing. That always makes me shudder. There are 20,000,000 of our people scattered over the world in the greatest spiritual empire this world has ever seen, and we are the only imperial power in the world whose people have never been asked to get out.  Wherever the Irish have conquered for themselves a home they are welcome citizens, and it ill becomes us, I think, with thousands of our people working in England, in America, in Australia, New Zealand and Canada, and in almost every country of the world, to go on record as saying &ldquo;though we have sought a welcome in every hemisphere, no one is welcome in Ireland.&rdquo;  It is a poor guest who never has the kettle boiling on his own hob.  What Deputy Brennan is really referring to is a recent development within the past two years in which enterprising persons have equipped themselves with splendid fishing boats and Scotch crews.  The boats are registered in Ireland and the proprietor is a citizen of this State; he is engaged in perfectly legal trading activities, but he belongs to that category of persons, to which I referred in opening this Estimate, who bought these boats and hired these crews in the full knowledge that the policy of this Government had been declared before these boats were bought and these crews were hired.  That policy was that, so soon as legislation was ready, the complete monopoly of the domestic market would be conferred upon the inshore fishermen, and that anyone who was not in that category was fixed with notice that if he chose to go to expense, subsequent to that declaration of policy, no question of compensation would arise for any vested interest that he had created <Col N="661" /> for himself as a result of his subsequent activities.  The boats referred to by Deputy T. Brennan are splendid boats, and the crews who man them are splendid crews.  I hope that the crews of our boats will be as good as those Scotch crews.  If they are, we shall have no need to worry about the future capacity of the inshore fishermen to fill the home market.  If they are as good, I hope the Sea Fisheries Association will provide for them as good boats as the Irish citizen referred to has provided for his Scotch crews.  If we do that, I think we shall have reached a very creditable standard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan dealt at some length with the bar at Arklow Harbour where one would imagine the ships of five continents swept in and out quite freely until this Government came into office and that towards the removal of that bar this Government is now only prepared to make provision for two-thirds. It is a permanent danger to the mariners of Arklow and I said I thought I would surprise Deputy Brennan.  Let me summarise it in this way: all the ports of our shores are subject to the harassment of a current which flows there, carrying with it sand, from Waterford right away up to Belfast.  It was met in the case of Dublin Port by the construction of the Bull Wall which was designed to have an effect upon the current calculated to prevent it depositing sand across the Port of Dublin.  The great volume of traffic passing there justified the immense capital outlay that was required.  Precisely the same problem presents itself at Wicklow, Arklow, Wexford, and, I think, even at Waterford. It is the intention of the Government not to spend decadally a larger and larger sum pushing the piers further and further out towards the English coast.  It does not matter how far one pushes them out, the current will come around the end of the pier and deposit its sand in the mouth of the harbour. Recognising the inevitability of that&mdash; it is the case in hundreds of other ports all over the world&mdash;the Government decided there is a permanent dredging problem in the east coast ports of Ireland and provision will be made permanently and perennially to <Col N="662" /> get that dredging done.  It will cost money, but, in the heel of the hunt, it will cost less than building another 100 yards on to the end of the pier every ten years.</P>
    <P>We asked the Galway Chamber of Commerce to make its suggestions about boat building and repair accommodation on the west coast long ago. We are still waiting for a reply.  Now, I am going to wait until August when, with the help of God, I will be in Carna on my holidays and if the Galway Chamber of Commerce has not made up its mind by then I will start round the west coast of Ireland and I will make up my own mind.  I will wait a certain time for advice from the local authority.  But I will not sit on my sash indefinitely and then have the Deputy Corry of that particular area throwing handsprings here in Dáil Éireann in an effort to discover why I did not do something when, for four years, I have been sitting on my sash waiting for the Deputy Corry of Galway County to do something.  I have waited long enough.  I would like Dáil Éireann to be fixed fully with notice that at the present moment my mind is as open as a double door and that I have been waiting for a considerable time for the Galway Chamber of Commerce to close it.  It is still open, but it will not stay open much longer.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Murrisk fishermen, I would like to give them the kind of boats they deserve.  They are the kind of fishermen for whom proper equipment is long overdue.  If they were not good fishermen they would never have fished this length of time with the accommodation with which they have had to put up.  But if I am to give them the best equipment, and that is what I would like to give them, they will have to fish into Cleggan because there is nothing I can do at Murrisk that will enable them to use the best equipment there.  If they insist on fishing into Murrisk&mdash;I think 35-foot boats can go in there&mdash;steps will be taken to clear the channel to make that possible; but, before we do that, I would like to provide 50-foot boats for them, if they will use them, for the purpose of fishing into Cleggan. They must make up their minds about <Col N="663" /> that and, when they do, I will do my best to expedite a decision in the matter.</P>

      <P>I was glad to hear a more reasonable note sounded to-day about the fishing limits, though some gay cavaleiro of the Fianna Fáil Party recently upbraided me for not insisting on the 12-mile limit.  If he can enrol the services of the sixth, seventh and eighth fleets of the United States of America for the defence of the 12-mile limit, we will consider asserting our sovereignty over it. But up to date, small countries can only assert their sovereignty over those territorial waters about which all nations agree, and the widest area to which we can get all nations to agree is three miles.  Some nations powerful enough to assert dominion over six miles have done so.  Russia has done so over 12 miles.  The way that nation does it is, she tells you to get out of her waters or she will blow the bottom out of your boat.  I have neither the inclination nor the means to blow the bottom out of anyone's boat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The return of Deputy Little to the House assuages my wrath.  He referred to Newfoundland as an example which we might follow.  It brought to my mind a wicked aphorism which I was sorely tempted to employ. I dismiss it.  I must say that if the activities of the Government of Newfoundland on their cod fisheries are to be judged by the results, they are a poor example for this country because the net result of Newfoundland's activities was that they lost the cod, the fishing and their independence and survived as an organised community only to be incorporated in the Canadian Federation. God forbid that we should emulate that example.  Many a time and oft in the last 15 years I warned Deputy Little that if he wanted to model his <Col N="664" /> agricultural policy on the fishery policy of Newfoundland, that this country would go down and cease to be the property of the Irish people.  By the mercy of God's providence we had an election here in 1948.</P>

      <P>I did not talk about Deputy Little's association with the home of cod.  I urge Deputy MacEntee not to draw from me the aphorism from which I have wisely forborne.  Just imagine Deputy Little rambling in here virtuously and saying he wants to know what protection is being provided and asking that, if promises were made, where were the performances.  He was trotting round this country for 20 years announcing that he was going to do the devil in a bag when he got the chance, but he was 15 years in office in this country as a Minister of this State and never even spat on a foreign trawler.  Yet he is not two years out of office until his heart is bleeding all over Dáil Éireann about them, suggesting that promises were made and asking where are the performances.  I shall tell the Deputy where are the performances.  I am authorised by the Minister for Defence to say that two corvettes are permanently charged with the protection of our fishery waters and will have permanently the co-operation of the Air Force in directing them to any occasion of trespass in so far as that can be effectively done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They are the corvettes that can get into only four ports in Ireland and they were bought by Deputy MacEntee without adverting to the fact that a boat should be considered from the point of view of its draught before it can be considered suitable.  These corvettes can get into Killary Bay, Bantry, Dublin and Cork harbours.  If they cannot get in there they cannot get in anywhere else. They will have to remain at sea permanently.  We can also get them <Col N="665" /> into Killybegs now.  That difficulty notwithstanding, we have been able to arrange for their use as patrol boats. The Leader of the Opposition and I on one notable occasion sped across Cork Harbour in a motor torpedo-boat christened, I think, the <i>Sam Adams.</i> We discovered, as we sped along, that we were using more petrol than any other known internal combustion engine and that if we made the boat travel for any appreciable time at the pace at which it could travel, the pair of us would be sitting on the propeller because the superstructure of the whole boat would fall away.  We have four of these vessels in our service.  Two of the corvettes can travel and remain afloat.  Their difficulty is ever to get home.  Once they get to sea, it is quite a business to get them back into their domicile.  That difficulty notwithstanding, they will be maintained in constant patrol.  As regards canning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will sit down. Deputy Little is all of a &ldquo;do-dah&rdquo; as to what we have been doing about canning.  He knows as well as he knows his own name the story about canning.  Messrs. Denny of Waterford City, for which the Deputy is supposed to be one of the representatives, came to me and complained that their canning unit in Waterford was embarrassed, in that it had been unable to get regular supplies of fish.  It was very difficult to keep a canning unit going when they did not have regular supplies.  I said to the then general manager of Denny's: &ldquo;I acknowledge that is a difficulty with which I think you should not have to contend.&rdquo;  I asked him to come back and see me in a week's time.  I had a conference with the officers of my Department and I said: &ldquo;Listen, this may not be a remunerative business in its initial stages, but we must mobilise the resources of the Sea Fisheries Association and of this Department and whatever the cost we must undertake to deliver into Denny's factory every day five crans of herring.  We have to charge them a basic price of £5 per cran on the understanding that if they <Col N="666" /> cost more than that, we shall defray the surplus charge and if they cost less, we shall give them a rebate as soon as our costings have been worked out.  We shall deliver them every morning whatever the cost, for five months&rdquo;&mdash; because there are only five months in which you can give that undertaking with any prospect of fulfilling it in respect to herring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say the general manager of Denny's said: &ldquo;That is a fair offer; nobody could wish for fairer.&rdquo;  A week later the board of Dennys met, the cannery was closed down, its equipment dispersed, the canning of fish and vegetables ceased, and the new plant was permanently done away with.  If I could have put my claws on that unit before they had dismantled it, I would have asked Dáil Éireann for authority to sequester it, fix a suitable compensation for the firm afterwards, and give it on lease to some other firm who would have carried on the canning business there. That set me back; I do not mind admitting it.  I am now seeking if I can find an established firm of fish canners who will, in co-operation with the Sea Fisheries Association, undertake the canning of fish.  It is a very highly technical business and I am extremely reluctant to undertake it myself or through the Sea Fisheries Association because when you have canned the fish you have got to sell it.  There is no use in piling up the canned fish a mile high.  You must sell it, and to sell it you have to have an established sales organisation.  I would much sooner have a firm like Angus Watson or some established firm in Great Britain or the United States, who would have an established market and who would work in collaboration with us to set up canneries and set out to can fish, sprats, herring or any other variety of fish they can retail, which are to be found anywhere along our coasts.  If such a firm is prepared to make a venture with us, everything we can do to help and facilitate them we will be glad to do, and we would like to see them make a good profit.  Provided they pay our fishermen a fair price for the fish, we are in no way desirous of grudging them a fair <Col N="667" /> reward for the work they do.  If we cannot get some firm to collaborate with us on that basis, I am prepared to look into the question of trying to do it ourselves, but I hate embarking on an enterprise the technical administration of which I do not understand myself.  Let us never forget that the canning of fish is not the end of our problem.  When you can it, you have to sell it.  You cannot go out to Piccadilly and shake a basket of canned herring and say &ldquo;fresh herrings for sale&rdquo; because they are not fresh herrings and the average purchaser will not buy a pig in a poke. Unless there is a name on it that has a reputation for quality and excellence there is a difficulty in breaking a way into the trade for canned fish.  As to a plan for insuring fishermen, I am precluded from dealing with that because it will more properly arise when the Bill which I spoke of is before the House.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered every point raised.  I am grateful to the Leader of the Opposition for his constructive contribution to this debate, as I was grateful to Deputy Major de Valera for his constructive contribution in the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture.  I do not know if it is correct protocol for so dreadful a person as myself to say in all sincerity to the Leader of the Opposition and every member of it that I want any advice they can give me, and I am quite prepared to try out any proposal responsibly sponsored by any bona fide Deputy.  If there is any suggestion from either side of the House for a committee of members to help and advise me in these matters I am eager and willing to collaborate with them. I did ask on the occasion of the last Estimate if we could not sufficiently lay political trenchancy aside to permit of those who are devoted to the sport of rod and line fishing to constitute a small fishermen's committee drawn from all sides of the House which would combine with me in improving sporting amenities in the country.  I renew that offer now.</P>
    <P>In connection with the establishment of a fishing trusteeship for the holding in its hands of such riparian fishing <Col N="668" /> rights as are bestowed upon it, I should like the House to know that there is no question of purchasing private fisheries and fishing rights like salmon fisheries and very valuable preserved fishings which are at present in the hands and are the property of individual citizens of the State.  The proposal simply is this: there are well-established fishing amenities available on rivers in this country which are not being preserved because they have been divided up into tiny fractions in the course of the division of estates by the Land Commission or something of that kind.  Our experience is that local angling associations have in many cases persuaded 20 or 30 farmers to give the local associations the exclusive fishery rights, the consideration being that the local angling association will keep the fences in repair, see that fishermen passing up and down will not smash fences or break down drains and make themselves responsible for seeing that people fishing do not chase cattle or engage in damaging trespass of any kind.  It is in an analogous situation that we propose to preserve such stretches of water and out of the revenue derived from the licences paid by our own people and by tourists improve the spawning beds and to do such other maintenance work as will increase the value of the fishery and maintain and develop it in the future. It is not a revolutionary development, but I am advised by angling associations that it is one which could result in much good.</P>
    <P>I should tell the House before I conclude that we have in hands experimental work on eight trout lakes.  One group of experiments is designed to determine what proportion of coarse fish can most profitably be withdrawn from a trout lake without upsetting the balance of nature and, at the same time, permit the trout to increase and to grow in size.  If you get rid of all coarse fish, in some instances the numbers of trout multiply, but they finally balance at about 2½ ozs. and you get a multitude of small fish.  We are also trying an experiment to change the P.H. content of the waters of other lakes for the purpose of determining whether that will result in a greater <Col N="669" /> growth of fish.  That is a complicated way of saying that we are trying to turn acid water alkaline.  We are also carrying out certain entomological work where we have reason to believe that the variety of fly which habituated certain trout lakes has through some undiscerned accident disappeared. There is a theory that our lake trout for the want of surface feed acquire the habit and custom of bottom feeding and cease to rise to the fly.  These are experiments in the pragmatical sphere.  We are doing our best to carry out all that science and discovery have established, but in this sphere described we are nothing better than pragmatists, but we are resolved to try out anything which is proposed to us by a responsible, prudent and experienced person who we believe to be in good faith and desirous of serving the best interests of the fishing sport in our rivers.</P>
    <P>We have distributed a greater number of trout ova from hatcheries this year than has ever been done before.  Our purpose is to double and quadruple that.  We have not done as much in the sphere of white trout as I would like to do, but there are special technical difficulties about transferring the ova or the sprats of white trout from one fishery to another.  They do not travel well and it is not every fishery that relishes the prospect of the Minister for Fisheries coming into their river and taking fry out of it and depositing it in some other river.  However, we have some of our own rivers and we are not without hope that we will be able to do more than has been done heretofore in the matter of white trout.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need go into the question of salmon beyond saying that when the concept of our fishing trust is grasped by the people&mdash;that they are going to be bought and maintained for our own people&mdash;the enforcement of the law against poachers will become easier by virtue of the willingness of our own people to sustain the law.</P>
    <P>I want to make this clear; it is fair and right that I should: where authorised officers of the State detect <Col N="670" /> persons injuring salmon or trout fisheries in the country they will be prosecuted to the limit of the law and, so far as the Minister for Fisheries is concerned, no application for the remission of penalty has the slightest prospect of success&mdash;not the slightest. It was otherwise when the tendency was for our people to be excluded from access to their own rivers, when any act of preservation was designed to improve the amenities available to strangers at the cost of our own people.  Now that these amenities belong to our own people and are going to be preserved for our own people nobody from at home or abroad will be allowed to plunder them.  I would be ashamed of our own country if our people extended to the robbery of their own neighbours the undoubted toleration deep planted in the hearts of every one of us for illegal acts aimed against the attempt of strangers to usurp what we never admitted they had any right to.  I am quite certain that if we get the help of responsible people in the country in explaining the difference between the guerilla warfare on usurpation in which most of us and our families took part at some time or another, and which was justified and approved of by most right-minded men of the country, and now, when the rights are our own and it becomes a question of the rule of law in our own community and whether our people will respect it or not, our work will prosper.</P>
    <P>In the name, then, not of usurping owners, but of the rule of law enacted by this Oireachtas, I am asking the people to collaborate with me in the enforcement of the fishery laws, and I am saying that the first duty of a faithful servant is faithfully to carry out the instructions of his employer. I get the instructions of my employer, who is the Irish people, through their Oireachtas and I am assuring the Irish people who employ me that in this respect in any case they may expect me to be a very faithful servant.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £2,747,160 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1951, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government.</P>
      <P>Deputies will observe from the published Book of Estimates that the total net amount required in the Vote for my Department for the current financial year is £4,382,160.  The total net amount, including Supplementary Estimates, provided for the last financial year was £3,223,100.  There is thus a net increase of £1,159,060 on last year's Vote.  The increase is easily explained.  There are only two main items accounting for it: (a) an increase of £585,000 in the amount being made available for grants to private persons, local authorities and public utility societies for the erection or reconstruction of houses; and (b) £500,000 additional for the financing of schemes under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949, this being the first full year in which the provisions of the Act will operate.  There is also an increase of £51,655 in the growing amount required to make provision for contributions towards the annual loan charges of local authorities in respect of housing schemes and an increase from £20,000 to £50,000 in the provision being made for grants for reserved houses for newly married couples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards local authority housing, I have to report another year of progress.  During the past financial year 5,299 houses and flats were completed by local authorities as compared with 1,871 in the previous year and <Col N="672" /> 729 in the year before that.  The record of housing works in progress by local authorities is equally satisfactory. At the end of March last 10,527 houses were in course of erection as compared with 8,193 in March, 1949, and 3,816 in March, 1948.  All the indications are that local authorities will achieve a figure of not less than 7,000 completed dwellings in the present financial year.</P>
    <P>The number of dwellings completed in Dublin City during the year was 1,574, which is more than double the output of the previous year.  Houses under construction for the corporation in March, 1950, numbered 3,591 as compared with 2,759 in March, 1949.</P>
    <P>When introducing the Estimate for my Department last year I referred to the serious obstacle in the way of a greater rate of production of houses which was presented by the inadequate supply of skilled craftsmen, such as carpenters, plasterers and others associated with the finishing of houses. I am happy to say that a considerable improvement has been effected in the course of the year under review.  The number of skilled operatives engaged on local authority housing in March, 1950, was 5,915 as compared with 3,664 in March, 1949.  This represents an increase of 61 per cent. in the number of skilled workers and has been brought about largely by the efforts of local authorities in expanding activities by direct labour and in the creation of a general atmosphere calculated to attract workers to their areas by publicising the extent of the programmes which are on hands and which are contemplated.  I have consistently supported these local efforts and given the widest possible publicity to the importance of the national housing programme and the large measure of continuity of employment which the various planned programmes will afford to workers.  I do not maintain, however, that the shortage of skilled workers of all types has been completely met everywhere.  Local authorities in some areas still experience some shortages in the finishing trades.  I have, however, every confidence that the remaining difficulties in these respects will be overcome by careful planning of pending programmes. <Col N="673" /> Unskilled building workers whose contribution to the housing drive is so valuable, and, at the same time, so unostentatious, were employed in increasing numbers also during the year.  The number engaged in March was 7,040 as compared with 4,689 in the corresponding month last year.</P>
    <P>As regards the financing of local authority housing schemes, in addition to the provision of subsidy towards loan charges which amounts this year to £757,800 and grants for reserved houses and for extra accommodation where a member of a household is suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, it is proposed to provide a sum of £3,200,000 in the Transition Development Fund for the purpose of making capital grants in reduction of the capital amount which the local authorities have to borrow for their own housing programmes during the year. Thus, the system of contributions towards loan charges and the provision, at the same time, of capital grants is being continued in the present year. A general review is, however, being made of the working of this system with a view to the unification, if possible, of the two forms of financial assistance.  For this purpose, statistical information is being compiled on the various systems of housing finance in operation before 1932, from 1932 to 1945 and since the creation of the Transition Development Fund.</P>
    <P>I indicated last year that the question of standardising subsidies is closely allied with that of housing costs and that it would be difficult to formulate a new system of housing subsidy until a much greater degree of normality was achieved in the matter of costs.  I am glad to say that there is now greater evidence of a tendency towards stability as regards the upper limits of cost and, indeed, a tendency for contract prices to drop.  The improvement in the supply of skilled labour and of materials; keener competition by contractors and the influence of direct labour building have all contributed to these developments. Current costs are, however, still very high.  Contract prices for unserviced labourers' cottages, including site works, range from about £725 to £1,000 a cottage, while for serviced urban <Col N="674" /> houses, including development cost, the price per house is between £1,100 and £1,400.  A severely critical attitude is being maintained towards tenders submitted to local authorities and every effort is being made to ensure that good value is got for the expenditure involved.  In the course of the year local authorities were urged to take every possible step towards reducing prices and it has been intimated that tenders in excess of a reasonable maximum should be rejected.</P>
    <P>There have been significant developments during the year in the more general acceptance by local bodies of the principle that rents should bear some relation to the ability of tenants to pay.  Such a system has been in operation for many years in Cork County Borough and it has now been adopted in the County Boroughs of Dublin and Limerick and in 14 other areas.  I have been at pains to impress on local authorities that there is a statutory obligation on them to select tenants on the basis of need for accommodation rather than with regard to their ability to pay rent.  This duty cannot be avoided, in view of the clear provisions of the Acts in regard to the classes of applicants who should receive priority in the allocation of houses.</P>
    <P>Once this principle is accepted, the question arises of the better-off families who, because of their qualifications and need for accommodation, are given new houses, being required to pay a rent according to their ability to pay, within the upper limits of a pre-determined economic rent.  The general adoption of this system would ensure that in applying the State grants and subsidies and the local authorities' contributions from rates, a periodical review would be made of the means and needs of each family.  The circumstances of a household will naturally alter from time to time.  Tenants with large families of young children have many demands on their resources and often cannot be expected to expend more than a certain recognised proportion of their earnings on rent. When the children grow up and begin to earn, the financial position of that same family can alter very much for the better within a few years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="675" /> The capacity to pay varies, therefore, not only as between one tenant and another but also according to the circumstances of a particular household, from time to time.  In the larger urban areas, particularly, the diversities in family income offer a wide scope for the adoption of this renting system.</P>
    <P>A sum of £1,635,000 is included in the Estimates for grants to persons and public utility societies in respect of the erection and reconstruction of houses. This is the largest amount which has ever been provided in one year for this purpose.  It is provided to keep pace with the very marked expansion of grant-aided private building which has occurred during the last financial year. On 1st April, 1949, 7,864 allocations had been made, of which 4,692 represented grants for new houses and 3,172 for reconstructions.  Of these allocations, 746 had been fully paid during the year and 1,179 partly paid.  On 1st April last the allocations had increased to 16,362.  Of these, 10,282 were for new houses.  Grants had been fully paid in 4,159 cases and partly paid in 4,175 cases.  A total amount of £1,049,882 was paid out in respect of private building or reconstruction grants during the financial year 1949-50 and the provision now being made in the current Estimates represents an estimated 60 per cent. increase over last year's expenditure.  It will be observed from a footnote to the subhead I (3) containing this provision, that issues in excess of £414,000 will be conditional on the enactment of amending legislation.  This refers to the statutory aggregate provided for under the 1948 Act, as extended, which will require amendment by law before grants in excess of the balance remaining within the statutory limit can be exceeded.  A Bill to give effect to this provision has been introduced.</P>
    <P>This review of the position and prospects of the housing drive will, I hope, convince Deputies that the present financial year is likely to produce results in the output of completed houses by local authorities and private enterprise which will reach, if they do not surpass, the highest figures ever previously attained.  The latest figures show every sign that this very favourable <Col N="676" /> record will be achieved.  In the three months ended 31st March last, over 1,900 houses were completed by local authorities and progress at this rate would achieve an annual output considerably in excess of the pre-war record.  Between 3,000 and 4,000 new houses are expected to be completed by private enterprise.  This brings the total target which we have now in mind for the year to about 11,000 houses, both local authority and private, for the whole country.  The total output achieved in the last three years by local authorities and private enterprise shows the enormously accelerated rate at which the drive has gone forward. For 1947-48, the total was 1,502; for 1948-49, it was 3,296; and for 1949-50, it was 7,966.</P>
    <P>I have nothing but praise for the activity of the interests, both public and private, which have contributed to this great recovery in building output within such a short period of time. Local authorities and local officers throughout the country have, with very few exceptions, responded wholeheartedly to the drive for solution of the housing problem, so that in some areas the main requirements have already been, or will shortly be, met. In the larger urban areas, the programme will take a longer period to implement, but in all these areas it is well on its way.  As Dublin represents the hard core of the national housing problem, I should like to commend in particular the spectacular energies and notable success of the housing authorities in Dublin City and County, including the borough of Dún Laoghaire, and the help and encouragement which is given to these authorities by the Dublin Housing Consultative Council.</P>
    <P>The administration of the Town Planning Acts was continued during the year as in previous years, that is to say, the main attention was concentrated on interim control and the deciding of appeals made by interested parties.  The number of appeals submitted to the Minister in 1949/50 was 226 as compared with 228 in the previous year.</P>
    <P>There has been a growing interest manifested in the problems presented by the steady increase in building in <Col N="677" /> Dublin City and the surrounding areas. Officers of my Department have had consultations with the city manager and his staff on these problems.  A consistently rigid attitude is being maintained in opposition to any large scale building developments in the green belt area and effective efforts are being made for the co-ordination locally of all forms of specialist advice as regards building both by the housing authorities and private persons in the areas scheduled for residential purposes.  The organisation being aimed at is intended to achieve a complete co-ordination of policy under the Town and Regional Planning Acts, under the administration of the building bye-laws and under the Housing and Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts. Activities under the latter Acts are also closely associated with the administration by the Department of Local Government of the schemes of grants to subsidise the erection of houses by public utility societies and private persons.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that for the year 1949-50 a substantial portion of the Road Fund was made available for the first time by way of special improvement grants for county roads. The amount allocated was £1,200,000 out of a total of £2,343,518 for county council road works as a whole.  The reports available on the operation of the new system indicate that substantial improvements were effected on various county roads by the aid of the grant and that a continuance of the same system for the current year is warranted.  County councils have, accordingly, been advised that the grants for main road improvement, county road improvement and the percentage grants for ordinary works on main roads would be continued in 1950-51 on the same basis as had obtained in 1949-50.  The estimated income of the Fund for the year is £2,600,000 and the allocations, including a provisional allocation for county boroughs, amount to £2,550,000. In addition, outstanding commitments from previous years to be met in 1950-51 amount to £750,000.  To meet total charges on the Fund, further borrowing will, therefore, be necessary, within the margin of the total additional borrowing <Col N="678" /> powers conferred by statute in 1948.</P>
    <P>During the year I had a circular letter addressed to road authorities arising out of various questions raised from time to time regarding the production of road materials by way of contract and the methods by which road authorities should themselves produce such material.  I pointed out that it was essential that the best possible value should be obtained for the money spent on roads and that each road authority responsible for a substantial annual programme should provide an engineering organisation, equipment and personnel sufficient to enable them to carry it out effectively.  This policy does not exclude the purchase of material or the hire of machinery in exceptional circumstances, nor the carrying out by contract of certain road works, particularly those of a specialised or abnormal nature.</P>
    <P>I drew attention to the fact that where costs of direct labour work, either in the production of materials or in actual work on the roads, were higher than in the case of similar contract work, the excess must be due to inefficient machinery and methods.  I accordingly recommended the production by up-to-date machinery of materials at central quarries and sandpits and the use of lorries where other forms of transport would be uneconomic or impracticable.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to report that the first programme of works undertaken under the Local Authorities (Works) Act between the autumn of 1949 and March, 1950, has proved a very great success.  A sum of £1,250,000 was voted by the Dáil for the purpose of making grants to local authorities for the carrying out of works under the Act.  The local authorities selected schedules of works and their proposals were then considered by the Department. The grants were confined generally to works capable of being completed by the end of the financial year.  Practically the full amount of the voted provision was expended in the year.  The number of men employed rose from 6,000 in September, 1949, to 13,850 in March, 1950.  In the latter month over 26,000 men were employed <Col N="679" /> by county councils on road works and Works Act schemes as compared with about 19,000 men engaged on road works in the same month in 1949.</P>
    <P>A further programme of schemes under the Act is being provided for in this year's Vote where, as I have said, an increased provision of £1,750,000 has been made for the purpose.  After making provision for the payment of the balance of last year's grants and for grants for urban authorities, I have been able to notify county councils generally of their grants for the present financial year.  They total in all approximately £1,600,000.  In apportioning this sum all the relevant factors were taken into account, such as the availability of labour, last year's performance and this year's programmes.</P>
    <P>In connection with the preliminary compilation of schemes for execution in the current year local authorities were advised that, in selecting works and in determining the time for their execution, regard should be had to the labour position in the locality, the demands of other services such as road works, agriculture, etc., the need for avoiding, as far as possible, sharp fluctuations in employment, and the weather conditions necessary for good results.</P>
    <P>The number of vehicles of all classes under current licence in August, 1949, was 122,536, as compared with 108,002 such vehicles in August, 1948.</P>
    <P>The Department of Local Government, in conjunction with the National Film Institute and the Garda Síochána, has continued to arrange for the production of various forms of road safety propaganda, including the display of road safety films.  Similar activities are projected for the current financial year.</P>
    <P>I referred last year to the very large programme of waterworks and sewerage schemes which is pending in most counties and in some of the urban districts. So far as the county programmes are concerned, I indicated the need for adhering to a procedure whereby works should be undertaken in accordance with a planned programme over successive years according <Col N="680" /> to the order of their relevant urgency. The extent of the activities of local authorities in resuming the implementation of their programmes has shown a strong upward trend during the year. A larger proportion of the schemes are being gradually brought to final planning stage.  The number of schemes authorised during the year included 70 major waterworks and sewerage schemes, involving a total expenditure in excess of £1,000,000.  Of this sum, over £400,000 was met by way of grants from the Emergency and Employment Schemes Vote and the Transition Development Fund.</P>
    <P>The programme of 70 schemes so undertaken was a big advance on the previous financial year when 33 such schemes were initiated.  The programme for the current year will be approximately of the same dimensions as that undertaken in 1949-50.  If progress is maintained at this rate in subsequent years the larger portion of the accumulated sanitary services programme should be undertaken within the three subsequent financial years with the usual time lag of one or two additional years to complete the contracts entered into.  This would represent a very satisfactory position as regards the most urgent schemes but it would by no means exhaust the demands from many further areas which will be taking their place in due course in the programmes of subsequent years.</P>
    <P>Since the 1st April, 1948, a comprehensive series of inspections of all fire-fighting services throughout the State has been made by the Department's fire adviser.  Recommendations for the improvement of the fire-fighting services have been conveyed to a number of local authorities.  The recommendations are generally based on a minimum outline fire-fighting service organised on a county basis.  The office of chief fire officer of a county or county borough has been approved as a whole-time permanent and pensionable post.  In some counties there has been a reluctance to appoint a chief fire officer.  I would like now to reiterate what has been pointed out in correspondence with the authorities concerned that no appreciable measure of success can be achieved in the <Col N="681" /> matter of securing even a minimum fire-fighting organisation in the absence of the continuous control, planning and supervision which a chief officer is intended to exercise.  Draft fire standards were issued to local authorities last year and have now been published in book form.  I hope that perusal of the standards will bring home to all concerned the very considerable tasks which lie ahead with a view to making places of public resort and institutions more secure against fire risk.</P>
    <P>Official contractors have been appointed for the supply of approximately 3,000 commodities during the current contract year.  Many commodities which were off the official list for some ten years are again being made available at competitive prices.  There is also evidence of increases in the number of commodities of Irish manufacture for which it is now possible to obtain satisfactory tenders.  There was a further marked increase in the number of applications for appointment as official contractors from provincial merchants.</P>
    <P>The prices quoted by contractors are not yet showing any general tendency to fall.  Reductions have taken place in the prices of a number of essential commodities but these are offset by increases in others.</P>
    <P>Last year many Deputies commented on the upward trend of rates and there were some forecasts as to further increases in the burden on ratepayers.  I am glad to say that these forecasts have proved to be largely fanciful.  The simple average of rates struck by county councils for the year 1950-51 is just a fraction of a penny less than that for the previous year.  In round figures it may be said that the average rates for the two years are the same, viz., 23/2 in the £.</P>
    <P>The county rate collection for the past year was very satisfactory, 97.5 per cent.  of the total warrant for the year having been collected at the 31st March, 1950, as against 97.2 per cent. on the corresponding date last year.  I trust that the public-spirited reaction of ratepayers generally as shown in the fine record of rate collection for the past year will continue to manifest <Col N="682" /> itself.  The increases which have taken place in the rates in recent years are, in my view, not symptomatic of extravagance or of ill-considered expenditure but rather a reflection of the great increase in essential local activities which has taken place, combined with the general post-war increases in costs generally.</P>
    <P>I have had occasion frequently to point out, both in this House and elsewhere, that the factors to which I have referred have led to substantially greater increases in the expenditure from the Exchequer on grants made available to local authorities in relief of rates on land and towards the cost of other services.  This tendency was referred to by the Minister for Finance in his Financial Statement for the current year, where he pointed out that since 1938/39 Government grants to local authorities have increased by over £10,000,000, whereas rates have risen by £4.6 million.</P>
    <P>The total loans sanctioned for purposes other than housing for the year amounted to £1,184,782 as compared with £871,601 in the previous year. The increase reflects increased activities of local authorities in respect of sewerage schemes, vocational education, construction of hospitals, county homes and dispensaries, etc.  Housing loans sanctioned in 1949-50 amounted to £11,833,234 as compared with £8,361,258 in the previous financial year.</P>
    <P>In the course of the year under review, the general administration of local authorities was, on the whole, very satisfactory.  I have visited a large number of local administrative units, mainly in connection with the opening of new housing schemes, but I invariably take the opportunity of inquiring into the general conditions and hearing the views of local representatives and others regarding the needs of the several districts.  I have experienced everywhere a very full degree of evidence of the willingness of local representatives and local officers to co-operate in the major schemes being promoted under my supervision.</P>
    <P>Needless to say, I am frequently confronted with demands which, in my position as mediator between the central <Col N="683" /> authorities and the local authorities, I am often unable to concede fully and sometimes I have to reject them completely or suggest that the projects be deferred.  Nevertheless, there is, I believe, a continued increase in that close and realistic understanding which I mentioned last year was growing up between my Department and the spokesmen of local administration. I wish to assure the House, and particularly those Deputies who are themselves local representatives, and through them local elected bodies generally, that so far as I am concerned my efforts will be constantly directed towards a development of this friendly understanding and co-operation with local bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration. In doing so, I understand that the Government business has got itself into such a muddle that it is necessary for us to be as brief and as cogent as we can in the criticisms which we have to make of the present general administration of the public services.  Therefore, I do not intend to detain the House at any great length. Perhaps, accordingly, I should begin my speech by commending the Minister in the few instances in which I can commend him for some of the things which he has done.  I am glad to see that, despite the reluctance with which it was received when it was first put before the House in the Housing Act of 1948, the Minister has realised that, if our housing problem is to be tackled without crippling the State and the local authorities, it is essential that the rents of houses built by public authorities, with Government subsidies and with subventions from the rates, should be related to the capacity of the tenants to pay.  I think there will be general agreement that this is a just and equitable principle and I am glad to see that the Minister for Local Government, representing as he does the Labour Party in the Cabinet, has at last accepted it.  I congratulate him upon his courage and I am sure that the acceptance of that principle will be of very great assistance to him indeed <Col N="684" /> in tackling the very difficult problem of providing houses for those of our people who require them.</P>
      <P>The other matter upon which I should like to congratulate him is the earnest attempt which he is now making to give effect to the policy which had been adopted by the Fianna Fáil Administration of ensuring that every centre of population would be provided with fire fighting services to the best of its ability to maintain them. We know that the need for utilising these services does not often arise.  It is only when a holocaust occurs, such as the lamentable tragedy in Cavan some years ago, a tragedy of such a shocking and heart-rending description, that the public conscience is sufficiently stirred and a general appreciation is formed of the need for systematic and careful organisation and maintenance of these services.  I know from experience that the Minister is not going to find it easy to persuade shortsighted people, who sometimes do occupy positions of public responsibility, to recognise that need; but I am glad to see that he is addressing himself to the task of persuading them, and I can only say that, as far as I am concerned, I will heartily support his efforts in that regard.</P>
      <P>Now let me come to some of the other aspects of the statement which the Minister has presented to the House, to which, as a matter of public duty speaking here for the Opposition, I must direct attention.  What I propose to say immediately does not apply, so far as I know, personally to the Minister for Local Government.  I have found him courteous and prepared to accept criticism.  It is a well-known fact, however, that there are colleagues of his in the Government, who think that the public have become so habituated to their extravagance that they no longer have any regard for questions of pounds, shillings and pence in relation to public services, while these Ministers themselves have now reached such a state of prodigal exaltation that it is regarded by them as something treasonable even to suggest that the burdens upon our people as ratepayers and as taxpayers might not already have become excessive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="685" /> In that connection, it might be no harm to remind the House at this stage that when the Government first became responsible for sponsoring Estimates in this House in March, 1948, they presented a volume of Estimates the total sum of which amounted to £70,520,000 and they were careful to append to that volume a disclaimer stating that it was the Fianna Fáil Administration and not they, not these prudent, provident, stewards who were now going to take charge of the public finances, who were responsible for the fact that they had to present to Dáil Eireann for acceptance Estimates which totalled the staggering sum of £70,520,000.</P>
    <P>This year however, they are no longer imbued with this desire to disclaim responsibility for extravagance. On the contrary, they come to the Dáil glorying in it and there is presented to us Estimates for the Public Services which total £78,127,000.  It is a colossal and staggering sum, which has already been commented on in this House.  I do not want to deal with the aggregate figure but I wish to call public attention to the fact that in the year in which Fianna Fáil left office, February, 1948, in the Estimates which they had provided for the incoming year, for the year which ended on the 31st March, 1949, the total sum asked for the service of the Department of Local Government was £1,172,000. This year, the figure has jumped to no less than £4,382,000&mdash;an increase of almost 300 per cent.  Is it not staggering to think of it?  Here, while the cost of living is mounting, while the people are groaning under taxation, while they are flying from the lands of Ireland, while emigration has become almost uncontrollable, the Government proposes to take from the service by the people of their individual needs, whether they are employers or employees, whether they are manufacturers or farmers, a sum which is almost four times as great as that which was denounced in unbridled language as extravagant when the Fianna Fáil Estimates were submitted to this House in March, 1948.  An increase of £3,210,000 represents the fulfilment of the Government's pledges to reduce extravagance and to curb expenditure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="686" /> There is something more even than that in this matter.  In 1948-49, what we proposed to take would have been raised out of taxation.  The money that we were to spend in any one year we proposed to collect in that year.  We proposed to treat our people honestly.  We proposed to have some regard for interests other than our own and our own narrow political interest.  We proposed in the year 1949 to pay our way as we went.  In this year in which they propose to spend £4,382,000, they propose to borrow £3,435,000 and, of the huge sum of £4,382,000, they propose to pay now something just a fraction over 20 per cent.&mdash;the remaining 80 per cent. of the indebtedness which the Government propose to incur for the public services they are leaving to be paid by their successors, whomsoever they may be.  Here, when the world is shaping up to war, when all the resources of the country in the future may be taxed in order to preserve the independence of this people, this Government is already trenching upon those resources, already depleting them and spending them in ways which even the Minister for Finance himself finds it difficult to justify.</P>
    <P>One may, of course, endeavour to discount what a member of the Opposition will say in relation to expenditure on the part of the Government, but we have the spectacle of the Minister for Finance coming in and, with special reference to some of the items in this Vote and other Votes, pleading to the House to try to save him from his colleagues&mdash;he could scarcely regard them as his friends when they compel him by their exigent demands upon him to make the kind of <i>ad misericordiam</i> appeal which I am going to recall to the recollection of Deputies.  The Minister for Finance, speaking in this House on the Vote on Account, said, as he is reported in Volume 119, column 2070:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I would ask that there be the most careful scrutiny of the separate items under these headings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has to come to this House and make that sort of appeal&mdash;saying to the Opposition, in fact: &ldquo;Boys, it is up to you.  I have done my best to curb this extravagant <Col N="687" /> programme.  I have tried to keep the State expenditure within bounds.  I have not been able to succeed and I cannot succeed short of resigning my portfolio and breaking up the Coalition. Therefore, I throw myself on your mercy and I ask you in regard to housing, land rehabilitation, drainage and other works to subject all these proposals of my colleagues to the most careful scrutiny.&rdquo;  Is it not clear then that not only are we convinced, but that the Minister for Finance himself is also convinced, that it is time somebody tried to call a halt to this extravagant administration?  If I may reinforce the quotation which I have just given in relation to the Vote on Account by what the Minister said in the Seanad on the Second Reading of the Finance Bill, when he admitted in reply to the criticisms of the Budget which he had to meet in the Seanad that taxation had already reached fantastic heights, is it not doubly clear that what the Minister for Finance asked for is justified, and that we are justified ourselves in approaching the demand of the Minister for £4,382,000 with a sceptical mind as to whether, indeed, expenditure of that huge sum is justified?</P>
    <P>Let us consider some of the items under it.  Sub-head K (5) provides the sum of £1,750,000 for grants to local authorities for the execution of works under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949.  The Minister, in the course of his speech, told us the number of schemes that had been embarked upon and the number of people that had been employed, and no doubt these are statistics which are worthy of consideration.  But there is something more than spending money merely in order to get thousands of schemes under way and tens of thousands of men employed.</P>
    <P>One is justified in asking, is the expenditure of that huge sum of money, £1,750,000, justified in regard to every penny?  I know, of course, there will be different approaches to this question. I know that some people will say that in their area some good schemes have been carried out.  On the other hand, in other areas we hear <Col N="688" /> that some schemes which could not be held by any means to be reproductive or remunerative or value for the money have been carried out.  There is no justification in spending public money on a scheme merely to inflate the Minister's statistics, merely to be able to state that at a given date in any particular year so many men were employed. Public money should only be spent if the results of that expenditure, in terms of the executed works, justify it.  Therefore, we are justified in asking whether the schemes which have been carried out are value for the money.</P>
    <P>There again, it would seem as if others than members of the Opposition are somewhat sceptical about the utility of these schemes and as to what has been the net benefit that has accrued from their execution.  No less a person that the Minister for Finance has betrayed an attitude in regard to them that might well justify him placing himself upon these benches.  When speaking on the Vote on Account he said it was found that more money would be required for the immediate purpose of drainage.  It will be noted that one of the things that is to be done under this subhead is the execution of works affording relief or protection from flooding&mdash;that is, drainage.</P>
    <P>This is what the Minister for Finance had to say in regard to that particular aspect of the problem&mdash;but before I quote the Minister I should remind the House that when the Local Authorities (Works) Act was going through the Dáil last year or in 1948, there was an intense drive made by the Minister for Local Government to secure that the county engineers of the local authorities would submit to the Department the greatest possible number of schemes that they could conceivably think of to be carried out in their administrative areas, so that as soon as the Bill went through, the purse strings were unloosed, public money was scattered, broadcast over the country and the engineers were told to go ahead and make a show of doing some useful work.  It is necessary to remind the House that it was in that position of chaos, disorganisation and hasty improvisation that these public <Col N="689" /> works schemes were launched.  That is what gives the point to the quotation I am going to give from the Minister for Finance&mdash;in which we have his disclosure of the way in which this problem of local authorities' works was tackled by the Department.  In column 2072, Volume 119, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We discovered here and there that land rehabilitation was held up by the fact that, where the waters had been channelled in various ways, they could not be run off properly because the outfall had not been prepared properly under the land drainage scheme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is precisely what the Opposition warned the Minister would occur if effect were to be given to the provisions of the Local Authorities (Works) Act in the manner in which we apprehended they would be given, by reason of the general approach of the Minister for Local Government and the Government as a whole to this problem.</P>
    <P>Here we may ask ourselves, since so much of the £1,225,000 which was provided in the year 1949 for these works has been mis-spent in the manner in which the Minister for Finance has disclosed to the House, how much of the £1,725,000, which we are going to provide for that same purpose this year, is going to be mis-spent in a similar way, making a splash of doing something for the sake of securing political kudos from it at the public expense?</P>
    <P>It would seem to me that the whole of this question of public works has been carried out in the spirit in which I think the Minister for Agriculture was speaking of his attack upon the problem of inland fisheries, that is in &ldquo;pragmatical sphere&rdquo;.  The whole approach has been one of trial and error.  &ldquo;Clear this drain and we will see what happens in the next farmer's field; clear this river and we will see what happens at the main outfall, let us get ahead and proceed on the principle of trial and error and spend as much public money as we can get the Dáil to vote for us and the shortness of our period of office permits us.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That system worked reasonably well last year and this year, thanks to no foresight, thanks to no planning on the part of those responsible for the manner in which this problem has been <Col N="690" /> attacked, but thanks to a beneficent Providence who blessed this country last year with the finest summer we had for many a long generation and, up to now, as good a summer as we have ever enjoyed.</P>
    <P>The weather has been dry, the effects of this premature clearing of the water courses which feed our main arterial system have not been manifested during periods of wet weather, during such a winter, say, as we had in the year 1947; but if the coming winter or the winter following proves to be such another disastrous winter as that was, I wonder what the effect of all this unco-ordinated, ill-conceived, unplanned attack upon a very difficult problem is going to be on the property of those who live in our towns and cities that border the banks of our main rivers, or those who live along our main water courses. That is when this policy, which the present Government has embarked upon, will be tested: that is when we will know what fraction of that £3,000,000 which represents the aggregate of the actual expenditure last year and that which is proposed for this year has been, shall we say, not manifestly ill spent but has been justified.  There is a balance, I think a very large balance, that must be written off as being ill spent.</P>
    <P>Now, I do not want to overlook the good resolution with which I opened, that is to say, that I intended to be as brief as I could.  There are one or two other matters, however, that I ought to touch on.  There is housing. The Minister talks about the intensified housing drive.  The Minister wishes, and the Government as a whole wishes, the country to believe that the problem of housing was neglected until they took office, when the fact is, as the Minister and the country know, the present Coalition Administration got off to a flying start.  The 1948 Housing Act had been passed; the sites for the housing schemes had been procured; the plans for the houses had been prepared; contracts, in many cases, had been placed and any houses that were built in 1948, 1949 or in 1950 derive entirely from the efforts of the Minister's predecessors over the years from 1945 to 1948.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to be censorious of the Minister for being a Party man, or that as a member of the Government, he tries to claim the greatest amount of credit he possibly can for the fact that the Fianna Fáil housing schemes are now coming to fruition under him.  That is natural and he is quite entitled to do it.  I am only pointing out not the propaganda in the matter but the truth in the matter.  I am only pointing out that there is not a house that is being built in the City of Dublin to-day that would be now in process of erection if it had not been for the work that had been done by the Fianna Fáil Administration in securing the sites and preparing the plans.  Mind you the securing of the sites is the most tedious and difficult portion of it.  In many cases, the sites had not only been secured but developed, in many cases the foundations had been laid, and in every case the plans had been prepared.</P>
      <P>Let us see how, even with that flying start, the record of the Minister for the year 1949-50 compares with the record of one of the Minister's predecessors, the then Minister for Local Government, for the year 1938-39.  I do not want to weary the House, but I shall give just one example, that of the number of houses completed for the Dublin Corporation.  In the year 1938-39 the total number of houses completed for the Dublin Corporation was 2,335.  I have that figure on the authority of the Minister himself who gave it in reply to a parliamentary question which was put down by my colleague and friend, Deputy Childers. For the year 1949-50, under this Ministry of push and go, the number of houses completed in the City of Dublin was 1,576.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy like to live habitually in a house without a roof?  I am talking of houses <Col N="692" /> in which people can live.  In 1938-39, the number of such houses completed and ready for occupation in the City of Dublin was 2,335, and for the year 1949-50, the number was 1,576, a deficiency of 759.  In the light of those figures I might say that the progress which is being made is somewhat disappointing. I do not want to disguise the difficulties which the Minister has encountered.  I know that materials in the year 1949-50 were not in as free supply as they were in 1938-39.  I know that, perhaps, we had not as many available workers, though I am not so certain about that, because, according to the same parliamentary question, the number of people employed in 1938-39 varied&mdash;let me remind the House again that the number of houses completed in the City of Dublin in that year was 2,335&mdash; between 2,320 and 4,243.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, in the year 1949-50, when only 1,576 houses were constructed, the number of men employed varied between 2,663 and 3,342.  One would perhaps be justified in making a rough calculation and saying that the position was that under the sort of lackadaisical administration which we were alleged to have when Fianna Fáil was in office, the labour involved over that period in constructing a house amounted to 1.67 men, but that in the year 1949-50, under the administration which is making an intensive housing drive, the output is such that it requires 2.5 men to produce a house in a year.  That is a rough and ready way of putting it.  I do not suggest that the figures have very much value as statistics, but that is a way of looking at it.  It does indicate that the Fianna Fáil Administration was getting better results out of the housing industry in the City of Dublin than the Coalition Administration is getting now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the rates. He will forgive me if I say that I detected a certain tone of complacency in his reference to the rates.  He referred to the fact that people had been grumbling about the burden which the rates represent and that they had been seriously apprehensive, as indeed they might have been, as to what the level of the rates would be for the coming <Col N="693" /> year.  He said that he was glad to say that all those dismal Jimmies who had been talking about the prospect of increased rates had been stultified because the rates, in fact, were a fraction of a penny less than they had been for the financial year which ended on the 31st March last.</P>
    <P>Of course, there are a number of factors to be taken into consideration in assessing the merits of the fact that the apprehensions as to the possibility of an increase in the rates were not realised.  But there is one fact that we should not leave out of consideration. That is the fact that the local elections are looming in the offing and experienced politicians, like my friends, Deputy Byrne, Deputy Dunne and a few other gentlemen, have felt, perhaps, that it might not be such a bad idea to inflate the rates for the year 1949-50, in order that they might be able to reduce the rates a little for the year 1950-51; and that, therefore, as a consequence of that, because there was an unnecessary inflation of the rates in the year 1949-50, there has been an actual increase in the real demand to be made upon the ratepayers for the year 1950-51.  However, that is perhaps a surmise as to what is a possible explanation of the fact that the rates in the year 1950-51 are just a fraction of a penny less than they were in the year 1949-50.</P>
    <P>Will the House consider what these rates might have been were it not for an Act passed by the Fianna Fáil Administration in the year 1947; it is No. 48 of 1947 and it is entitled the Health Services (Financial Provisions) Act?  I wonder what the rates of the local authorities would have been were it not for the fact that the Fianna Fáil Administration, which was alleged to be extravagant and to have no regard to the position of the local ratepayers or the local authorities, had passed that Act.  Could the Minister for Local Government, when he is replying, tell the House the total sum which has been paid under that Act to the local authorities over and above what was paid out of the Central Fund to those authorities before the passage of that Act? Then we shall see what the position of these local authorities might have been had not Fianna Fáil been in office in <Col N="694" /> 1947 and had the Government of the day not passed that Act.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to say too much about roads.  I understand that some Deputies propose to move a motion which will be discussed concurrently with the Estimate.  They may wish to speak at greater length upon this matter.  Everybody who has had occasion to travel the main roads throughout the country will concede that their condition is deteriorating and that they are not nearly so good now as they were in 1948.  Let us not forget that in the year 1948 we were repairing and making good the deficiencies that had occurred in road maintenance over the period of the war years.  I ascribe this deterioration, not perhaps very pronounced at the moment, but still noticeable, to the fact that the central authority is failing to give sufficient assistance to the local authorities to maintain the roads in proper condition.</P>
    <P>It is true that in 1948 the Government had to implement the promise which the Fianna Fáil Administration had given that an additional sum of £2,000,000, over and above what the Road Fund could supply, would be made available to the local authorities to carry out the further reconstruction necessary and the essential replacement works on roads.  But that £2,000,000, which we had intended to provide out of the Central Fund as a free grant, was provided by the Minister's predecessor by borrowing on the security of the Road Fund.  The Minister has told us to-day that, because further expenditure upon the roads is required, further borrowings on the fund must be made.  I think we can describe this Government as the most &ldquo;borrowingest&rdquo; Government in existence. If they can borrow, they will not raise the money in any other way; they have an entirely spendthrift, prodigal and improvident policy in regard to the defrayment of the cost of public services.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to that matter is, of course, similar to the position in regard to the housing grants for which they propose to borrow and in regard to local authority works for which they also propose to borrow. Every borrowing which they make on the security of the Road Fund reduces <Col N="695" /> the future capacity of that fund to meet the future demands which will inevitably be made upon it and, therefore, we are merely putting off the evil day when further expenditure will have to be incurred upon our roads and there will be no free revenue in the Road Fund to borrow against.  We should face the fact that if the Road Fund is not able out of its own resources to meet the cost, then that expenditure should be met by the central authority out of the Central Fund by way of grant; or, if the central authority is not prepared to do that, then the motor vehicle duties and the other duties which feed the Road Fund should be increased in order that the roads, which are such an important item in the economic life of the country, may be maintained on a proper standard.</P>
    <P>In that connection it might not be out of place to lament the vacillating and pusillanimous attitude which the Minister displayed in relation to an urgent scheme of road improvement in the neighbourhood of this city.  I refer to his abandonment of the Bray Road improvement project.  There is no doubt whatever that that abandonment was a grave error of policy on his part. Everybody knows that that road is one of the main arteries from the city to Wexford and, ultimately, to Waterford, through the important towns along our eastern coast south of Dublin. It is a road that is a veritable death trap.  It is a road where accidents are of daily occurrence.  It is a road the improvement of which is urgently demanded and the improvement of which was being carried out gradually year by year under the Fianna Fáil Administration.  That the improvement was not complete before 1948 was due entirely to the intervention of war and to no other reason. This is a public work that must ultimately and inevitably be carried out.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest the work should be carried out all at once.  It was a work designed to be carried out in stages spread over a number of years.  It would have cost in the long run something in the region of £233,000.  It has now been deferred and the ultimate consequence of that will be that, when <Col N="696" /> it is carried out, it will in all probability cost twice as much.  In the meantime the life of every user of that road, whether he be a pedestrian, a motorist, the driver of a horse-drawn vehicle or a cyclist, will at certain sections of that road be in inevitable jeopardy every time he passes over them.  The Minister was stampeded into abandoning this project by a campaign conducted in a newspaper in the interests of a few individuals who resented the fact that the amenities of their properties might be interfered with.  I hope that the Minister&mdash;the Minister is a man of courage and I have no reason to deny that&mdash;will regard the shelving of that scheme as only temporary, that he will take it up again as soon as the local elections are over, and he will ensure that it is proceeded with and given effect to.  I am glad to see that the Minister recognises the need for completing this scheme in the form in which it was originally planned.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other matters which I shall just briefly mention in the hope that the Minister may give us some information in regard to them when he is replying.  For many years, there has appeared in the Estimates a sub-head providing for competitions for designs for housing schemes.  The purpose of the competitions was to secure some variation in the more or less standardised type of house which is built under the various Housing Acts.  We were anxious if we could to secure model plans and model lay-outs, which would inspire architects and engineers, who are responsible for the execution of these schemes, to combine aesthetic considerations with mere utility.  As I have said, I had hoped that we had got to the stage after the change of Government took place that we would have that competition held in the year 1948-49.  For some reason or other, it has not taken place.  I am glad to see that the Minister has not abandoned the idea and that the provision continues to appear in the Estimates for his Department.  I should like if he could give us an assurance that the competitions will actually take place this year and that the community as a whole will have the benefit of them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="697" /> There is another matter upon which I should like the Minister to give us some information.  In the year 1947 I thought we had reached a virtual conclusion as to the lines upon which the North County Dublin regional water supply would be carried out.  That was a very important work.  I thought that we had reached a solution as between the Dublin Corporation on the one hand, as the main water suppliers, and the Dublin County Council on the other, as representing the main consumers. I do not know what progress has been made in giving effect to the scheme but I should be glad if the Minister would give me some information in regard to it.  I should like also if he would let me know the position in relation to the Howth main drainage which has again an important place in the general development plans for Dublin and the metropolitan district. I have nothing more to say on the subject.  I shall leave a more detailed criticism of the administration of the Department to other Deputies who may wish to participate in the debate.</P>

I do not know whether that was, in fact, a definite agreement.  What I suggest to Deputy Corry is that if he would devote that part of his speech which he intended to make to the general demands which the maintenance of the roads in proper condition would make upon the finances of the State in one form or another and leave to one side the question of how the money would be provided we might conduct the debate on these lines and we might, if the Chair permitted, put the motion afterwards as a separate motion to be decided without discussion.</P>

      <P>As I said, in moving the motion, I have no doubt that I will have the support of every Deputy no matter what Party he belongs to, because we are in the position that the roads of this country were, in the first instance, built out of the ratepayers' money in the old Grand Jury days and that was carried on by the rates collected by the county councils when they came into being.  These roads were built up by the ordinary country people paying each year their assessment on roads.  Now of late years, and when I say of late years I do not mean the lifetime of this Government or the lifetime of any other Government, this thing of collecting money which is other people's property and devoting it to uses other than the use to which it should be put, namely, the improvement of our roads, has been carried on <Col N="703" /> here.  It is on account of that that we are anxious that the Government should step in and refund in the only way possible for them by handing over the money derived from the roads by motor taxation, petrol taxation and by the import duty on motor vehicles and devoting it to the roads for the next three years so as at least to bring them up to a condition in which they will be able to bear modern traffic.</P>
      <P>The Minister might state that he was not the first bandit, but the facts remain that motor taxation went up during the past two years by over £750,000, and that petrol taxation went up by close on £2,000,000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="704" /> Let us have a look at the condition of those roads for which we want this money.  The report of the deputy county engineer of Cork County stated on the 17th January, 1950:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We present our estimates for the year 1950-51 and this year we are making a radical change as we have made it out in two parts: (1) the minimum required for pure maintenance, and (2) a list of works of rolling, etc., on important non-rolled roads.</P>
    <P>Our maintenance figures are the lowest at which we consider our roads can be maintained at their existing standard.  The comparative figures of our estimate and the amount available in 1939/40 show an increase of 126 per cent.  This at first glance seems large but is, in fact, on the small side as wages have increased from 35/- a week to 66/- a week, an increase of almost 90 per cent., and the price of cut back bitumen has increased from £4 1s. 0d. per ton to £15 12s. 4d. per ton, an increase of 385 per cent.  This means that our surface dressing costs have gone up practically three times the pre-war price.  Having regard, therefore, to the value of money, we are asking for less than was allowed pre-war.</P>
    <P>The biggest factor of all we have left to last, namely, the intensity of traffic and the change that has taken place both in the location and weights of such traffic.  Roads that only occasionally saw a lorry pre-war are now expected to take very heavy traffic and these roads have deteriorated sadly.  In August, 1939, the number of vehicles taxed in County Cork was 5,571; in August, 1948, it was 8,997; in August, 1949, it was 10,791; and the estimate for 1950 is 12,300.  In other words, our motor traffic has doubled in numbers and is getting on towards trebling, and the weights of the individual vehicles have also increased in nearly the same proportion, so that it would be fair to say that the total weight of motor traffic using the roads to-day is not less than four times that of pre-war.</P>
    <P>Last year the amount of money available for county roads permitted only a negligible amount of surface <Col N="705" /> dressing on existing surface-dressed roads and no money was available for this purpose from central funds, with the sole exception of a few miles of suburban roads carrying city bus services.  In the South Cork district, for instance, there were 162 miles of surface-dressed roads at March 31st, 1949, and over 150 miles could not be done.  This is a very serious situation as a few years of this would mean the breaking up of these roads and the loss of the capital expenditure involved in their making.  The same applies, in a lesser degree, to the north and west areas, but the total money involved is not far short of £750,000.</P>
    <P>In view of the above, we consider that we are justified in not accepting responsibility for the maintenance of the roads unless the sum asked for the purpose is made available.</P>
    <P>In the course of the year, and in fact any year, representations are made in various ways to the council to have certain roads rolled, etc., and a common method of dealing with such applications is to refer them to the estimates meeting.  We are now submitting a list of roads which, in our opinion, should be improved, and we give in each case an approximate estimate for the council to implement resolutions, or take such steps as it thinks fit.  In considering this list, it can be borne in mind that a grant for the improvement of roads will, in all probability, be made available in the coming year much on the lines as in the current year.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That was signed by Mr. Coffey, Mr. O'Donnell, and Mr. P.J. Malone, the three deputy county engineers for the county.  The report continues:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;What is the result of that appeal? They say, in the first place, that the <Col N="706" /> minimum required for road maintenance was: main roads, £160,000; county roads, £253,000.  All they got from the county council was £136,000 for main roads and £206,000 for county roads, leaving a deficit of £71,000 for road maintenance on main roads alone.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reason for that was that despite the fact that the cost of bitumen had gone up and wages had gone up, the Minister only made the same allowance in grant as was made in the previous year.  The elected representatives on the Cork County Council could not see their way to place any further burden on already overburdened ratepayers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Not the whole lot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Desmond will have an opportunity of speaking on this Estimate.  I advise him to take a look at the back numbers of the <i>Cork Examiner</i> and see what he did at the meeting of the Cork County Council.  The position is that the roads in Cork County this year are being run, in respect of maintenance alone, on a sum which is £71,000 short of the lowest estimate the county surveyors could give, and I want the Minister to realise that.</P>
      <P>With regard to the improvement looked for by the three county surveyors, the total estimate for the improvement, not of all the roads but of some of the roads in Cork County alone amounts to £1,000,000 or one quarter of what we are looking for in this motion, so that, at best, if this motion is carried, we could only do half the job of improvements which the surveyors say is necessary in Cork County this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These roads are the property of the local authority, the county council, and not the property of the State, and, if the State collects an income from these roads by way of motor taxation, petrol taxation or otherwise, every £ they collect means an extra deterioration in the condition of these roads and extra wear and tear on these roads.  I am sure the Minister knows and appreciates that fact and he will appreciate my anxiety that these roads should not get into any worse condition than they are <Col N="707" /> in now.  They are the property of the local authority, as I say, and it is a new form&mdash;or, if you like, an old form &mdash;of highway robbery for the State to step in and give an individual a licence to travel over these roads, while drawing a tax from his petrol, when the roads which are worn by that individual are not the property of the State.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the House will agree that transport has been completely revolutionised during the past ten years.  One sees very few horses and carts or horses and butts going the roads nowadays.  The bulk of the transport is motor-lorry transport.  The bulk of the passengers travelling travel by car.  We hear a lot about the dollars which the tourists bring in.  They come in here and travel on one of these roads which the county surveyors have said will be unfit for traffic, if some radical change in the system of financing them is not made, and, if they break a couple of springs, they will not come again, and we will lose that asset.</P>
    <P>I should like this matter to be taken seriously into consideration not alone by the Minister and the Government but by all the Deputies, each of whom in his own county is faced with the same condition of affairs as that with which we are faced in Cork.  There is no justification for that condition of affairs being carried on week after week and month after month.</P>
    <P>The Minister during the past fortnight has received from the Cork County Council an appeal which was passed unanimously by the council on exactly these lines, so that, in speaking here, I speak with the unanimous voice of the elected representatives of the Cork County Council.  We all see what the position is and we see the condition into which these roads are falling day after day and week after week.  In the case of a number of these roads, as I pointed out during previous discussions on roads, the water-table, instead of being in the dyke at the side of the road, as it used to be, is now in the centre of the road, and, despite the soft and cooing voice with which the Parliamentary Secretary told me some time ago that I could get such matters dealt with under the Local Authorities <Col N="708" /> (Works) Act, I notice that, when these matters are sent in, they are turned down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee said it is waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Every Deputy can answer for himself.  I am putting my case and I can assure the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary that, if the position were reversed in the morning and it was Deputy MacEntee who was sitting there, I would make the same case and put forward the same arguments. This is not a political matter with me.  It is a matter of seeing that the property entrusted to us as representatives of the ratepayers, the property of which we are the custodians, will not be allowed to deteriorate, while money is taken out of it for purposes other than those to which that money should go, that is, the upkeep of the roads of the county.  That is my attitude in this regard.  Out of the county roads, the State has drawn an income which amounts to, roughly, £2,300,000 more than Deputy MacEntee drew when he was Minister in his last year of office.  Surely we could expect that that £2,300,000 would go back into the roads and that the attitude of the Minister for Local Government would be that he would insist that at least he would hand back the roads to his successor in as good a condition as he got them.  That would not be asking for too much.  If these roads have deteriorated to the extent that there is £2,300,000 worth of traffic more on them, that £2,300,000 should go into the roads.  There is no justification whatever for the attitude that has been adopted in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that we have not alone the opportunity before the recess of puting this case but that we also have the opportunity before the recess of having a separate vote on it and of enabling Deputies to come together on this and to insist, by passing this motion, that the local authorities will get what they are entitled to.  That is all we are asking for.  I consider that a three-years' programme on the lines I have suggested will undoubtedly bring the roads up to a standard that will bear the modern traffic that is imposed on them.  It will relieve the <Col N="709" /> Minister of nightmares.  It will relieve him of a load on his mind every day, thinking of the condition of the roads, thinking of the deterioration of the roads and afraid of his life even to take his car into one of these by-roads for fear he would never come out of it again.  The Minister knows the position that exists.  The Minister knows that these roads are not fit for traffic.  When the Minister is opening housing schemes some day, he may get into one of the bad roads and I would not like to meet the Minister when he would be stuck in one of them.</P>
    <P>The condition of the roads is to my mind complete justification of the case we are putting up.  I do not wish to delay the House on the Estimate in general.  I could, perhaps, say a lot praising the Minister.  I could perhaps refer to other things in which he is to my mind blamable.  I consider that this matter transcends in importance any proposition that could be put up. I have great pleasure in moving the motion and recommending it to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all we require.  I will be as brief as possible. When I decided to attach my signature to this motion, it was not just through any caprice or for publicity of any sort.  It was because I saw that it is a matter of dire necessity that something should be done to change the condition of our roads.  Deputy Corry has given an account of conditions in Cork.  Any Deputy or member of a local body who is sincere and honest in expressing his views can say the same of practically every county.  It <Col N="710" /> is true that, during the emergency, owing to turf production, in the West of Ireland, work on roads was very much neglected.  Most of the men who had been engaged on the roads were engaged in the production of hand-won turf, with the result that the roads deteriorated greatly.  Added to that, there was very heavy traffic.  Lorries carrying many tons were travelling, not only over the main roads, but over the secondary roads, county roads and by-roads.  The result is that there is great deterioration in the condition of the roads.</P>
      <P>During the three years before Fianna Fáil left office, liberal grants were given for the restoration of the roads but that work was not completed.  Last year we were notified by the then Minister for Local Government that our grants were to be cut down.  We were also notified that a certain amount was to be allocated for the improvement of county roads.  That was a good thing all right but I am afraid the Minister is very optimistic if he thinks that the amount allocated for the improvement of main roads will do anything appreciable in any reasonable time.  At the rate we got grants, it would be about 70 years before we would have improved all our county roads and long before that time had expired there would be a great need for renewal.  The amount granted for improvement of county roads is altogether insufficient.</P>
      <P>Apart from the condition of county roads, main roads in many cases are very badly in need of re-surfacing and in fact many main roads in the West of Ireland should be rebuilt because they are not able to carry the traffic that they are carrying at the present time. In County Roscommon in only about two cases are the streets of our towns in a reasonable condition.  The streets of all the other towns would need to be rebuilt.  That would be a very big task and would require a great deal of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Bord na Móna ceased production of hand-won turf, they left us a legacy of roads that were in a deplorable condition.  Hardly a week passes that representations are not made to me by people who live along the roads asking that something should be done <Col N="711" /> about them.  Only a few days ago I was told of a bridge that was broken on a by-road.  Bord na Móna left it there and it is now impassable.</P>
    <P>Taking all things into account, I would say that the roads are in a very bad condition.  I am not blaming the present Minister for Local Government. It was not he who first intimated that the road grants would be reduced, but I think he would understand that it was a very grave thing to do.  Even allowing for the fact that in the last year we got something like £42,000 improvement grant for county roads, the net reduction, as we had estimated, was £78,000 for a mediumsize county.  That was a very serious matter and has been a very serious matter since.</P>
    <P>This year, in preparing his estimate, the county engineer estimated for over 50 per cent. more than we were prepared to give him.  Unlike other counties, we did not continue the rate that had been struck in previous years.  The roads had deteriorated so much that we decided&mdash;this applied to people of all Parties on the county council&mdash;to increase the rate for county roads alone by 1/8 in the £.  Last year, when we were notified of the cut in road grants, we only raised the rate by 5d. in the £. Deputies can see that the raising of the rate by 1/8 in the £ is a very big step and represents very heavy expenditure on that particular item alone. If we increased the rate to the extent that the county surveyor would require, it would be increased by 5/- Even then, he would not be satisfied that we could put the roads into proper condition.</P>
    <P>It may not be the best procedure to say: &ldquo;Allocate to the local bodies an amount equivalent to what is raised in taxation on the various forms of motor vehicles.&rdquo;  It does not matter what way it is obtained, the money is required.  The total amount involved would be about £7,000,000, if all the money derived in one way or another from motor traffic were applied to the roads.  If all that cannot be allocated, a very big proportion of it would be required for the next three years.</P>
    <P>We brought in this motion in order <Col N="712" /> to draw attention, in the first place, to the great necessity to do something. To do something small is not very much good: a large sum of money must be allocated if the roads are to be put into a reasonable condition.  I would appeal to the Minister to accept this motion in principle.  I am not asking him to accept the motion in its entirety, but I would ask him to accept it in principle.  I know he is not the final authority in this.  I know that the reduction of the road grant by £2,000,000 obviously is a Cabinet decision, that no Minister, not even the Minister for Finance, would attempt to make such a reduction, that he would have to get the sanction of his colleagues and if anything like this is to be put into operation it will have to get the sanction of the Cabinet.  However, it is the responsibility of the Minister to try to get proper roads in the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister, as Deputy MacEntee said, seemed to be rather complacent about the condition of the roads.  I can assure him it is not a matter for complacency.  It is a very serious matter.  In our particular case&mdash;and we are not paying anything for health services at the moment; later it will come to the time when we will have to pay&mdash;we have already a rate of 24/2 in the £.  No one used to a rate of 10/-, 12/-, or 14/- at the most, can look at the present position with any degree of satisfaction.  It is a very serious state of affairs.  While it is true that prices are pretty good for those who have land, this is becoming a very heavy burden.</P>
    <P>Let us bear in mind that many of the ratepayers are paying for these roads for the use of motorists, people who have not even a donkey and cart themselves. It is not fair that poor ratepayers should be paying for those who are using motor vehicles.  I understand that the number of heavy vehicles in recent years is about 100 per cent. more than it was formerly.  Much of the work that was formerly done by Córas Iompair Éireann or its predecessors, the railway companies&mdash;in fact; the great bulk of that work&mdash;is being done by lorries which are carrying heavy loads.  They do not go merely on the <Col N="713" /> main roads which may be calculated to carry them safely, they go also on county roads and by-roads and even into culs-de-sac.</P>
    <P>Here again we have a serious position with regard to these same culs-de-sac and I hope that in any extension of the grants to local bodies the Department of Local Government will consider some scheme by which they may be repaired and maintained.  We have applications again and again before the county councils, but owing to legal difficulties we cannot do anything. It is not fair that the people who live in these culs-de-sac, in many cases a large number of families, should be condemned to slavery like that, as they have not the financial means to repair the roads.</P>
    <P>I did not intend to speak at length, as I understand there is a question of trying to get Government business done and I do not want to impede it in any way.  However, I do ask that when a vote is taken on this&mdash;as I hope it will be&mdash;the Deputies of all Parties will consider their responsibility to their constituencies and to the country in general.  I do not think it is unreasonable to ask that substantial grants, such as we have asked for, should be made available for three years.  After all, grants are being made available for many purposes, but anyone must admit that the roads are absolutely necessary arteries in the life of the country and must be maintained. Everyone realises that the longer you leave these roads in a bad condition the more costly it will be to maintain them.  I travel over roads right beside me, up against my door; the paving stones were put there maybe 100 years ago.  They are exposed and the whole surface is worn off, perhaps by motor traffic.  I do not know how the vehicles travel on them at all.  Consider what it will cost in a few years' time, if nothing is done.</P>
    <P>I do not attribute any ill motives to the Minister or anyone connected with him, but I hope he will have something done in a big way to increase the grants.  I suppose there cannot be any change in the present Estimate, but I ask that the grant be increased when the time comes.  Deputy Corry mentioned <Col N="714" /> a fairly definite sum and I think nothing less would be of much use.  If we come back to normal in three years, we can consider the position that will then exist.</P>

      <P>It is satisfactory to see progress being made in housing. We have come to the time when it has been proved that the policy commenced so thoroughly by the late Minister, God rest his soul, is now bearing fruit.  We have the satisfaction of seeing housing going on on a very satisfactory basis.  I wish the present Minister luck in that and I hope that, through the co-operation of the various local authorities, housing progress, under the Minister responsible will, within a few years more, please God, ease the terrible burden and worry which is unfortunately the lot of many people.  I am glad that in South Cork &mdash;where Deputy Corry, although he represents East Cork, is chairman of the board of health&mdash;we have made arrangements whereby the people entitled to houses are getting them.  Even there&mdash;I do not say that Deputy Corry is in any way mixed up with this&mdash;we had outside influences and propaganda telling people they would not get the houses unless they joined certain political Parties.  To be fair and honest, I am not coupling Deputy Corry's name with that, but I am speaking from experience and from what I know. I am glad that that has been eliminated and that we are now in a position to say to those people: &ldquo;You are a worthy applicant for a house and the position is coming about whereby you will get it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see that, during the term of the present Minister and his predecessor, the road workers in the country as a whole have been made a little better off than they were.  I hope that they will be in somewhat better circumstances financially and that the co-operation which is expected from them under ordinary circumstances will be forthcoming, through fair <Col N="715" /> conditions being given.  As we have seen, the introduction of the &ldquo;Wet Time Act&rdquo; was helpful to those people.  I am not speaking in any sort of a biased way but we cannot forget, from our experiences in the past, that a change has come about in the conditions under which these road workers work down the country.  Things are a little different now from the anxiety displayed by the wee Deputy from the north, Deputy MacEntee, who was so generous to our people down south that it nearly broke his heart to give them 2d. a day.  I hope these times will never return and that whatever Government may be in power in this country and whatever Minister for Local Government may be responsible, and however, members of local authorities may differ politically, the workers will never be a pawn in the hands of either the Minister or the Government.</P>
    <P>I want to refer very briefly to Deputy Corry's motion.  It seems to be rather complicated and it is difficult to know the bounds within which we can discuss it.  Deputy Corry mentioned that roads are the property of the local authorities.  Let me say that I agree whole-heartedly with him there and that I have done so on many occasions in discussions in the Cork County Council.  However, after that we differ. Deputy Corry says that they are the property of the local authority but that the central authority must repair them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh no.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that they are the property of the local authority and that, while the local authority is entitled to assistance from the central authority, the local authority is bound to ensure that money will be secured locally as well as centrally for the upkeep and improvement of these roads. Public representatives, if they are honest and sincere enough to face their responsibilities, will realise that that is so.  It is possible that Deputy Corry's colleague, who more or less seconded the motion, was not aware of all the circumstances.  Will Deputy Corry deny that, when dealing recently with the roads estimates so ably covered by him by extracts from the Dáil <Col N="716" /> debates, our surveyors told us they wanted a certain amount of money sufficient to keep the roads in their present condition and that the majority of the Cork County Council voted for a reduction on the surveyors' figures? Does he deny that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  Will the Deputy allow me to explain?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that where roads deteriorate as a result of action by an outside body, even if it be the State, and where they draw an increased income out of the deterioration of these roads, the State should pay the piper and not the other man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that Deputy Corry said that, but he does not deny that the majority&mdash;it was not unanimous&mdash;of the Cork County Council decided, in respect of the figures submitted by their surveyors and engineers, that though these engineers were asking for a definite amount to keep the roads in their present condition that figure would have to be reduced by about 1/6 in the £. Considering that 1d. in the £ in Cork brings in £4,800, it is obvious that the majority of the members in the Cork County Council were so determined to see good roads in County Cork that they went so far as to reduce that figure by 1/6: that represents £4,800 multiplied by 18.  I must say that I cannot see the sense of a motion being brought before this House by any member of a county council who will have to admit that what happens locally does not always tally with what happens here.</P>
      <P>Has it not been made clear by Deputy O'Rourke that they do not care what happens in respect of a discussion here?  They do not care if they have no discussion so long as there is a vote.  Are we to forget that Deputy O'Rourke and Deputy Corry are preparing their guns for a local election and yet, despite all that political playacting, we have the sorry sight of a reduction of £4,800, multiplied by 18, in respect of the roads?</P>

      <P>Is it not fair to say that we should not act as hypocrites, saying here that we want more money while at our own county council meeting we say that we will not give up our share?  The Waterford County Council, in their wisdom, decided that they would spend the money on their roads and put them in good repair.  It is admitted that they have good decent roads now.  However, through sheer neglect and sheer fright at the thought of spending one penny, they have squandered pounds in Cork by not keeping the roads in good repair.  I put down a parliamentary question for answer yesterday and I would say, in connection with it, that at times in this House comparisons are made between the amounts given this year, last year, the year before that and the year before that again, and so on.</P>
      <P>If we are to be fair and honest and desire to make a true comparison on the figures, surely we must, as I have asked in that question, make a comparison between the period 1941 to 1945 and 1946?  Deputy Corry is as cute and as wise as any man in this House and I give him full credit for that.  He knows full well that, in respect of the amounts allocated for each county and for Cork, in which both he and I are interested, while there are certain increases throughout these years, there was a balance accruing from the amount which was not given out in these years.  In 1947&mdash;the time of the increased grant&mdash;even the increased grant itself did not make up for the amount not given out between 1941 and 1945-46.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am at all times anxious to see the central authority put every penny they can into the Road Fund and through that into the roads themselves. But we in Cork must not forget that if we are paying increased motor taxation because of a large increase in the number of vehicles taxed and increased petrol duty, we have the right to travel the roads of every one of the Twenty-Six Counties.  We are not paying that money simply for the right to travel the roads of Cork County alone.  If we can travel over the roads of every one of the Twenty-Six Counties, surely it is only fair to admit that there is a certain amount of wear and tear on the <Col N="718" /> roads of other counties caused by Cork men?  I suppose that even here in Dublin we are responsible for a certain amount of wear and tear and that, even here, we are probably responsible for much wear and tear on the patience of our opponents at times.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Corry is fully aware&mdash;but he escaped discussing it&mdash;the one line taken in the past was just the question of trying to get extra money some way or another&mdash;we had not the foggiest idea of what way we could get it.  I believe the only sensible approach&mdash; other than by the local authorities facing their responsibilities&mdash;the only genuine approach would be, instead of the Minister allocating a certain amount out of the Road Fund each year and each county putting up its own amount, accepting the recommendation made by some of us on the deputation that saw the Minister. Deputy Corry was present, but I do not think he agreed too wholeheartedly with it.  The recommendation was that, instead of raising a few hundred thousand each year, we should go somewhat further and raise up to £500,000 if necessary.  In the meantime, we would be assured of a continuation of our slice out of the Road Fund each year to make up for what we would be getting in the ordinary sense.</P>
    <P>I believe that is the only approach we can see&mdash;that we raise £500,000 and that we get a guarantee for a continuance of the money for Cork County out of the Road Fund.  I ask the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary to bear that solidly in mind.  Then if the local authorities do not face their responsibilities Deputy Corry will have full satisfaction in finding me voting against him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few suggestions to the Minister whose Department is now under review.  The suggestions I propose to make are not in the form of criticisms.  I think the time has come for us to reflect on what has been accomplished in the effort to bring about some system of relief for our people in the matter of housing. When we took over control of this country we inherited an amount of slumdom and, as time went on, under our own administration, there was created a situation in which we began to realise that not only should something be done rapidly, but that it should be done extensively.</P>
      <P>In the period of the Cumann na nGaedheal régime, when housing was started on a comparatively large scale, some of us thought that it might be questionable to go on with the schemes then envisaged because we might only create new slums in the elimination of the ones then existing.  In the City of Dublin, at any rate, where we had such a scarcity of accommodation and where we were forced over a number of years, particularly in the years prior to the outbreak of the war, to give priority to certain classes, the position became very acute.  We had to give priority to families living in basements, families living in single rooms, families consisting of parents and maybe seven or eight children.  We had to give preference to families where certificates of ill-health had been issued by the dispensary doctor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of families consisting of eight persons or over, we put them into ordinary small houses which were built <Col N="720" /> in accordance with the regulations as they then stood.  What was the result? Where we put a father and mother and, say, eight children into a small house, we found in the course of a few years that instead of there being a father and mother and eight children we had really ten adults in this small house.  As children, the boys and girls shared the same bedroom, but to-day we have grown-up people, mixed sexes, sharing the same rooms and accommodation.</P>
    <P>I suggest that in future schemes of housing on a large scale, consideration should be given to leaving some space to add on a room or two to houses which were built even in accordance with the present space standards.  I also suggest that there should be a grant made available for local authorities so as to enable them to provide that extra accommodation.  If officials of the Department will go round to Cabra or Crumlin or any other part of Dublin where these large housing schemes are in progress, and examine the houses and the occupants, I believe they will come back with the feeling that many of the houses are overpopulated. Some arrangement should be made whereby the tenants of local authority houses will derive some benefit in the shape of an additional room or two.  In the case of future housing schemes that aspect should be kept in mind.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to suggest that as time goes on and these young children grow up you can shift them from one place to another, but that cannot easily be done, because these houses are mainly built to the same standard. That applies to the types of houses made available to those who purchased under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  I would like the Minister to have this matter examined and he should endeavour to have consultations with local authorities, particularly in the City of Dublin, with a view to seeing how this position can be relieved. I have personal experience of this problem and I am aware that where we made available a good type of house, suitable for a young married couple with a certain number of children, in time the family increased, the children grew up and then you had in that type <Col N="721" /> of small house a degree of overcrowding which made the position almost as bad as when those people were first taken out of their hovels or tenements.</P>
    <P>There is another matter I would like the Minister to consider.  We are now applying what are called differential rents.  The idea behind that is that local authorities will be able to grade up or grade down the rents of their tenants in accordance with a tenant's income.  I understand that has been tried out to a certain extent in Cork.  It is being applied at present in Dublin.  What I suggest is, that there should be some formula or machinery whereby this up or down arrangement in rents could be carried out more rapidly than at present.  In answer to a question that was asked in this House recently we were given an astounding figure as to the number of applications made by the Dublin Corporation to secure possession of rented houses from tenants who had got into arrears in their rent payments.  In a great many cases, a man in constant employment finds he has no money left out of his weekly earnings when he has met his liabilities.  If he has the misfortune to lose.  This employment he gets into arrears with his rent.  The local authority can then start proceedings to secure possession of the house within a couple of weeks.  My suggestion is that, where people's earnings change rapidly through loss of employment or some other unforeseen cause, there should be some formula or machinery by means of which there could be a lowering in the amount of rent and the application of the differential rent principle without hardship to the occupying tenant and without imposing unpleasant duties on the local authority officials.  In these cases, too, the local authority representatives are often held responsible for what occurs. All that would be obviated if what I suggest were done.</P>
    <P>I do not know how this differential rent principle is going to be applied finally.  There seems to be, even in this House, a very great difference of opinion on the subject.  Recently in a discussion in this House the Minister for Finance was obviously referring to economic rents in the sense that they <Col N="722" /> must be economic to the local authority and to the State.  Another member of the House, dealing with the same subject in almost the same words as the Minister, referred to economic rents as they affect the tenants.  I am afraid that in the City of Dublin we are reaching the stage where we are being forced by circumstances to erect houses at rents which may ultimately prove to be too high for the tenants Therefore, I think we will have the same old problem all over again unless there is some formula or machinery whereby, on examination, rents can be fixed up and down in accordance with circumstances which arise suddenly in the case of the tenants.</P>
    <P>I should like to have a statement from the Minister to clarify something which is not quite clear to me.  The Minister for Local Government, and his predecessor in office, as well as the Taoiseach have, on a number of occasions, indicated that a shortage of money will not hamper the building of houses.  We in the Dublin Corporation are not quite clear as to how these statements affect us.  The City of Dublin raises its own loans for housing. Recently, there was a short hold up because of the difficulty of obtaining the full amount of money estimated to be required within a certain period by the corporation.  It is true that we got the money at a later period.  I should like, as I say, to have a statement from the Minister which would clarify the position where the Dublin Corporation or any other local authority finds it necessary to continue the building of houses on a large scale. I should like to have an indication from the Minister that, in these circumstances, there will be no hold up of schemes due to any shortage of money and that if the Dublin Corporation finds any difficulty in obtaining money from its bankers, the State will at any rate make it available to them.</P>
    <P>We have now had some 30 years' experience in the provision of houses to meet what we think are our own needs. We may have made some mistakes. At the same time, I feel that the Minister and his Department cannot help but have sympathy with a point of view that I have expressed before. Take the case of a family which is <Col N="723" /> taken out of a slum tenement and put into a new house.  In time, the new house does not provide adequate accommodation for that family.  In a case such as that, I think there should be not only permission to make an addition to the house to meet the needs of that family, but that there should be State assistance to enable it to be done.  I think that would be preferable to having to build a new and larger house for that family which would involve the payment of State and local authority grants, the acquiring of land as well as the cost of building the house.  I think that in the future where we are considering housing schemes on a large scale, that inherent in those schemes should be a provision for making additions to the houses at a future date when such additions became necessary.  I think it would be far better do that than spend additional capital at a later date to meet the need which would then have arisen.  I think that my suggestion, if adopted, would give real satisfaction to the people for whom we are providing houses at present.  Certainly, under it they would have better living conditions than they have had in the past.</P>
    <P>I do not know if what I am about to refer to will be ruled out by the Chair.  In the City of Dublin&mdash;I take it this right also applies in the case of local authorities all over the country &mdash;if an application say for the erection of a cinema in a certain district is turned down, the applicant has the right of appeal to the Minister.  The people of the district also have the right of appeal to the Minister.  I think that is admitted.  I wonder, in view of that, whether the Minister would listen to an appeal from a number of Dublin citizens and, possibly, from the corporation against the decision of another Department to take the Store Street premises for a purpose other than that for which that building was originally intended?</P>

      <P>We are not discussing the proposed new Housing Bill, but I would like to draw the Minister's attention to a particular matter in connection with housing.  Possibly, Deputy Captain Cowan will be angry with me for raising this.  Where a person applies for a loan from a local authority, whether it is to buy a house built by a local authority or by private enterprise, under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act some limit should be fixed by the Department to the legal charges the proposed purchaser is asked to shoulder.  On one occasion I pointed out that where the corporation bought a property and built identical houses on it, selling a number of them subsequently under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, the prospective purchaser was asked to pay legal charges almost equivalent to his buying the whole site, although it was a case of repetition as far as each house was concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not offer any criticism of the Estimate.  I merely make certain suggestions.  I think those in charge of our housing schemes should now pause and reflect on what has been accomplished.  They should consider in how far it has benefited the recipients of new houses.  They should ask themselves whether the houses provided are now adequate for a completely adult family or whether it is desirable that some additions should be made to them.  In particular, they should consider the possibility in the future of designing houses to which it will be possible to add one or two rooms should it be found necessary to make such additions in order to accommodate a completely adult family.  I think we should now have some better idea of housing in general and perhaps the Minister can improve on the suggestions I have made to improve a situation which is gradually. becoming objectionable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe has made some interesting observations in regard to this family moved from an overcrowded slum area into a corporation house; after a number of years he says that the family becomes just as overcrowded in their new circumstances. I do not think that is so.  If it does happen, it can last for only a very limited period because, as a general rule, the boys marry after a few years and leave the house; likewise, the girls marry and leave the house.  In the end, we have the father and the mother left alone.  We have just got to face realities in regard to this and the suggestion of making provision for the building of an extra room is not practical or practicable at all</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Very often you get the youngest son or the youngest daughter living at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of them may. It is the experience of all of us that for <Col N="728" /> a particular period all the family are at home.  Then they start to drift away and the family gradually gets smaller. I would not think that there is any point really in this idea of building extra rooms.  Anyway, there would be a tremendous lot of trouble in regard to it in the city.  I think the Minister should be congratulated on the work done during the past 12 months.  The very fact that he has introduced this new Housing Bill which meets points of view that were expressed by a number of us over the past two years is an indication that the Minister has listened to reasonable proposals put up to him in this House.  I felt very happy when I saw the provisions of this new Housing Bill, which will be before the House probably to-morrow and which, I hope, the House will pass with very little discussion, because it is such an important measure that it is vital it should be on the Statute Book before the Dáil goes on holiday, whenever that will be.  The Minister has also introduced the County Management Bill, which gives the House an opportunity of discussing that very difficult and intricate problem.  Not only does it give us an opportunity of discussing the position of county managers but it opens the way to a consideration of the problem of city managers and that is a problem with which Dublin Deputies are particularly concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>These two measures which have been introduced by the Minister for Local Government show the progress that has been made by the Department during the past 12 months. If I keep to the administration of the past 12 months, I shall be perfectly in order.  It is, I think, one of the very good signs that democracy is really in operation in this country, that the desires of Deputies should be translated into Bills which are brought within a reasonable period before the Dáil for consideration.  The main item on which I want to address my few remarks to the House is building, particularly in the City of Dublin.  No doubt there has been substantial progress over the past couple of years.  The pace is being accelerated, not to the extent that one would like to have it accelerated, but nevertheless there has been an increasing tempo in the production of houses. Deputies who have to meet night after night their constituents who are anxious to get houses can now see day after day particular individuals who are bad cases being housed by the Dublin Corporation.  I think that is something that every Dublin Deputy particularly is glad to see.  There is nothing so welcome in the morning as a letter from the Dublin Corporation to say that Mr. So-and-So is about to be provided with a house in one of the new building schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Who are the Deputies who get these letters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>All the Dublin Deputies do and I can assure the House that they are very welcome letters indeed.  I should like to see more of them.  I should like to see the tempo increased.  I was disturbed recently by a report in the <i>Irish Press</i> that there had been some reduction in the number of persons employed in the building of houses by the Dublin Corporation. <Col N="730" /> I hope that the Minister will deal with that matter when concluding. It is clear, it appeared to me at any rate, that that is just a temporary phase while work is about to be commenced on another scheme.  During the debates last year and the year before on this Estimate and in questions I addressed to the Minister and his predecessor, I asked the Minister to ensure that adequate lands and building sites would be available so that as high a production of houses as was humanly possible would be achieved.  I should like to see on hands sites that are being built on, sites that are being developed, sites being prepared for development and sites in course of acquisition.  That will be necessary if the full scale housing programme is to be carried out.</P>
      <P>In that connection I mentioned last year and the year before the position in regard to the St. Anne's estate where sites are available for thousands of houses, but those sites cannot be built on because there is no sewerage scheme.  I recommended to the Minister and to his predecessor that that sewerage scheme should have been tackled as a matter of grave emergency and that, if necessary, men should be employed on that scheme for 24 hours a day working in three eight-hour shifts with electric light at night in the way the Shannon scheme was developed.  If we are to make substantial progress with housing in Dublin, it is essential that the facilities available on the St. Anne's estate should be utilised and they can only be utilised if the sewerage work is completed and that should be done as soon as possible.  I repeat my request to the Minister that he should discuss with the Dublin Corporation the undertaking and the completion of that sewerage scheme by the employment of all the unemployed people in the City of Dublin working on shifts of eight hours per day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the City of Dublin we have quite a number of suitable sites for the building of flats.  Those sites are derelict all over this city.  You find them in my constituency and in other constituencies.  There is a general desire on the part of a number of people in Dublin who need houses that they should be housed in flats convenient <Col N="731" /> to the locality in which they reside, in which they were born and reared and in which their fathers and mothers before them were born and reared.  That is a reasonable desire on the part of those persons and I think the Minister should discuss with the housing director and with the Dublin Corporation the development of all these available sites so that flats would be built upon them as soon as possible. On the North Strand, where houses were blown down by a bomb or a land mine which was dropped there during the war, there are sites for quite a number of flats which would house a very large number of families in the vicinity who are living in overcrowded and insanitary tenements at present.  The building of those flats could go on hand in hand with the building of houses in the outlying area.</P>
    <P>In that regard, I have felt that there should be some improvement in the machinery dealing with the allocation of houses.  The people are anxious to be housed as far as possible in their own areas.  Under the system of priorities that exists people living and working on the North side find themselves housed on the South side and people who are living on the South side find themselves housed on the North side a considerable distance away from their places of employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a system of transfers to meet that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that. There are difficulties, however, in connection with the matter because the priorities have to be followed.  There are difficulties also in the matter of the transfer, because very frequently one recommends two families for transfer and it is not always possible to obtain sanction to the transfer however strong the ground for the recommendation may be.  However, that is only a detail in comparison with the more important matter of providing houses for the people who need them and probably by a system of transfer, which may be made more easy after the City Management Act is amended, all those difficulties can be ironed out.</P>

      <P>The vanguard.  Recommendations have been made in previous years to the Minister to ensure that local halls, recreation grounds, gymnasiums and public parks are developed and constructed in connection with all the new housing schemes.  While that is primarily a matter for the Dublin Corporation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>And yet you want the rates reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I think it is something on which the Minister should take a pretty firm stand with the Dublin Corporation and all local authorities.  If new housing schemes are developed, if thousands of houses are being built in a particular area which has been open country, those citizens who are being brought out there should be provided with all those facilities and amenities and, side by side with the building of houses, quite a good lot of work can be done with regard to the provision of recreation grounds and the building of halls and gymnasiums.  The citizens of Dublin and the citizens of any other city or town are entitled in this century to have those amenities.  I do not think that the provision of those amenities is going to affect the rates very seriously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>If those amenities and facilities are necessary&mdash;and I think everybody agrees that they are necessary&mdash;then we should not be stopped simply by the possibility that the provision of those things will lead to some slight increase in the rates.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister for Justice is here because there is one aspect of this matter that touches to some extent on his responsibilities although strictly it is a matter for the Minister for Local Government.  Deputy Briscoe has mentioned the point about evictions, notices to quit and proceedings to eject corporation tenants.  It is quite a common thing every week in the City of Dublin to see hundreds of persons, occupants of corporation houses, summoned to attend before the <Col N="734" /> District Court in proceedings for ejectment. The strange thing about it is that Dublin Corporation as a corporation have no responsibility whatever with regard to that nor are they consulted. The notice to quit is issued allegedly on the authority of the city manager; it is signed by an official of the corporation and served on the particular individual who is brought to court.  The citizen, the tenant of the corporation house, has no defence whatsoever to the proceedings which are brought by the corporation as the district justice, however sympathetic he may be&mdash;the very same thing applies to county council houses and houses owned by local authorities all over the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a certain amount about the development of roads.  Since we have had this very large cut in road grants in the periods 1948-49 and 1949-50, it has obviously become essential to reconsider the whole question of road improvement and road maintenance in the light of modern conditions.  The roads of this country have the same importance, from the point of view of the national economy, as Córas Iompair Éireann, the housing of the people or the provision of electric power.  They should be considered as a whole and as part of a long-term plan.  Quite evidently, there must be some priorities, and it is not for me to say that a mile of road should be built at the expense of one house or group of houses for the people, but, nevertheless, as I have said, the maintenance and improvement of roads. is a question of vital national importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="738" /> Any neglect on the part of the State to preserve existing road surfaces simply has the effect of doubling the burden of expenditure upon ratepayers and taxpayers in the next ten years, and every year that passes in which insufficient money is spent simply adds, by geometrical progression, to the amount of money which has to be spent by the Government that will succeed the present Government, whatever its complexion or political view.  I think that we consider far too many problems in the light of an immediate political situation and the Government, having already decided to impose on the next generation a very considerable burden of expenditure through the repayment of debt, might at least consider the opposite and see how far they can save the next generation money by the proper planning of the roads.</P>
    <P>The fundamental facts of the situation are well known to those in this House who have studied roads as a problem by themselves.  There are 50,000 miles of public roads, of which some 40,000 miles are county roads and 10,000 miles main roads.  Nearly all the main roads are surface dressed, with a few exceptions, and some of the county roads are also surface dressed, but very small in proportion.  There are also some 20,000 miles of non-public roads.  That figure I have always regarded as very large.  It was an estimate by an officer of the Minister's Department, and, whether it is 12,000, 15,000 or 20,000, it is a very large mileage of roads which are not administered or repaired by any one public authority.  In 1938-39, there were some 73,000 vehicles.  In 1949, that number had increased to 122,000, and, of these, 32,000 were public service and commercial vehicles&mdash;an increase of 66 per cent. in the total number of vehicles and of 100 per cent. in the number of goods vehicles, which do most of the damage.</P>
    <P>We made a calculation at one time that, by the middle of the war, the capital investment in the roads of the country had already reached the huge figure of some £25,000,000 and, allowing for costs of maintenance and improvement, that figure has increased many times since then.  Most of the 20,000 <Col N="739" /> miles of non-public roads are in a deplorable condition, arising from heavy turf transport and from the fact that, in the course of the past 16 years, it was not possible to carry out improvements in every direction at the same speed.  My own belief is that one of the most prominent causes of emigration is the fact that the young people will no longer tolerate conditions under which they have to go to Mass, to school, to amusements of any kind or to work, along roads which are utterly out-of-date and which would have been continuously improved but for the advent of the world war, for which no one in this House was responsible.</P>
    <P>My views about road improvement are partly based on the idea that, if we want to keep the young people here, we must make communications far more satisfactory.  We also have to face the fact that, no matter what the Government of the day does in regard to Córas Iompair Éireann, no Government in this country is likely to take any action which will prevent people owning their own vehicles and transporting their goods from one destination to another.  As the Minister knows, the whole problem of Córas Iompair Éireann eventually boils down to the fact that the overhead charges involved in handling goods at either end of the journey, when leaving and when arriving, and in using frequently two and three kinds of transport to carry these goods are so high that no public transport system, however perfectly run, is going to be able to compete completely and adequately with those who wish to bring their goods in their own vehicles.</P>
    <P>The position is that Córas Iompair Éireann is likely in future to close down a number of branch lines&mdash;it is almost inevitable under existing circumstances&mdash;and the more branch lines that are closed down, the greater will be the burden upon the roads.  At the same time, as the Minister knows, the number of cars is going to increase continually year by year, until the time is reached when any person above the level of the most modest wage will have some sort of motor vehicle.  It is becoming a universal thing in this <Col N="740" /> life from which we cannot possibly escape.  Along with all this, the cost of road repair and improvement has increased, on the Minister's own admission, by 125 per cent.  My own belief is that that is a minimum figure.</P>
    <P>I would say that by the time wages have increased again this year, the increase in cost might possibly be 135 per cent.  The principal cause has been the increase in wages so desperately needed by road workers and which has taken place under successive Ministers for many, many years.  I should like to add at this point that the attempts made by certain Deputies to give the impression that the present Government alone has raised the wages of the workers is, in the circumstances, ridiculous, since, if I remember rightly, road workers' wages were something in the neighbourhood of 25/- to 35/- before the world war and have been rising continually ever since then.  They rose, I think, in every year of the last five years of the office of the previous Government.  I may add, of course, that a great many other social services were conferred upon road workers at the same time by the last Government, still further improving their position.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see, in that connection, while I am speaking on the matter, that the Minister has continued the encouragement of the provision of protective clothing by county councils.  We, I remember, issued various notices about that asking county councils to improve their standards in regard to the protective clothing being given to workers and, from an answer to a parliamentary question I got the other day, I can see that very considerable progress is being made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>You did not sanction that, though, years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position. I think it is Just as well to give the figures to the House in regard to where we stand in regard to the amount of money available.  In 1938-39, we had for road expenditure from all sources a total of £2,025,000, of which the rates paid about two-thirds.  In 1949-50, that amount had gone to £4,640,000, of which the rates provided about half. The Road Fund grants were £700,000. <Col N="741" /> in 1938-39 and £2,346,000 in 1949-50. That sum looks very substantial.  It looks, at first sight, as though we ought to be able to do very good work on the roads but, according to the Minister's own admission, £225 in this year will be required to do the work that £100 did in 1938-39.  He cannot escape from that one hard fact.</P>
      <P>If you apply that simple mathematical sum to the amount of money made available in 1949-50, you find that the real increase on road expenditure, having regard to its value, is only 10 per cent, since 1938-39.  You simply take the total of £4,640,000 and say that every £225 of that will only do the work of £100.</P>
      <P>There is no cooking of these statistics.  It is a simple problem for the Minister to face, which the Minister of State for every other Department has had to face in connection with the task of providing money for services, perhaps not in the same degree but nearly in the same degree. If you apply that principle, you find that the real increase in the amount of money made available for the roads is only 10 per cent. above 1938-39.  The traffic density has increased by 66 per cent. and goods vehicle density has increased by 100 per cent.  It is quite obvious that the Minister will have to reconsider the whole problem.</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting that the Minister could necessarily have done that in his first year of office.  I would like to be as generous as I can but one cannot escape from these figures. There is no reinterpretation of them. They are there for everyone to see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you apply that same principle to main road grants&mdash;again from figures which I secured by answer to a parliamentary question, you find that even the very large grants made available by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1948-49 were not entirely sufficient to account for the increase in the cost of road improvement, although they went a good way towards it&mdash;you find that, in relation to 1949-50, there is an actual decrease in the amount available for main roads of 31 per cent.  Again applying the same principle of what value can be effected in road improvement or restoration by the money, in comparison with 1938-39, there is a reduction <Col N="742" /> of 31 per cent.&mdash;an increase in terms of money but a reduction in terms of value effected.  It is quite obvious that the main roads can never stand up to the burden of traffic, can never be made suitable for this country, can never be made to compare with roads in other countries with the same standard of living as we have unless that situation is changed.</P>
    <P>I next come to county roads.  Here there has been relatively more improvement in the amount of money made available than in the case of the main roads.  The total amount made available for county roads in 1938-39 from rates alone was £853,000.  In 1948-49, the total amount available from rates and the new Road Fund grants was £2,601,000 and the amount available in 1949-50, was £2,696,000.</P>
    <P>I should mention, in passing, that the suggestion that the present Government have given a great deal more money for county roads is not true in the sense of the total amount of money made available as compared with what Fianna Fáil made available in 1948-49.  It is true that the total amount of money made available from all sources is greater than it was in our last year of office but the actual sum is very nearly the same, according to the figures given to me in answer to a parliamentary question.  The increase there is very considerable but, if you apply the same rule of relating the figure to value performed, you will find that the increase from the point of view of value is only really about 50 per cent. for county roads as compared with 1948-49, and even that increase does not relate to the numerical increase in the actual density of traffic on the roads and, therefore, the amount of damage which will be done.  Traffic, as I have already said, has increased by 66 per cent. for all cars and 100 per cent. for public service and goods vehicles.  There is the problem that has to be faced.</P>
    <P>I next should advert to the fact that the Road Fund Grant, as the Minister knows, was allocated in reference to the local contribution in the three years before he took office and was also related to the number of cars registered in a particular area, the <Col N="743" /> population of the area and the road mileage in the area.  These were the factors, when we were in office, and we considered at that time adding a further factor in calculating the Central Fund contribution.  We decided that we should have a special factor for tourist roads, where they were of vital interest to the tourist industry, that if there was a road such as the road that takes people around the Ring of Kerry, there should be some special allowance for a road of that description, irrespective of what the unemployment was in the area.</P>
    <P>We also decided that we should give special grants to counties where main roads pass through a county which have very little local interest.  A good example would be the main road from Dublin to Cork when passing through Tipperary.  So far as I know, from talking to people in that area, the road from Cashel North to the Tipperary boundary has very little local interest to people living in the county, whereas the portion of the road from Dublin to Cork going South from Cashel to Cahir and Mitchelstown would have much more local significance.  We decided that there should be another factor used mathematically by the Minister's Department when calculating Central Road Fund grants allowing for that question of the local interest attached to a main arterial road going from Dublin to some place in the West or South or going between two towns.</P>
    <P>One could give as a further example the Cork-Mallow road.  Although it is an arterial road that goes on to Limerick, it will obviously have very considerable local interest to the people of both Cork and Mallow.  There are many other examples of the same kind that will occur to Deputies.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that £300,000 of the Road Fund is now taken for ordinary revenue purposes.  That was done by the former Government.  If the Minister were to calculate the figure&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;he would find that, before the world war, when conditions for improving roads were fairly normal, the amount of money spent out of road rural grants from the Special Employment Schemes Office was greater <Col N="744" /> than the total raid on the Road Fund over a period.  I am fairly certain it was greater; I am certain it was as large.  There was no great raid on the total moneys available for improving roads.</P>
    <P>The Minister has to face the fact that upon the present horse power basis of taxation the increase in taxation that comes from the number of cars on the road has no relation to the increase in the cost of road expenditure.  He gets more money because there are more cars on the road; the cars do more damage, so there is no absolute increase in the amount available for repairing and improving roads.  The increase in taxation for small vehicles which was imposed in October, 1947, according to a reply to a parliamentary question, I think it was in the year 1948-49, only provided £300,000 out of a total of £2,400,000.  In other words, there is a deficiency of money available for road repair and improvement, because motor taxation has remained stable.  That is the fact, even although the number of vehicles on the road has trebled since 1938-39.  Even though they have trebled, there is still a deficiency of money.  The road contribution has not increased in the same proportion and the rates cannot bear any more expenditure on roads, or very little, and as a result there is this very considerable deficiency.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows, the petrol tax yielded a sum of £3,200,000 in 1949-50. One, of course, can argue until the cows come home whether some of that should be made available for roads or not. Once it goes into the general revenue, it is simply a matter of saying that you have an excuse for providing a sum of money from general revenue for roads, as in that huge sum of money there is some which comes from petrol tax.  If we estimate that that £3,000,000 is actually revenue from petrol used on the roads, it would amount to about £24 tax per vehicle in the country&mdash; which is a considerable amount.  I know that that is a very specious argument, as the money is intended for general revenue purposes; and I merely use it as an illustration of the way by which the Minister might secure more money for roads from the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="745" /> What all this really means is that the Minister must have more money, and a very good illustration of his need for more money is a statement that was made by one county engineer to a county councillor in a certain county, who was asked to state what he considered to be the amount required to keep his roads in their present condition without further deterioration.  He said he required, for that particular county, £112,000 for main roads and £116,000 for county roads, just to keep them in their present condition.  The amount he got was £47,000 for main roads and £53,000 for county roads.</P>
    <P>Now, even allowing for the fact that any county engineer might be inclined to exaggerate somewhat enthusiastically the money that he could spend on maintenance or improvement, it is quite obvious that there is a deficiency. County engineers have presented county councils with estimates of that kind all over the country and even if you were to make a large allowance for exaggeration or for their putting up far more than they could possibly get, this is the clearest proof, clearer than all the statistics I have given, that the Minister should do his best to find more money for the roads.</P>
    <P>There is another question, the question of Offaly.  I do not know whether Deputy Davin is in the House, he would know about this.  In some counties turf production continued in great volume to the very end.  The Road Fund grants under present circumstances depend upon the county expenditure in the three years preceding the Minister's entry into office.  In Offaly, as in other counties, they could not take full advantage of the big grants given by Fianna Fáil.  They spent less, as they were still doing turf, and they could not find the workers to do the large amount of work in the summer. Unless the Minister has changed his method of allocation, these counties still continue to suffer relatively to others.  The counties best off were those able to take the fullest advantage of the grants made available by the former Government and there were certain counties where the position is worse than in others.  If one were to apply in this case the rule as to what money will do in relation to value, I <Col N="746" /> think the Minister will find that in the present year County Offaly is getting less money than it got in 1938-39 actually, because of the two factors&mdash; £225 doing the work of £100 and the fact that Offaly went on with its turf work and could not get workers for roads during the period which the Minister uses as his datum period.  If the Minister has changed his method of allocating grants, I would be very glad to hear it, but I think that the method is a little unfair in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>When I speak of this deficiency of road expenditure, there are a number of other factors to be taken into account.  There has been an increasing use of machinery on roads, which should increase output.  There is certainly far better work than ever before being done by county engineers in all counties.  There is a better class of stone being used in many counties, as a result of the previous Government's work and the policy advocated by the Minister, of preparing central quarries where stone of approved quality, that could be analysed in advance, could be crushed and prepared as chips for the road.  Another factor to be taken into account is that modern lorries are much better sprung than the older ones were and do much less damage to the roads than in 1938-39.  That does not apply to some of the war surplus lorries running still, which do more damage in five minutes than six others of the more modern type.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, against all that, we have not one-tenth enough modern machinery for use on the roads and there is not half enough competition between contractors and direct labour work to keep up the output.  Also, the huge programme of post-war dressing of the roads was never intended to be permanent in many cases.  In many cases, the heavy traffic is already beginning to destroy the surface.  One only has to travel, as I do on occasion, throughout the country to see some of the very well-made roads that have had to experience extremely heavy traffic, beginning to deteriorate.  The waterproof surface is slowly beginning to disintegrate; it has not gone very far, but is absolutely bound to continue unless some of these roads are improved <Col N="747" /> in a permanent way, with solid stone foundations and all the other appurtenances of a modern road.</P>
    <P>I next come to the non-public roads, the cul-de-sac roads in the country, of which I have said there are 20,000 miles.  As the Minister knows, it is not possible under present conditions for local authorities to repair those roads except when, as in many counties, they administer grants made available by the Special Employment Schemes Office, if the unemployment is sufficient.</P>
    <P>The position is, from the point of view of the Minister, that those non-public roads are repaved by three different agencies at the moment&mdash;by the Land Commission, by the local authority working on behalf of the Special Employment Schemes Office and by the Special Employment Schemes Office direct.  Grants are given for those roads not on the basis of functional need, density of traffic or any other technical factor but (a) because of the number of registered unemployed in the electoral division concerned, (b) because they carry a certain amount of turf, (c) as a result of the local contributors having agreed to put up what used to be 25 per cent. and what in future, I understand, will be a percentage varying according to the valuations of the persons concerned, or (d) by the Land Commission for the improvement of newly divided estates. I would point out that the actual value of farm residences in some cases decreases by as much as 50 per cent., if they are situated at the end of a long boreen on which there may be as many as 15 or 16 other residences.  The amount of money made available from the Special Employment Schemes Office, based on all types of schemes was £225,000 in 1938-39 while in 1949-50 it was £152,000.  There is a real reduction there of some 70 per cent. if you apply the rule that roughly £225 will do the work of £100 pre-war.</P>
    <P>That is a very serious matter and it is going to alter not only the whole question of the valuation of farms in the future but the more people become modern-minded in this country the more intolerable they will consider these boreens to be.  I suggest to the <Col N="748" /> Minister that he should consider a long-term policy designed to provide some means of repairing those boreens and improving them by reference to the functional need, the density of traffic and their condition.  I suggest that he can still go on employing people where they have to be employed; that he can ask the users to make the same contribution if he thinks it necessary but that they should be considered as part of the road system in this country.  If the Minister reads my own observations on that matter when I was Parliamentary Secretary in connection with a debate that took place on a private Members' Motion, he will find that I said that the only excuse we had then for not considering that matter was the vast amount of restoration which required to be done after the war and the need to overcome deficiencies created through war conditions.  I clearly indicated that I knew the problem would have to be tackled; that you could not go on leaving 20,000 miles of non-public roads as compared with 50,000 miles of public roads subject to the improvement by any kind of method except functional need and density of traffic.  He will realise that I am not, therefore, speaking inconsistently or trying to place suddenly on his shoulders a burden which I did not even consider at that time.</P>
    <P>So far as the main roads are concerned, they are out of date for huge stretches in respect of their width, their vertical elevation and their foundations. They are particularly out of date over bogs and they constitute a danger to life in many places.  They have, in particular, the effect of causing extreme physical fatigue to drivers. Everybody knows that accidents do not necessarily take place at corners. The cumulative effect of physical fatigue on a driver on a bad road or a road that curves the whole time is to increase the possibility of accidents. Wherever main roads are too narrow in a dense traffic area they are an absolute menace to life.  The Minister will be aware that it is in the narrow stretches of the Bray road that most of the accidents occur, according to a report prepared by the Garda Síochána.  The county roads are far <Col N="749" /> below adequate standards and only the outbreak of the world war prevented far more being done to them before. I asked the Minister a question in regard to the cost of improving county roads per mile.  In his reply on Tuesday, 14th March, 1950, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The figure of £1,850 per mile may be taken as reasonable for the improvement (including widening) and surface dressing of a typical mile of county road but it would not be possible to give an average figure because condition as to width and other factors vary considerably. £2,850 may be taken as the corresponding figure for such work including strengthening of foundations in a bog area.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If he takes these two figures and applies them to the present county road grants, both from the rates and the Central Fund, the Minister will find that it will take a great many scores of years to bring the county roads up to the kind of condition which the younger generation of this country would desire.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the Minister should reconsider the whole question of road planning in this country.  No one could consider carrying out arterial drainage by widening a river one foot one year and one foot the next year. No one would consider deepening it by several feet in one year and several feet the next year.  No one would consider it was adequate to provide electricity supply pylons throughout the country which are so light that in four or five years they would have to be entirely renewed because they would not bear the number of cables to be added.  No one would consider that he was right to purchase land for housing purposes by buying half an acre at a time until enough had been acquired for one housing scheme of 60 houses.  No one would be prepared to sanction tenders for housing where the specification of the materials to be used in the housing was not of standard quality and up to date.  It would seem to me that we must get out of the habit of thinking that road planning cannot be done in the same way as planning for arterial drainage, electricity supply power or housing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="750" /> The Minister should now reconsider the whole question of roads in the light of the fact that the more you plan for the future the more you provide for the future; that the less continuous alterations you make in the structure of the road the cheaper it will be in the long run and the less it will cost to maintain; that the more work you can do the more money will be left available for improving all the various classes of roads in the country.  In other words, if a plan is made for the road from Dublin to Cork, based on what the Minister considers is likely to be the traffic density in the next six years, and if the Minister wants to build only a narrow road to Cork, a road that is not much wider than what it is at present, in which the curves are not much less pronounced than they are at present, we can argue about that later, but there is no question about it but that we should reserve whatever space is required for the Cork road in the future to a reasonable degree.  To plan steadily for its improvement over a period of years is going to result in the total cost being very much less, in its being possible to employ far more modern machinery which contractors or county councils could not otherwise afford either to buy or to hire and to do the work over a long period at less cost.  At the same time, when the road is being finally improved it will be far less costly to maintain.  The result will be that more money should be left available for the improvement of the county roads.  One of the worst features in debates in this House on roads is the idea that county roads should be competitors to main roads in regard to the money available.  If main roads are not repaired economically there will not be money for county roads and <i>vice versa.</i>  Each one bears a relation to the other.  To cut money off main roads, to delay their improvement, to allow deterioration to take place is only going to get the Minister into much more trouble, or a Minister who may come after the present Minister, when it comes to trying to effect any kind of reasonable programme of county road improvement so urgently needed.  As I have said, to give insufficient money to main roads merely piles up the proportion of money spent on maintenance over 25 years on the <Col N="751" /> main roads and draws away from funds required to improve county roads.</P>
    <P>We had a plan of that kind, and that plan was in operation when the Minister's predecessor came into office. That plan was criticised by Deputies who had not bothered to listen to the speech made by the Minister for Local Government of the day on the ground that we were trying to construct vast autobahns all over the country. Nothing was further from the truth. The object of the plan was not that you ought to construct vast autobahns, but that you might build a road from Dublin to Cork of whatever type you might think would be required ten or 15 years from now, and that you would do it scientifically and methodically.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wishes to have a different type of road to that planned by the previous Government there is nothing to prevent him.  The whole idea is to save the State money by doing it in a planned way.  We left the Minister that plan.  As he knows, it was based on the idea that traffic density would increase at the same rate, from 1945 or 1946, since traffic became normal after the war, for the next 20 years, as it increased from 1928 to 1939.  It was a very reasonable gamble.  The Minister, I think, will find that the increase has already considerably surpassed that rate.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind that general increase, we planned to improve the roads on a basis that was scientific. We arranged surveys and we asked local authorities to consider taking enough land to enable the roads to be widened progressively and scientifically over a period.  We also planned to have standard specifications or road widths, road curvature, road elevation and so forth.  The effect of doing that would be just as great as planning properly for, say, rural electrification, telephone extensions or arterial drainage.</P>
    <P>Getting back to the question of the Bray road, because there is no general plan in operation for main roads around Dublin, you get the kind of parish pump talk that took place over the Bray road.  There is not an engineer in the whole of Europe who <Col N="752" /> would not tell the people of Bray that that road will have to be doubled within the next ten years and the sooner it is doubled, progressively and as inexpensively as possible, the better.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave me the average density of traffic on that road.  Taking into consideration the increase in the number of vehicles on the road, it reached 300 vehicles per hour at a point south of Donnybrook and 260 vehicles per hour at a point north of Donnybrook.  That was the result of taking the figure of the number of vehicles circulating in 1928 and adding a percentage representing the increase in the number of vehicles circulating in the Dublin area, since 1928.  The peak densities in the morning, in the middle of the day and in the evening would be greater.  There is no modern road authority that would not prescribe a double track road where the density of vehicles exceeds 400 per hour.  There is nothing immodest or extravagant in that proposal.  The difficulty is that there is no general plan.</P>
    <P>People may say that an improved road to Bray is going to cost too much in comparison with other roads around Dublin and they ask why should it cost so much.  There is no plan by which the proposal can be given the same amount of attention as that devoted to other roads around Dublin that will also have to be doubled within the next ten years. There are 12½ miles of roads requiring doubling in the Dublin area, planning in respect of which should begin now. That is absolutely inevitable, judging by ordinary modern traffic conditions.</P>
    <P>There will never be extensive double carriage way required in this country, because the population is not large enough.  The main consideration from the Minister's point of view is to carry out improvements on 1,000 miles of the 10,000 miles of main roads through the country where improvement is very drastically required.  He can make whatever provision he likes with regard to the standard width.  We decided that the road from Dublin to Cork, the road from Dublin to Galway and the road from Dublin to Limerick should be 24 feet wide with single <Col N="753" /> carriageways.  It is not an excessive width and there is no autobahn about that.  When you consider that these roads will have to carry increasing traffic for the next 20 years, nobody could say that it is an extravagant proposal.  There was a suggestion that the main road from Dublin to Cork should be doubled as far as Naas and then made 24 feet wide the remainder of the distance to Cork.</P>
    <P>If county councils knew that that would be the general standard it would be far easier for them to plan and far better work would be done on the roads.  It would be far easier to find contractors, to arrange for the use of the largest type of machinery and to increase output.  Gradually, if it becomes the general practice, the cost of road improvement will go down.  At the moment the cost of main roads, using modern machinery, is enormous. The machinery has to be specially hired and nobody is accustomed to the standards adopted.  The road near Monasterevan is more like a scientific experiment than an illustration of the general practice of what could be done in the making of a main road.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the main difficulty the finding of the money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I say&mdash; they cannot find the money.  Another method of improving road construction is the concreting of main roads over bogs&mdash;not minor but main roads over bogs.  The Minister, if he desired, could save the next generation a great deal of money and would enable the remainder of the county road improvement work to be carried out more quickly.  He can be told by his officers that, in the case of a concrete road, when it is considered over a 25-year period, the cost of maintenance is less. You have to wait 16 years before you begin to get back your money but, after 16 years, you recover more than your money from the point of view of lower maintenance cost, particularly over a bog area and in connection with double carriage-ways and all roads bearing heavy traffic.  It takes a long time, no doubt, but, if the Minister wishes to have regard for the people 16 years from now, I suggest it is a principle <Col N="754" /> worth applying to the greatest extent that money will allow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>The money is the difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is the difficulty. Again, it is good up to a reasonable degree for contractors to compete with county councils in regard to certain types of road work.  Contractors should be given their chance to work on the roads and at the same time the county councils could do a substantial amount of direct labour work.  I can see nothing wrong in the application of the dual principle.  The amount to be done should be a matter of general ministerial policy.  I am not suggesting that all the work should be done by contract, nor am I suggesting that all the work should be done by direct labour.  A good blend of both would be excellent from the point of view of increasing output and encouraging the carrying out of good, skilled work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have dealt sufficiently with the public roads and I have mentioned also the question of dealing more successfully with county road improvement so as to carry out work on the main roads more cheaply.  In regard to employment, there is no need for the Minister to worry about employment on the roads.  Taken as a whole, he knows that he can have the very largest machines available in this world for improving the main arterial roads of this country.  The result will be that, in the long run, he will need more money to employ exactly the same number of men, or more men, on the improvement of boreens and county roads.  Because sometimes people suggest that any interference with the general principle by means of which roads are made now may cause unemployment, I would remind the Minister that, in the course of the last ten years, as many as 35,000 people and as few as 7,000 people have been employed all over the country on minor relief schemes of every kind, and that as many as 4,600 and as few as 710 have been employed on Land Commission improvement work.  In connection with rural improvement schemes, at one time there have been 591 <Col N="755" /> schemes under consideration by the Government which resulted in a certain amount of employment.</P>
    <P>In other words, it is possible for the Minister to devise a modern system of road improvement in which the following would be the results, so far as human beings are concerned.  The results are very important and are of paramount interest to the whole community. The more the Minister uses machinery on main roads, a higher proportion of men will be paid fitters' and drivers' wages, and the more scope there will be for promotions so that a man can go gradually up the scale when he joins a county council staff. When he joins a contractor's group, there will be varying wages and varying types of work.  The more machinery is used, the more machinery there will be that will require repair, and so more people will be employed in effecting repairs to it and ancillary services. The more machinery that is used, the more money will be available in the long run for employing people on other kinds of road work.  There is no need to presuppose that there will be any reduction of employment for any one single man by the adoption of modern principles in road engineering in this country.  In fact, if anything, the result should be that more men will be employed as a whole on roads and lands in the winter months, and a higher proportion of them at higher wages.</P>
    <P>One of the factors in connection with modern road development is that it is possible to spread the work far more evenly as between the winter and the summer months through using modern machinery.  There can be the crushing of stone by high-class machinery in central quarries going on continuously in the winter months.  During our term, modern road machinery was not available to enable us to begin to put a proper modern road plan into operation&mdash;I may add that everything I have said on this can be found on the files in the Minister's office&mdash;but, even despite that, we were able to level out employment on the roads to a very considerable degree.  If I remember rightly, in our last year of office the <Col N="756" /> greatest number of people employed on the roads in 1947-48 was in the neighbourhood of 24,000 in the month of June, while the least number employed was something in the neighbourhood of 19,000 to 20,000 in the worst winter months.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows, satisfactory employment in the winter months is a vital thing in a rural district, and that employment can be given on roads, no matter what machinery is used, for the reasons which I have already stated. I do not think I need say anything more about road work.  I would ask the Minister to let us know how soon he can continue with the road plan which we left him.  It is possible for him to modify it any way that he likes, if he thinks it is too extravagant, but as long as it is a proper road plan and as long as he considers the building of roads in the same way as the Electricity Supply Board considers the erection of pylons through the country and the Board of Works considers the carrying out of arterial drainage, he can proceed to apply whatever principles he wishes.</P>
    <P>The next question is that of library development.  A Bill was passed through the House shortly before the last Government was defeated.  It was praised and approved of by everybody. I think it was almost the most unanimously praised Bill that I have ever heard discussed during the whole of my time as member of the House.  It was designed to assist in the improvement of the library service and to take over the central library from the Carnegie Trust.  I have read the first report of the Library Council which was established under that Act.  It is quite obvious that they have not been able to go ahead with the work which they set out to do.  I would ask the Minister whether he cannot do something to help.  The position is that, if the Minister wants to, he can encourage adult and juvenile education which can never be given in the schools throughout the country, and which is a thing that is desperately required in the rural districts. It is a thing which is needed as the result of our history.  Its vital importance is realised in the case of every other modern State in Europe. In the whole of Scandinavia library <Col N="757" /> development is associated with adult education.  It is associated with modern educational conceptions and is subscribed to by the central government on a considerable basis.</P>
    <P>In this country, the libraries vary enormously according to the amount of money which can be raised locally and the character of the librarian.  The librarian who has a capacity for the work and has the peculiar gifts of imagination required, can enormously increase the number of books read&mdash; the number of good books on Irish history, books about Irish life, about science, agriculture and everything of that kind.  A good example is that of a library area where all but 10 per cent. of the books will be the very lightest form of novel, and of another library area&mdash;in districts away from towns because, apparently, country people always read the more serious books&mdash;where the percentage of nonfiction read is 33 per cent. of all the books issued.  This is the result of having sufficient money for the service and of having a brilliant librarian who knows how to interest the public in books which may not have always been available to them.</P>
    <P>By means of book lists he can encourage the public to read the right kind of books and can do much to encourage the use of the library service.  There are some libraries where the juvenile books that are made available are woefully inadequate.  There are others where they have an excellent juvenile library.  There are almost no juvenile reading rooms available, rooms to which children could go to read books perhaps after Mass on Sundays or when their parents go to the market on fair days.  There are practically no places in this country where children can read books.  Such places are practically nonexistent here, although they are to be found in many other countries with much the same standard of living as we have.  There are very few children in this country who know anything about the history of their parishes, or about the famous people who have lived in them.  They know nothing about the character of birds or flowers or beasts or of growing things.  They know nothing about the science of growth, and so there is a terrific deficiency <Col N="758" /> of general knowledge of that kind, all of which, of course, if properly developed, could give so much pleasure to people living in the country.  One of the ways of meeting that deficiency would be by an extension of the library service which is going on in other countries and which, I suggest, should be built up here.  We hoped that the new library council would appoint surveyors who would go around the country and, in a very friendly way, find out what was required in each area and present a joint report and plan so that the county councils could know what standard they could reach and the way in which they could reach it.  We hoped that the Government would then be able to make grants to the local authorities as a result of the work carried out by these surveyors. In many areas plenty of work has already been done but there are other areas where they are definitely lagging behind.  The idea was to establish some kind of level standard.  I hope the Minister will give more encouragement to the library council because the members have a long way to go before they reach their objective.</P>
    <P>Every single Party in this House expressed the highest praise of the idea of providing some better form of adult education.  We all realise that no one can learn very much in school. The best way in which one can learn afterwards is through the medium of these library services.  They can be of tremendous value in maintaining a Christian civilisation and in maintaining the people's interests in remaining on the land.  I ask the Minister to consider what more he can do to encourage the library council in its work.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister consider whether something should be done in connection with the cleaning up of derelict sites?  The Minister will recollect that we passed an Act in 1940 to secure immediate title to these sites with a view to their subsequent removal. Possibly there is more important work to be done in the provision of actual houses for the people but there are areas where there should be sufficient labour to clear away these derelict sites without in any way interfering with the housing programme.  In a <Col N="759" /> space of 60 miles between Dublin and a provincial town I counted no less than 125 such sites.  It may be that the Act we passed needs amendment. I think it was one of the criticisms of the Labour Party when we were in office that there were certain features of the Act which were too cumbersome and needed amendment if the work was to be done quickly.  Has the Minister given any consideration to that matter?</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words about the traffic problem in general.  When does the Minister propose to bring in the Traffic (Amendment) Act that was partly ready for him when he came into office to enable the Gardaí to carry out their work more efficiently? Has he been able to confer with the Gardaí and local authorities in regard to standardising the use of danger signs on the roads.  In several areas local authorities have put up danger signs which are not in accordance with international practice.  That may be all right.  One can always argue that there is no need to follow slavishly a certain accepted group of international signs.  We did conform to general practice a number of years ago with a view to having as few types of sign as possible and have them easily seen by road users.  We did it with a view to not confusing drivers and road users with a multiplicity of signs.  If there are to be special danger signs, I think they should be in universal use in the country and placed where they can be easily seen.  Some can be seen at night because they have reflectors; others cannot because they have no reflectors.  The same applies to cats' eyes.  It is perhaps a small matter, but it is one of vital importance to orderly traffic to have the use of cats' eyes standardised on all the main roads.  In some areas they can be seen on the entire length of road either by night or by day.  On others they begin at a certain distance before the curve; on others they may begin at a lesser or a greater distance.  We have no standardisation in regard to that.</P>
    <P>What are the present regulations for encouraging the provision of turf ranges in turf areas or in areas fairly <Col N="760" /> close to bogs, though not immediately surrounded by them, in local authority housing?  How far has the Minister gone at the present time to conform to the general wish of the people to encourage the use of turf wherever it can be conveniently and economically used?</P>
    <P>Has the Minister considered the terms of the Sanitary Services Act, 1948.  Has he considered the problem of getting sewerage and water from individual houses attached to main drainage and water schemes?  So far as I know in a considerable number of towns nothing has been done to join houses to existing water and sewerage schemes.  Under the Sanitary Services Act local authorities were given power to do that.  They have to pay for any length of sewer or water pipe over and above a certain minimum distance, and they can collect the cost for the remaining distance through a special rate levied on the occupier over a 30-year period at some very low rate of interest. It seems a very reasonable proposition.  If there is anything faulty in the Act, the Minister should consider the position now.  I think it was the last Act we passed and it was passed in a great hurry.  Possibly there are certain deficiencies in it which will require amendment.  I remember being amazed to learn that senior counsel in times past have made thousands of pounds in fees on the question of deciding the joint responsibility as between local authorities and individuals for the maintenance and making of sewerage and water schemes. I was hoping that might be avoided in the future.</P>
    <P>Lastly, what is the Minister doing about the scheme for an architectural competition?  I think it is just as well we should realise that there have been very few good architects since the dawn of time.  An architect is a kind of artist.  There have been very few good artists since the dawn of time.  There are only about 30 artists among practically all the great Renaissance painters portraying the Christian scene for us. Good artists set the examples for less good artists and good architects do likewise.  There is no doubt that the standard of architecture for local authority housing is very low as compared <Col N="761" /> with other countries.  One has only to wander through Spain, Holland and the other European countries to realise how true that is.  It almost looks as if we built houses merely because we wanted to build them quickly without paying any regard to appearance.  There is something very much akin to economic liberalism in the idea of building houses recklessly as human containers without having any regard to the effect they may have on the lives and spirit of those who occupy them.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to go ahead with the architectural competition. It is better to have a few good designs copied and adapted rather than to have 20 or 30 bad designs.  Some of the new houses are delightful; others have no imagination either in construction or design.  I think much remains to be done from that point of view. Better designing is needed from the point of view of the built-in cupboard space made available and apart from furniture installed.</P>
    <P>I think more remains to be done in standardising the size of cisterns and pipes in order to reduce costs.  All these things call for the attention of the Minister.  If remedied, they will result in better housing for the people. As I have said, it is impossible to find more than one really good architect out of 50 or 100 from the point of view of artistic design.  The majority of them have the sense merely to copy the work of others.  That is why I say we need to have a good example set.  It should be no more expensive to build a beautiful house well designed than to build an ugly one.  It should not cost any more over a period of ten or 15 years. Housing design calls for imagination and inspiration on the part of those in charge of housing.</P>
    <P>Before I sit down I would like to refer to an observation made by a Deputy.  The suggestion was that in his area people had to belong to a certain Party before they would get a new house.  I do not understand what he meant by that.  As far as I know, the medical officers of health and the local authorities are incorruptible men. I think the idea that a person would have to belong to a certain political Party in either Longford or Westmeath <Col N="762" /> in order to get a new house is a revolting one.  It is contrary to the entire spirit and tradition of medical officers of health.  No doubt they are not perfect human beings; no doubt on occasion they may be influenced in one way or another but the suggestion that one has to be a member of a political Party to get a new house is entirely wrong and unfair to the officials concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution to this debate will be a limited one.  From my short experience as a member of the House, I have come to appreciate the importance of good local government administration throughout the country. It is not hard to realise the effect that local administration has on central government.  It is, therefore, all the more necessary to ensure that the machinery of local administration is maintained at a high level of efficiency. The significance of local government administration cannot be overstressed. I am pleased to learn from the Minister's introductory statement that, generally, over the past year reasonably satisfactory progress has been made by local authorities in their main activities, such as the provision of houses, sewerage, water schemes and the maintenance and improvement of roads.  Apart from the general situation, there are some particular points affecting my own constituency which I should like to bring to the Minister's notice for his earnest consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as housing is concerned, I think greater stress should be laid on the desirability of building houses, particularly in the rural areas, by direct labour.  From my short experience and knowledge of the direct labour system, as against the contract system, I am satisfied that direct labour not only produces a cheaper house but a better house from the point of view of construction and craftsmanship.  For instance, in one small scheme carried out by direct labour in Rosscarbery, a considerable saving was effected, and work is in progress on a limited number of houses by direct labour in Drimoleague.  On the other hand, in my own native town, Dunmanway, a group of houses <Col N="763" /> are being built by contract.  I think this scheme should be sufficient as a test of the merits of the two methods of construction.  Therefore I can see no reason why a further group of houses to be erected in my own town could not be built by direct labour, particularly in view of the availability both of skilled and unskilled labour. My dissatisfaction arises from the fact that contract prices in the town are far too high, ranging from £1,100 to £1,300 per house.  Therefore I cannot understand why the local authority do not extend their very limited direct labour activities.  The local authority's attitude in this matter is all the more difficult to understand in view of the Minister's repeated pronouncements in favour of direct labour.</P>
    <P>Apart from this, I should like to direct the Minister's special attention to the urgency of the housing needs of all the towns and villages in West Cork, especially in the towns of Bantry and Skibbereen and in the villages of Leap, Ballingeary and Glengarriff.  In order to ensure that the situation is kept under constant review I would suggest to the Minister that he would obtain a quarterly report from the local authorities in these particular areas as regards progress.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of housing which merits serious consideration is the necessity for a number of single cottages to be built in rural areas throughout the county.  It is within my knowledge that on several occasions tenders were invited but no contractors applied.  Many of the cottages were re-advertised but the local authority again failed to get contractors. Such cottages are required for people living in condemned houses and yet the local authority refused to build by direct labour.  The poor people who are living under those conditions, which make for the development of tuberculosis, are allowed to suffer on. This position has existed for many years.  The number of people who require such cottages to my knowledge in West Cork is about 30.</P>
    <P>Coming now to the question of repairs of cottages, the general experience is that when a person reports that <Col N="764" /> repairs are necessary it is often two or three years before anything is done.  I hope there will be an improvement in this direction when the engineering services are amalgamated.  Furthermore, as part of the housing drive and in order to ensure that proper services are available when the houses come to be built, steps should be taken to instal water supplies and sewerage schemes in all towns and villages well in advance of building.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of road workers.  Their present remuneration is fairly reasonable but I think it could be further improved without casting any appreciable burden on the local authorities concerned.  There is also the question of protective clothing.  I understand that at present road workers receive only one issue every three years.  This is ridiculous because, owing to the very nature of the work in which these men are engaged, the clothing, which is of very poor quality, could not be expected to last for a longer period than 12 months.  I suggest that, in common decency the road workers should receive an issue every 12 months and furthermore that the issue should be made during the month of September each year.</P>
    <P>It has come to my knowledge that road workers living in a particular area in my constituency are employed in another area despite the fact that there is work available and men employed in the particular area in which these men live.  I suggest that, if at all possible, county council employees should be given work as near as possible to their own homes.  Where it is not possible to give them employment near their own homes and where they are employed more than three miles away, they should be given a bicycle allowance because such an allowance was granted to bog workers during the emergency.</P>
    <P>So far as road works themselves are concerned I would suggest for the Minister's consideration one particular stretch of road in my area, namely that from Dunmanway to Macroom, on which some money has already been spent on surveying.  This is an important road and it is the most convenient means of communication between Dunmanway <Col N="765" /> and Macroom and it is now in a very dangerous and deplorable condition. In addition, other county roads such as the Drimoleague-Skibbereen and the Durrus-Kilcrohane roads are in urgent need of attention and I trust that the local authority will include them in their programme for immediate execution.</P>
    <P>On the question of the operation of the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949, I suggest that all schemes submitted under that Act should be carried out during the summer months. The work will then prove most beneficial to the landowners, to the workers and to the State and the bulk of the road maintenance work should be deferred until later in the year.  Also every effort should be made by the Minister and his Department to see that the schemes submitted under the Local Authorities (Works) Act are carried out as expeditiously as possible with particular reference to the Beara peninsula in my constituency because chronic unemployment exists there.</P>
    <P>There are many deficiencies in the Managerial Acts and I am sure that none of our public representatives will be satisfied until the assurance to repeal these Acts is implemented.  Personally I am glad that the Minister has already introduced a Bill to remove these deficiencies so as to ensure that those who offer themselves for election to the local councils will do so in the knowledge that if the people give them their confidence they will have available a democratic form of machinery under which they can give effect to the people's wishes in local government affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to be very brief for once.  I look upon the Local Government Vote as one of the most important Votes of the Government because a number of vital matters affecting the people in every area is controlled by the Department of Local Government.  I wish to deal with that very hackneyed subject, housing, that has been already spoken of by a number of speakers to-night.  In County Dublin the housing position has advanced considerably and it was due in no small way to the activities of the previous Minister for Local Government, <Col N="766" /> Deputy MacEntee, in the acquisition of sites.</P>

      <P>And Deputy Burke. Now we have the position in County Dublin where a number of people still require houses and the work is slowed up completely.  It is not the fault of the present Minister but the acquisition of sites seems to be a burning question. I have spoken on this very urgent matter before, and as far as I can see, in a number of areas in County Dublin housing is at a standstill due to the slow acquisition of sites by the Dublin County Council.  I look upon houses as being more important than hospitals because if we have not good houses there is very little use in bringing people to hospital and giving them first-class treatment and then sending them back to the same old hovel, 6 by 4, 6 by 6 or 6 by 7 as the case may be.  It is very nice to see that members of the Government Parties can take this serious position so lightly that they can laugh at it.</P>

      <P>Due to the work we had already done before you people came into office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have raised the question of the building of extra rooms to cottages before, especially the case of people who are suffering from tuberculosis and <Col N="767" /> who applied to get an extra room as was arranged for under an Act passed by this House in 1945.  I must say that while the Minister is not directly responsible, the local authorities could expedite the granting of such applications and assist people of that kind.</P>
    <P>The repair of cottages is hopelessly slow.  I have referred to it umpteen times and I am not going further into it to-night.</P>
    <P>While I want to keep my promise not to speak too long, I want to refer to the short-sighted policy of road making and road repairs in County Dublin.  I have made representations on a number of occasions about dangerous corners on second and third-class roads and when you make representations you are told that there is no money to meet it and you are dealing with roads that are no more than prairie tracks.  I wonder will the Minister consider taking the matter in his own hands and requesting local authorities to take the long view on the remaking and widening of roads and the elimination of dangerous corners.  We have had the experience of kicking up a row when somebody was killed, of votes of censure passed by juries saying that it was a pity that the road was not repaired or the dangerous corner taken off.  My county is a tourist centre, so far as Dublin City people and people from other areas are concerned, and the roads to the seaside in the area leave much to be desired, and I suggest that a policy of spending a reasonable amount of money each year, until such time as we reach some state of perfection in our roads, should be embarked upon.  That can be said of the main road from Swords to Dublin.  I am merely running over these points and do not propose to elaborate them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very important matter, especially in an area to which we hope to encourage tourists to come, that our roads should be perfect, and the Minister and his Department should take an active part in seeing that a policy is adopted under which this work will be carried out and will not have to wait for a year, two years or 20 years.  That is retarding progress and not tackling things as they should be tackled.</P>
      <P>With regard to sewerage and water schemes, I had a number of questions down with regard to the provision of these amenities in various areas and I hold that anything the Minister and his Department can do in this very vital matter deserves the support of the country.  I am sorry to say that there are areas within a mile or two of Dublin which have still no sewerage or water schemes.  In a number of cases, they have succeeded in the past few years in having them provided, but there are towns like Blanchardstown, Castleknock, Donabate, Lusk and similar areas along the coast, to which thousands of people go, which have not got such facilities.  I have raised the matter on numerous occasions by parliamentary question and I merely refer to it now to ask the Minister to see what he can do to expedite this urgent matter.</P>
      <P>Seaside amenities come within the purview of the Department and I must say that the amenities available for citizens who come out from the city leave very much to be desired.  In certain areas, on the recent few fine Sundays, any man fortunate enough to have a car could scarcely find parking space within a mile of the coast, and it is a matter to which I should like the Government, now that those making up the Government have stated definitely that the tourist industry is worth something to this country, to give serious attention.  The only way to encourage people to go to those seaside resorts is by providing the necessary facilities&mdash;by providing parking space for cars, facilities for the people who have no cars and all the smaller amenities that add greatly to the attraction of any district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the introduction of the new Local Government Bill, I will reserve <Col N="769" /> any further remarks I have to make on local government for a later occasion, but I should like the Minister to tell me what has happened to the old North County Dublin regional water scheme.  Is it still under consideration or has it been scrapped?  That was a very important scheme which would definitely have facilitated a number of areas, if it had been possible to put it into operation some few years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephPatrickBrennan" hpid="Dr. Brennan Dr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a good deal about the Department of Local Government, but, in view of the desire to curtail the debate, I shall limit myself entirely to what I consider to be necessary, with the object of trying to bring before Deputies certain matters which I think are worthy of their consideration.  First, I think this Department is the greatest burden with which this country has ever been saddled.  It would be impossible to imagine any Department so inept, so far away from the minds of the people and so careless of its obligations, and, unless I receive some satisfaction in the Minister's reply with regard to some of the points I intend to make, I shall seriously consider whether I can support this Vote. I go further and say that, if in his reply I find no hope of improvement, I shall certainly vote against it. The present condition of the Department is possibly not the fault of the Minister.  It is a heritage which has come down to him from an alien Government and it has never ceased to follow on the lines on which it was founded by that foreign Government. Since the Minister took office a little over a year ago, he has, I am sure, done all that one man could do against a Department which is definitely hostile to the will of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Particularly am I concerned in my constituency, which consists of something like 100,000 people, with the matter of housing.  During last year, on various occasions, in an effort to get solved the problems from which the people are suffering, I raised certain questions with regard to housing in the House.  The matter was also raised by my colleague, Deputy Brady, who put a question to the Minister on 23rd May last asking, in reference to <Col N="770" /> the Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation area and the Rathdown area of the Dublin County Council, the total number of houses built or reconstructed each year from 1934 to 1949 and the average number of manual workers employed during these years. I am only concerned with housing. The answer we got from the Minister was that in 1933-34 164 houses were completed; in 1949-50, 145 houses were completed and in regard to the Rathdown area, in 1934-35, 133 houses were constructed, and from 1939 no houses were completed during the subsequent years until 1949-50, when 29 houses were built.</P>
    <P>I wonder if any statement could be a greater reflection on the ineptitude of the Department which is responsible for maintaining in comfort the families who, in that large area, for which I happen to be one of the representatives, are crying for shelter.  There were 145 houses completed in 1949-50 in Dún Laoghaire and 29 houses in Rathdown.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister and those associated with him can give figures showing how many houses are under construction but is he so unaware of the conditions that exist that he will not take further steps, as he should take, to supply the needs of those who require houses?</P>
    <P>On 23rd March, 1950, I asked him some questions about houses.  I asked him what was the reason for the delay in the provision of houses by the county council and the Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation for families living in deplorable conditions.  I asked him whether, in order to safeguard the Christian fundamentals on which family life is based and to terminate the many cases of separation of fathers from their wives and children, he will take adequate remedial steps at once in respect of the areas concerned.  The Minister did reply but he did not answer the last part of the question and that is the kernel of the reason why I take such an antagonistic view of his Department.  Instead of relying on the fundamentals on which family life is based and encouraging our young people to get married and to live in decent homes, he and his <Col N="771" /> Department are so negligent that they forget these very fundamentals.  When I asked the Minister, in a supplementary question, would he answer that part of the question, he said, &ldquo;I think I have answered the question as fully as I can answer it.&rdquo;  Surely no rationalist could do better.</P>
    <P>I wonder if there is a single case in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area where newly-weds have been provided with houses.  I want to know from the Minister is he going to allow families to grow up where children are separated from their parents and husbands from their wives, without taking serious notice of the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephPatrickBrennan" hpid="Dr. Brennan Dr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Hostile Department is correct.  It is because that Department is hostile and because it is too much of a luxury for this nation to carry it and other Departments of State that I say that until every document which is in these Departments is taken out into the middle of Dublin Bay and dumped there and a new system is organised, a system more consistent with the ideals of our people, we cannot hope for the solution of our social problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBernieJnr" hpid="Mr. Beirne Mr. Beirne">

    <Speaker pid="JosephPatrickBrennan" hpid="Dr. Brennan Dr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with Deputy Burke.  I think this is a very, very serious problem.  The allocation of houses, such as they are, is another matter to which I shall refer later.  It is to the discredit of the Department of Local Government that, instead of having solved the housing problem now, after 2½ years of office, we are worse off than we were in 1934.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely the Minister must realise his responsibility.  If he does not do so, he should come to this House and tell us and he should go down to the people and talk to them and give his excuses and utter his platitudes and wishful thinking.  What the people want at the present moment, is not oratory, but houses.  People living under conditions which are truly deplorable receive very short shrift from the administration which is responsible for <Col N="772" /> the allocation of houses in the county and in the Borough of Dún Laoghaire. I have no hesitation whatever in stating here and now that I believe that some influence, and some underhand influence, is at work to prevent a just distribution of houses.  I believe that the Minister should hold an inquiry into the method by which this is done.  Had I known that this debate would be on to-day, I could have brought into this House a load of letters received from the county council and from the Borough of Dún Laoghaire, stating that other and more urgent cases are to be given houses.</P>
    <P>I remember a case of a family of eight&mdash;which is now a family of nine &mdash;living in two rat-infested rooms, who were visited by the acting medical officer of health.  They were promised a house.  The reply I received from the borough corporation in regard to them was a machine-made reply; it did not even bear the signature of the responsible officer; it was simply rolled out.  It said that that person did not deserve a house&mdash;that there were more urgent cases&mdash;I think these were the words.  At the same time I know in the Borough of Dún Laoghaire where families of two, three and four have got houses and I know of others living in squalor and in filth and under conditions which are a disgrace to any civilised community, who are not deemed to be worthy of consideration for a house.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say&mdash;and I am sure he can say&mdash;that this is done by statute.  That is the refuge which is taken for every lapse and every departmental inefficiency.  Statute, statutory powers, statutory procedure &mdash;we are sick of that.  That is why the Department of Local Government should be dumped into the middle of Dublin Bay.  What we want is an approach to the real problems, the real social problems, from which the people are suffering.  We want an equitable distribution of such favours as can be given by the responsible administration. When I say that I believe that the distribution of houses depends on inequity, I know of a case where a councillor is able to come to certain people and say: &ldquo;You are getting a house.&rdquo; Now, whether that is guesswork or not <Col N="773" /> I do not know, but it is happening and I do not make a statement like that lightly.  If I did, I should not be worthy to stand on the floor of this House.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the administration both of the Dublin County Council and of the Borough of Dún Laoghaire should be entirely abolished and that every document in the departments controlled by these administrations should receive the same treatment as that which I suggested for the Depart ment itself.  It seems to me that these two administrations, as well as the Department, believe that the objective of the people is to provide a luxurious environment for the sole purpose of keeping in employment and providing for the future of the supernumerary officials in whose custody is placed the unfortunate fate of long-suffering people.  I sincerely hope that the Minister, in his reply, will give some hope to the people whom I represent that at any rate family life can be restored, that husbands separated from their wives and children can be provided with a house, that young people entering into the marriage state can secure a home.  There is no use in telling me that it is going to be done.  I want it done&mdash;and it should have been done in the last two years, and it would have been done had ordinary decent business people taken the job and had red tape been eliminated from the procedure which has kept from the people whom I represent, and who are suffering as I have suggested, the comforts which they have been denied.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to say more than I should, but there is one thing I must say in dealing with the administration, especially of Dún Laoghaire Borough. The ratepayers of that borough contribute largely and painfully to the luxury of keeping in employment the corporation which controls the borough, and the condition of the streets each morning is perfectly disgraceful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We have 50,000 miles of public roads in this country and, of these, 10,000 miles are main roads. Some 13,000 miles of the 50,000 miles are resurfaced but 37,000 are not.  In addition to those 37,000 miles we have 20,000 miles of what might be described as cul-de-sac roads.  The amount of money spent on those roads at present is not sufficient to keep them properly maintained.  The ratepayers are going to be faced with a problem in a few years' time because the same amount of money is not being spent on them as was spent in the past.  They will have to go and remake those roads&mdash; and the ratepayers will be called upon to foot the bill.  Heretofore, a certain amount of money was paid out through the Department of Local Government by way of grants.  Those grants were substantially reduced two years ago, I think, to the extent of about £2,000,000. Our submission is that those grants should now be restored.  Those of us who are members of county councils have had experience, from time to time, of deputations composed particularly of farmers living on county roads which are in a shocking condition and in respect of which no moneys or only very small amounts were spent during the war period. Even if we had had the money available during that time&mdash;and there was money available in many instances&mdash;it happened that the county councils were not able to use all the money allocated for county roads because we had not the men.  They were in the Army and they were cutting turf in the bogs in order to provide fuel for the people in the cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the war ended, a survey of our roads was taken by the county engineers.  I understand from my <Col N="777" /> county surveyor that it was the general opinion of the county surveyors of the country that it would take at least two years to restore the roads to their pre-war condition.  What happened?  The grants were cut in 1949.  The result was that if those roads were to be put into the same condition as they were in pre-war, it would mean an additional burden on the ratepayers of the country. That is very unfair.  During wartime, we had turf lorries and beet lorries travelling on the county roads, and even on the bog roads which were never built for the purpose of carrying heavy traffic, and the result was that they were cut to pieces.  The withdrawal of the grants meant that the ratepayers would be responsible for putting them into a proper state of repair. They could not afford to do that.  Therefore, those roads have not yet been restored to their pre-war condition. As I have said, those of us who are members of a county council have, on many occasions, met deputations from farmers about the condition of county roads.  These roads had bad bends, hills and so forth, and the farmers were hoping that something might be done by the county council.  The county council was unable to do anything because it had not the money. The only way in which many of these works could be carried out was by getting grants from the Government.  As a result of the withdrawal of the grants, we were unable, in my county, to go ahead with necessary and important works, and works that would be of benefit to the people.  In connection with the 20,000 miles of cul-de-sac roads, we have boreens, laneways and so forth leading into farm houses. Under the Fianna Fáil régime there was a scheme whereby many of those laneways could be done under the minor relief schemes.  That has been discontinued.  No grants are made available as they were during that period.</P>

      <P>I will test that very quickly.  I would be very glad indeed if the Parliamentary Secretary would give grants for the repair of these boreens, and it will be my fault, I suppose, if I do not get them.  Already we have had the experience of having the road grants cut to a very substantial extent, over £2,000,000.  I submit that the amount of traffic through the country compared with the volume of traffic some years ago justifies the increased grants we are asking for.  We hope that the Minister will use his influence with the Minister for Finance to extract more money out of the motor taxation fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Childers pointed out, the Minister has stated that it takes £225 now to do the amount of work £100 would do in 1938-39.  Let us take that as being correct and let us take the <Col N="779" /> amount of money that we spent, including grants from the Road Fund and the contributions from the rates. In the year 1938-39 we spent £2,025,000 and in 1949-50 the amount spent on the roads was £4,640,000.  That seems a very substantial increase, but if you compare the two figures, and if you assume the Minister is correct in stating that the cost of the upkeep of the roads, maintenance and improvement, has gone up by 125 per cent., then that sum represents an increase of 10 per cent. over and above what was spent in 1938-39.</P>
    <P>We all know that there are far more motor vehicles on the roads to-day than there were in 1938-39.  The number of motor cars, private and otherwise, has increased by 66 per cent.  The number of heavy motor vehicles, such as lorries and trailers, has increased by 100 per cent.  If you look at it from the point of view of the amount of damage done now by these vehicles, as against the amount of damage done in pre-war days, I think everybody will agree that it is far greater now.</P>
    <P>We have more heavily-laden vehicles travelling the roads.  Going through the country, you will meet a lorry and trailer coming along and they are like a small train.  I have seen a lorry and trailer conveying 29 tons of beet.  There are not many county roads capable of carrying vehicles with loads of that sort.  They were never built to carry such heavy loads.  If they continue to carry loads of beet and turf and merchandise of every description the roads will soon wear out if some effort is not made to reconstruct or improve them.</P>
    <P>There are cattle being conveyed to the Dublin market in these lorries and trailers from all over the country.  If this is to continue, what will be the condition of the roads within a few years?  We are not spending the money necessary in order to keep them in proper repair.  The only way we can look after those roads is by getting grants.  The cost of the upkeep of the roads has gone up during the past two years as a result of the reduction in the road grants, yet we are not spending and cannot spend the same amount of money as we did spend three or four <Col N="780" /> years ago.  Even at that time we should have been spending more.  We could not do any more then, mainly because men were not available and we had not the machinery.  We hear a lot of talk about unemployment now. So far as the roads are concerned we have the men ready to work and we have the machinery and the materials but we have not the money.</P>
    <P>Deputations came before our council and we informed them that we were anxious to go ahead with the work but we were in the position that we could not afford the money.  If grants were made available in the same generous way as they were in 1947, we would be able to carry out some of these works and we would be able to make some improvement in the roads.  I want the Minister to use his influence with the Department of Finance and try to get more money for us.</P>
    <P>I agree that the Department should spend more money on county roads for the reasons I have given.  I know many farmers are depending to a far greater extent, in fact to almost 100 per cent., on having their produce carried by road.  Very little agricultural produce is now going by rail. Every year we see lorries going to farms for corn and beet and other farm produce.  I understand in many parts of the country, but particularly in the West&mdash;and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance can bear me out in this&mdash; that farmers have to haul their beet a long distance to a pickup point, because of the fact that the roads leading to their homes, or even to within two or three miles of their homes, are not built to carry the heavy lorries.  That happens in my own county, and I can speak with greater knowledge of my own county than of County Galway.  I know there are places where heavy lorries cannot be brought.</P>
    <P>If we are to have an expansion of production in the agricultural areas, greater facilities must be given to the farmers, and they must be provided with better roads.  One of the ways in which you will induce them to produce more is by providing good roads to their homesteads, giving them greater facilities by having roads capable of carrying lorries to where <Col N="781" /> their agricultural produce is ready for removal.  I can see no great difficulty in the Minister going to the Minister for Finance and making a reasonable case for increased grants.  The roads originally were not built for motor traffic, and neither have they been improved to the extent that they are now suitable for that traffic.</P>
    <P>Motor traffic in this country means £7,000,000 for the Exchequer, and out of that money £2,000,000 is given for the maintenance of roads.  What justification can any Minister put up to hold the £5,000,000 that is paid by the direct users of the roads?  What excuse can he make for not giving it to the people who are maintaining those roads?  If the grants are not made available the ratepayers must do the job, and if they are unable, then the roads will deteriorate to such an extent that the State one day or another must come to the rescue and we will have nationalisation of roads. You can have partial nationalisation now or you must have it in the future, one or the other.  If you want to escape that at the present time, the only way you can do it is by making a substantial increase in the grants to the county councils.  So much for roads.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words in connection with local government, with particular reference to the appointment of tenants to cottages.  Under a regulation recently made by the Minister, a preference must be given to agricultural labourers.  I should like to have a definition from the Minister of what is an agricultural labourer.  I had a case like this recently.  It was that of a married man, the father of five or six children who worked all his life on the land.  Some time recently he got a job with the Electricity Supply Board as a tractor driver on the rural electrification scheme.  He has made within recent times three applications for a cottage.  He has been turned down on each occasion on the grounds that he is not an agricultural labourer. As a matter of fact he should have been number one choice for a cottage. He would have been had he come within the category of an agricultural labourer.  I should like to know from the Minister if the same thing is to happen to road workers in the rural areas.  They are in much the <Col N="782" /> same position as the man I have mentioned. If he cannot be defined as an agricultural labourer, then neither can a road worker.  The same, I suppose, would apply to a handyman in the country who does a good deal of work for farmers and is sometimes employed in the towns or villages.  Strictly speaking, I suppose those men are not agricultural workers because they do not use a sprong or a fork.  At the same time they are living in rural areas.</P>
    <P>According to the regulation, as it has been interpreted in my county, the man who drives an Electricity Supply Board tractor is not regarded as an agricultural labourer.  But, if for any reason, he were to lose his present job or were to become redundant, he has no option but to go back and work on the land.  Suppose he did go back to work on the land then, naturally, he would become an agricultural labourer. Apart from his present job, the only other work he can get is with farmers.</P>
    <P>There was another regulation made some time ago by the Minister in connection with the tenancies of cottages. It has been my experience that on no occasion has the original applicant for a cottage got it when it was built. Away back in 1938 and 1939 in my constituency we had advertisements in the newspapers asking people in the rural areas who required cottages to make application for them.  Agricultural labourers and others did so.  In many instances, men were given plots by farmers voluntarily.  In other cases, the plots had to be compulsorily acquired.  But when the houses were built, in practically all cases they were given to people other than the original applicants.  The latter did not qualify simply because they had their families reared.  That was the principal reason why they did not get a house.  As I have said, I have known original applicants who were given sites for cottages voluntarily in 1938 and 1939.  The houses have now been built.  Those original applicants were at the time living in mud cabins or in hovels.  I know one particular man who reared a family of six children.  The house he lived in was so small that if he wanted to enjoy a smoke he had to go outside the door.  Now his family are scattered <Col N="783" /> and there is no one remaining behind but his wife and himself.  Due to that fact he is not entitled to a cottage.  Is it right for the Minister, or for a local authority, to deny people like him the right of having a decent house in his old age?  That ought not be the policy of the Department.</P>
    <P>The regulation in regard to that should, I think, be considered by the Minister and be amended.  The unfairness of it was brought forcibly to my notice about 12 months ago.  I went into a house where there was an old man.  He told me that about ten or 12 years earlier he had applied for and got possession of a plot on which a house was to be built for him. When it was, his application for it was turned down.  I made a suggestion at a meeting of the county council in connection with cases of that sort.  I do not know whether it was ever submitted to the Department or not.  It was that these houses be let in groups of five, and that one of the five be reserved for original applicants.  If that had been adopted it would help some way to solve this problem.  Later I suggested that two out of the five be given to men with families, that two others be reserved for newly-weds and the remaining one for original applicants. That scheme was turned down. I am chiefly concerned with the cases of original applicants who were given plots ten or 12 years ago on the understanding that houses would be built for them.  When the houses are built they find they are debarred, because in most cases there is no one left behind but the man and his wife. It looks as if they are never going to be able to enjoy the comfort of a decent home.</P>
    <P>There is another matter I want to refer to.  It is a suggestion that was put before the late Minister for Local Government on the occasion of his first visit as Minister to Kilkenny.  It was in reference to houses that, from the structural point of view, are well built, which we have in many parts of County Kilkenny.  I suggested to the Minister that these houses be taken over by the county council.  Many of them are well built with granite stone.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="784" /> The suggestion was that two of them be converted into one house, or, on the other hand, that an additional storey be added to each.  I think if that suggestion had been carried out it would mean the saving of a lot of money both for the State and the ratepayers in County Kilkenny.  These houses are let at a very low rent.  If they are left as they are it is likely they will be condemned by the doctors as not being suitable dwellings.  I think that if two were converted into one you would get a very good house. You would certainly have a far drier house than some of the newer ones that are being built.  I think the Department should give careful consideration to that suggestion.</P>
    <P>In my constituency of Kilkenny-Carlow we have houses of this description in many of the villages and towns. In County Kilkenny you have them in Goresbridge, Graiguenamanagh and Gowran, and in Fenagh and Borris in County Carlow.  I believe that very suitable houses can be built or reconstructed there.  The rent on the tenants would be much smaller if the houses were reconstructed.  In addition to that, many of these sites are situated in towns and villages.  The usual procedure nowadays is that, if there is a new building scheme, the houses are built outside the existing village or town.  The authorities have an eye on sewerage, water and so on. That is quite right, of course, but the villages are beginning to lose their identity under these schemes and what was once a village is now perhaps a derelict site.  Approaching these towns and villages nowadays one meets a nice patch of houses on the outskirts and inside the village there are only derelict sites.  The village of 25 or 30 years ago has disappeared to all intents and purposes.  All that is left are the shops.  The ordinary people have been transferred out to new building sites and the old village is rapidly losing its identity.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Local Authorities (Works) Act, representations were made on numerous occasions by the county council with reference to the drainage of Lough Cullen.  That is situated in South Kilkenny.  If the <Col N="785" /> bed of the river was lowered, it would drain the lake and keep the roads in that area from being flooded.  Many of the roads there are flooded after heavy rain.  Good grazing land is being damaged.  I understand that application was made to the Department of Agriculture under the land rehabilitation scheme to have some work done in that area, but, in the opinion of the Department of Agriculture, the work comes under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, and they refuse to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>I think myself it should be done under the land rehabilitation project. I think the Minister for Local Government should at least send down an inspector to find out definitely into which category the particular work comes.  Irrespective of whatever Department undertakes the work, it would be of great benefit to the people in the district.  I understand that the works undertaken under both these provisions are being financed out of Marshall Aid and there would, therefore, be no question of extra taxation imposed on the people.  The money spent would be spent to good advantage.</P>
    <P>I understand other works have also been submitted but have not been passed so far.  The scheme in connection with the Powerstown river was sent up last year and, so far as I am aware, that scheme has been turned down.  That river causes considerable damage by flooding on at least three roads.  Any time there is abnormal rain the river floods.  In addition to the roads being flooded, the lands are flooded too.  I think it would be well worth while carrying out that scheme. Because it causes damage to roads, I imagine it should come within the scope of the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>
    <P>With regard to some of the works, I believe the council will have trouble because claims can be made.  Some works have been carried out and one does not need to be an expert to know that, if flooding follows upon abnormal rain, the lands around will be inundated. In some cases the level of the road has been raised and there will be no place for the water to go except on to the adjoining lands.  If that <Col N="786" /> happens, the council will be faced with the responsibility of making good the damage done.  I think I am right in stating that there is a provision in the Act to cover that matter.</P>
    <P>Another objection is that the council has to pay the engineers.  I think that is very unfair.  After all it is the Department which suggests the scheme in the first instance.  We have to employ the engineers.  It may happen that our engineers will be compelled to do work which will ultimately prove detrimental to the council.  We may be paying men to do harm to ourselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not, but the fact of the matter is we have had no experience of it yet.  If we had a repetition of the abnormal weather of 1947, then we might be able to see what the results are and we might be in a position to say: &ldquo;We were wrong in our forecast with reference to this work.  We said it would do damage, but we have not had that experience.&rdquo; Since these works commenced we have had two of the best years we have ever experienced in living memory.  We have had no abnormal rains.  There has been no test.  During 1947 we had water 18 and 20 feet deep in North Kilkenny.  It is the general opinion of the engineers and of those who live in those areas and have seen the floods in the past that there will be worse floods in Kilkenny, Thomastown and Inistiog in future.  The river has silted up at Thomastown Bridge.  We made arrangements two years ago to have the silt removed, but the Department refused to sanction the scheme on the ground that the river would come under the arterial drainage scheme.  There are portions of the River Nore across which one could walk at the present time because of silt and tree trunks.  If extensive work is done north of Kilkenny and the waters flow down after heavy rain <Col N="787" /> irreparable damage will be done in Kilkenny, Thomastown and Inistiog. These towns have all suffered from flooding in the past.  The position in the future may be much worse.  I understand from other Deputies to whom I have spoken that the same is true of other areas where there are large rivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying we should not have the scheme, but I do think the arterial drainage should be put into operation before these smaller schemes are carried out.  I agree that excellent work is being done in some areas.  I might mention here that we carried out a scheme in Kilkenny under the Local <Col N="788" /> Authorities (Works) Act, and the Minister for Agriculture subsequently claimed the credit for it.  I understand he sent down a special representative to report on it.  It was really one of the Department of Local Government's schemes.  However, it was not our business to interfere.  It was a matter for the Department of Local Government.  The scheme was a good one, and the Minister for Agriculture took advantage of that fact.</P>
