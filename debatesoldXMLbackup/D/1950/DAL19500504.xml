      <P>Might I inform the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance that on Thursday, 27th April, I asked a question dealing with the same road into this bog and the reply I got on that occasion was that this bog was privately owned and the repair of the road in question was not, therefore, a matter for the Land Commission?  I wonder how the Minister can reconcile the answer of the 27th April with the answer given to-day.  I do not want to embarrass the Parliamentary Secretary.  He may not know anything about it.  Will he please refer the matter to the Minister so that we may at least have either the same answer or a correct answer?</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply given to his question of 7th July last on this matter.

He was appointed last November and it is now May.  He has carried out certain work and I believe he has made a proposal to the Cork County Council to carry out some borings under the bridge to get some information as to the possibility of foundations. The Cork County Council I believe are examining that proposal, but so far no proposal has come to the Department.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is true to say that the financial statement delivered here yesterday by the Minister for Finance has aroused only a ripple of public interest.  That is a fact which is more to be deplored by critics of the statement than by the Minister.  It was, perhaps, one of the most important statements of that kind ever made to the Dáil.  Certainly, in my view, it is likely to have more far-reaching consequences than many of the financial statements of earlier years.  The reason why there was no public interest in it is, of course, because the statement expressed little more concerning the manner in which the Government propose to handle the problem caused by the spectacular rise in the cost of the public services than was already known.  I should like to congratulate the Minister for Finance upon the astuteness with which he has handled the political problems involved for him. The announcement of his intention to borrow instead of to tax for the Budget deficiency so far in advance of the Budget statement has had the effect of diverting attention from the course of Government policy which the rise in the cost of the public services revealed.  If that announcement had been withheld, as a more orthodox Minister for Finance might have withheld it, until the Budget statement, if the <Col N="1777" /> full rise in the cost of the public services had been revealed without intimation of the method the Government intended to use to cope with it, then public fear of a possible heavy increase in taxation would have concentrated attention and discussion upon the failure of the Government's economic policy, or the Minister for Finance's surrender of the principles to which he gave expression on his election, and the subsequent announcement of the decision to meet the increased cost not by higher taxes but by resort to the money-lenders, would have had the sensational flavour which the Minister for Finance was so anxious to avoid. We give the Minister full marks for his cleverness in meeting his political problem.</P>
      <P>I think the Government as a whole, however, are entitled to share in our commendation on that score.  The long-range battle which has been proceeding between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for External Affairs &mdash; it is, I think, a sham battle; at any rate, nobody is getting hurt in it &mdash; has also served the purpose of diverting public opinion from the essential facts of the Budget position and the critical nature of the Government's decision in relation to it.  It has, incidentally, served the secondary purpose of diverting attention from the personal failure of the Minister for Finance.  The attempt at misrepresentation of the character of the Government's decision, the references to &ldquo;national investment&rdquo; or, where that was inappropriate, to &ldquo;social investment&rdquo; or, where that was inadequate, the Taoiseach's delightful expression &ldquo;expenditure on human improvement&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We are going to inquire, from certain information which we got from the Minister for Finance, exactly what the country can afford. Let me, however, once again put the problem in simple terms &mdash; the terms which were revealed to the House and the electorate when the Book of Estimates was published.  The cost of public services this year is estimated at £78,000,000.  Last year these services were estimated to cost £65,500,000. That is the first and most important fact.  In addition, Central Fund services, which previously cost £8,000,000, are now going to cost £9,000,000 &mdash; the additional £1,000,000 being consequential upon the borrowing which the <Col N="1779" /> Government has already undertaken. It is needed to pay interest and sinking fund charges on these loans.  Against that total bill of £87,000,000 for supply and Central Fund services, revenue, as estimated by the Minister for Finance, will bring in £75,000,000, leaving a deficiency of £12,000,000.  The Minister told us during the debate upon the Vote on Account that he examined the Estimates for the various Departments. He said he did so for the purpose of ascertaining what sub-heads in each departmental Estimate represented items for which he could justify borrowing and he discovered, as a result of that search of the Estimates, such items which, providentially, amounted to the exact figure of the deficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That, as Deputy Aiken has remarked here, was a coincidence. I wonder how many Deputies on the benches opposite really think it was a coincidence.  Are there not a few of them who have a deep suspicion that the Minister merely decided to borrow for the deficiency, whatever it was; that he selected items from the various sub-heads amounting in the aggregate to the same sum, and then set about the more difficult task of producing arguments to justify that course as a policy?  We know now what the arguments are.  Some of them are a capital investment &mdash; they may yield no interest to the Exchequer, but they have been classified as such.  Some are a social investment &mdash; whatever that exactly means &mdash; and some are just &ldquo;plans for human improvement&rdquo;, a term that would cover anything from the maintenance of a Borstal institute to a ministerial joy-ride in Europe.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say America, where the Minister for Agriculture, on his own admission, wasted a month. Is there any Deputy opposite who does not suspect that if the Revenue Commissioners had estimated that the yield of tax returns this year would be <Col N="1780" /> £1,000,000, £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 less than £75,000,000 the Minister would not have gone back again over the Book of Estimates and have found a few more items amounting to £1,000,000, £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 for which he could justify borrowing on the same grounds?  Is there any Deputy opposite who suspects that if the Revenue Commissioners had been in the fortunate position of being able to tell the Minister for Finance that the tax revenue would be £1,000,000, £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 more, the scope of State capital expenditure on these items would be contracted by that amount?</P>
      <P>I want to discuss this matter very seriously on the basis of two points. Can it be done at all?  What will be the economic consequences of attempting it?  The Government are going to borrow this year, in accordance with the proposals of the Minister for Finance, some sum in excess of £30,000,000.  It will be at least £31,000,000 and possibly more.  It is obvious that that cannot be done by any methods, even the methods suggested by the Minister for Finance, without serious consequences.  It is a question in my mind whether it can be done at all by any method, but we know that the effort is going to be made; we know that the Minister for Finance has, in fact, now no alternative but to proceed along the road he has mapped out, regardless of the consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He knows there will be risks.  So far as the records of the House are concerned, he will be able to point to them and show that he realised the risks he was incurring and that he warned the House, although those who heard him read the statement did not notice any emphasis on the warning, that the programme set out for the Dáil, the policy which he outlined for the Government, could not be carried out at all unless certain conditions were fulfilled.  On page 40 of his statement he mentions the risks in the technical terms which he used throughout his whole statement, technical terms which we have to translate into terms which the people will understand. He refers to the risk of inflation. <Col N="1781" /> I suppose most Deputies understand the term, but for the ordinary member of the public inflation is something you do with a balloon.  What the Minister means is that the course he is now going to follow will occasion a risk that prices will rise.  I am now quoting his words as they appear on page 40 of his statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Apart from increasing the burden on the taxpayer, an unduly rapid rate of increase in the State debt may have other undesirable consequences which it must and will be the aim of the Government to avoid.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One is the risk of inflation.  The second &mdash; and I hope that Deputies who have made it their business in this House to establish themselves as the custodians of the social conditions of the workers will note the nature of the gamble they are being asked to undertake &mdash; is the further risk of a lowering of living standards, the level of consumption, the amount of food that our people may eat, the amount of clothing they may be able to buy; in fact, all the things that make up the standard of living may be reduced by reason of this departure in financial policy upon which the Government has decided.  The contraction of normal development, the dislocation of employment, the denial of opportunities of new employment which may be occasioned also by this departure in financial policy&mdash;all these risks are there, according to the statement of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The Government may proceed with this policy and find that it can be done; but if, on the Minister's own assumption, circumstances arise in which the policy cannot be followed at all, then the risks are greater still, because they include the risk of a complete economic collapse which it might take generations to recover from.  We know, however, that the Minister for Finance has committed himself to this policy of borrowing in order to defray the cost of certain supply services.  If he finds that he cannot proceed with it, either because of its effect upon prices or upon the standard of living, or its effect upon normal private investment, or for any other cause to which he referred, <Col N="1782" /> he will have to trim his policy.  What part of it will he trim?</P>
    <P>These supply services which are to be financed by borrowing will be carried through.  It is the normal and beneficial capital investment to which no reference appears in the Book of Estimates at all that will have to be curtailed and restricted and we will be left in this position that we will be creating mainly dead-weight debt and not, by reason of any capital expenditure undertaken, adding one iota in a direct sense to the national income.</P>
    <P>We got figures yesterday in relation to the national income.  According to an estimate, which we were warned was provisional and subject to revision, the national income, valued in devalued pounds, in 1949, was £350,000,000.  The Minister for Finance made some adjustments and alterations to that figure; he added on customs and excise duties, subtracted subsidies and then added some figure which represents an estimate for expenditure upon depreciation. He added in the trade deficit for good measure and got a total of £405,000,000 which, he said, represented the pool from which all expenditure of any kind undertaken by the Irish people was made last year.</P>
    <P>Let me protest here against the inexplicable and inexcusable delay in producing from the Central Statistics Office estimates of national income and expenditure, equivalent to those published for the years prior to 1945.  There can be no rational explanation offered for that delay.  Before I ceased to be Minister for Industry and Commerce and in charge of the statistical office the office had reached a stage in preparing estimates for subsequent years which would have permitted the publication of figures.  However, their objection to publication of them at that time was mainly on the ground of professional pride.  The unexplained items which they were anxious to break down into more understandable parts were, in their view, unduly high, and, while I agreed to postponement of publication while they made that effort to interpret the statistics available to them, I did not contemplate that three years later we would still <Col N="1783" /> be with only a rough, provisional estimate, subject to revision for the national income in last year.  I make that complaint all the more emphatically because the Minister gave us yesterday an estimate of the expenditure of our people last year upon consumption goods which I find myself unable to relate to any corresponding figure published in respect of earlier years.  However, we will take the Minister's figure.</P>
    <P>In last year, according to him, the people of this country had from all sources, including the liquidation of external assets, £405,000,000 to spend and of that £405,000,000 they spent £354,000,000 on consumption goods, on food and clothing and so forth, leaving a balance of £51,000,000 which the Minister described as gross investment, that is to say, the total expenditure upon new capital undertakings, upon additions to stock and including the increased value of work in progress.  I want the House to note that figure of £51,000,000.</P>
    <P>During the course of the debate upon the Vote on Account I suggested to the Minister for Finance that this capital programme which he had outlined could not be undertaken, that there was not available from the savings of our people for investment in Government loans the amount of money that he proposes to borrow.  He assured the House that not merely was the amount of money available for investment substantially higher than the figure he gave but that it had been for years past of the order of £70,000,000 a year and he added&mdash;I am quoting from column 2513, Volume 119, No. 19 of the Dáil Debates:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There has been no appreciable change, no change for the worse, in the finances of the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, either that figure was wrong and the Minister based his financial proposals for this year upon a wrong figure or else there has been revealed, since that figure was prepared, a change for the worse in the finances of the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1784" /> The cost of living has risen more rapidly than the national income and the amount that is available for investment purposes of all kinds is now substantially less than it was &ldquo;for years past.&rdquo;  The likelihood that the Minister based his decision and secured the assent of his colleagues to that decision on a wrong figure cannot be ruled out. The tactics of members of the Government have always been to overcome the immediate difficulty of parliamentary debate by any device, including the device of giving the Dáil inaccurate information, and to leave the resulting problem to be dealt with when it arises.  However, having been challenged, the Minister in his Budget statement gave us a figure.  The total amount in 1949 available from all sources for new investment of all kinds was £51,000,000, half of which came from the current savings of the people and the other half, in the form of a deficit on external trade, through the realisation of external assets.  Now the half which represents the savings of our people represents all the savings available, including all the profits of every business concern that were not distributed.</P>
    <P>During the Vote on Account debate I referred the Minister to a statement of the Central Bank in respect of the year 1948 that in that year the amount of new capital known to the bank to have been raised from the public did not exceed £16,000,000, of which by far the greater proportion was subscribed to public loans.  When I suggested in the course of that debate that the current savings of our people available for Government investment or for private investment, for capital formation of any kind, did not exceed £24,000,000 or £25,000,000, the Minister for Finance scoffed at the suggestion. As he himself told the House yesterday, if private capital outlay is to be maintained then the amount which the State is proposing to invest this year, whether it be invested in productive enterprise or in the Budget deficit, can be secured only in one of two ways, either by a reduction of the level of consumption of our people, leading to greater saving, or by enlarging the trade deficit, leading to the repatriation <Col N="1785" /> of external assets.  The Minister admitted that there was no gain in promoting increased State investment at the expense of private investment. Most of us would regard that as a disadvantage, but it is clear that if he attempts to draw off from the amount available for investment this year any sum approaching half the total amount he intends to borrow, not merely will he stifle normal private enterprise but he will force this country into a position in which all private enterprise will cease and in which any new development in industry or agriculture must inevitably proceed under State auspices.</P>
    <P>I have said already that the Government, in ignorance, are leading the country into a form of cockeyed Socialism, and I, for one, believe that more beneficial results will be secured if the Government goes avowedly for a Socialist policy, controlling all forms of economic activity, controlling all investment and taking all the responsibility for the economic consequences of its acts.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance has doubts himself as to whether this policy which he has adopted, whether on his own initiative or that of some of his colleagues is not known, can be carried through.  He stated at page 48 of this document:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...the State investment programme can be carried through, without causing inflation or restricting the amount of capital available for private enterprise, if output is expanded, if resources are withdrawn from consumption by increased savings, and any deficiency in the resources so set aside for investment is made good by external disinvestment in the form of imports of goods.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I want Deputies who support <Col N="1786" /> this policy, whether out of Party loyalty or because they understand it, to note particularly that paragraph in the Minister's statement.  This programme can be carried through only if output expands, if there is a reduction in consumption and increased savings by our people and if we have a considerable increase in the import of goods.  The Minister for Finance could have put that statement the other way round.  He could have said that in order to carry through this programme it is necessary to secure an increase in output, a reduction in consumption leading to increased savings and a substantial increase in the import of goods.</P>
    <P>On the same page he also suggested that there was another essential condition to the fulfilment of his programme &mdash; the need, he said, to avoid increases in income not related to output.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;An expansion in consumption generated by increases in money incomes would deplete the resources available for investment and have inflationary consequences.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So not merely are we to work harder and to increase output in order to fufil this programme, not merely are we to consume less so that we can lend increased savings to the State, not merely must we reconcile ourselves to a substantial increase in the import of goods but we must have also something akin to a voluntary standstill of wages. I am not saying it; it is the Minister for Finance who said that yesterday. Did many of the Deputies sitting opposite to me now note these phrases in the Minister's statement?  Did they appreciate their significance?  The statements are there on the record. They cannot deny in future that the Minister did not warn them of the implications of the policy that he is asking them to approve.  Thirty-one millions are to be borrowed.  In order to make it possible for the State to borrow that £31,000,000 we have to endure these consequences.  There is, of course, an alternative open to the Minister.  There are other sources from which he can get money, other sources which, if he applies to them, will involve us in still greater risks.  He <Col N="1787" /> does not, he assures us, intend to use these alternative methods except in a limited degree.  Of this £31,000,000 to be borrowed, the cost of the land rehabilitation scheme, the local authorities' works scheme, harbours development and the mineral exploration scheme is to be defrayed out of the American Loan Counterpart Fund. On the 31st March there was £13,000,000 available in that fund. More will accrue to it during the year. If the Minister's undertaking to the Dáil yesterday is of any value, he is going to utilise that fund for this borrowing programme only to the extent this year of £5,120,000.  He could, of course, utilise all the fund. He recognises, however, that it would have precisely the same effect on employment, prices and trade as if he ordered printing presses and printed notes to that value.  Therefore, he is not going to have recourse to it to the full extent.  Only in the limited measure outlined by him is he proposing to utilise that fund.</P>
    <P>Similarly he is going to liquidate certain securities held by various social welfare funds entrusted to his care.  The liquidation of these securities would have precisely the same inflationary effect as the utilisation of the American Loan Counterpart Fund.  In addition, he hopes to get £5,000,000 through the Post Office Savings Bank, and he has, as I understand it, about £2,000,000 available for investment under various heads which will be utilised in connection with this borrowing programme.  He proposes to get the balance, whatever the balance may be, from current savings by a national loan.  Unless the balance is substantially less than the figures given by the Minister would indicate he cannot do it.  I know he explained the fact that the 1949 loan of £12,000,000 attracted subscriptions from the public only to the extent of £7,500,000 on the ground that he asked the banks not to support it.  If I understand the statement he made here yesterday, he is not going to attempt to fill this year's national loan with bank aid either; he is going genuinely to attract the amount of money he requires out of public savings.  It will be interesting <Col N="1788" /> to see whether he can do it or not. Inevitably, if he tries it the consequences to which I have referred must follow.  We have only got a limited amount of money available here for investment purposes of any kind.  An effort by the State to draw that money into the Exchequer to finance various State schemes means that it cannot be utilised for the more normal type of development upon which most of us would prefer to rely for an improvement in economic conditions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be used for that purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>By far the largest part of it is used for that purpose.  All the undistributed profits of business mainly represent new investments in the business in which they arose and in a country such as ours, where most business enterprises are on a comparatively small scale, the expansion of industrial activity must mainly come from the extension of the activities of these enterprises following the reinvestment of earned profits.  That type of development may be regarded as undesirable by some of the pale pinks of this country who do not understand the implication of their own viewpoints but of this I am certain: that we shall get more rapid development, and development over a far wider field in industry, by encouraging and assisting private enterprise than by any limitation of development to State activities. I have no apology to make for the fact that in my time as Minister, I promoted numerous industrial projects under State auspices.  I have always defended the doing of that on the ground that, in our circumstances, there were many forms of industrial development that were unlikely to be undertaken or undertaken in a reasonable time by private concerns and that if we wanted to make progress in these fields, we had to do it through State organisations.  Despite attacks upon the organisations that we established in accordance with that policy by Deputies on the opposite benches, I was pleased to note that the Minister for Finance was compelled to admit yesterday that they were on the whole successful and successful even on the <Col N="1789" /> narrow basis of returning to the Exchequer an amount of money equivalent to the charges undertaken by the Exchequer in financing them.</P>
      <P>Nobody here is raising any objection to State investment on any scale on undertakings to increase the national income.  All the £19,000,000 of investment of that kind which the State, we are told, may undertake next year, will, in the main, be undertaken on projects that we initiated.  So far as the electricity generating programme is concerned, I for one, am not satisfied that the plans of the Electricity Supply Board go far enough.  We have never, for years past, been in the position in which we could see the stage at which the output of the electricity would be equivalent to the demand for it.  I do not believe that, even when the five new stations now in construction are completed, we will have reached that position.  The increase in the demand for electricity is growing far more rapidly than the activities of the Electricity Supply Board in planning new generating capacity.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why the machine turf programme is being delayed, if, in fact, it is being delayed by the non-enactment of the legislation which is on the Order Paper.  That Bill, which is on the Order Paper, was ready for introduction in the end of 1947.  It could have been submitted to the Dáil in its present form, because it has not been altered by a word, in March, 1948. It was, in fact, introduced here last autumn, but it has never got a Second Reading.  It may be that, by some temporary arrangement, Bord na Móna is being facilitated in proceeding with its plans as if the legislation had been passed, but, clearly, it would have been a far more regular procedure, if that is the case, to get the Bill passed through the House.  It will be an unopposed Bill, and so the necessary financial arrangements of the board could have been put on a formal basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The housing expenditure which is to be undertaken will be in accordance with the terms of the 1948 Housing Act.  Telephone development, arterial drainage or any work of that kind which the Government want to undertake, <Col N="1790" /> provided it is well planned, will be supported by Deputies on this side of the House.  (Deputies: Hear, hear.) When in March, 1948, the Minister for Finance came to this House with the announcement of the first loan floated by the present Government I told him then that, so far as we were concerned, for every well-planned project of national development he could rely on our support and on our support in raising money.  We object to borrowing for a Budget deficit.  We object to borrowing for purposes that in the past were financed out of revenue because we believe that by doing so you risk the progress of these normal development schemes, because you will restrict the progress of private enterprise and because you are taking these unnecessary risks with the people's standard of living and the level of employment.</P>
    <P>Let me be clear in this regard, that in so far as there are set out in the Book of Estimates particulars of the various sub-heads for which the Minister for Finance proposes to borrow in this year, I would not contend that the whole charge represented by these sub-heads should be met out of tax revenue.  We borrowed for the Transition Development Fund.  The Minister decided last year to wind up that fund, but he has changed his mind, and he proposes to allocate a further £2,000,000 to that fund in this year. Borrowing for that fund initially was fully justified.  It was established on the assumption that building prices would reach a peak in the year or two after the war and then fall again, and in so far as it was undesirable either that housing authorities should postpone their activities until the fall in prices occurred or that houses built during that period should cost more either to the local authorities or their tenants than houses built subsequently, it was desired that the peak should be removed by the making of exceptional contributions from the Exchequer.  If that fall in prices has not occurred or is not anticipated, if, in fact, the height to which building costs rose in those peak years was not a peak but the normal level for the future, then if it is necessary to increase the <Col N="1791" /> measure of State aid to local authorities undertaking housing, it becomes less justifiable to borrow for that purpose, because that aid will have to be continued year after year so long as the housing programme is continued.</P>
    <P>I suspect that Ministers realise fully the lack of justification in their policy because they are at such pains to misrepresent it.  So far as we are concerned, you cannot go fast enough with the housing programme.  We do not think you are going fast enough. We do not think that the assurance that housing activities would not be impeded by financial difficulties has worked out in precisely that way.  We think there are impediments to housing output which the Government are capable of removing but which they are disinclined to tackle.</P>
    <P>In so far as the £14,000,000 which is to be spent on housing next year represents an investment in housing, we are agreeable to it being met by borrowing. Nine million pounds of that £14,000,000 will represent advances from the Local Loans Fund to local authorities.  The Local Loans Fund has always been fed by the proceeds of Government borrowing, and it is legitimate to continue on that course.  I will raise a question mark concerning the expenditure from the Transition Development Fund.  I think that borrowing for the purpose of that outlay is justifiable only on the assumption that was made originally, that a reduction of building costs was to be anticipated next year or the year after.  Borrowing for ordinary housing grants cannot be justified on any ground.  What are these housing grants?  They are subsidies for rents; they are moneys given out to local authorities on the one hand, or to private individuals on the other, to enable them to get dwellings at a price or at a rent that is less than the economic price or economic rent.  It is a social welfare scheme. It is as much a contribution from the general community to the standard of living of the individuals who benefit under it as is the children's allowances scheme.  There is just as much justification for borrowing to pay children's <Col N="1792" /> allowances as there is for borrowing to pay these rent subsidies.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, there is nothing abnormal about the payment.  It is to be assumed that this housing programme will continue year after year, as long as most members of the present Dáil will live, and that year after year money to that amount or to a larger amount will have to be voted against the cost of these grants.  Borrowing for that purpose is improvident finance, and I submit that the only reason why the Government decided upon it was that they were anxious to find some means of avoiding the increase in taxation which the rising costs of other Departments of State would have necessitated.</P>
    <P>I want to raise also the proposal to borrow the entire cost of the land rehabilitation scheme.  I did not oppose vigorously that proposal when it was first announced to the Dáil a year or so ago.  I have no objection in principle to the State borrowing to meet expenditure which can reasonably be expected to result in an expansion of national production and, consequently, in State revenue.  But does any Deputy here believe that expenditure under the land rehabilitation scheme is adding to the capital value of the land benefited or to the productive capacity of the land in direct relationship to the total expenditure?  Do Deputies believe that?</P>

      <P>Are Deputies trying to tell me that the market value of the land after the money has been spent on it will increase by the amount of the expenditure?  Why should we borrow for the administrative expenses involved in the scheme?  Are the civil servants who are administering it a capital investment or a human improvement arrangement?  Is there any reason why that part of the cost should be borrowed?  The same thing applies to the Local Authorities (Works) Scheme. Some proportion of that expenditure might be met by borrowing, just as in the past a proportion of the outlay on forestry was met, but only a part, not the whole.  I have not got the information <Col N="1793" /> which would enable me to arrive at a personal calculation as to what proportion of the capital expenditure could justifiably be regarded as an investment of the kind described by the Minister for Finance, but I am satisfied that the whole of it cannot be justified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not.  I am not responsible for what the Deputy understands; I am responsible for enough. In the past these kinds of charge on the public purse were defrayed out of tax revenue.  That may have been a form of finance which imposed burdens on our people at the time when the expenditure was being undertaken, but that is the time the burden should be imposed.</P>
      <P>What is the proposition of the Government? We are going to spend under these various heads £12,000,000 this year.  We are going to recover that £12,000,000 at the rate of £650,000 per year over 30 years.  Next year, presumably, if the Minister is still determined to avoid increased taxation, a much higher deficit in the Budget will involve still higher borrowing and another imposition of £650,000 or a larger sum per year over 30 years, and so on for every year so long as this policy is followed.  In ten or 15 years' time there is going to be a Minister for Finance forced to allocate out of the public revenue millions of pounds every year, millions that he would wish to spend on the improvement of social welfare services or in some other manner beneficial to the people who are paying the money, to pay for the benefits that we will be enjoying this year.  That will be known, no doubt, as the McGilligan legacy.  In 30 years' time they will still be paying and the McGilligan legacy will then be joined in Irish folklore with the curse of Cromwell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not the only additional charge upon revenue which will follow from this policy because, over and above the £650,000 per year which this year's expenditure will impose and the expanding charges which next year's <Col N="1794" /> expenditure will impose, we are undertaking a capital liability for other purposes involving interest and sinking fund payments of probably not less that £1,000,000 per year.  We are proposing to do that again next year. Therefore, as the years pass, an increasing proportion of the State revenue must be appropriated to the financing of these capital liabilities, meeting the obligations involved in the increase in the dead-weight State debt which the Government are asking us to undertake this year.</P>
    <P>As I have said, posterity cannot object because they are not here to object, but some of us should look further ahead than the next election. Is it not obvious to everybody that the real reason why this policy has been adopted is because it is a popular policy &mdash; I admit it is a popular policy &mdash; that it will be an easier task for Deputies opposite to convince the people of the country that they need not pay now; that they can leave the job of paying to somebody else later on; that it will be for us to convince them that it would be in their interest to pay now.  They will have the easy task.  It is only later people will realise how they are going to pay, when unemployment begins to mount, when prices begin to rise, when the necessary curtailment of the standard of living is experienced, and no doubt Deputies think they will be able then to find some method of blaming Fianna Fáil for that also.</P>
    <P>I have said that there are circumstances in which the State would be justified in not attempting to meet the whole of its expenditure out of current revenue.  I think that that course is practicable and desirable and has successfully been applied in countries like Sweden during periods of trade depression, during periods when there was a deflationary fall in prices, during periods when the total outlay of the community on consumption goods was inadequate to take up the entire current output.  But do these conditions exist now?  The Minister warned us that the conditions which exist here are the reverse.  Is he not telling us that we are still facing the danger of active inflation and is it not precisely <Col N="1795" /> in the teeth of this warning he is recommending us to follow a course which is the reverse of what good policy would indicate?  Our situation is not so fundamentally different from that of Great Britain.  The British Chancellor of the Exchequer did not go to the British Parliament and say: &ldquo;We can borrow and spend this year and let those who come after us pay.&rdquo; On the contrary, he impressed on the House of Commons the necessity for budgeting for what he called a genuine surplus and he produced above the line, to use the Minister's phrase, a surplus almost equivalent to the whole of his expenditure below the line.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Great Britain is a debtor nation; we are a creditor nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the difference? How does it involve the issue which is raised here, the spending of money which is not earned?  If there is the danger of inflation to which the Minister referred, he should be budgeting for a surplus and trying to draw off excess purchasing power, to draw it into the Exchequer, and thus check the rise in prices which will otherwise occur.  Instead of that, he is like a doctor applying the wrong remedy, who tells a postman suffering from bunions that he should take more exercise or a D.T. patient that he needs a stimulant.  That is the advice we are getting from the quack who is now put in charge of the national finances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have asked why we have to undertake these risks and to face these probable consequences of the Government policy.  The sole reason is because the Minister for Finance failed in his attempt to apply the policy of economy and retrenchment which he announced when he was elected.  That is the sole reason.  If he had been successful in finding economies, if he had tried to apply his policy of retrenchment, this situation would not arise.  Remember this: in the year 1947 Deputy Aiken brought a Budget here based upon Estimates for Supply Services totalling £52,000,000. <Col N="1796" /> A spokesman of the Fine Gael Party greeted that Budget with the statement that expenditure at that level imposed an intolerable burden on the people. Later in that year, when food prices began to rise and the Government decided to check the rise by introducing the policy of subsidies, there was a second Budget.</P>
    <P>Under that second Budget, expenditure on supply services rose to £58,000,000.  Did the Deputies opposite not make that the main plank of their election platforms?  Did they not argue against Fianna Fáil on the ground that taxation at that level was more than the country could bear&mdash;that expenditure on that scale was beyond our means?  Was an assurance not given by the present Minister for Finance that expenditure would be reduced below £58,000,000, even to the extent of £10,000,000?  Very well.  He came here himself, as Minister for Finance, in 1948 with a Book of Estimates which he repudiated.  He told the House &mdash; and Deputies here remember what he said &mdash; that these Estimates had been prepared by his predecessors; that he had no responsibility for them and that his sole concern was to examine them to see how they could be reduced.  They amounted to £65,000,000.  &ldquo;Prodigious&rdquo;, &ldquo;prodigal&rdquo;, &ldquo;extravagant&rdquo;&mdash;these were the three adjectives the Minister used to describe expenditure on that scale.  Does any Deputy remember the typical McGilliganesque use of these terms?  He said that it was preposterous that he, as Minister for Finance, should be asked to inflict upon the country the burdens involved in an expenditure upon public services amounting to £65,000,000.  He would reduce them by £6,000,000 in a year. Did he?  He came back in 1949 with Estimates for the public services amounting to £70,000,000.  He did not, it is true, completely forswear the policy of economy then.  He still paid lip service to it.  He again professed to be engaged in seeking possibilities of savings.  He comes back this year with Estimates totalling £78,000,000 &mdash; and the policy of economy completely in the discard.  He is now glorying in the expanded expenditure of the Government and advancing as a policy <Col N="1797" /> what previously he represented as a catastrophe.</P>
    <P>And why have we got to handle this problem?  It is because his failure is disastrous to the whole economic future of the country; because he and his colleagues lack the moral courage to go to the Dáil or the people and say: &ldquo;Yes, we failed to check expenditure&rdquo; or &ldquo;We decided our policy was wrong and that the right policy was to increase expenditure, to provide new services.  You cannot get higher expenditure on new services unless you pay for them and we think it is desirable you should have them and should pay for them.&rdquo;  That is the course we took &mdash; I grant you that it was not popular &mdash; when we went to the country in 1947 and said: &ldquo;We think food prices should be subsidised and that the cost of living should be stabilised at its then level.&rdquo;  We said that in order to do it, we wanted more money and that we proposed, therefore, increasing the tax on beer and tobacco.  We understood fully that we were giving a stick to our political opponents but we thought it was the right policy and we were prepared to take the consequences of it.</P>
    <P>The idea that you can lead people to believe you can get something for nothing will bring the whole country into the bog of bankruptcy &mdash; the Minister for Finance will remember that phrase.  This Government has not reduced taxation.  The rates of tax upon beer and tobacco were reduced &mdash; that is true &mdash; but the yield of taxation is increasing.  I grant the Minister all the satisfaction which he is entitled to feel because he came into office when the country was emerging from wartime to normal conditions; when supplies were improving; when trade was reviving.  Taxation at the old rates began to bring in more money.  The petrol tax yielded only half the amount it is yielding now but then there was only half the amount of petrol available. Revenue from customs duty has expanded by £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 because there are more goods upon which duty can be charged.</P>
    <P>Income-tax is yielding more because there has been a devaluation of money and wages are, therefore, rising and <Col N="1798" /> workers are now paying income-tax who never paid it before.  Because of the expansion of the yield of revenue, the Minister got in last year, or expects to get in this year, £9,000,000 over and above the amount collected in 1947 even though the rates on taxes in force have not been increased.  But this increase in expenditure has not ended.  The reason the Minister decided on this policy of borrowing for a Budget deficit in this year is because he knows that the problem he will have to face next year will considerably eclipse this year's problem. Can we get an assurance from the Minister that the rise in expenditure will stop?  We will get no such assurance, I am certain.  He has taken off the controls.  He has said to his colleagues: &ldquo;I am not going to fall out with you just because you want to spend money.  The more money you spend the more I shall have to borrow, but, so long as there is any money left in the country to borrow, go ahead&rdquo;. He knows that next year the rise in expenditure will be greater still.  The reason why he has adopted this new financial departure now is because he thinks it could be easier to convince the country that it is a new policy on this occasion than it would be next year, when his failure to fulfil his preelection pledges and post-election undertakings to economise will be more glaringly obvious.</P>

      <P>The last point made by Deputy Lemass was that this policy <Col N="1800" /> was being supported because it was politically popular.  I would like to point out to the Deputy that, in so far as some of us on this side of the House are concerned, this is not a new policy.  It is a policy which we advocated, not because we believed it was popular, but because we believed it was the right one, and we supported that policy before we ever came into this House.  It is not a new policy so far as the Clann na Poblachta Party are concerned.</P>
      <P>I feel a certain amount of sympathy with Deputy Lemass and other Deputies opposite.  Deputy Lemass quite obviously finds himself in a rather difficult position.  He expected that after two years of inter-Party Government, with Deputy McGilligan as Minister for Finance, he would be able, to put it colloquially, to go to town on Deputy McGilligan.  Deputy McGilligan, as Minister for Finance, is the man about whom the most horrifying warnings and admonitions were addressed by Deputy Lemass to those of us who sit on this side of the House. In 1948 Deputy Lemass, more in sorrow than in anger, shook an admonitory finger at us in Clann na Poblachta and warned us of the terrible character who is now Minister for Finance, the man with the mania for retrenchment, the man who made a fetish of economy for economy's sake.</P>
    </Speaker>

That was the picture painted for us by Deputy Lemass in 1948.  I have the most complete sympathy with the Deputy in now having to come to the House, make a complete about face and attack Deputy McGilligan, Minister for Finance, for a policy which, according to Deputy Lemass, lacks that caution and conservatism which he has now <Col N="1801" /> elevated into the position almost of a deity.</P>
      <P>Yesterday Deputy Aiken described the Budget as a rake's progress.  We on these benches welcome it as progress. We believe the ideas enshrined in the new departure in our budgetary system are progressive ideas suited to our particular situation.  I would like to ascertain from Deputies opposite, if I may, just what their attitude is.  I listened with attention to Deputy Lemass and Deputy Aiken and I am still not quite clear as to what the Opposition attitude is.  Are we to take it that they desire the cutting down of the recently increased expenditure on old age pensions?  Are we to take it that they are opposed to the land rehabilitation scheme and the expenditure which it is proposed to make under it?  Do they think that it is proposed to spend an undue amount on afforestation?  Are they apprehensive that the Government's hospitalisation policy is being too rapidly and too vigorously pursued?  Are they worried that the Government, which they warned the people was opposed to the development of our turf resources, is now going ahead too boldly with plans for further turf development?</P>
      <P>These are questions we are entitled to put to Deputy Lemass and his colleagues. These are questions which, even if we did not put them, the people of the country would.</P>

      <P>The case appears to be made that capital development which cannot be undertaken out of current expenditure can never be undertaken at all.  Deputy Lemass did qualify that and say there was a certain percentage of proposed capital development which he thought could properly be financed by borrowing.  He did, by implication, suggest that there was another portion which could not and should not be financed by borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our approach to this matter is that this country is under-developed.  It suffered in the past from under-investment. <Col N="1803" /> As a result of that, we have had men and money both leaving the country.  In the very nature of things, we are making up a time lag.  We are forced into the position that we must do in two or three years that which, had our history been a normal one, would have been achieved by a process of evolution over a period of 50 years. We have heard all the fears and all the phobias and all the apprehensions aired here to-day.  Consider for a moment what the position would be if we now had a state of emergency such as existed between 1939 and 1946. Would not this Dáil willingly agree to the raising of money by any normal method in order to defend the neutrality of our country?</P>
    <P>In so far as Clann na Poblachta is concerned there is a state of persistent war, a war which must be waged against poverty, against unemployment, and against emigration.  If the pundits of orthodox financial methods, the conservative spokesmen of the old order and the old idea say: &ldquo;You cannot adopt these methods even to combat unemployment, emigration or poverty; they are unorthodox,&rdquo; then I am perfectly prepared to retort: &ldquo;Orthodoxy be damned; let us do our job in so far as we can at any rate to eradicate these evils from our midst.&rdquo; Those of us who remember the Party opposite in its earlier days when some of us had considerable faith in it never thought that we would see the day when Deputy Seán Lemass would be the evangelist of financial orthodoxy, much less that we would see him worried at the spectacle of Deputy McGilligan, as Minister for Finance, adopting a line of action too revolutionary for Deputy Seán Lemass.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass was quite obviously trying to persuade the House and the people that there was some real objection to the proposals put forward here.  I suggest to him that in his heart of hearts he knows there is only one thing wrong with the proposals, that is, that their successful implementation will mean the end of <Col N="1804" /> Fianna Fáil as a Party.  Deputy Lemass was sitting behind his busted flush trying to do as well as he could in the circumstances, but in this particular instance we on this side of the House are holding four aces.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass spoke in a gloomy, pessimistic strain of what was in store for the country as a result of the Government's decision to adopt the double-budgetary system.  He seems to forget that as recently as on the occasion of the Vote on Account, when some of us referred to this as a rather new and startling departure but one which we welcomed, we were told that there was nothing new about this, that it had been done for years and that we were talking through our hats.  We were told that by the Deputies sitting behind Deputy Lemass.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass appears to forget that in the summer of 1947 he indulged in gloomy prognostications when he made his famous austerity speech. I will refer the Deputy to the exact date later.  He overlooks the fact that his gloomy prognostications then came to nothing.  Admittedly, the Deputy's forecast then may have been based on the fact that the Deputy was of the opinion that he would continue in office and his calculations may have been upset because of the fact that there was a change of Government.  In so far as the majority of the people are concerned, if they were now asked to judge on the question as to whether his forecast in the summer of 1947 was inaccurate, they would be quite satisfied to say that it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point was made that expenditure has increased.  Great play was made on that by Deputy Lemass.  Expenditure has increased.  The point Deputy Lemass overlooks is that taxation has not increased.  Due to the policy pursued by the Government, the country is more prosperous, the national income <Col N="1805" /> is rising, the amount of money upon which the Government can call has increased.  Deputy Lemass overlooks all these things.  I put it to him while he was speaking that the country is now in a position to pay for better government.  I will make him a present of the fact that it is not cheaper government. It is better government.  It is not cut-price government.</P>
    <P>The suggestion was made that the Minister was borrowing merely to pay for a deficit in the supply services.  I may be obtuse and I may be stupid, but I certainly could not understand from the Deputy one intelligent argument in support of that assertion. There is no attempt to cloak the items upon which it is proposed to make this capital expenditure.  The only concrete criticism made by the Deputy on any item was that directed to the £1.7 million for housing grants. He referred to that as an expenditure which would go on from year to year. He overlooked, in the first place, that that is an expenditure not merely to subsidise rent or to subsidise prices; it is an expenditure necessary to give people an incentive to build their own houses.  In so far as the point which he made that this is an expenditure which will recur from year to year is concerned, if he gives that even a minute's consideration he will know it is not so because, while there will be the normal replacement necessary, you will not have the amount of building which we have at the moment.</P>
    <P>One thing for which the Minister, I think, should be commended was his acceptance of the principle that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;it is the primary responsibility of the Government to promote the continued and efficient use of the national resources in men and materials.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I commend the statement also in which he went on to say that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the State is expected not only to maintain the essential liberties of its citizens but to take an active part in securing conditions favourable to their material well-being ... to ensure that there is adequate capital investment to develop the national <Col N="1806" /> economy and to provide ample opportunities for productive employment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mind you, these are very significant statements coming from the Minister for Finance about whom we were warned by Deputies opposite that we would have to beware of him, that we would have to look out for him when he went round with his axe or his tomahawk &mdash; I am not quite sure which &mdash; looking for projects dear to our hearts and to our policy, for the purpose of lopping them off, cutting them down and dispensing with them altogether.</P>

Let me say that I think it is a pity from the point of view of the country that the suggestion made by the Leader of Clann na Poblachta, when this Dáil first assembled, that an all-Party Goverment be set up, was not accepted by <Col N="1807" /> Fianna Fáil, but they made their bed and now they can lie on it.</P>

      <P>Deputy de Valera's interjection reminds me of a comment which I think I am entitled to make. I was amazed at the doleful approach of Deputy Lemass to this Budget from the point of view of his own Party, because the concluding note upon which Deputy Lemass sat down was that this was a dishonest Budget, but that it was a politically popular one. I think I dealt with that suggestion at the outset.  We do not support a Budget because it is politically popular. We advocated the double budgetary system before Clann na Poblachta ever had a representative in Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>There are one or two minor matters upon which I should like to compliment the Minister, one in regard to which I attempted on several occasions to exert pressure upon him.  That is in reference to the question of authors' royalties and their liability to United States tax in respect of sales in that country.  I understand from the Minister's statement yesterday that as soon as the convention is ratified by the United States Government these royalties will be no longer liable to double taxation.  Am I right in that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>At least the anomalous position which existed has now been remedied.  The Minister in the course of his statement referred to the fact that he did not like the idea of discriminatory taxes.  I am very glad that the Minister was not in a position to follow his inclination because he would have to meet a lot of very severe criticism, from Clann na Poblachta at any rate, if he had attempted to reduce the 25 per cent. tax.  It is essential that that should be retained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred also to the proposal <Col N="1808" /> to make additional grants to university institutions.  In that connection I should like to make one comment to the Minister and to underline it as strongly as possible.  If the Minister proposes to make any additional grants to University College, Dublin, I, for one, will oppose them until such time as they alter their policy with regard to the question of Irish for the entrance scholarship examination.  They are out of step with the nation.  They are pursuing a policy hostile to the language.  I merely mention it inasmuch as the Minister referred to it in the course of his speech.  I mention it now as one matter upon which I shall be opposed to him unless the university authorities reconsider their decision with regard to an Irish version of the papers for the entrance scholarship examination.</P>
    <P>A budget should be an indication of the economic and social policy of the Government.  I think it is safe to say that this Budget complies with that obligation.  It discloses an economic and social policy whereunder the care of those sections of the community least well able to take care of themselves is a primary consideration of the Government.  It discloses a policy of developing and making productive our national resources.  It discloses a policy of belief in the future of this nation, belief in the future of the Irish people.  For that reason I compliment the Minister on his statement and I shall support the Resolutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always interested in listening to Deputy Lehane speak on all the matters debated in this House. I am interested because I take it that when he leads off for Clann na Poblachta, he is to a certain extent acting as the spokesman of their policy at the moment, whatever it may be.  I have a clear recollection of the full comprehensive policy of Clann na Poblachta, as announced before they came in here as a Party, with specific reference to certain matters under discussion to-day.  Deputy Lehane, in concluding, paid a tribute and compliments to the Minister for what he considered the active manner in which the development of our national <Col N="1809" /> resources was going to take place, as exemplified by the Budget.</P>
      <P>One of the items to which the Clann na Poblachta Party, and Deputy Lehane in particular, has a very strong commitment is reafforestation.  From the Budget statement, and from the Forestry Estimate which is still before the House, it is quite clear that afforestation, as envisaged and announced by Clann na Poblachta &mdash; they committed themselves to putting it into effect&mdash; is only a pipe dream that will never be realised, even to the extent of 1 per cent. of what Clann na Poblachta promised.  Does Deputy Lehane remember that, under his reafforestation scheme, we would not only have sufficient timber to meet the demands of our own country, but would actually have a sufficiency of timber over to enable us to make all the industrial alcohol that we wanted to propel our motor cars?</P>

      <P>Do you not remember saying that from the surplus timber available we would be able to get sufficient industrial alcohol for the running of many industrial projects?  We are now down to 25,000 acres a year for reafforestation.  That is the aim as regards the acquisition of land, and the money provision in the Budget and in the Estimate is measured to that acreage.</P>

      <P>They were going to acquire millions of acres for this purpose, but we are down now to a target of 25,000 acres, with the proviso &ldquo;if it ever can be reached.&rdquo;  When the Minister introduced the Budget yesterday, I came to the conclusion that it was, to a great extent, becoming a waste of time of the House to have a Budget introduced at all.  We have reached the <Col N="1810" /> stage now where the Government has concluded that taxation, in their opinion, from the point of view of direct taxation and possibly indirect taxation, had reached the maximum which they would care to impose on the people, while expenditure has gone far in excess of what they promised it would ever reach, and since it would be impossible, without complete disruption, to get a balanced Budget to meet this excess of increased expenditure, the present attitude is: &ldquo;Leave taxation as it is; whatever we are short let us borrow it.&rdquo;  In this year the total commitments to be met by borrowing reach over £31,000,000.  In other words, it is a confession that Government expenditure has now gone beyond the capacity of the taxpayer to meet by direct or indirect taxation. That is what the present Budget conveys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard and read in the Budget statement &mdash; I cannot understand what is at the back of it &mdash; that the Minister to encourage and increase consumption of tobacco was leaving the tax on tobacco as it is, but was removing the imperial preference in order to direct the consumption of tobacco to American tobacco.  I wonder is that not just a device to ensure that some or more of the Marshall Aid money will be used up and brought into our Counterpart Fund for the purpose of using it as an extra amount to be borrowed from the Marshall Aid fund.  I cannot understand why there should be any change in that or why it should be suggested that there was a hope that increased consumption of tobacco would help the particular device that is being adopted. It clearly shows to me that the position is this: that the present Government want every penny of that Marshall Aid money used up.  We all know that the only way it can be used up is by spending it in the States on goods or commodities of whatever kind they may be, though we were led to believe that Marshall Aid would be used almost exclusively for the purpose of bringing machinery and other items into this country to improve our productive capacity, and so help us to contribute to the delivery of additional supplies to European countries in those <Col N="1811" /> commodities which we might be able to export.</P>
    <P>But now there is a change in Europe and there will be less need there for certain of our commodities, as shown by the drop in prices.  The immediate concern would appear to be to make sure that goods will be purchased in America, irrespective of what purpose they are going to be used for, so long as the money is spent and the equivalent in sterling is put into the Counterpart Fund.  The result of that will be that when the Minister needs an additional £5,000,000 he will be able to issue a State loan and take out that money.  Now, in addition to the goods purchased by Marshall Aid, a great number of them will be taxable on arrival here and so that will help to keep the revenue buoyant, as it is called.  That may have practical results from the point of view of the Exchequer in the present year, but we have to remember that Marshall Aid ends in 1952.  What are we to do then? The year 1952 is not so far away.  I have heard some Deputies in cross-talk in the House saying: &ldquo;What do we care if there is a burden on posterity&rdquo;?  But 1952 will be here in our time and there will be a very drastic change in the repercussions on our economy when Marshall Aid ceases, apart from the fact that the repayment of Marshall Aid money will then become due.</P>
    <P>It also appears to me rather a strange form of economy which we are developing in connection with the purchase of feeding-stuffs, such as maize, in large consignments to feed our live stock and, as has been announced, to walk the live stock off the land for export for sterling.  I tried to examine the minds of the people responsible for the framing of this Budget.  I wonder whether there may not be at the back of the mind of the Minister for Finance the idea that we are going to have another devaluation of sterling. In that event, the amount we will owe will assume a different aspect.  If we are faced with another devaluation or a series of devaluations, the amount we borrow now will have to be repaid in the form of the currency which will succeed the present currency.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1812" /> Deputy Lemass has tried to draw attention to the attitude of the members of the Government Parties when discussing Fianna Fáil Budgets.  Our expenditure, large then, according to them, was said to be a vice.  Now they are spending far more millions than we ever anticipated spending and they are trying to suggest that what was with us a vice is now with them a virtue, and, because it is a virtue, it should be indulged in to an extravagant extent.  Fianna Fáil had a definite policy in its approach to State finance. Fianna Fáil recognised that after the emergency there would be certain disturbing factors outside, over the repercussions of which here we could have little or no control.  Therefore, we devised the food subsidies and we coupled with the food subsidies what was very much objected to by Labour, a standstill Order with regard to wages.  The object was to see that the vast majority of our people who would be affected by lack of control or particular actions of the Government would not suffer in their ordinary lives.  The idea was to protect them against increases in the cost of living and to take steps to see that, as far as the internal situation was concerned, our own acts would not contribute towards an increase in the cost of living.  It was reduced down to the simple formula of keeping essential foodstuffs pegged at a certain maximum price and making sure that there was a fair and even distribution of them.  One of the main planks in the platform of all the Parties in opposition to Fianna Fáil was a cry against the rise in the cost of living and a demand for a reduction.  Clann na Poblachta, not one of whom is in the House at the moment, promised a 30 per cent. reduction in the cost of living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. The Deputy has just come into the House and did not hear me refer to the standstill Order on wages.  Wages are increasing in order to catch up with the increase in the cost of living.  There will be a spiral of wage increases, as is evidenced by the demands now going round which will follow one after the other, at the specified amounts of 11/- and 11/- and 11/-.  Wages will increase, but the increase in wages will not bring back to the people the standard of living we would like them to have. Wages only mean something when they can regulate a standard of living.  The cost of living has begun to spiral.</P>
      <P>The Government are making savings on the subsidies.  The arrangement made in the last two years to remove the subsidy from certain types of food, a matter to which I referred on the Vote on Account, is not having a very welcome reception from the public.  Persons using subsidised flour have to use grey flour. Persons who want white flour have to pay an unsubsidised price for it.  But the person who is below a certain level has no choice.  He gets a certain amount of grey bread and grey flour at the subsidy price.  The whole idea is to reduce the State contribution towards subsidies which is further aggravating the situation in connection with the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1814" /> I do not know to what extent controls will be reintroduced.  In the last few days the Minister for Agriculture indicated that he was aware of the price of potatoes in Dublin at this time of the year.  I do not know to what extent he will be able to control that and bring potatoes back to the normal price.  There may be a reason for the increased price which will be explained, but so far as the public are concerned the answer will be: &ldquo;We are now paying 3/- a stone for potatoes.&rdquo;  It is no help to them to be told about the future benefits which will accrue as a result of this excess expenditure of the Government and the increased borrowing.  Deputy Lemass pointed out a very important item.  Every year, at the rate we are going, we are clapping on to the backs of the people an increased charge of approximately over £1,000,000 to meet the service of State debt by way of interest and reduction of the State debt itself.  Ultimately, our liability by way of interest will far outweigh, in the matter of hardship in the shape of taxation, any benefits that will accrue from an unwise and imprudent approach to State financing.</P>
    <P>The Minister &mdash; and I hear support for it from his benches &mdash; has decided that he is going to regard some of the State contributions, hitherto regarded as a liability to taxation for the purpose of subsidising houses, as a capital expenditure.  I do not think that is wise.  While it should be our aim to build in the cities and towns of our country all the houses our people need as fast as possible, at as economic a price as possible and with as great an amount of subsidy as possible, I do not think it is wise to set the headline that the subsidy is to be regarded as a capital expenditure, and to be met by borrowings.  The subsidy in connection with housing is not solely a State matter.  Local authorities subsidise housing out of the rates.  If we are to take this as a headline as to the proper way to deal with it, then the City of Dublin should in the future remove from the rates the charge that is on the rates by way of the contributions the rates give to the subsidisation of artisans' dwellings and borrow a sum of money for it and put the <Col N="1815" /> repayment of those moneys on the future ratepayers.  Is that a wise thing to do?  Would it not be a wrong thing to do?  Yet that is what is being done here.  To the extent that a change has been made from what was done in the past, to that extent the Minister is not doing a wise thing. The more houses of that type we build the greater the liability to be met in the future.  At a certain period of time the local authorities, combined together, will be the landlords of a very considerable number of houses. If we approach this matter lightly, if we are going to regard this provision of houses entirely as a capital expenditure, we might ultimately be faced with a demand to regard them as such for all time, and it would be reflected by the occupants in their liabilities to the local authorities for the use of the houses.  I shall not go any further than that.  The first year the Minister for Finance took office, as Deputy Lemass says, he walked into this House with the Book of Estimates in his hand and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am not responsible for this child.  It is an illegitimate as far as I am concerned, but I will do the best I can for it and with it&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and he proceeded to destroy certain belongings of the child.  He slashed out of existence Aer Línte.  I should not be surprised to learn that most of the Deputies who constitute the Government Parties regretted that event, and would probably be better pleased if Aer Línte were in existence to-day, giving all the employment which it would give and bringing all the prestige it would bring to the country.</P>

      <P>We do want houses.  I say, however, that where the present Government estimates that so much of our national income is due to tourist traffic, then anything related to tourist traffic should be nursed and kept healthy &mdash; and one of the mainsprings of tourist traffic in this country, as <Col N="1816" /> modern life is developing, is air transport. If we had our own air transport system not only would we have additional employment in this country, not only would we be able to compete with the rest of the world in the flying of these craft but we would also have an income in respect of bringing passengers who constitute our tourist visitors to this country &mdash; an income not only in sterling but also in hard currency.  I believe that very many members of the Government group realise to-day that it was an unwise act&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We are not talking to-day any more in respect of State investments in State-sponsored or State-controlled schemes that will be reproductive in returning to the State not only the money but also the interest on the capital invested.  We are now accepting in this House the investment of borrowed money by the State that need not necessarily be reproductive or need not even be repaid.  If we compare that with the attitude of mind when Aer Línte was put out of existence, we see a complete change.  I believe, and I believe Deputy Rooney would be the first to agree, that if we were to re-establish Aer Línte he would be very happy about it.</P>

      <P>In the first year of the administration of the inter-Party Government a realisation of assets took place.  The Constellations were sold. They were purchased in dollars but they were sold for sterling.  A great amount of tourist board property in the shape of hotels was realised.  Only recently, the Minister announced in the Seanad that we are going to change our coinage.  We are going to call in all the silver coinage and replace it by nickel.

The expression was used that when the inter-Party Government took office they took over an Exchequer and national assets after the very bottom-scrapings of the barrel had been taken out.  It is a strange thing that, into this empty barrel, the barrel which had been scraped out to the very last, the Minister can now put his arms and bring out State expenditure and State borrowing <Col N="1818" /> up to £107,000,000 this year, and there is no suggestion that this is the final bit that is in the barrel, but that there will be a lot more poured out of it in succeeding years on this new basis of finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the fledgling has gone back to his original roost.  I thought the Deputy had left that roost and was sitting on another bench.  I think the inter-Party Government is really misleading and fooling itself if it thinks the public do not understand what is happening.  I noticed yesterday in the <i>Evening Herald</i> the big headline &ldquo;£2,000,000 a week Government Expenditure&rdquo; and under that an article which suggested that the whole of Ireland was so interested in this Budget that the gallery was packed out and Leinster House was a place of bustle and hustle.  Everybody here knows that the gallery was never before so empty as it was yesterday. Not one of us had to go to a colleague to beg a ticket for the gallery; there were tickets available galore yesterday.</P>
      <P>In other years the gallery was packed for the Budget because the people were interested.  Yesterday the people were not interested for the simple reason, as Deputy Lemass said, that they had been made aware in advance of what was going to happen. They knew there was going to be no change in taxation and that whatever was short would be borrowed.  But there is apprehension in the minds of taxpayers as to how soon they will be called upon to pay increased taxation to meet the cost of borrowing and the repayment.  If you approach national expenditure from the point of view that you have to collect what is non-reproductive in the shape of expenditure, or where something has become normal in expenditure, then you are very careful that you will not go beyond what is reasonable and possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People are interested in seeing to what extent extensions in social services are going to take place, what benefits will go to people below a certain amount, and to what extent the <Col N="1819" /> people who have will contribute to the have-nots.  People are disillusioned and disturbed because the cost of government in the matter of administration has not gone down, but has gone up considerably.  We remember the surplus number of civil servants who were going to be cleared out.  In yesterday's Budget there was a statement that not much has been accomplished in that respect, but there are efficiency experts going around trying to spot who is in the service doing nothing and trying to get rid of those people or else find something for them to do.</P>
    <P>The net Government expenditure has gone up instead of down.  The Civil Service has not gone down.  It will continue to go up, and the man who has to pay for it all realises that if we are to carry on government as we understand it to-day he will have to pay the piper some time and he recognises that that might be fairly soon.  I suggest it will not be a matter for posterity.  I say this matter will have to be re examined as soon as possible after 1952, when Marshall Aid will disappear and when we have to paddle our own canoe out of our own resources.</P>
    <P>As regards land reclamation, I agree it is a good thing to spend money trying to reclaim and put into production land which is not now producing &mdash; that is, if it can be done.  I do not agree that we should exaggerate the possibilities of doing so and the results that may be achieved.  At the moment one of our difficulties is that surplus agricultural commodities which we have for export are not being sold at an economic price.  We cannot get from our customers what we would regard as an economic price.  If we are going to increase production of the very articles which we have to sell uneconomically, are we not conversely going to do something which will cost somebody something ultimately?  We cannot have it both ways.  We cannot indicate to possible customers that we want an economic price which is higher than they are offering, and at the same time tell them we are going to double our production of the same article, notwithstanding the uneconomic <Col N="1820" /> price.  If we do that they will come to the conclusion that what we call an uneconomic price is, in fact, an economic price and they will offer us less.  That is an ordinary, simple approach to the situation as I see it.</P>
    <P>In connection with land reclamation, there is talk about £40,000,000 being spent.  There is no time limit put to the spending of the £40,000,000.  It might be ten or 20 years ahead.  There was a suggestion that it would be done in ten years.  Land reclamation is to be done in a variety of ways.  Individuals are to contribute towards the improvement of their land in this way. Some of them to-day are finding out that it is not making their land more valuable, and that it will not be worth the cost in the sense that such land can be purchased in the open market. I move to report progress.</P>

    <P>To delete sub-section (1), lines 27 and 28, and substitute:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  As soon as the next actuarial valuation of the society has been completed, Section 2 of the National Health Insurance Act, 1942 (No. 5 of 1942), will cease to have effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I wanted to put to the Minister last night was a very simple one.  I think he exaggerated the difficulties in regard to the making of an actuarial valuation.  The situation is now very different from what it was in 1943.  That year, as the Minister is aware, was the height of the war period, when every British Government Department was engaged upon the war effort.  For the purpose of having an actuarial valuation made as on the 31st December, 1943, it was necessary for us to have recourse to the British Actuary, as our predecessors had to have recourse before us in relation to the actuarial valuations <Col N="1821" /> which they made from time to time.  In addition to that, every branch of our own administration was overburdened with the task of dealing with the particular problems thrown up by the war.  Because of that it was difficult to procure the data necessary to enable an actuarial valuation to be made.</P>
      <P>The position has changed completely since then.  It has changed fundamentally. The Minister now has at his disposal in his own Department a qualified actuary; he was formerly an officer of the Department of Finance who, in his own time, qualified as an actuary, and was subsequently released for training in the Office of the British Actuary with a view to making his services available to the Government for the particular purpose provided in the Act of 1942.  I suggest it is not really fair to the House or to the public, who will eventually evaluate the proposals the Minister will submit to them for a comprehensive insurance scheme on the basis of the information the Minister will give them and which, in fact, he ought to be supplying to them now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said &mdash; and this touches the matter immediately &mdash; that the one thing that is lacking in the White Paper which the Minister has published dealing with social security is statistical data upon which an evaluation of that scheme can be made.  One of the essential elements in that scheme is the actuarial position of the National Health Insurance Society.  These essential facts the members of the Oireachtas and the general public should have before them when they are discussing and criticising the Minister's proposed social welfare scheme.  I can see no reason whatsoever for dispensing with the actuarial valuation.  On the contrary, I think it is more important than ever that we should have that information.  Why was it considered necessary to have the actuarial valuation made in respect of the National Health Insurance Society itself except to demonstrate the fundamental soundness of the scheme originally?  Does the Minister now take the view that it does not matter whether his scheme and his proposal are sound or unsound; he will steam-roll them through the <Col N="1822" /> Dáil with the support of those elements in the Coalition who are supposed to be business-men and who are supposed to look after the interests of the taxpayers of this country?  Is that why he wants to dispense with this?</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should reconsider the position and decide that an actuarial valuation will be made as at the 31st December, 1948.  That is a very convenient date.  It marks, so to speak, the close of one administrative period and the opening of another one. If the actuarial valuation discloses that the position of the society is not as sound as it ought to be, the Minister's predecessors &mdash; I am sure he will be glad to hear this &mdash; will have to carry the major share of the blame for that.  But we are not afraid of this investigation even if it shows us to have been bad administrators; we can be blamed and we are prepared to accept the blame. We want the people to know the truth and to have the facts.  I cannot see any reason whatsoever why this essential information should be withheld from them.  It is quite easy for the Minister to have that actuarial valuation made. It is essential that it should be made before he prepares a comprehensive social insurance scheme because the rates of contribution must inevitably be based upon the actuarial experience of the National Health Insurance Society.  If he does not have that experience properly expressed in actuarial terms, I fail to see how he can prepare any proposals worth the consideration of his colleague, the Minister for Finance.  For that reason, therefore, I would very strongly urge the Minister to accept this amendment to Section 19 and to delete sub-section (1) as proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why Deputy MacEntee is making such a fuss over this amendment.  I have explained the position to him.  If it were necessary to make this actuarial investigation or if it were of any value for the purposes of the comprehensive scheme I would unhesitatingly assent to the making of such a valuation.  But it will have no value whatever for the purposes of the comprehensive scheme because, in the first place, I hope the <Col N="1823" /> comprehensive scheme will be in operation long before any such actuarial valuation could be available.  Deputy MacEntee is not an actuary, but, of course, he probably knows more about the business than does the actuary himself and he could no doubt regulate the tempo at which actuaries work.  I am advised by those in a position to judge that it would take close on three years before such an actuarial examination would be completed.  The last actuarial valuation took three years.  I am informed by those in a position to judge that a similar examination now would take the same period, with the result that it will be a considerable time before any figures can be obtained as a result of a further actuarial examination.  Even making the greatest possible haste, there is no likelihood of figures being available until the end of next year or probably until the following year. What, therefore, is to be gained by making an examination?  One purpose perhaps might be to ascertain what is to be the position of the sum of money made available for additional benefits. We can look at that position as we see it to-day.  At the moment all the indications are that the funds of the society are now in as good if not a slightly better position as when the last valuation was carried out.  There is no reason, therefore, whatever to fear that moneys will not be available to finance the scheme of additional benefits.  That scheme of additional benefits is covered in any case by the moneys made available from the last valuation which runs until 1952 and the indications are that, even if you still want it to finance the additional benefits scheme in the way which now operates, you have the money there but the intention is that there will not be a separate allocation of moneys for the additional benefits scheme under the comprehensive scheme.  They will be made available but that will not depend upon the result of an actuarial valuation, even if an actuarial valuation would show that they were there.  The only difference between us on this matter is that you think fit to spend a considerable sum of money on an actuarial valuation <Col N="1824" /> which will not be available for examination in connection with the comprehensive scheme because it will not be completed by then and, even if it is available, it will have nothing whatever to do with financing the additional benefits scheme in future.</P>
      <P>Mention has been made of the fact that there is an actuary in my Department. I have not an actuary; the person indicated is not an actuary as such.  He is an officer of the Department with responsibility not for acturial work but for administrative work.  That is his function there.  Even if the actuarial examination were undertaken, it would take the period I have mentioned.  I put it, in all seriousness: is there anything to be gained in undergoing the expense of an actuarial examination when we do not need it for the purpose of the additional benefits scheme and when it will not be available in time for the comprehensive scheme?  If it will satisfy the Deputy I shall undertake to do this:&mdash;When we come to consider the comprehensive scheme I undertake to put at the disposal of any Deputy, by a question or at his request, any and every piece of information that I have as to the funds of the society at a particular date and then Deputies, if they like, can compare the general position with the position at the last valuation. I do not think it wise that this should be pressed to the stage of forcing me to undertake what in the long run seems to me to be a fruitless investigation and one which the officers of my Department in a position to judge say is not required for the purposes of the comprehensive scheme.  It is a matter of considering on which side wisdom lies.  I say it does not lie in the direction of pressing for an investigation which is really of no value.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I find it very difficult to understand the difficulties which the Minister is raising. Since I was relieved of the position of Minister for Social Welfare I have been engaged in a more remunerative and less onerous job, a job in which actuaries are usually employed, and I cannot see that an actuary would take anything like three years, or even three months, to carry out this <Col N="1825" /> actuarial examination.  In the position in which I am now, we have to employ actuaries from time to time; we know what we have to pay and I do not think it would take more than two or three months of an actuary's time to do this job.  I have an idea of how the particular individual to whom the Minister refers is paid.  I may say, in passing, that I do not think he is paid enough but, in any case, he is not paid a princely salary.  I refer to the actuary in the Department, and three months of his time is not going to cost a lot. I think the Minister is labouring this thing in an effort to give the impression to the Dáil that this is a very big problem.  We, in the Opposition, would feel better briefed if an actuarial valuation were carried out before the comprehensive scheme comes along.  I think this amendment is very reasonable, that we should have one more actuarial examination and then let it cease.  The actuarial valuation would be carried out on the 1948 figures.  I was always under the impression when I was Minister that the returns of the National Health Insurance Society are kept very much up to date.  They have various mechanical apparatus for entering up various auditors' returns.  They have had these mechanical appliances for a period and I imagine that they will have the different figures of the various age groups, occupational groups and, perhaps &mdash; I do not know if this is necessary &mdash; sickness experience. If these figures are available it should be a very easy matter for the actuary to give his report.  I am just making the point that I think the Minister is exaggerating the difficulties in the matter.  I do not think it would involve anything like a three years' wait.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have put in this amendment for the purpose of endeavouring to meet points <Col N="1827" /> of view that were expressed on the Second Stage of the Bill namely, that at present you have appeals to the Minister under the national health insurance code, and that it was desirable, therefore, that the method of appeal to the Minister who is administering national health insurance affairs should be discontinued. This amendment seeks to apply to national health insurance appeals the same appeals procedure as operates in the case of unemployment insurance disputes and Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts disputes.

He can virtually bring into the national health insurance code any provision in the Unemployment Insurance Acts, 1920 to 1948, or the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts, 1935 to 1948.  That may be a good thing.  It may be essential to make the change-over, but it is certainly a colossal acquisition of the power to legislate by Order which the Minister has so roundly condemned.

I would ask him to remember that the people who are concerned in securing that they will have some right of appeal to some independent authority are not the Deputies sitting on these benches but the 640,000 people who are members of the National Health Insurance Society who, as the Bill originally stood, were going to be placed in this extraordinary position that, whereas before they had the right of appeal to the Minister with an independent arbitrator <Col N="1828" /> between them and the committee of management of the society they are now &mdash; the committee of management and the society itself having been abolished &mdash; under the Minister's absolute control.  He has absolute control over them, over their funds and over their rights.  He can refuse to pay them benefit, and so they have no real ground of appeal.</P>
      <P>I am taking this amendment for the want of something better.  As far as the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts are concerned, the position there is very different from what it is under the national health insurance scheme. Under that Act you have a large number of pensioners who do not get their pensions as of right, so to speak, but by the grace of the Oireachtas, which votes the money to pay the non-contributory pensions.  There you have a situation where questions of means arise.  These questions are not investigated by the officers of the Minister for Social Welfare but by the officers of the Minister for Finance, and it is the Minister for Finance who indirectly, through the Revenue Commissioners, administers the non-contributory pension scheme.</P>

      <P>What I say was the position until the year 1947 when the investigation officers, who were previously officers of the Revenue Commissioners and indirectly of the Minister for Finance, were transferred to the Department of Social Welfare. Time did not permit what, I believe, would have been necessary and essential changes to preserve the rights of those people to have an independent appeal.  That was one of the consequences of the transfer of these services from the Department of Industry and Commerce and from the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners under whom they were previously administered.  We had not time to rectify that before we were put out of office.  The Minister has had time. He has been over two years in office, and I gather he has not yet restored to the people concerned rights which they had previously enjoyed.</P>
      <P>Now, the whole gravamen of my case against the Minister for the manner in which he has brought in this Bill is that, in addition to depriving old age pensioners and claimants under the non-contributory scheme of widows' and orphans' pensions of the right of appeal, he is now doing the same in relation to the 640,000 people who are members of the National Health Insurance Society.  That is the position, and the Minister cannot deny it.  Where I was at fault was in not fully adverting to the change which had taken place since 1947, but that does not affect the argument and it does not affect the position.  The position remains as I have said, that there is now no independent right of appeal.  The Minister himself, I think, has become ashamed of the situation which he created and is now endeavouring to remedy it.  That is a concession to the critics of this Bill to the extent that the Minister is now giving an added protection to the members of the National Health Insurance Society.  That is what we were out to secure.</P>

      <P>Most of what the Deputy stated is not worth dealing with.  It is evident that he does not know what he is talking about, as he displayed in such a manifest fashion during his contribution. I only rise for the purpose <Col N="1830" /> of making one comment.  The Deputy is worried about the appeals of old age pensioners.  Let him absorb those-figures. There are to-day 15,000 more persons getting old age pensions and at a much higher rate than when the Deputy was sitting on these benches. It is that fact which will keep the Deputy a tenant of the benches opposite for many a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Again the Minister cannot produce any relevant argument. That has nothing to do with the case. If there are 15,000 more old age pensioners it is because changes have been made in the law, not because of any change in the Administration.  I gather that the appeal officer is still there, that even now claimants for old age pensions find it necessary to appeal against decisions of old age pensions committees and that they go to the Minister for Social Welfare.  Therefore, the Minister cannot claim any credit for that.  After all, it is not he who is providing the money.  If there are 15,000 more people drawing old age pensions, it is not the Minister who is paying them; it is the taxpayers who provide him with the funds.  It is they have to pay them, and not the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rising to continue the objection that I made on every Bill in which a section of this type is introduced.  Sub-section (2) of this section gives the Minister power by Order to make &ldquo;in respect of any provision of or made under the Acts&rdquo;&mdash; that means the National Insurance Acts, 1911 to 1948 &mdash;&ldquo;such modifications and adaptations as appear to him to be necessary or expedient for giving effect to this Part of this Act&rdquo;.  In recent years that form of legislation has become quite common.  There was a time when, if an Act of Parliament had to be amended, it had to be amended by another Act of Parliament.  But this device has been introduced over a number of years to give Ministers power to make particular Orders modifying or adapting the provisions of these statutes.  I have said before, I say it now, and I suppose I shall have to say it often in future, that that form of legislation is objectionable.</P>
      <P>If an Act of Parliament has to be amended, it ought to be amended by Parliament and not by ministerial Order.  It is no defence to say that such an Order made by the Minister will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and that the Oireachtas may, if they wish, within 21 days after it has been tabled, pass a resolution annulling the Order.  That is really no protection because, unfortunately, very few people bother about Orders laid on the Table and, from the point of view of persons whose duty it is to interpret and read Acts of Parliament, there may be difficulty in finding out what an Act of Parliament does mean, because the wording of an Act is apparently not sufficient and one has to search the statutory Orders to see what modifications and adaptations the Minister has made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know who is the genius who invented this form of section.  When it was invented, I am quite sure that it was passed through Parliament, whether this Parliament or the British Parliament, by means of a Government majority.  I understand that objections have always been taken to it.  The Ministers of the present Government when such a provision was introduced into Bills by the last Government <Col N="1832" /> violently and quite properly opposed it.  In fact, it was through a pretty strenuous fight both in this House and in the Seanad that a sub-section such as sub-section (3) in regard to laying the Order on the Table of the House was accepted.  Where a Bill has passed through both Houses in the ordinary way and has received its First, Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth Readings, one would expect that any modification of it would go through the same procedure.  Where this method of laying an Order on the Table of the House is followed, it means that a member in this House or in the Seanad may put down a motion to annual and that motion will be decided by a simple majority of either House.  Unless some member is particularly vigilant, the 21 days may pass and there may be no opportunity of bringing the matter before either House for consideration.</P>
    <P>If I could see the necessity for this form of procedure, I might be convinced that there was something in it, but I see no necessity for it.  I have seen Ministers introduce such a provision as this and all they could say was that circumstances might arise in which it was necessary to make such a modification or adaptation.  But, at the time the section is put in, the Minister or the official in his Department, or the draftsman has no idea as to what, in fact, it may cover or what it may enable to be done.  Therefore, I think the section is objectionable and I rise now on this Bill to express my objection to it in principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained on the last occasion, what we are doing is a procedure which has already been adopted by this House in respect of other Acts.  I can see the objection anybody may make on principle in a matter of this kind.  This is the most expeditious way of dealing with a problem which this Bill throws up, namely, that of making sure that the intentions of this part of the Bill are properly implemented.  That can best be done, we think, by giving the Minister power to make any adaptations or modifications where necessary.  If that power were not there it would be necessary to go through a variety of Acts and regulations in a detailed way to amend them <Col N="1833" /> in a Bill of this kind, giving you a Bill which would be quite unintelligible and, at the same time, committing you to a line of policy of making amendments in case you would need them under this Bill.</P>
      <P>This is a simple procedure in as much as you make an amendment if you find it necessary to do so.  If it should not prove necessary you need not make the amendment because of the possibility that at some time it might be necessary to make it through the medium of a Bill.  I want to use the power only for the purpose of making quite sure that we can implement the provisions of the Bill which are being approved by this House.  Any regulations so made will be laid on the Table of the House and the Dáil will have an opportunity of annulling these regulations.  The House is familiar with that line of action.  I can assure the Deputy and the House that it will not be used in any unreasonable way and that it will be used only for the purpose of doing whatever is barely necessary under this Bill.  In any case, this Act will go its way before the end of next year.  It is merely a device to do speedily the things that have to be done under this Bill in order to implement the purpose for which the Bill was introduced.</P>

      <P>Before we part with this section I should like the Minister to disclose to the House the grounds for the statement he has just made to the effect that this Act will disappear before the end of next year.  That would not appear to be clear from some of the sections in which a date later than the end of next year is mentioned &mdash; for instance, 1954.  It is very interesting indeed to hear the Minister's statement in reply to Deputy Cowan and it will have a bearing, perhaps, on what we shall say later. Would the Minister indicate the grounds for his confidence that this Act will disappear by the end of next near?  I cannot see any prospect of the Act being implemented&mdash;certainly the Minister for Finance does not see any &mdash; by the end of next year.  In the discussion of the amendment which we have just disposed of the Minister said he hoped to put certain proposals before the House by the end of this <Col N="1834" /> year.  The Minister for Finance has made no provision for those proposals in his Budget.  I doubt whether he will be in a position to make them in his Budget for next year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose the principal discussion ought to take place on amendment No. 26.  Our view was that if amendment No. 26 were carried, amendments Nos. 20 and 25 would be accepted as consequential.  We have put down amendment No. 26 because, so far as I know, there is no enactment of the Oireachtas which contains a provision of this nature.  It is a provision which completely ousts the Minister from his normal position as constitutional guardian of the properties of the State.  It <Col N="1835" /> is rather significant that when the discussion is opened upon this matter the Minister for Finance finds it so embarrassing that he takes up his papers and flees from the House.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (7) of this particular section represents, to my mind, a complete overthrow of the Minister for Finance in his constitutional position. It is quite clear that there must have been a tremendous tussle going on in the Cabinet before this section was accepted.  I notice that the Minister is blushing and smiling the satisfied smile of the victor&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;at the fact that he has succeeded in defeating that great protagonist of financial rectitude, the present Minister for Finance.  I am not a lawyer but I have, in various capacities, studied proposals for legislation from time to time and I do not recollect&mdash;my recollection may be at fault; I am not putting it any further than that&mdash;any provision similar to this appearing in any statute that has been enacted since the State came into operation. There may be such provisions but, if so, they are very obscure and they must have been introduced where the exception occurs.  To the best of my ability I do not recollect that any Government ever had the hardihood to come before the Dáil with a proposal of this sort.</P>
      <P>Let us consider what the position of the Minister for Finance is under the law and under the Constitution.  The duties of the Minister for Finance will be found defined in the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924.  Paragraph (ii) of sub-section (1) of Section 1 of that Act contains the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Department of Finance which shall comprise the administration and business generally of the public finance of Saorstát Éireann and all powers, duties and functions connected with the same, including in particular the collection and expenditure of the revenues of Saorstát Éireann from whatever source arising <Col N="1836" /> (save as may be otherwise provided by law), and the supervision and control of all purchases made for or on behalf of and all supplies of commodities and goods held by any Department of State and the disposal thereof, and also the business, powers, duties and functions of the branches and offices of the public service specified in the first part of the Schedule to this Act, and of which Department the head shall be, and shall be styled an t-Aire Airgid or (in English) the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the Department of Finance, of which the Minister for Finance is in charge.  Let us go back on that section for a moment and see the responsibilities it imposes upon the Minister for Finance:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and control of all purchases made for or on behalf of and all supplies of commodities and goods held by any Department of State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is one sub-section to which we take objection and which we wish to delete from the section.  I may say that we have other objections to the section besides the provisions in sub-section (7).  Sub-section (7), against which these particular amendments are directed says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In dealing at any time before the 1st day of July, 1954, with any matter arising out of any acquisition, construction or reconstruction pursuant to sub-section (1) of this section or arising out of any disposal pursuant to sub-section (5) of this section, it shall not be obligatory on the Minister to refer to any other Minister or obtain the consent or sanction of any other Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) of this section, by implication, points out against whom sub-section (7) is directed, because it says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A payment shall not be made under sub-section (1) of this section on or after the 1st day of July, 1954, save with the consent of the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So that it is clear that sub-section (7) relates to the Minister for Finance <Col N="1837" /> who, in fact, is the only other Minister who would be concerned with the acquisition or disposal of property.</P>
    <P>What is the purpose of that?  Why should the Tánaiste, the Minister for Social Welfare, desire to place himself in any different position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Minister for Finance from any of his colleagues in the Cabinet?  Why does he wish to do that and, above all things, why has the Minister for Finance consented to be ousted in this matter?  And, if the Minister for Social Welfare succeeds in doing that, what is there to prevent the Minister for Education, the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Lands, the Minister for Justice, the Minister for External Affairs, who we know is a very generous spender, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and every other Minister in the Cabinet seeking to avail himself of the fundamental change in relationship which the Minister for Social Welfare has succeeded in making in the position of the Minister for Finance in the Government and saying: &ldquo;I should be put in the same position as my colleague the Minister for Social Welfare&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Can the Minister for Social Welfare answer that question?  If he gets away with this, what is to prevent other Ministers claiming that they are just as important in the Government as the Minister for Social Welfare?  They will be able to point to certain facts that will support their claim.  They will say that everybody knows that the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Local Government are members of the Cabinet and that the Tánaiste is in the Government because they can bring ten votes to the Coalition. That is their importance, and it is their sole importance in the Government. The Minister for External Affairs and the Minister for Health can say: &ldquo;The Clann na Poblachta Party is as good as the Labour Party any day, and, if a Labour Party Minister can get away with this in this Bill for social welfare, why cannot our Ministers get away with it?&rdquo;  The Minister for Lands will say: &ldquo;Well, I may not have ten votes, but I have six, and six votes are vital to the maintenance of <Col N="1838" /> the Government and I am entitled to be placed in exactly the same position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Minister for Finance as the Minister for Social Welfare is.&rdquo; Then we shall have the least and the littlest of them all, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, saying: &ldquo;It is quite true I have not six votes or ten votes, but I have five, and five are enough to put the Government in and if the Government does not hold those five votes the Government will fall.  I am just as important to the maintenance of this Coalition as the Minister for Social Welfare and, therefore, if the Minister for Social Welfare gets away with what is provided for in Section 21 of this Bill, I should get away with it also.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Are not these the natural and logical consequences which will follow if the House accepts sub-section (7) of this section?  And what, then, is going to be the position of the taxpayers?  The position of the Minister for Finance is different from that of other Ministers. Other Ministers are anxious to carry on, to extend the public services, to extend their Departments; they want to make themselves more and more important and to loom larger and larger in the public eye day after day. Therefore, they are always coming along with schemes that will keep them in the public eye, schemes that involve the expenditure of public money, and the only Minister who can stand against that sort of thing and who can protect the taxpayers is the Minister for Finance.  He is, from the point of view of the ordinary working-class people, the professional men and the business community generally, the most important man in the Cabinet.  He may not, perhaps, carry his proper weight in the councils of the Government.</P>
    <P>We had an example of that in the Budget introduced yesterday, but that is the fault of the man who holds the portfolio; it is not due to any defect in the original scheme of things, as the terms of the relevant section in the Ministers and Secretaries Act, which I have read out to the House, demonstrate beyond yea or nay.</P>

This is a very dangerous procedure.  It has not appeared in any other statute.  If it is carried, it will mean that we shall inevitably have other Ministers coming along here and making similar claims. I think it is a very ill-advised section to put in the Bill and I am surprised that the Minister for Finance has consented to it, unless he said: &ldquo;I want to wash my hands of this whole business; I am not in favour of using the national health insurance funds to buy Store Street; I am not in favour of taking over the funds of the society and utilising them in the way in which the Minister for Social Welfare proposes to utilise them; so far as I am concerned I will have nothing to do with it.&rdquo;  He may then have voluntarily stepped down and walked out, leaving the Minister for Social Welfare solely responsible for the things which will be done under Section 21.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee opened by drawing on his rather vivid imagination to depict the struggle in the Cabinet room between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Welfare over the provisions of this Bill.  He tried to warm himself with the belief that that was what really happened.  Then he finished by saying that was not what had happened at all; that what had happened was that the Minister for Finance did <Col N="1840" /> not agree with this business.  He said there was, in fact, no battle; there was no quarrel; the Minister for Finance washed his hands of the whole business and gladly quit.  Nothing exposes the duplicity of Deputy MacEntee more than the speech he has just made.  He starts off with one premise and finishes on another; both premises are equally false.</P>
      <P>This matter was approached in a reasonable and matter of fact way. This building in Store Street had been ordered by a bankrupt undertaking which could not pay for it; it had been ordered by a company that had in its safe at Kingsbridge cheques made out to people to whom they owed money but which they could not issue because there was no money to meet them.  This was the illustrious institution, Córas Iompair Éireann, which decided they would build Store Street; this dream fantasy clamped down in the busiest part of the city was ordered by Córas Iompair Éireann, when in fact they were not able to pay their day to day expenses.  Yet, they entered into a commitment of this nature.  Any street arab could have done the same because he would have had as much possibility of paying for it as had Córas Iompair Éireann. These people were apparently aided and abetted to do things in this millionaire fashion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Here was an institution, Córas Iompair Éireann, without a penny to its name, deciding to go in for a palatial bus depot in Store <Col N="1841" /> Street.  Every conceivable device was to be provided, all, apparently, costing money.  They entered into this knowing perfectly well that they were as poor as Lazarus and, when the time came to pay for it, they would not be able to pay for it.  That confidence trick can go on for a while but one cannot get away with it for ever.  Ultimately there came a day when they said: &ldquo;We cannot go on with this; we do not want it; we cannot pay for it; we cannot even issue the cheques that are written in the safe because there is no money in the bank to meet them.&rdquo; It was in those circumstances they shed Store Street.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>They should have borrowed, the same as the Government is doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <P>Your Government left these people in such a state of penury nobody would lend them a bob.  In those circumstances a streak of realism hit Córas Iompair Éireann.  They said they could not pay for it and they did not want it.  We then decided to buy it as a central headquarters which would enable us to shed the other offices throughout the city, thereby leaving them available either for other public purposes or for private dwellinghouses. I think it was preferable for us to do that rather than leave it there to be christened the &ldquo;Córas Iompair Éireann folly&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Fianna Fáil folly&rdquo;, or turn it into a rookery.</P>

It has to be equipped.  It has to be put in a condition to accommodate staff.  If the ordinary procedure were adopted, it would be necessary to approach the <Col N="1842" /> various Departments concerned for sanction every time a new piece of equipment was required.  The Government decided that the best thing to do in the circumstances was to take power to finish the job as quickly as possible so that it could be occupied by the departmental staff.  They wanted to avoid another Santry Court monument such as Deputy MacEntee erected when he was in the Custom House.</P>

      <P>We decided, therefore, to purchase the building and, in order that it might be completed as quickly as possible, the Government gave authority to bring it to fruition without the necessity for frequent consultations and endless sanctions and approvals which would be involved if the ordinary procedure were adopted. It is for that reason this section is included in the Bill.  We have to get it finished by that date.  I believe it will be finished before that but, at all events, that is the latest date; if it is not finished by that date we must go back to the ordinary procedure.  I am quite satisfied that our association with it will be finished in a capacity which will not involve consultation before that date but there is a safeguard in putting in the date.  Bear in mind, the funds which are being used for the purchase of these premises are funds under the control of the Minister for Social Welfare on behalf of the society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Thanks for that learned interruption.  In this particular instance what we are doing is what has already been done&mdash;purchasing a building which is required by this Department.  It is being purchased out of funds which are already invested in British securities.  Does Deputy Dr. Ryan deny that?  We are handing over funds which are invested in British securities.  If the Deputy will put down a question I shall furnish him with a list of these securities.  We are going to buy these premises out of the funds invested in British securities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>No objection to British money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Your Party put them there and one way in which I can get them back is to buy Irish property with them.  This building is going to be bought with moneys at the disposal of the Minister for Social Welfare, <Col N="1844" /> moneys invested, during the 16 years during which you were in office, in British securities.  Portion of these funds is going to be used to buy these premises and the State will make good an annual sum which will not be less than the interest which these invested funds now yield.  All that is being done in order to enable these buildings to be purchased and occupied as central offices for the accommodation of the Department of Social Welfare, the State at the same time and the public generally benefiting by the fact that the Department will have to vacate a number of other buildings.</P>
      <P>Now we come to the question of whether anything like it was done before.  It was done when the Hospitals' Trust Funds were passed into the Department of Local Government and were administered there solely by the Minister in charge of the Department without even any obligation after five years to consult any other member of the Government because the Minister for Local Government, bear in mind, during the entire period of office of the Fianna Fáil Government could write cheques every day for 16 years with the funds placed at his disposal from the Hospitals' Trust Funds and, in fact, did write cheques that way without the slightest restraint for 16 years. I hope that the Fianna Fáil members will not allow themselves to be taken in by the theatrical performances of Deputy MacEntee this evening because he wrote cheques himself as Minister for Local Government on these funds without any obligation to consult the Minister for Finance or the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take another example.  In the Department of Industry and Commerce during Deputy MacEntee's short sojourn there, there was an arrangement to establish a civil aviation branch, which was set up in that Department and which in fact entered into contracts to buy land, to build airports at Shannon and elsewhere without consulting the Board of Works, it having complete authority to go ahead and do that work.  That is what was happening when Deputy MacEntee was in the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Now he comes in here like an injured innocent <Col N="1845" /> to pretend that this is something which has outraged his feelings of financial rectitude and, the gladiator that he is, rushes into the arena saying that the whole edifice of the Irish nation will collapse because we are going to repatriate the moneys invested during the Fianna Fáil régime in British securities and use them to buy a building in Dublin, a building ordered by a spendthrift transport undertaking when it had no money to pay for it.  These are the cold facts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the cold facts of the situation.  The public can judge whether the course upon which we have embarked is a wise one.  I am quite satisfied that what we are proposing to do in this section represents a prudent course of action.  Bear in mind that under this section we purport to hand over to the Minister for Finance for investment on behalf of the fund all moneys which are not required for the purpose of purchasing these premises so that he may hold these funds in the same way as he holds other funds on behalf of the nation.  But the funds are at our disposal at the moment and they will be used for this purpose.  They are being used for a meritorious project. In all the circumstances, I think it is much better to invest these funds in a building in the City of Dublin than to have them invested for us in the development of some part of the British Empire.</P>

I have never heard such nonsense as the Minister spoke here to-night.  Take the last statement that was made.  Fianna Fáil did increase benefits under national health insurance out of taxation, but when the Minister became a Minister he increased the contributions. That is his record as far as national health insurance is concerned. I think he should acknowledge that.</P>
      <P>The Minister also told us that he is going to purchase the Córas Iompair Éireann premises.  He does not know what the price will be, but he is going to purchase them.  Did anybody ever hear of a purchaser making an announcement of that kind?  He announces in public that he is going to purchase the premises, but he does not know what the price will be.

      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare is the big man lecturing us, telling us all that he is going to do, but he does not want to consult the Minister for Finance.  He is going to purchase a bankrupt concern, whatever it will cost, and he will pay for it because he controls the money of the society.  That is what he said.  Of course he is not too well up on these things.  Deputy MacEntee caught him out badly yesterday&mdash;he tried to gloss over it to-day&mdash;when he pointed out that the Minister did not know the difference between the guarantee fund and the reserve fund.  The Minister is a big man.  He makes a good impression on people who do not know him.  He is a pleasant man, and he makes a good impression, but he does not know the difference between the reserve fund and the guarantee fund.  He tells us that he controls the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the memorandum sent out from his Department it says &ldquo;these sums now amount to a total of £2,359,457 and are invested in securities having a nominal value of £2,349,461 which, at the request of the society, are held by the Minister for Social Welfare on behalf of the society.&rdquo;  The Minister who is talking big tries to impress Deputy Davin.  He should have done that before now, but turning to Deputy Davin he said &ldquo;I control the funds&rdquo;. The memorandum was sent out by the Department, and we are to assume that <Col N="1848" /> it is correct.  But the Minister says &ldquo;I control the funds&rdquo;.  Well now that is about as near to the truth as the Minister has ever gone in his life.</P>
    <P>He comes in here and he talks this boloney, not only about the Córas Iompair Éireann premises and about this bankrupt concern but about what he is going to do, and without consulting the Minister for Finance or the Board of Works he is going to take over the premises.  He is going to manage everything.  He is requested by the members of the society to look after the funds on their behalf, but he tells us that he controls the funds. Now, I think the Minister should be a little better briefed before coming to the Dáil to discuss a matter of this kind.  This is a very serious matter, the investment of the funds of the members of the National Health Insurance Society who have been paying their contributions over very many years.  On that he should at least he able to give the Dáil the true facts and tell us who is in a position at the moment to control those funds, and what will the position be when this Bill is passed.  Will he tell us what is the position in regard to the purchase of premises for the new Department of Social Welfare, and who will be in a position to make a decision on that?  Information on all these matters is very necessary if the Dáil is to do its duty in a conscientious and reasonable way, and if it is to be in a position to advise the Minister as to the best solution for this problem. The Minister is not helpful to the Dáil because he is making statements here that are not true statements&mdash;they do not coincide with the facts.  Unless we are in a position to consult the Bill and the memorandum issued by the Department of Social Welfare and to compare these documents with the Minister's statements, we cannot find out whether the Minister has been strictly sticking to the truth or form our own conclusions of what the truth is.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I would be in order at this stage in raising the question as to whether it is a good thing that the Minister should be permitted to purchase the Córas Iompair <Col N="1849" /> Éireann premises.  Personally, I think it is a great pity that the Minister should be looking for premises in Dublin at all.  I raised this matter on the Second Reading because I think this is a Department which should be shifted down to Cork or Galway.  When I was Minister for Social Welfare I made certain moves in that direction. The Minister has not referred to it since.  I do not know whether he is prepared to deal with it or not.</P>

Here is an excellent case for decentralisation.  I do not think there is any other Department of the Government where it could be carried out so easily.  The Department of Social Welfare is one that is run by ordinary administration.  There are very few decisions that come up to ministerial or secretarial level.  It is a Department that is run completely on ordinary routine administration, and in my opinion the Department could be run as well in Galway or Cork as in Dublin.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>When progress was reported I was referring to the increased expenditure of the Government and <Col N="1850" /> certain of its Departments on the one hand and to the increased cost of living on the other.  I do not know whether the members of the House supporting the Government really appreciate that there has been, in fact, a very substantial increase in the cost of some very essential commodities.</P>
      <P>On the 1st April, 1950, the International Labour Office Review reported that in the Twenty-Six Counties&mdash;that is the Republic of Ireland&mdash;the cost of living had gone up by 2 per cent. over the previous November.  Trade unions have been complaining at their meetings that the cost of living has gone up, is going up, and that the only solution for them is to advance further arguments to sustain their claims for further wage increases.  On 23rd March, 1950, the <i>Irish Independent</i> reported a meeting where a Mr. Seán O'Moore said he could not see how trade unions were going to keep their members from applying for an increase of wages unless the Government got down the cost of living.  On 25th February, 1950, the public was informed that unrationed tea, which had previously been sold at 5/6 had gone up to 6/- a lb.</P>
      <P>To show the confusion that exists, both inside and outside the House, the <i>Irish Times</i> on the 7th February, 1950, published a statement by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who, in addressing the Tinahely branch of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, stated:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The union's aim was to seek to raise the national level of wages by trying to have the cost of living reduced.  He was pleased to say that since this Government was elected there had been no increase in the cost of living, the upward trend of the index had been halted and everything possible was being done to reduce it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In spite of the fact that we have had increased prices advertised of a number of commodities, that we have certain trade union representatives admitting that the cost of living has gone up and demanding increased wages to meet the situation, a Minister, addressing <Col N="1851" /> a branch of a workers' organisation, said that it has gone down, that they were going to keep it down and going to improve the workers' standard of living by keeping the cost of living down.  I have here a report from a trade journal of the 3rd February stating: &ldquo;Bacon, eggs, milk and mutton all cost more.&rdquo;  Milk in that particular period had risen by 16.2 per cent. over the previous price.  The <i>Irish Press</i> on 2nd February, 1950, stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Another serious impost on the smaller wage and salary earners is to come about in the next few days following an increase in leather prices from a penny to fourpence a pound, according to quality, which came officially into operation yesterday. The new leather prices will mean that footwear of average quality will cost from 2/- to 2/6 a pair more, with a bigger increase on the dearer types.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>No.  Deputy Davin should know that we are not all as foolish as he is and that one does not quote as a news item something which appears in a leading article.  If the Deputy does not know it, it was the Minister for Agriculture who permitted the canned meat factories to charge the tanneries more for hides in order to compensate them for the low price they were getting for canned meat abroad and as a result the price of leather went up.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;A rise of approximately 10 per cent. in the price of cement is announced by Cement Limited.  The <Col N="1852" /> new price is to take effect from to-day&rdquo;&mdash;that is the 23rd January, 1950. Cement has gone up by 10 per cent. in order that we can build houses cheaper for people to live in.  Of course Deputy Davin will not be affected by this, as he is just a plain man like myself.  This is from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 14th January, 1950:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It was announced yesterday that as a result of an increase in the cost of imported materials the Minister for Industry and Commerce has made an Order with effect as from Monday next fixing revised maximum prices for tyres and tubes.  The increase is equivalent to 10 per cent. in the case of motor and bicycle tyres, 7½ per cent. in the case of heavy vehicle tubes and bicycle tubes, and 5 per cent. in the case of motor car tubes.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We all know that on 24th November, 1949, the price of petrol went up by 2d. per gallon.  To a great extent, that was due, I suppose, to devaluation. Nevertheless, we have various members of the Parties forming the Government continuing to tell the people that the cost of living has been reduced.  Do you think that people are so stupid that when a woman goes into a shop and finds that the price of flake oatmeal has gone up by 2/8 a cwt. she believes what she has been told by a member of the inter-Party Government when she knows that she is paying more and she is told that she is paying less?</P>
      <P>I could go on giving a lot of other items, but I want to give another one, from the <i>Irish Press</i> of 3rd October:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Beet growers have been notified by the Irish Sugar Company that the compound beet fertiliser, which has been selling at £22 a ton, will cost £24 a ton as from Saturday last.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then there is a note added:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Speaking at Portumna Show on September 20th (less than a fortnight ago) Mr. Dillon, Minister for Agriculture, said: &lsquo;Some people have expressed apprehension that the price of artificial fertilisers will go up.  I am your Minister for fertilisers, and I want to tell you that the price of fertilisers will not be increased in Ireland by one penny piece in foreseeable <Col N="1853" /> time and that supplies will be equal to any demand you make upon them.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to come back to the talk we had about the pre-election period and about the period immediately after the first Budget.  I want to refer to the alleged wasteful extravagance of Fianna Fáil.  We have been told that a lot of the expenditure is for &ldquo;capital purposes&rdquo;, &ldquo;reproductive purposes&rdquo; and for the &ldquo;improvement of people&rdquo;. There is, first, one Estimate to which I should like to refer.  For the Department of External Affairs in 1947-8, the Minister and staff cost £31,000&mdash;for 1950-51 the figure is £60,000.  It is true that a certain amount of that is due to devaluation.  Travelling expenses have gone up from £750 for the year 1947-8 to £4,750 for the year 1950-51.  Incidental expenses&mdash;I do not know what incidentals are&mdash;were £500 in the year 1947-8 and have now risen to £2,900. Telegrams and telephones have increased from £2,000 to £5,600.  Entertainment has increased from £2,000 to £6,500.  Iveagh House office and restaurant&mdash;this is something that Deputy Donnellan can give us some information about&mdash;cost nothing in 1947-8 but its cost is £27,000 in the Estimate for 1950-51.  That represents the position now despite the fact that we were going to introduce all kinds of economies and despite the fact that the Deputies opposite criticised their predecessors in office under the headings of squandermania, of leading the life of Riley in luxury camps, of running around in big motor cars which, of course, I believe have since been abandoned&mdash;I believe the Ministers <Col N="1855" /> and Parliamentary Secretaries now walk or take the bus.  I would not suggest that they could be accused of using a State motor car after all they had to say about the use of State cars by their predecessors&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we are getting at it.  When I was speaking before, Deputy McQuillan, I think, doubted what I said.  I have searched for the statement which proves that Clann na Poblachta were committed, if any particular Party ever believed in its policy and ever intended to carry out their promises, to the policy which they put forward at election time.  One of their promises was a reduction of at least 30 per cent. in the cost of living. I have here an extract from the <i>Leinster Leader</i> of the 6th September, 1947.  The present Minister for External Affairs, speaking at Carlow is reported in that paper to have said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Clan na Poblachta calls on the Government to put into immediate operation the following temporary remedies:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Provide subsidies on all food produced on a sufficient scale to <Col N="1856" /> enable the producer to provide for himself, and the agricultural worker whom he employs an adequate family wage, having regard to the present cost of living and modern requirements.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I shall not attempt to go into details on that first provision.  The second provision reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  The subsidies provided should be sufficient to bring about a reduction of at least 30 per cent. on the existing cost of all food produced and consumed here and should be accompanied by a strict control of prices.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Food produced and consumed here has not gone down in cost by 30 per cent. It has gone up.  Milk has gone up. There has been a promise&mdash;I shall not say a threat&mdash;that butter is likely to go up by 2d. per lb. if the producers can be made to accept 1/- a gallon for five years' arrangement.  Oatmeal has gone up.  Everything that I can possibly think has gone up in price &mdash;and I have already mentioned potatoes. The third provision states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  Supply all agricultural producers with fertilisers free of charge to increase the production of the land.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When I was talking earlier this evening I questioned the Land Reclamation Scheme and what it was promised would be achieved by it.  I feel that the Clann na Poblachta people might do much more good for the country in respect of increasing production by asking the Minister or the Government to use some of the Marshall Aid money to bring in fertilisers to be given to our farmers even at reduced prices or at a subsided price or free of charge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is your Party trying to sabotage the land reclamation scheme?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am entitled to criticise what the Government does.  It does not necessarily follow that because I disagree with something that I sabotage it.  This House is where we voice our opinions.  If we disagree with something which is suggested by the Government and criticise it&mdash;for instance, <Col N="1857" /> with an announcement in regard to policy&mdash;is that criticism to be taken as sabotage?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The fourth point in the statement is this:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Cease wasting shipping space and credits on imported luxury articles such as motor cars, wines, brandy, canned fruits, etc.  Utilise that shipping space and those credits to obtain fertilisers and agricultural machinery.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I wonder could the Parliamentary Secretary tell us what is this Iveagh House Restaurant, costing up to £27,000?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Store Street?  It is good.  I feel that where the labour content is high, any project is desirable. We used to give grants to local authorities to relieve unemployment. It was an expenditure of State money and practically 90 per cent. of it was used in the payment of labour.  Deputy <Col N="1859" /> Byrne knows we used it in Dublin for the cleaning of laneways or repairing roads, doing work which we could not normally do out of ordinary income or out of borrowed money.  So long as it served a useful purpose, and provided there was a maximum labour content, it was never regarded by us as waste.</P>
      <P>In somewhat the same sense the Minister is making his new approach. He says that the building of a hospital is a capital expenditure.  It is true it has no reproductive value in the shape of a money return and, possibly, it will become a liability on the community for at least portion of its upkeep. The Minister says it is a capital investment because it is for the purpose of improving human beings and, from the national point of view, that is just as good a capital investment as anything else.  Consequently, I say that any project about which Deputy Davin might make an inquiry will have the same value so long as it keeps people employed, so long, as you do not build something just for the purpose of blowing it up.</P>

I do not know whether the Minister was standing on his head in 1948 or whether he is standing on it now, but at one time he was in quite a different position from that which he now occupies.  In his speech on the Vote on Account in 1948, and generally in <Col N="1860" /> connection with all the Estimates, the defence was put up that the then Estimates and other financial proposals were not framed by the Coalition Government. We were told: &ldquo;Next year, please goodness, you will see such a whittling down in every Department that the total reduction in Government expenditure will be £10,000,000.&rdquo;  I got that far when this uninvited interruption came along about a building I am not permitted to discuss.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, and therefore the Minister's interjection that I am afraid to discuss it is hitting below the belt&mdash;if one can use that phrase in parliamentary debate&mdash;inviting me to do something the Chair will not allow me to do.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister for Finance accepts the uncertain position with regard to sterling.  I heard a great deal of his financial statement, and I read it last night.  I was particularly interested in the long number of pages dealing with financial theory&mdash;juggling with inflation, deflation and repatriation of capital, saying a lot of things, but, in fact, saying nothing.  Why does not the Minister for Finance say: &ldquo;I am of the opinion that we must repatriate our capital and we propose doing it in this form,&rdquo; instead of saying that some people think it would be a good thing to do it and other people have been investing their money abroad and some people say such behaviour is perverse, while all the time he does not indicate if there is any Government policy in relation to that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He talks about inflation and deflation and says &ldquo;I am afraid if I did this it might cost so much, and if I did it this way it might cost something else.&rdquo;  We have to recognise one thing and that is <Col N="1861" /> that the value of our currency, so long as we are linked with sterling, will not be altered up or down by any act of ours.  We are only the tail end, and a very small hair on the tail end, of the sterling world.  What happens outside will affect the value of our currency only so long as we are linked with the sterling bloc.  Therefore, the Minister can only relate things to the internal situation.  If our consumer goods are to be mainly imported an increased expenditure in this country will in no way affect the price of these goods outside the country, because our capacity to consume in relation to world production of any article is infinitesimal, so it can only affect those things which we ourselves keep on short supply, if short supply exists.</P>
    <P>It is also fair to include in any reasoning on that particular matter the position as it really is.  A big proportion in the increased cost of living in this country is due to circumstances beyond our control.  The devaluation of the £ has made certain things that we buy abroad dearer.  Unless we alter our policy we shall be continuously faced with the same kind of dangers and, should these dangers eventuate, the same kind of results.  I referred earlier to the peculiar situation wherein this country has to buy corn and maize in a dollar area on borrowed dollars which may have to be paid back at high rates of interest.  They are already costing us a good deal more because of devaluation.  If we are using them to purchase food for our people or foodstuffs for our live stock in order to supply our people the increased cost must be reflected in the finished article to the consumer.  If we are not using that finished article and if we are exporting it we are again exporting for sterling which, in the opinion of some people, it is very dangerous to accumulate, and we are thereby increasing our credit in sterling while having a debit ourselves in borrowed dollars.  Surely that warrants some examination to see whether or not that situation can be avoided.  I do not know whether it will make the present Cabinet confess another change of policy.</P>
    <P>Will the Government ever realise that we are in just as grave an emergency <Col N="1862" /> to-day financially as we were physically during the war years?  It might be wiser to go back again to compulsory tillage and try to produce here the foodstuffs we require both for our people and for our live stock instead of carrying on this uncertain juggling between two types of currency with ourselves sandwiched in the middle, promising our people a certain amount of comfort in their homes and a certain stability when we know that because of circumstances as they exist we cannot possibly hope to retain that situation.  The only way to achieve stability is to return to a simple policy of self-sufficiency in so far as we can accomplish it and to face the situation as one of emergency in the uncertain financial condition of the world to-day.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to talk in millions. It is all very well to say how we will do this and how we will do that.  The day of reckoning will not come for posterity. The day of reckoning will come, in my opinion, very soon after 1952.  We can no longer get dollars from the dollar pool.  Yet, we go on borrowing dollars to provide another country with commodities and we get no compensation in the shape of dollar credits from that country.  I suggest the time has come when we must approach this matter from a realistic point of view and one that will be understood by the public.  I think the change of policy must go further.  Apparently the economy idea is abandoned.  Fianna Fáil were accused of sinning in that respect. Their sins have now been taken off their shoulders and the sinners to-day are the present Government.</P>
    <P>We were supposed to have handed over to our successors a barrel scraped clean of its contents.  The extraordinary thing is that on every occasion in the past two years upon which anyone has dipped into that barrel fresh riches have been produced from it.  That is due to the careful husbandry of the previous Administration during its 16 years in office.  Take care that the present Government does not scrape the barrel so clean that in the end there will not be sufficient in it to keep things going normally.</P>
    <P>I take it it is the intention of the Government to make this year a sample <Col N="1863" /> year for succeeding years of State finance.  If we clap on to the back of the people the interest charges on a borrowed £31,000,000 this year, and possibly a similar amount next year, it is quite easy to reckon up how much money in the shape of interest payments will have to be met.  They will not be found in the control of State ownership.  The scrapings can then only come from the pockets of the citizens who have to pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The outstanding feature of this Budget is the fact that it is presented in two parts.  It has been rather neatly described as a two-tier Budget.  While it may be a novelty in this country so far as national finance is concerned, it is by no means revolutionary.  There is a precedent for it in at least one of the Scandinavian countries.  Strange as it may seem, there is a precedent for it much nearer home in the realm of local authority finance.  Many members can testify to that.  It is a recognised feature of local authority finance that where it is necessary to invest larger sums in capital works that type of requirement is financed by borrowing.  If one were to adopt the system advocated by Deputy de Valera of &ldquo;pay as you go&rdquo; so far as local authorities are concerned one would have a wide divergence in rates.</P>
      <P>I am not so much concerned with the Budget being intended to conform, as some people think it is, with commercial practice.  Rather do I see in it, and so do my colleagues, a much deeper significance, since it has a very useful and desirable social objective.  Everyone knows we are a creditor nation and, taken <i>per capita</i>, amongst the highest in the world.  Despite that fact, and probably partly because of it, for years past the order of things has been a comparatively low standard of living, chronic unemployment and large-scale emigration.  That is due to the fact that we have suffered from under-investment and lack of exploitation and development of our national resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite evident to me and to my colleagues this is the first attempt made by a native Government to grapple with our grave social evils. What is wrong in initiating a system of <Col N="1864" /> capital works designed to enrich the community as a whole and for which prudent financial arrangements in the way of sinking fund are made?  The only argument that I could take from Deputy Aiken's criticism last night was the point he made that a growing national debt would eventually lead to financial chaos.</P>
    <P>I repeat, what is wrong in dealing with the twin diseases of unemployment and emigration, if this House decides to adopt the remedy outlined in the Budget proposals with the precautions incorporated in the Minister's speech?  I say that the stand taken by Deputy Aiken so far as the question of national debt is concerned is financially unsound.  I go further and say that criticism of that particular type is positively anti-social.  The issue or rather the challenge which this Budget provokes is whether we shall have a departure on the lines of the capital works indicated in the Budget or a continuation of the position based on the policy of, as Deputy de Valera indicated, pay-as-you-go with the disastrous results which were featured in administration in the last 25 years in this country.  I suggest that raises a serious social issue and, so far as Deputies of the Labour Party are concerned, we regard the adoption of this policy as part and parcel of our own creed.  I have no hesitation in saying that we welcome it.  To the workers, may I say lest they might be misled by propaganda of a kind which would indicate that the nation was in financial danger, that it is their interests, the workers' interests, which are being safeguarded for the first time in this Budget.  Under the scheme of capital works as envisaged in the Budget, they will have good wages both in a direct form and in an indirect form.  Their position will give them a measure of security that they have been unable to get over the years.  If we decided to adopt the policy outlined by the Opposition of pay-as-you-go, well then the issue is quite clear; we are destined to remain with a pool of constant employment and large scale emigration. There is no avoidance of that position unless we move away from it in the form indicated.</P>
    <P>I listened with very careful attention, <Col N="1865" /> as I say, to the speech made by Deputy Aiken last evening.  To my mind the main point, in fact the only one, he made was that in which he referred to the question of the national debt. That I think has been effectively dealt with in the Budget statement.  I listened with equal care to the speech made by Deputy Lemass who had time to examine the Budget statement overnight. In this connection may I say that Deputy Lemass is always interesting and invariably convincing when he has a good case but during my period of membership of this House, may I say that I have not heard him&mdash;I am sorry he is not present at the moment &mdash;make a weaker case.  I can only conclude that he knew himself that his material was weak.  His speech like the Budget itself was presented in two parts.</P>
    <P>In the opening stage he, like Deputy Aiken last evening, denounced the improvident way in which it was proposed to proceed with these works.  He concluded that stage of his address with the rather interesting designation of the proposals as a whole as those of &ldquo;a cock-eyed social system&rdquo;.  Whatever that comment meant, I am not quite sure but it is true that in the second part of Deputy Lemass's speech we found the real Deputy Lemass when, in fact, he admitted, referring to the list of capital items which are given in page 26, that he himself, if he had the responsibility, would adopt the same procedure particularly so far as items like housing are concerned.  I am inclined to take the view that the only difference between our friends on the left here and the Government and ourselves on this side is that the Opposition probably regard the measures that are being taken now as ones that should have been taken before.  That is how I view it.</P>
    <P>I must say I was rather surprised at one omission on the part of Deputy Lemass.  I recall that on last year's Budget he thundered forth very heavily indeed on the absence of any reference to the question of a scheme of social security.  That was the basic point of his attack last year and it is a remarkable feature of this year's debate that Deputy Lemass, Deputy Aiken and <Col N="1866" /> Deputy Briscoe, the three Deputies who have spoken for the Opposition so far, made not the slightest reference to that proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither did the Minister for Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I expected that retort from Deputy Aiken but the fact that the Minister for Finance did not refer to it does not absolve the Opposition from their omission to refer to it. We are supporting this new financial departure because it is so desirable and necessary and we are supporting it all the more readily because of events that have occurred in the economic and social field for the past 12 months.  May I point, in the first place, to the fact that the Government and the Parties on this side have granted an addition to old age pensions of £2,500,000 as well as easing the means test.  So far as the means test is concerned, it is a question to which we shall return at a later stage.  There is also the fact that pensioners of the State and local authorities have been given a not unreasonable measure of assistance to meet the increased cost of living.</P>
      <P>To return to the point to which I referred earlier, there is a definite assurance that the scheme of social security mentioned so often during the past 12 months will be introduced before the Minister presents his next Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>What assurance have you of that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The assurance is this.  The present Government have approved of that scheme and the Deputy may take it that members of all Parties on this side of the House will support that legislation.  I am confident that, if not all, a big proportion even in the Opposition Party will also support it.  It is my feeling and the feeling of all Deputies on this side of the House that that measure of social security will be law next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the feeling of the Minister for Finance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that, as one member of the Government, he is behind this scheme equally <Col N="1867" /> with the Tánaiste himself.  Anyway I shall move away from that and refer to other matters which as I say make it easier for us to support the Budget before the House.  There is the question of housing to which a great deal of reference has been made.  I think it is safe to say that, as far as housing is concerned, this will be a record year in the State as a whole.  The number of men engaged at the end of February was 12,556, and the number of houses in course of erection was 10,838.  It is safe to say that the rate of progress is so satisfactory in some districts that the responsible authorities there can say that they are within measurable distance of a final solution of the question.  I think that County Dublin may be cited as an example. The City of Dublin has its own special problem.  Things are not by any means unsatisfactory here.  The City Council is aiming at a target of 3,000 houses this year.  If that is reached it will be a wholetime record for the City Council. With other members of the House who are members of the Consultative Council, I should like to take this opportunity of paying tribute to the extremely efficient officials who are in charge of that scheme.  I will leave it at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another side to the question of housing, particularly in Dublin, to which I should like to direct the Minister's attention.  He has given figures in his Budget statement relating to the subventions which are being given at present to local authorities for houses and for private building as well. I think he described these subventions as generous.  I think that if things were normal, they could certainly be so described.  I want to put it to the Minister that, notwithstanding the fact that these subventions are generous and notwithstanding the fact that local authorities are making a pretty useful contribution to housing from their own purse, the fact still remains that, in a good many cases the rents which the tenants are called upon to pay are entirely too high.  I think that Deputies in all Parties will agree that there are cases of that kind&mdash;that while excellent houses are being produced, the rents are too high or will eventually prove <Col N="1868" /> too high for the tenants going into them.  There are two solutions to that problem.  One is that the subvention be increased or alternatively, that building costs should be lowered.  I and other members of the House have repeatedly directed attention to the question of building costs.  You may rule out the question of labour so far as building costs are concerned.  I am going to direct the Minister's attention once again, as I have directed the attention of his colleague the Minister for Industry and Commerce to it, that it is about time we had an inquiry into the cost of building materials.  Rightly or wrongly, the feeling is abroad that this cost is too high.  I will be quoting a statement later which will indicate that the profits from building materials can certainly be described as too high. As I say, it is a matter for the State, as to whether the subvention shall be increased or whether we shall have an easement in the direction that I have indicated.</P>
    <P>There is a still further problem so far as houses are concerned.  I think I may speak on this for my friend, Deputy Hickey, as well as for myself because the grievance that obtains in Dublin also obtains in Cork.  The grievance is this, that for some reason, so far unexplained, Dublin and Cork Boroughs are excluded from the recoupment which all other authorities are getting in the case of housing.  I will pay tribute to Deputy Aiken in that he initiated the question of the 2½ per cent. so far as housing authorities are concerned.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, all local authorities get their housing finance from the Local Loans Fund.  The rate, I believe, is 3¼ per cent.  The present Minister has maintained the old rate of 2½ per cent. by recouping to the local authorities the difference between the 3¼ per cent. and the 2½ per cent.  But the county boroughs of Dublin and Cork are excluded from that benefit. The only reason given for doing so is that they have to go on to the market to provide their own finance.  I want to underline the point that, while they have to go on the market to provide their own finance, they are prohibited from drawing on the Local Loans Fund. <Col N="1869" /> I suggest that, in equity, they are entitled to the same recoupment as that afforded to all other authorities.</P>
    <P>So far as housing finance is concerned, there is the definite assurance now&mdash;it will be accepted by all Parties &mdash;that no financial consideration will be allowed to impede housing progress. The only restriction that I see in that undertaking is that Dublin and Cork are being left in the position of being discriminated against.</P>
    <P>There are other features of the past 12 months which give the members on this side a measure of satisfaction. This may be described as the half-way stage of the present Government, and it is not inappropriate that these matters should be referred to.  I have referred to old age pensions, housing and social security.  It may be no harm if I refer to the position of employment as it is in the country at the present time.  The average numbers engaged in all industry increased by 17,000 or by 10 per cent. between 1947 and 1949.  The number in 1938 was 166,000.  The production of manufacturing industry increased by about 22 per cent. since 1947.  The wages paid to workers were increased by, roughly, 8 per cent. since 1947.  Provision is made in the Book of Estimates this year for £12,500,000 for social services. There is an increase from £6,000,000 to £8,000,000 for education. The agricultural grant for the relief of rates is increased, and local government, public health and other services are increased.  Taking these increases, in conjunction with the legislation with which, I am glad to say, we have been associated, such as that relating to the transport industry, the position, I think, may be regarded as satisfactory. The Transport Bill is now in its last stages.  This means that, roughly, 22,000 workers, with their families, will have a measure of security which was not available to them up to this.</P>

      <P>There is also the question of agricultural workers. Provision is being made at the present time for them so far as holidays are concerned.  All these matters give us, <Col N="1870" /> on this side, satisfaction, because they justify the participation of our own two Ministers in the present administration. I want to refer to another matter which has not so far been touched upon and that is what has been described as the excess profits tax.  In his speech in 1948 the Minister stated, as reported in Volume 110, column 1057, of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Another important factor in the present inflated structure of wholesale and retail prices is the high level of profits in trade and industry. When the excess corporation profits tax and the excess surtax were abolished two years ago by my predecessor, with effect as from the end of 1946, it was expected that this would be followed by a general fall in prices.  This expectation has, unfortunately, not been realised and from the figures which I have examined it is clear that excessive profits are still being taken in a number of instances, despite all efforts at price control.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He went on to say that, if it were necessary, he would introduce a further dividend Standstill Order accompanied, this time, by the appropriation of the whole, not merely a part, of any excess profits.  My comment on that is that if profits were excessive in 1948, there is no doubt that they are higher now.  I have had a statement prepared with regard to a number of firms taken at random in what might be described as the industrial group. These were firms concerned with drapery and clothing, textiles, tanning, boots and shoes, confectionery, milling, bakery trade, building materials' providers and miscellaneous, totalling 69.  The result shows that, according to the last returns available for these companies, namely, returns for last year, as against the preceding year, there was an over-all percentage increase of 23 per cent. after provision had been made for depreciation, taxation and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I instance this to place it alongside the position of the workers in relation to the cost of living.  Ministers and Deputies are as well aware as I am <Col N="1871" /> that there is still a gap to be bridged in order to put the workers on a parity with the year 1939 between the increase in the cost of living and the increase in wages.  The Minister will be aware that there are only two ways in which to bridge that gap.  The most desirable way is the one which the workers would like and, particularly, the wives of the workers, and that is to ensure that there will be a substantial decrease in the cost of living.  The Government can claim that since they have taken office the cost of living has been kept more or less steady.  Actually, on the new index figure, it may be said to have gone up just one point.  That new index was introduced in 1946. I suggest that, while the Government can congratulate themselves that that is so, they would be foolish to rest on their oars or regard the position with complacency.  The figures I have given indicate that the prices emanating from firms of that description are having a serious bearing on the cost of living and I am bound to say that there is discontent at present so far as the cost of living is concerned.  The Government would be well advised to take heed of the position as they see it and to have a ruthless and a thorough probe into the matter.</P>
    <P>On the question of the cost of living, I should like to make this point.  In 1946, the previous Government changed the method of computation of the cost of living figure.  They did that by means of some 900 budgets taken in conjunction with the nutritional survey over the country and it was described as an interim index figure, the understanding being that at a later stage a more permanent index system would be introduced.  That system has remained unchanged.  I submit that it is not a true reflex of the actual position.  To give one instance, the Córas Iompair Éireann bus fares in the City of Dublin were increased, but that item was not included in what they called the weighting system in connection with this index figure.  My colleagues from the Dublin areas know only too well that so far as Dublin workers are concerned &mdash;I am sure this also applies to other large areas&mdash;transport as an item of <Col N="1872" /> the family budget is almost as important as food.  There is a necessity for a change there.  The survey was made over 900 families.  Obviously, that was not a sufficiently wide range and the survey was taken at a time when there were acute shortages, so that the consumption of food then was not what it is to-day.  Therefore, there is need for a change so far as the index figure is concerned.</P>
    <P>These are the points I want to make in connection with the Budget.  As I say, it marks a new and welcome departure as giving hope to the workers throughout the country.  It is a Budget almost specially designed for their welfare and I am sure it will be appreciated by them as such.  I have read the magnificent economic survey made by the Minister.  It is probably the best that has been presented to the House in my time.  So far as he has introduced and sponsored the proposals to which I have referred, I want to extend to him my personal congratulation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the best way of dealing with the situation under the Budget is to use the words of one of the Ministers who was undoubtedly brought into consultation on the Budget.  I allude to the Minister for Agriculture.  I shall give the description given by the Minister for Agriculture of the last Budget introduced by the Fianna Fáil Government on 9th May, 1947.  I heard Deputy O'Sullivan telling us that the best way of carrying on was to borrow all the time.  So long as you keep going that way you are all right.  The Minister for Agriculture, before he became a Minister, held the same views.  Here is what he said&mdash;column 2550 of the Official Reports, Volume 105, of the 9th May, 1947:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Finance winding up a long statement announced triumphantly that he wanted to point out that total State expenditure to be met in the coming 12 months amounts in all to £69,356,000!  That represents expenditure at the rate of £23 per head of the population or rather more, and £140 in respect of each family consisting of a father, a mother and four children.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1873" /> That was only 1947.  The present Minister for Finance told us that he was going to pare down wasteful extravagance. How is he doing that? Here is what he did.  Lo and behold, his £69,356,000 has now become £109,500,000.  That is a bit of a change. According to my colleague, Deputy M. O'Sullivan, who is on the Labour Benches, everything in the garden is lovely now&mdash;although, according to the present Minister for Agriculture, the sum of £69,356,000 in 1947 could only be described as wasteful extravagance. I wonder what he will have to say about the present sum of £109,500,000?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon, as he was then, continued:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Is it any wonder that Deputy Giles&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;he is over there now&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;should say to the Minister: &lsquo;Do you remember the time when you were going round from houseen to houseen in Louth and South Monaghan? Would you have told a countryman and his wife, with three or four children in the kitchen, that you were struggling to get control of this country in order to get the opportunity of spending on their behalf £140 a year...&rdquo;&rsquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;and the same Minister struggled and went from chapel gate to chapel gate in this country to get a hold in this country in order to put 40 per cent. on to that £140 in respect of each family. It is a great idea.  He continued:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Take the average ten-acre farmer west of the Shannon.  Of how many of them could it be said that their weekly income is £3 per week?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;since they got the Minister I think it has fallen by about 30 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We are blessed with a Minister for Finance who glories in the fact that in the next 12 months he is going to spend on their behalf £140 in respect of each household consisting of a man, his wife and four children.  He is mixing things up.  He is beginning to believe that all the households are like Raglan Road residences <Col N="1874" /> and forgetting that the bulk of them are like the houseens in Louth and South Monaghan in which he was glad to take refuge 20 years ago...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further on he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is very easy to sweep it into the Exchequer and it is great fun to go around spending, providing a little dole for this one and a little benevolence for that one, but it is very bad finance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is what the present Minister for Agriculture&mdash;then Deputy Dillon&mdash;had to say in 1947.  Notwithstanding those fine sentiments, he will come in here, probably, in the very near future and give his blessing to this Budget.  He continued further:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But the Minister announces blandly that the total debt of the nation now is £100,000,000&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;I wonder what it is now?  Apparently, something like £45,000,000 has been added to it in the past two years. Here is something that I thought I would see between the well-known tightness of the present Minister for Finance and the ideals which the present Minister for Agriculture held when he was an ordinary Deputy here. I should have thought that this Budget &mdash;and the last Budget&mdash;would have been somewhat on the lines of what the then Deputy Dillon said in that speech:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Does it ever occur to him&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;he meant the then Minister for Finance&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that in times like these there is a very grave duty upon him to start repaying what he borrowed in years gone by&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister thought of these sentiments when, inside a period of two years, he increased the expenditure from £69,000,000 to £109,500,000? I suggest that the Cabinet should take this speech, which was made by the present Minister for Agriculture in 1947 when he was an ordinary Deputy of the House, and examine carefully and seriously what he suggested.  If they do that, it is quite possible that there will be a change of heart on their part and that they will come in here with completely changed minds about the Budget as it is before the House <Col N="1875" /> this afternoon.  Further, in the same speech we read this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If my memory serves me well, somebody once approached Adam Smith with that dilemma and said:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;Can you tell me, sir, if people go on spending more than they are earning and if they never take any action to try to repay their debts, must not a state ultimately go bankrupt?&rsquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Adam Smith's reply was:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;Well, sir, it takes a long time and a great deal to bankrupt a country!&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think the rate of the rake's progress has doubled in the past two years.  It is a pretty good lift from £69,000,000 to £109,500,000 in two years on this job.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And this gentleman will be long dead and mouldering before the consequences of his actions fall to be endured.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a Budget in which we are borrowing on the labour and work of our children and of our grandchildren.  We are going to live well and they will have to pay for our extravagance.  That is the actual position.  The Government have started off operations with the definite decision: &ldquo;We are going to have a good time and we do not give a hang about who comes after us.&rdquo; That is the spirit in which this Budget and the previous one was introduced. That is their attitude.  Everything they can lay their hands on&mdash;every asset that was in this country&mdash;has been wrecked.  Not content with that but, according to this Budget, the central authority is going to rob the local authorities.  The roads of this country are the property and the obligation of the local authorities.  These people remind me of the gentleman who got a farm in conacre and who thought he would come in and knock out of it three or four or five cocks of wheat in succession and then throw it over.  If I were to use the words of my dearly beloved friend, the Minister for Agriculture, he was out to mine the land. Those boys are mining the roads.</P>
    <P>Let us see in that respect what the <Col N="1876" /> position is.  First of all, as regards duties, I will quote from a reply given to me by the Minister for Finance on Tuesday, 2nd May, when I asked him to state the revenue derived from import, excise or other duties on mechanically propelled vehicles and parts therefor in the years 1944-45 to 1949-50. I find from that reply that the Government collected in customs in 1949-50 £993,300 and in excise £122,500 or, roughly, £1,150,000.  I asked the Minister for Local Government, on the 19th April last, if he would tell me the position as regards motor taxation.  He told me that in 1949-50 they collected £2,552,000 and that the estimate for 1950-51 was £2,600,000.  In 1947-48, the last year Fianna Fáil was in office, the income under that head was £2,000,000. There is an extra £600,000 now.</P>
    <P>I was very anxious to know how much the Minister for Finance was pulling in on petrol and I asked him would he state the revenue derived from petrol taxation in the years 1944-45 to 1949-50.  I find that last year the Minister collected £3,213,000 in petrol taxation as against £1,514,925 collected by Fianna Fáil in 1947-48.  In motor taxation and petrol taxation the Minister has collected £2,313,000 more than the Fianna Fáil Government collected.</P>
    <P>This extra motor taxation means an increased number of vehicles on the road, and the increase in the revenue from petrol taxation means more wear and tear on the roads.  You would think a Minister who is receiving £2,300,000 more than his predecessor got would take his claws out of the Road Fund. The fact is that he is again taking from the Road Fund this year £300,000.</P>
    <P>Added to that enormous sum which he is collecting from motor users, I think there would be about £800,000 by way of duty on Irish produced motor tyres.  The tyre that is made in Dunlops in Cork must pay duty to this Government and there would be another £800,000 of revenue from that.  I have not definite information on that point, but I have a question down for next week.  At any rate, without counting that, the Minister receives from motor users this year an income of £7,713,000. Out of that enormous sum he is giving back, roughly, £2,000,000; he is giving <Col N="1877" /> that to the local authorities to keep the roads in order.</P>
    <P>That position can lead only to one thing.  According to the statements of our county engineers in Cork, the roads are steadily deteriorating and are quite unable to cope with the kind of traffic from which the Minister is drawing practically £8,000,000.  The Minister apparently has decided, like the gentleman who took the conacre, to wear away the roads belonging to the local authorities, to turn them into pot-holes.  As anyone can see on the rural roads at the present time, the water, instead of being in the channels on the sides of the roads, is in the centre of the roadway.  The Minister's cure for that is to collect all he can and give nothing out.</P>
    <P>The money collected in this manner is being used in other ways; it is going in other directions and to people who are far less entitled to it than the local authorities who are being robbed in this manner.  The roads are the property of the local authorities.  The local authorities are responsible for them and they will have to endeavour to keep them in order.  The Minister's attitude towards these roads is &ldquo;Well, we have succeeded in getting into office; let us gather in all we can while we are there, rob everybody, and let the next fellow foot the bill.&rdquo;  It is a very fine, a very good idea, if the Minister can get away with it.</P>
    <P>What is the position of the people who will have to foot the bill?  I will again quote the Minister for Agriculture in regard to our principal industry, and the means he has taken to remedy the things he considered were wrong.</P>
    <P>Speaking in this House on 18th June, 1947, at column 2041 of Dáil Debates he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There remains beet&mdash;the blessings of beet!  Some day, and not in the far distant time, our people will have to ask themselves whether it is in the best interests of the community as a whole to continue the production of sugar from beet in this country at an annual cost to the community of £3,000,000 sterling. That is what it costs in normal times <Col N="1878" /> to keep the beet industry going in this country.  If, instead of growing beet and converting it into sugar, we import refined sugar into this country there will be £3,000,000 sterling more for the National Exchequer and that £3,000,000 can be used to increase children's allowances in every home in Ireland from the 2/6 per child to 5/- per child.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is another quotation from the present Minister for Agriculture, then Deputy Dillon.  Since the farmers of this country were blessed by that Minister for Agriculture the area under beet has gone down by some 10,000 acres. Recently the general manager of the sugar company stated that we would have to import from Cuba, or from wherever we could get it, 36,000 tons of foreign sugar.  We will have to pay for that sugar £12 a ton, according to the statement made by the general manager, more than the Irish farmer and the Irish labourer in the sugar factory are paid to produce sugar here.  For that we shall have to find this year £1,000,000 odd in dollars.  I must admit that the Minister has done a pretty swift job in the two years he has been in office.  Anyone who looks at the kind of stuff we are getting in the sugar bowls in the restaurants here and compares it with the product of our own factories must realise the difference in more ways than one.  The income from that particular industry of ours has been reduced by that amount through this gentleman's activities.</P>
    <P>This gentleman also talked about potatoes at that time.  At column 2050 on 18th June, 1947, he said that there was a surplus of potatoes in South Monaghan&mdash;a very serious surplus&mdash; caused by this atrocious system of giving a guaranteed price for potatoes. The Minister came into office.  He was very fond of potatoes.  He started his activities two years ago.  He advised the farmers to grow potatoes.  They grew them. On the 18th June, 1947, he was looking to Deputy Smith to find a market for the surplus that he said existed in Monaghan.  I wonder what kind of market he found last year.  What is the position to-day?  Dear old Ireland, <Col N="1879" /> the land of the spud!  We had a statement from the Minister for Agriculture a few days ago that the price of potatoes now was £20 a ton.  Why?  In order that our friends across the water would not have to go without, this gentleman travelled the Continent; he went to America and Canada and to the Sandwich Islands looking for spuds.  He was quite prepared to pay the American people dollars, and the dollar is after all a respectable coin, for spuds and to sell those spuds to Britain for sterling.  In two years the Minister for Agriculture has succeeded in bringing about that condition of affairs.</P>
    <P>We have to import sugar at £12 a ton extra from Cuba and Formosa and we have to travel the world looking for spuds.  Last year you had the position where the Minister could not find a market anywhere for Irish spuds and this year, when he wants to buy them, he cannot get them.</P>

      <P>We must examine what the financial position is of those who will have to meet this Budget.  Deputy O'Sullivan treated us to a glowing description of social services and of the <Col N="1880" /> benefits that would be conferred through them on certain sections of the community.  I submit that the cost of living has reached a very serious point. There was a time when we had plenty of oats here.  Now we have to import them from the Argentine and convert them into flake meal at 8/2 per stone. The Argentinian farmer can get 8/2 for oats and the sugar growers of Cuba can get £12 a ton more for sugar, but anything is good enough for the poor old Irish farmer.  The tillage farmer's income has been wiped out.  Having done that, the Minister turns his attention to dairying.  His predecessor had achieved a situation in 1947 where the cost of producing milk was 13.35d.  Production costs have increased since then and to-day one should get for one's milk something like 1/4 to 1/5.  But the Minister for Agriculture wrote to the creameries recently asking the farmers to take 2d. a gallon less than they were getting when Deputy Smith was in office, and the pity of it is that some of them took the shilling.</P>

      <P>My colleague would go into the Lobby as a representative of farmers to say that they should not get any more.  I think this is about the sixth Farmers' Party I have seen doing that.  That is the position of the people in our principal industry who are supposed to foot this bill.  These are the people who will have to foot the bill in the long run.  I do not wish to annoy the Acting-Chairman too much by quoting the Minister for Agriculture. I thank him for his leniency in that respect.  I am not going to worry him at the moment but there are a few more little items in the calendar in that line.  We shall have an opportunity I hope, in the debate on the Estimate for Agriculture, of dealing with the whole matter.  The Minister in charge of that Department is the gentleman who advised the farmers to grow Ymer feeding barley and who is at present paying £23 per ton for cargoes of barley from Morocco to depress that market as he smashed the malting barley market last year.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fagan will have a very different tune in a couple of years.  Deputy Fagan will find in a few years that the farmers who are now being asked to produce milk at 1/- a gallon while it costs 1/4½ per gallon will give up keeping cows.  When there are no cows there there will be no calves and there will be no stalls to keep on Deputy Fagan's ranch for fattening.  So long as Deputy Fagan can get a cheap whitehead he is all right.  Deputy Fagan will never recover from the outrage inflicted upon him by the Fianna Fáil Party when they compelled him to plough up his land and grow wheat for the Irish people.  That outrageous wheat! &ldquo;Before you ate it, you had to hold it out in your hands, squeeze the water out of it, then tease it out and make up your mind whether it was a handful of boot polish or a handful of bread. If it was boot polish you put it on your boots or shoes and if it was bread you tried to masticate it if you were fit.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the statement made on Irish wheat in this House on the 18th June, 1947, by the gentleman who has been put in charge of agriculture in this country for the last two years.  That statement is reported in column 2050 of the Official Debates of the 18th June, 1947, Volume 106.  That is the statement made by the Minister whom these gentlemen put in charge of agriculture. That is his description of the bread made from Irish wheat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been drawn away from it.  I expected when I saw that they were going to borrow £12,000,000 for capital expenditure&mdash;apparently I was under the same misapprehension as <Col N="1882" /> Deputy Martin O'Sullivan a while ago &mdash;that this money would be expended on starting industries here that would provide increased employment for our people.  For that reason, I mentioned two items in the debate on the Vote on Account that would mean an increase in the number employed in my constituency of something between 200 and 300 able-bodied men.  I thought that they would be provided with decent employment of the same type as Fianna Fáil gave them before.  I mentioned that there was practically three-fourths of a sheet mill down in Haulbowline. Unfortunately all the parts which it was intended to acquire to bring that mill into operation were not brought in at the period the war started and they could not be got afterwards.  We, at the present time, are sending out of this country a pretty considerable sum for the purchase of corrugated iron. That sheet mill, as I say, is three-quarters finished and if it were completed, it would provide employment for anything from 200 to 250 extra men.</P>
      <P>I was speaking on this matter on the Vote on Account when the Minister for Finance interrupted me and told me not one penny of the £12,000,000 was for this purpose.  I do not know what it is for unless it is for getting a special plane to place at the convenience of members of the Executive Council. At the rate travelling expenses are mounting up, they must be travelling to an extraordinary extent.  There is hardly a day you pick up the paper that you do not see three or four of them featured on a train somewhere, while the country pays the bill.  I would be extremely anxious to see the money devoted to such purposes diverted to more useful purposes.  I heard a good deal as to the extra numbers employed from Deputy Martin O'Sullivan when he was speaking here but the returns which I have got as a result of questions which I have put here, show that the number of unemployed in the town of Fermoy has increased and that the number of unemployed in the town of Youghal has practically doubled.  I expect that if we are going to borrow money for capital expenditure, that money will be devoted mainly to providing employment in capital industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1883" /> Instead of starting industries to give employment to our people and keep them at home, we go borrowing for a rehabilitation scheme at a cost of £25 or £30 an acre for land which the Minister for Lands will be buying in a few years' time for forestry purposes at £4 an acre.  I say openly and above board that is all that land is fit for.  I do not think that is wise spending.</P>

The only time the Government will object is when they are caught out and have to pay any of it back.  They have no intention of paying any of it back, and will not be here when it will have to be paid back. When I went to one of our new Ministers I told him I wanted a new hospital and I spoke about equipment for it.  He had no bother in telling me that he could give me 100 per cent. for it. He wanted me to tell him that he was the most decent Minister I had ever met and, when he asked me for my opinion, I told him that he had no intention of being here when the bill would be presented.  That is what I feel about all this borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dunne last night feelingly alluded to agricultural labourers and forestry workers.  I would like to see something in this Budget which would put those workers, as well as the unpaid labourer&mdash;the farmer's son, and all of the unskilled men&mdash;in as good a position as the unskilled labourer. Deputy Martin O'Sullivan talked about bold schemes.  I would like to see a bold scheme brought forward so that our agricultural labourers would be able to earn between £4 10s. 0d. and £5 a week, and under which the farmer would get a price for his produce which would enable him to pay that wage. If that were done I would be in favour of the Budget.  I would regard that as <Col N="1884" /> one of the fundamental points in it. Unfortunately, as far as Deputy Dunne is concerned, class hatred drove him into the Lobby the other day to further depress the farmer by refusing to give him an increase in the price of his milk.  I do not wish to say in the House what I think about him.</P>

      <P>When I hear talk about an increase in employment and the numbers that have been put into employment in the last two years, I wonder where are those people employed. We had meetings all over the country, at which members of all Parties spoke feelingly about the flight from the land.  During the past two years, over 21,000 of our young people who were employed on the land under the Fianna Fáil régime in 1947 and 1948 have cleared out.  I do not blame them. How could you expect any man to remain on the land at the present wage for agricultural workers when an unskilled labourer, digging foundations for houses, can get £5 10s. 0d. a week? It is in that situation that the farmers are being asked to increase production. We hear a lot of talk about that.  We had a complete manoeuvre on that line.</P>
      <P>It is said that the best method of defence is attack.  The Minister very wisely started off on that line when he told the farmers that they were going to have increased production, and that a market would have to be found for what they produced.  I have examined closely the line that has been given in this House during the past month on questions that were asked by Deputy P.D. Lehane and Deputy Cogan.  In order to give sufficient butter to the people of this country on the present ration you want 700,000 cwts. of butter.</P>

When the time comes to pay it back, the boys who will be shoved into the front-line trenches to pay it back will be the agricultural community who have been ruined and robbed for the last two years.  They are the people who will be asked to pay it back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am extremely anxious to know what this money which we are borrowing is <Col N="1886" /> to be expended on.  Is some of it to be spent on the roads?  Is it going to be spent on providing industries?  The Minister for Agriculture tells us that £40,000,000 of it will be spent on the land.  I respectfully suggest that it is going to be spent in the wrong way on the land.</P>
    <P>The Parties on the Government Benches went before the people of the country two years ago and I suggest that they got no mandate to increase by something over £40,000,000 capital expenditure in this country.  As a matter of fact, their object was to get rid of the spendthrift Government, those scoundrels who came along to collect £65,000,000.  In order not to delay the House, I shall refrain from quoting the speeches of the Minister for Finance on that matter.  Some of my colleagues will probably fill the bill in that respect.  I assert, however, that they have no mandate from the people for that and that the proper thing for the Government to do, if they intend carrying on with a policy of that description, is to go to the people and look for a mandate to spend £109,500,000.  I have put the case as fairly as I can and, as you, Sir, said, I will have an opportunity later on of discussing the position of the people who will have to foot the bill.</P>

      <P>When speaking in this debate, Deputy Briscoe referred to the fact that this Government had only got an empty barrel from Fianna Fáil.  We left them one, too, and he has just sat down.  Deputy Aiken, in opening the discussion on the Budget yesterday, struck what has, in my opinion, been the keynote of the Fianna Fáil attack on the financial policy of the Government, not only in the course of this debate, but possibly for the past 12 months.  When Deputy Aiken said yesterday that he bitterly resented this Budget, the operative word was &ldquo;bitterness&rdquo; and bitterness has been the keynote of the Fianna Fáil attack on the present Minister for Finance and the financial policy of the Government.  It is not very difficult to see the reason for that.  It is mainly the bitterness of remorse that Fianna Fáil when in office, particularly when they found it necessary to introduce a <Col N="1887" /> Supplementary Budget in 1947, had not the financial wisdom or even the ordinary common-sense to deal with financial matters in the way the present Minister for Finance has done it.  It might be as well if some speaker from the Fianna Fáil Benches had the courage to stand up and tell us what is their policy in these matters.</P>
      <P>We can all remember that for the best part of two years the present Minister for Finance was portrayed as some kind of a miserly lawyer who was rampaging with an axe over his shoulder to cut the roots of all the capital development schemes started by Fianna Fáil.  We remember the outcry raised by Deputy Kissane and others with regard to Fianna Fáil schemes which were cut out by this Government.  We were told that they were schemes of capital development, that the Fianna Fáil Party and Government stood for schemes of capital development, and that this reactionary Government, this ultra-conservative Government dominated by a Fine Gael Minister for Finance, was going to clamp down on all of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some while ago the tune was changed.  Deputy Lemass in one of his articles in the <i>Irish Press</i> under the pen-name of &ldquo;Dáil Reporter&rdquo; complained to the members of Fianna Fáil Cumainn throughout the country that the economy drive was all a fake. From the time that that article&mdash;or should I call it a Party directive&mdash; from Deputy Lemass appeared in print the whole tune has been changed.  Now we are told that the Government, instead of carrying out their policy as originally announced, are being wasteful and spendthrift and that a rake's progress is the only way to describe the activities of the Minister. We have had Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Lemass not stopping at personal abuse and personal insults in their descriptions of the Minister for Finance.  We find him described by Deputy MacEntee a few days ago as a tight-fisted rasping lawyer, as a Minister for Finance without as much back-bone as a filleted herring and we find him described by Deputy Lemass as weak-kneed. <Col N="1888" /> Peculiarly enough, we also find Deputy Lemass telling Fianna Fáil supporters down the country that the Government have now come around to view things through Fianna Fáil spectacles and that they are now pursuing Fianna Fáil policy.  We heard Deputy Little stating that the Government were clambering back on to the rock of Fianna Fáil policy.  Even to-day we had Deputy Briscoe complaining that in two years the Government have turned a complete somersault and that they are now facing in an opposite direction to that which they faced in 1948.  If that is so, the Deputies opposite must be facing in a diametrically opposite position, too.  Their acrobatic skill must be just as great as that of any Deputy in this House.  The extraordinary thing is that the Deputies opposite were criticising the Government just as violently and just as virulently, in respect of every action and every speech then as they are to-day.  If we are to accept from Deputy Lemass and Deputy Little and Deputy Briscoe that the Government have faced about, must it not also follow that the Deputies opposite have faced about if they still find themselves in a position to attack this year's Budget just as they did the Budget in 1948?</P>
    <P>I said that the keynote of the Fianna Fáil attack was bitterness.  I believe that in their bitterness they have become completely reckless of the damage which they might do not to the Government, not to any particular Party supporting the Government, but to the interests of this nation as a whole.  I hope that it is merely ignorant recklessness on their part and that there is nothing callous or deliberate about it.  When I heard Deputy Corry's speech here this evening some doubts entered my mind.  I have read the recent speeches, printed in the <i>Irish Press</i>, which were made by Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Lemass, and it is quite apparent to me that those speeches were speeches which might either deliberately or inadvertently damage the national interests, damage the confidence of the people in the financial stability of this State and make it difficult for the present Minister <Col N="1889" /> for Finance to float a loan, as he indicated he intended doing.  When I heard Deputy Corry gloating over the fact that these people from whom it was hoped to raise the money would examine the financial position here and might not give the money&mdash;he did not say that, but that was the implication in his sentence&mdash;I wondered whether those speeches delivered by Deputy Lemass and Deputy MacEntee were designed for that particular purpose or whether it was merely accidental.  I think that any Deputies on the opposite benches who read these speeches or who heard them will know very well the dangers in the line being pursued by their leaders.  I hope some of the more responsible Deputies opposite will make some effort to repair the damage which Deputy Lemass and Deputy MacEntee are doing&mdash;whether, as I say, it is being done deliberately or merely through ignorance.  It is difficult to believe that such ignorance could be displayed by people who for 16 years were Ministers of State in this country.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party, and in particular the two Deputies whose names I have mentioned, are, apparently, going before the people and claiming that the dominant political voice in this country is still the Fianna Fáil voice&mdash;that the majority of the people in the country are going to be guided by what the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues say.  If they are honest in that claim they must realise that they are treading on very dangerous ground in some of their recent utterances on matters financial.  I particularly deplore the speech made by Deputy MacEntee and which was reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 3rd instant.  He made the speech at a Fianna Fáil gathering in Dublin SouthEast. In it he referred to the present Minister for Finance in the insulting language which I mentioned already. He said that the Minister is a tight-fisted rasping lawyer and a man without as much backbone as a filleted herring.  That is all right&mdash;that is Deputy MacEntee's normal form.  We come to expect that kind of thing from him when he gets on his feet.  But Deputy MacEntee himself was a Minister for Finance in this State for some <Col N="1890" /> years.  He knows the responsibilities which that office carries.  He knows the particular responsibilities which always must attach, in any Government, to the occupant of the position of Minister for Finance.  He knows how difficult, particularly in unsettled times, it must be for a Minister for Finance to get money by means of borrowing, if he requires it.  Deputy MacEntee has heard the Minister for Finance making references in this House to his approach to the banks in this country.  He had heard the Minister for Finance defending the banks and the banking system, even against some Deputies on this side of the House who did not share his view.</P>
    <P>And what had Deputy MacEntee to say with regard to the banks knowing, as he must have known, that in many cases where national loans are floated the success or failure of those loans may ultimately depend on the attitude of the banks and the degree of support or otherwise which bankers will give to national loans?  Deputy MacEntee, in the speech to which I have referred, made a deliberate effort&mdash;it must have been deliberate, because his language does not leave it open to any other interpretation&mdash;to suggest that this Government were endeavouring to drive the banks to adopt a policy which the banks did not want to adopt&mdash;and not alone did they not want to adopt it, but it would be bad finance, which would endanger the deposits of all bank depositors, large and small.  This versatile Fianna Fáil warrior appealed to the banks to hold firm, to safeguard the interests of the small depositors.</P>

      <P>I advise Deputy Killilea to take his time and to read what is being said.  He will be able to digest it then and possibly to understand it.  Here is what Deputy MacEntee had to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The screw is to be put on the banks to do what Mr. McGilligan has admitted the public are not prepared to do.  That is the explanation of the cold war which the Coalition spokesmen have been waging on the Irish banks.  But the banks had a personal responsibility to their depositors and it would appear from Mr. McGilligan's own statements that they had been impressing this point of view upon the Government.</P>
      <P>The banks, naturally, and because they had certain traditional standards of conduct in these matters, were apparently refusing to become the instruments whereby the cautious thrift of their customers was to be fully explored and exploited.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He went on later to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the hard-earned savings of a lifetime are wrung from the banks and squandered by this reckless and incompetent Government, what use will it be to the man who is reduced to penury because his savings have been thus wasted to be compelled to take from the banks thousands of scraps of paper issued by them under the compulsion of the Government? Unless the banks stood firm and the people supported them, the State was heading for financial chaos.  Inevitably in its train would follow hardship and suffering and widespread unemployment.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I make a point when I am giving a quotation to use the Fianna Fáil bible so that it will not be questioned.  That was Deputy MacEntee talking to members of the Fianna Fáil organisation in his own constituency last Tuesday.  Every Deputy who read that speech will, I think, realise the implications of Deputy MacEntee's statement; he will <Col N="1892" /> realise what Deputy MacEntee intended to say, even when he had not the courage to say it openly.  I think, in so far as words can carry any meaning, that Deputy MacEntee in that speech did go as far as he could to say to the banks &ldquo;As long as Fianna Fáil are in opposition, as long as the inter-Party Government are in power, any of you who have political leanings towards Fianna Fáil, we are calling on you not to support this State as long as it is without a Fianna Fáil Government; we are asking you not to cooperate with the present Government and, in case you are thinking of cooperating with the present Government in its financial policy, we are warning you that we will create panic amongst your depositors.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly know a lot of bank depositors who have politics.  There is no doubt, to my mind, what Deputy MacEntee meant, and I am willing to wager with any Deputy that if Deputy MacEntee decides to participate in this debate he will bear out what I am saying. Deputy MacEntee loses his head when he gets on his feet and it will not occur to him to strike a note of caution.  If Deputy MacEntee is reminded of that speech, I would like to hear his comments on it.  I think he would go a lot further, not when he is merely talking <Col N="1893" /> behind the closed doors of the Fianna Fáil meeting, but when he gets an odd interruption from this side of the House, it is then we will hear all about it.  However, that was Deputy MacEntee.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass, somehow or another &mdash;I do not know how, and I never have understood how&mdash;built up for himself a reputation as a level-headed man, the shining star on the Fianna Fáil ministerial Benches, a realist amongst politicians by accident, as a certain Mr. Skinner described the Fianna Fáil Government.  One might overlook that type of speech from Deputy MacEntee.  One might find the bankers might be sufficiently interested in politics, despite what Deputy McCann thinks.  I think even the banks might be sufficiently interested in politics to know Deputy MacEntee's form and to know that that type of thing can be expected from Deputy MacEntee.  But when we have the same line being pursued by Deputy Lemass, the Deputy Leader of Fianna Fáil, the man who, as I say, amongst all Fianna Fáil Ministers, managed to acquire, however fraudulently, the reputation as a realist Minister and a Minister with common sense&mdash;when we find the same line being pursued by him, we are surely entitled to suspect that the Party directive has been issued and that the Party line is going to be toed by Deputies opposite; either that or there is something contagious about it, because Deputy Corry was on the same line this evening and Deputy Butler will be on it the next evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both Deputy Lemass and Deputy MacEntee, without giving any reasons for their attiude, jumped to conclusions which they invite the people to accept. Deputy Lemass spoke in Belturbet on the 24th of last month, and he is duly reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the following day where he persuaded the type-setter to give him this heading: &ldquo;Lemass on Madcap Policy.  Finance in Parliament.&rdquo;  Deputy Lemass's speech to the people in Belturbet was not an impromptu speech.  We know that.  Possibly that is the way in which Deputy Lemass acquired his <Col N="1894" /> reputation.  All of us know here that Deputy Lemass is an effective speaker, a speaker who with very little straw can make effective bricks, even when he is speaking impromptu.  But on this occasion when he visited Belturbet on the 24th of last month he did not go there merely for a chat; he did not go there to make an unprepared speech. He went there to deliver a lecture.  In the course of that lecture the <i>Irish Press</i> report him as saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The sound financial condition in which the country had emerged from the war period had been undermined with extraordinary rapidity by the Coalition Government.  It seemed hardly possible that any Government, however improvident, could have done so much damage in so short a time.  Every month was making the position worse, increasing the difficulty and lengthening the period of subsequent recovery under another Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In connection with that I think it should be pointed out in fairness to the Minister that some short time ago a pamphlet was circulated by the Economic Co-operation Administration in Dublin in which that authority surveyed in detail, and very exhaustively, the financial position of this country. We find in that impartial review by the Economic Co-operation Administration authority here a somewhat different picture from that presented by Deputy Lemass for the edification of the people of Belturbet.  I shall quote now from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 2nd April, 1949.  There is a quotation in it from the pamphlet to which I have referred in which it is stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With the aid of substantial dollar imports Ireland's internal economy has made good progress since the war.  Both agricultural and industrial output are rising and the monetary and financial position is sound.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a comment on the pamphlet. I have not got before me the pamphlet at the moment but I think it will hardly be questioned that this is an accurate summary of what the document says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Ireland's economic position past, present and prospective, has been subjected to a very searching examination <Col N="1895" /> by Economic Co-operation Administration experts in Washington. They reached the conclusion that the need to increase production is acute in Ireland and that the Government has prepared realistic and ambitious plans for the recovery and development of the country over the next four years&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputies must remember the advent of that pamphlet and they must remember, too, its reception by the Fianna Fáil Party newspaper.  They must remember the <i>Irish Press</i> banner-lined the pamphlet by saying: &ldquo;Back to 1939 level in four years.&rdquo;  I merely mention this pamphlet to illustrate how the financial policy of the Government and the economic position of the country is thought of by an impartial investigator whose job it was to investigate the economic position of the country impartially.  I invite the House to put that review side by side with the reckless speeches made by Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Lemass.</P>
    <P>A certain amount of criticism has been made on the grounds that too much money is being spent by this Government and the focal point of the criticism has been, by Deputy Aiken in the House, by Deputy Lemass in and out of the House, and by Deputy MacEntee out of the House, that the Government's proposed programme for capital development is fraudulent, that the Government had no right to borrow money for the purposes set out by the Minister in his Budget statement, that the Government was afraid to face the unpopularity of increasing taxation and that all these various items which the Minister has segregated into capital items should be financed from taxation.  I think even Deputy Little, provided he has not yet received the Party directive in the matter, will admit that that is a correct analysis of Fianna Fáil Party criticism.</P>

Even that is some slight improvement because Deputies will remember that yet another financial genius on the Opposition benches told us on the Vote on Account that housing would be a proper capital development provided all the houses were built in one year.

      <P>Public health services, which cannot be answered; hospitals, agricultural development.  I think we may pass over agricultural development because Deputy Corry, apparently not having either listened to or read the Minister's statement, deplored the fact that agricultural development was not included.  If we accept Deputy Corry as a spokesman for the Fianna Fáil Party, I dare say we can pass agricultural development. The next item is electricity development, which so shocked Deputy Butler; the telephone system; transport; schools and other State buildings; afforestation; tourists, fisheries and mineral development.  This is the list the Minister for Finance set out in his Budget statement, showing the items set aside as proper items for capital development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For days on the Vote on Account and for a day and a half on this Budget Deputies opposite have attacked that list.  We have been told that we, like Fianna Fáil, should be Aiken-minded, that we should tax the people to get the money for the works mentioned in that list.  In 1947, Deputy Aiken, as the people of the country have cause to remember, was Minister for Finance. Deputy Aiken, introduced a Budget in May of that year&mdash;we shall come to the Supplementary Budget in a minute&mdash; and his Budget statement appears in Volume 105.  I want to direct the attention of Deputy Little and Deputy Butler to column 2255 of Volume 105, so that they will see that Deputy Aiken made provision for borrowing a sum of £8,000,000 to pay for items which he considered proper items of capital development. We find that the list included a sum of over £1,000,000, nearly £1,500,000, for telephone services.  The <Col N="1898" /> present Minister has &ldquo;Telephone System&rdquo; in his list.  We find that Deputy Aiken's list included £2,000,000 for electric power stations.  We find that the present Minister, with some slight economy of words, refers to it as &ldquo;Electricity Development&rdquo;.  We find that Deputy Aiken had £150,000 for tourist facilities.  &ldquo;Tourist Development&rdquo; appears in the list of the present Minister.  We find that £1,500,000 was included for machine-won turf by Deputy Aiken.  Again the present Minister includes the same sum, for what he calls &ldquo;Turf Development&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There was one item in Deputy Aiken's list which does not appear, so far as I can see, in the present list unless it comes under the heading of &ldquo;Transport&rdquo;.  That was &ldquo;Airport Development&rdquo; which cost the people at that time something over £2,000,000. I wonder will Deputy Little now give us a clear &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to housing, because in 1947 housing was accepted by Deputy Aiken as a proper item of capital development and he did not attach any strings to it.  He did not hear Deputy Dr. Ryan whisper in his ears: &ldquo;You must complete all those houses this year.&rdquo;  No, Deputy Aiken was prepared to treat housing as a proper item of capital development with no strings attached.  I have not got the report before me but I have one sentence of it which will give Deputy Aiken's 1947 mind on this question, as reported in column 2253 of Volume 105.  Deputy Aiken said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;During the past year the Government did all it could to encourage new capital development and particularly the building of houses.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, Deputy Aiken asked the Dáil to believe at that time that housing was not only a proper item of capital development but one in which the Fianna Fáil Government was particularly interested.  Now three years later, Deputy Little cannot make up his mind as to whether housing is a proper item of capital development.</P>
    <P>There were five or six other items which Deputy Aiken laid down as proper items for capital development, items for which money could properly be borrowed in 1947 and which also appear in the list mentioned in the Minister's statement.  I wonder did it <Col N="1899" /> occur to any Deputy opposite to inquire from Deputy Aiken whether he had said anything indiscreet in his various utterances as Minister for Finance? I know that the Supplementary Budget of 1947, which came along some months after this, was a very indiscreet affair, something but for which Deputies opposite feel that they might be sitting on these benches, if only Deputy Aiken had kept his mouth closed and kept the Supplementary Budget speech locked up in his mind instead of standing up and spouting it out in this House.  These five or six items were sanctioned by Deputy Aiken in 1947.  They are now being attacked by speaker after speaker on the benches opposite.  Why?  Is not the only reason that Deputy McGilligan is Minister for Finance instead of Deputy Frank Aiken?  Is there any other explanation?</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe talks about a somersault. Could you have any greater somersault than the attitude of Fianna Fáil on this question?  Many times during the past 12 months Deputies opposite have criticised the Government because they did not do this or they did not do that.  For the 12 months prior to that, there was a unified whine from Deputies opposite because the Minister for Finance and the Government pursued a policy of cutting out waste and extravagance and putting an end to schemes which were not only unproductive then, but would never be productive and which were merely a drain on, and a waste of, the resources of the people of this country.  We were told during the 12 months from February, 1948, to February, 1949, that this Government was economy-ridden, that it was dominated by a reactionary group who were going to do away with all development and progress in this country.</P>
    <P>For the last 12 months we have had Fianna Fáil Deputies, in particular, urging the Government to do this, that or the other thing, all of which meant increased expenditure.  We have had Fianna Fáil Deputies expressing dissatisfaction with the increase in salaries paid to the teachers.  We have had a deliberate policy of provocation pursued <Col N="1900" /> against the Tánaiste in respect of social welfare matters, in particular, old age pensions.  We have had the usual suggestions of meanness against the Government&mdash;that they did not give enough to the Guards, to the Army or to civil servants.</P>
    <P>I want to put this point bluntly to the Deputies opposite, and would be glad to get a blunt answer to it.  The Deputies are now criticising this Budget because too much money is going to be spent.  They are not criticising what is known as the capital end of the Budget, but they are criticising the first portion of it which is described as the current Budget because they say too much money is going to be spent.  Every Deputy opposite is entitled to speak in this debate. I invite any Deputy opposite to tell the Government where he wants economies made.  Remember that when the Party which I represent were in opposition, and when the Labour Party and the Farmers' Party were in opposition, they claimed that the Budget introduced by Fianna Fáil could show reductions, and they pointed out where those reductions could be made.  They pointed to the extravagance of Fianna Fáil and they indicated how economies could be effected.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We effected economies in many ways, and every time waste was cut out Deputy Butler, or some other member of the Party, went to a Fianna Fáil Cumann, and said: &ldquo;Oh, is it not terrible?  The McGilligan axe is at work again.&rdquo;  We know that by cutting out the loss of £500,000 a year on the transatlantic air service we were able to increase old age pensions.  We remember, too, that this Government were able to put a stop to such improvident purchases as Deputy Lemass's purchase of the Argentine wheat and the Canadian oatmeal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We can throw our minds back, too, to the time when a number of people who were demobilised from the Irish Army were encouraged by the then Government to put their gratuities into the confectionery business, and we can remember the action of Deputy Lemass, as soon as that was done, in flooding the Irish market with imported chocolate and other sweets.  Yet, Deputy McCann has the nerve to talk about sugar.  I have indicated some of the ways in which economies were effected by this Government.  We also scotched the £11,000,000 plan of Fianna Fáil for luxurious buildings and offices.  Fianna Fáil, as well as putting into operation some of the plans which I have mentioned, also imposed certain new taxes in their Supplementary Budget.  I am sure Deputy McCann is probably sick and tired of hearing of the triplets&mdash; beer, tobacco and cinema seats.  This Government was able to give back to the taxpayers all the money which could have been obtained from them under those taxes when it remitted the taxes before it was one month in office.</P>

      <P>In addition to all that, this Government substantially increased old age pensions, <Col N="1902" /> widows' and orphans' pensions, and blind pensions, while the level of workmen's compensation was raised. The teachers, who were so scurvily treated by Deputy Butler and other members of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>

      <P>I take it that Deputy Butler has read an article called &ldquo;Diddlum Dandy&rdquo; written by his financial leader, Deputy MacEntee, and that Deputy McCann thinks that under Fianna Fáil the teachers would have got more.  I wonder would the old age pensioners have got more, and would the teachers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to take it that the large-hearted Fianna Fáil Party would have seen to it that their pensions did not decrease in value, and that accordingly there would have to be an even further rise under Fianna Fáil?  I suppose the same thing would have happened to the Gardaí and the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>So that there would be more Gardaí and, I suppose, there would be more civil servants.  It <Col N="1903" /> is very difficult to follow the line of argument put up piecemeal by Deputy McCann.  As far as I can see, Fianna Fáil policy would be to increase all these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that there would be more people working.</P>

      <P>What then would be reduced?
