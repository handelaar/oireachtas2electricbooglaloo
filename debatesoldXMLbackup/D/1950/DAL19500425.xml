      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether there are any lands in the parish of Shannonbridge, Offaly, the subject of acquisition proceedings by the Land Commission at present for the relief of local congestion; and, if so, what action is being taken in this connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick) Joseph Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that this is a congested area but that there is no suitable land there for acquisition.  The only solution of the problem is the migration of some of the tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister discovered, from the records of his Department, that a number of farms have been listed for division, over a long number of years, in the Shannonbridge area which, in the opinion of the local people, are suitable for the relief of congestion in the area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that the area is a badly congested area without any suitable land being there for acquisition.  I am not aware that the Land Commission has any lands in hands in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he has any recent reports from the Land Commission regarding the Ballyhassion estate, Walsh Island, Geashill, County Offaly, and if he is now in a position to say whether these lands will be divided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to his question of <Col N="948" /> 2nd November, 1949, regarding these lands.  Since then the Land Commission considered the question of resuming part of the holding and they decided not to take any action in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand from the Minister's reply that, as far as this case is concerned, it is a closed subject as far as he and the Land Commission are concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Not as far as I am concerned but as far as the Land Commission is concerned.  They decided not to take any action.  That does not preclude the possibility of any lands becoming available later.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The repair and maintenance of this drain is not a matter for the Land Commission.  The answer to the second part of the question is &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether he is aware that a report, which meets with strong objections from the clergy and general public, is in circulation in the parish of Edenderry, County Offaly, to the effect that the Land Commission propose to bring migrants to holdings in the parish, and if he will say whether this report has any foundation as far as his Department is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission policy of relieving congestion involves migration of tenants from congested area to suitable lands in non-congested districts.  Whenever suitable land becomes available, it will be used as far as possible for that purpose after local needs have been met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister remind the commissioners&mdash;or some of them&mdash;that previous experiments of bringing migrants into this area ended in failure, while the local smallholders were left out in the cold?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer for what took place before I took office as Minister for Lands.  I would, however, point out to the Deputy that the present policy is that all deserving uneconomic holders will be facilitated out of lands in hands before migrants are considered.  Only the residue will be used for migrants.  I may take <Col N="954" /> advantage of this opportunity to say that the allocation of land left over for migrants must be left to the entire discretion of the commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a say in that. They will not.  Not one will let a plough through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be as hard as steel on that question.  After local needs have been fully met, the use to which the remaining land will be put must be left to the commissioners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

      <P>It is only at the stage of first inspection that information becomes available as to whether the applicant desires to do the work himself or that it should be undertaken by the Department. The total number of first inspections is 14,580.  Of this number, 12,155 have signified their intention to do the work themselves, and approvals have been issued in 9,294 cases.  Tentative agreement on proposals has been reached in 62 cases out of 2,425 in which applicants have asked the Department to undertake the work.</P>
      <P>As indicated in a reply to a question by Deputy Cogan on 19th instant, the number of applicants who had received cash grants for work completed was 213, involving £2,891.  As at 8th April, 8,738 applicants had been approved involving cash grants for work now proceeding, or to be proceeded with, to the value of £193,780.</P>
      <P>It can be taken that about 90 per cent. of those applicants who require the work to be done by the Department will ask to have their contributions paid by way of annuity.</P>
      <P>The total amount of money expended to date, excluding administrative expenses, is £143,165.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state the date on which the agreement for the sale of potatoes to the British Minister of Food was made, by whom the agreement was negotiated and concluded, on what evidence or advice it was assumed we would have the necessary <Col N="965" /> surplus of potatoes to export, inside of what date must the contract be fulfilled, what are the prospects of our filling the contract from home supplies; if we are unable to do so what steps have been taken to secure supplies from an outside source and at what price or conditions can supplies be obtained for sterling and, should this not be possible, what hope there is of having the necessary dollar release effected to complete the purchase, and whether there has been any pressure from the British Food Ministry for the supply of the balance of potatoes for which we contracted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department's letter of agreement to accept the offer of the Minister of Food to buy 50,000 tons of ware potatoes of the 1949 crop for delivery before 15th May, 1950, was dated the 19th March, 1949.  This was an extension of the previous agreement in respect of a similar quantity from the 1948 crop, the negotiations for which were initiated in 1947.  Having regard to the very large exportable surplus from the 1948 crop, it was a reasonable conclusion that there would have been at least 50,000 tons available for export from the 1949 crop had there been no reduction in the area under potatoes in that year.  It will not be possible to complete the contract with supplies from the home crop, but I am not in a position, at this stage, to furnish details of further measures which may have to be taken to deal with the situation.</P>

      <P>The number of outdoor staff employed on the enforcement of the compulsory tillage Order at the peak period of the season 1947-48 was 245.  As the Deputy is aware it had been the practice during the years in which the compulsory tillage Orders were in operation to employ a number of officers seasonally and to release them as the exigencies of the work permitted. This procedure was followed in 1948.  With the exception of some men for whom the Department obtained private employment, all the former tillage outdoor staff who were available <Col N="968" /> and suitable have since been absorbed on the land rehabilitation project or in other suitable State employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The bogs on which the production of machine turf under the special turf production scheme has been discontinued are set out in a tabular statement which will be circulated with the Official Report.  Production on none of the bogs has proved economic.  It is not possible to indicate the numbers of workers that might have been employed on these bogs if they had been continued in production in the 1950 season, but the tabular statement indicates the numbers that were employed on the bogs in 1949.</P>
      <P>I am informed by Bord na Móna that alternative employment on permanent schemes operated by the board in Counties Kildare, Offaly, Tipperary and Galway was offered to those men who, in February last, became unemployed as a result of the decision to close down the special turf production schemes, the men, where necessary, to reside in the hostels operated by the board.  Bord na Móna still require a large number of men for the 1950 season's campaign on their permanent schemes, and advertisements to this effect have appeared in the daily papers.</P>
      <P>I should add, for the information of the House, that the Government have decided to continue the special scheme for the production of turf in the 1950 season on certain bogs, the production from which, it is estimated by Bord na Móna, can be readily disposed of not later than the 30th June, 1951.  These bogs are situated in the Counties of Roscommon, Westmeath, Meath, Galway, Tipperary, Clare, Kerry and Limerick.  It is expected that production will amount to 40,000 tons of turf and, at the peak of employment, some 850 men will be engaged.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the price at which the turf could be disposed of was not sufficient to meet the charges. In fact, in some of the areas the losses will be still more substantial, particularly west of the Shannon and in Kerry and other places, because in order to dispose of the turf the price will have to be reduced from 39/6 to 32/- or 33/-, and even then it is anticipated that there will be difficulty in disposing of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated specifically and clearly that, at the peak of production this year, on the selected number of bogs in the counties I have mentioned, 850 persons will be employed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put it this way: will the 850 men be actually engaged in the production of turf or on ancillary operations in connection with bog development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Some Deputies apparently know the work which has to be performed to produce turf.  It is estimated that, on the limited number of bogs from which the produce can be sold which are to be operated this year, 850 persons will be employed at the peak.  Whether they are engaged four to each semi-automatic machine or in wheeling or footing or clamping turf or getting it out to the side of the road, it will mean the employment of 850 persons at the peak.  To get to the peak on any particular bog may mean from one week to one month.  You do not reach your peak at starting.  You may not reach the peak until May or June.  There are bogs on which you cannot work until the end of June.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the difficulty of proceeding with the semi-automatic scheme west of the <Col N="979" /> Shannon was the local sale of the turf. Will the Minister consider making a special effort to get the turf produced west of the Shannon sold east of the Shannon, particularly in view of the fact that we are subsidising the British Coal Board to the extent of 25/- per ton for the production of coal?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is really an untapped market in the West of Ireland for this turf and that there is absolutely no reason why one sod of turf produced west of the Shannon should go east of the Shannon?  In view of the fact that this market is there in the west, I ask him to hold an inquiry into the marketing system of Bord na Móna so that this market will be properly explored and developed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not.  I am as anxious as any Deputy to see the fullest possible development of turf. Deputy Aiken will, I am sure, appreciate that you will not make it more economic by having to transport turf from the west coast to the east coast. The Deputy is fully aware that one of the biggest factors in the cost of turf is transport.  If the position is as Deputy McQuillan says, I will be very glad to receive any assistance from him in that matter.  If we can find a market east or west of the Shannon or anywhere else in which turf can be sold at an economic price, then I will &ldquo;plug&rdquo; it for all I am worth.  May I remind Deputy Aiken that I was not responsible for the coal deal with the British?</P>

The company will dispose of this sugar in its original state or in a refined state, according <Col N="982" /> to demand.

      <P>The Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948, permits of the reservation of houses for newly-weds, as such, only in the case of the larger urban housing authorities, including Clonmel Corporation.  The Labourers Acts, being the housing code under which the South Tipperary County Council operate, require certain preferences to be given in the letting of cottages which do not enable the council to reserve for newly-weds, as such, a fixed percentage of the cottages built each year.  Subject to these preferences, it is, however, open to the county council to let cottages to newlywed applicants who come within the extended definition of &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>As regards the first part of the question, a new infants unit of 31 cots has recently been completed and will be opened within the next month at the National Maternity Hospital and work has started on further extensions to provide eight additional cots.  A new infants unit of 30 beds is at present being erected at the Rotunda Hospital. This unit will be in operation by the autumn.  An infants unit of 16 cots is also being provided at the Coombe Hospital and should be available before the autumn.  The provision of a new storey over the admission block at the Temple Street Children's Hospital will increase the bed accommodation by 24 cots by the summer.</P>
      <P>On the completion of the new nurses' home at St. Michael's Hospital, Dún Laoghaire, accommodation will become available in the hospital for a further 30 patients.  The building of a nurses' home and administration unit at the Meath Hospital, for which a contract is about to be placed, will make available accommodation for 19 additional patients.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's statement that the short-term hospital building programme has not yet started in Dublin is not correct.  In fact, a substantial part of that programme is already under way. A new sanatorium of over 500 beds has been provided at St. Mary's Chest Hospital, Phænix Park.  Work has started on the new 304-bed children's hospital at Crumlin, and tenders have been obtained for the erection of a 250-bed children's sanatorium at Bally-owen, County Dublin.  Site development works are in progress at the regional sanatorium at Blanchardstown. Work is well advanced on the building of a new outpatients department at St. Anne's Skin and Cancer Hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress on Thursday night I was dealing with what I considered to be a better system of training for teachers than the system at present in operation and I suggested that it would be desirable that teachers should obtain a university degree.  Teachers in the Cities of Dublin, Cork and Galway have every opportunity of obtaining such degrees after their training course but I hold teachers, even in the remotest part of the country, require to have as high qualifications as those in the cities and towns.  That is to say that in these far distant districts, children are deserving of the best possible education that can be afforded to them.  I do not mean of course to suggest that the system I have indicated for the training of teachers would be the best method nor do I hold that it should be put into operation, but it is something worthy of consideration.  There is a widespread opinion among members of the teachers' organisation and other bodies interested in education that the present system is not the best system that could be devised.  I hope, therefore, that the Minister will, at some future date, consider the matter to see if any better system can be found and put into operation either wholly or gradually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now come to the school buildings, where the children and the teachers have to spend five or six hours each day.  During the war years the building of schools, like the building of <Col N="994" /> houses and hospitals, was suspended. As a result, a great deal of arrears now have to be made up.  During the past two or three years numbers of splendid schools have been put under construction. I suggest that there are very many schools in a state of repair that could be described as not exactly too bad and before they become worse it might be well if certain reconstruction work was carried on so as to leave them in a suitable condition until such time as better schools can be erected. There are many schools which are entirely unsuitable for the children or the teachers.  Indeed, there are some buildings that are a menace to the health of those who have to use them. For some reason&mdash;it is not a question of money&mdash;there seems to be a great delay in finding sites, and so many architects and engineers have to deal with them that years seem to pass before anything is done in connection with the new buildings.  I have in mind some two or three very bad schools in my own area.  During the past few years we have been pressing for the erection of new schools, but that seems to be as far away as ever.  I know the Minister and his Department are doing the best they can, and so are the other Departments concerned, but there seems to be trouble in finding sites.  I wonder could they be obtained compulsorily?</P>
    <P>There is also the difficulty of the local contribution.  There are some areas where it is almost impossible to get the people to contribute anything. I think people, if they are interested in the education of their children, should do their best to contribute something and so help the managers in this matter in a better fashion than they do.  In latter years people seem to have the idea that everything should be done by the State.  It would be much better if they would only realise that the children are their responsibility, and they should make a greater effort to see that the schools in their localities are properly constructed and equipped.</P>
    <P>I would like now to refer to the important questions of heating and cleaning. Even though the Department allocates grants for this purpose, it is <Col N="995" /> still the custom that the children have to do the work of sweeping the floors, dusting the rooms, laying the fires, and so on.  A grant is given on the basis of the average.  There are, say, schools with an average of 60, 70 or 80. There are two rooms and these rooms require to be thoroughly heated.  It is not so difficult in that case, because of the local contribution given by the parents in the way of turf, or money to purchase turf or wood, and there is also some contribution from the manager. But in the case of schools with an average of 25 or 30 you still have two rooms and they have to be heated for the children just as well as the rooms where you would have 60 or 80 children.  It is difficult in that case because you will have a limited number of parents supplying the turf or the wood.  It would be more equitable if a grant were given to the schools according to their size, whether they consist of one, two or three rooms, rather than have the contribution on the average basis.</P>
    <P>In connection with most schools it can be said that the old sanitary system is entirely out of date.  I think steps should be taken so that you might have a septic tank or something like that constructed.  In addition to that, there should be a supply of drinking water.  It is the custom in some schools when the children, especially during the warm summer, want a drink, they have to go to a nearby stream which may be, perhaps, polluted, or to a nearby river.  One often wonders there is not more fever arising out of that practice.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made to allocate a certain sum to help necessitous children to purchase books.  It is not always easy for the teacher to know what child is necessitous.  In fact, there has been a widespread demand for the supply of free books to all schools.  I do not agree with that.  I hold that people look too much to the State.  Parents are responsible for the upbringing and education of their children.  If the State were to take full control, parents might then lose the interest they other wise would have in their children and they would not continue to contribute <Col N="996" /> something towards their education.  In really necessitous cases I agree it is absolutely essential, and it is a good policy, to help the children, but I still think the parents should offer something towards the supply of books and other school requisites.</P>
    <P>Fully 90 per cent. of the children of this country receive their education in the national schools, and I think that in order to improve their education provision should be made as soon as possible for raising the school-leaving age to 15, and later to 16 years.  In that case it would be necessary, perhaps, to have attached to each school what I may call a higher primary department with a teacher to teach special subjects.  In other words, it would be a type of school which would fit in between the primary and the secondary.  In every parish there should be some provision made so that the children can receive vocational education.  They would attend the primary and the higher primary schools, and then move on to a vocational school.  At the present time the vocational schools are built in the cities and towns.  I think it would be more advantageous if they were erected in the open country, amid all the beauties of nature.  There should be attached to each such school a plot where demonstrations could be given, say, in agriculture.  In that way you would mould the minds of the children into a desire for working on the land and you would teach them also at least the elements of agriculture.</P>
    <P>When I speak of a vocational school in every parish, I do not mean the elaborate and palatial buildings erected in towns and cities.  I am just thinking of an ordinary hall or two-roomed building, not very elaborate, but properly equipped.  Perhaps if the Department of Education would co-operate with some of our local bodies in the provision of parish halls, these would be quite suitable buildings in which to carry on vocational education to a certain extent. There is no such hall available in many of our parishes.  Perhaps courthouses, or some other buildings under the control of local authorities, could be made available for this purpose.  It is quite unfair that, while the people <Col N="997" /> in county council or corporation areas have to pay for the upkeep of vocational schools, their own children have no means of getting a vocational education, due principally to the absence of buildings in which to give it.  I think that something might be done in that respect.  I do not expect that it will be done overnight, but I think that gradually facilities should be made available so that eventually vocational education will be at the disposal of all children whose parents cannot afford to give them a university education.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister took over control in the Department of Education he certainly has improved the salaries of teachers, pensions for teachers, and generally conditions of service for teachers.  While the demand of the teachers, in the first instance, was for arbitration in connection with salaries and conditions of service, they accepted the setting up of the Roe Commission to deal with these matters.  When it was set up they had great expectations of good things coming from it.  While the Minister, or the Government, did not accept the majority report of the commission, or fully implement its findings, it was a matter for gratification that the Minister did adhere to the principle or structure of the majority report, even though he did not concede the minimum or maximum salaries that were embodied in it.  Even though the teachers are not satisfied with what has been done, still I can assure the Minister that all sensible teachers throughout the county realise that he did his best, and that if he fell short of their expectations it was because other members of the community required an increase in wages.  At any rate, while he could not meet the full demand at present, I want to say that it is still the policy of the teachers' organisation to have the findings of the Roe Report fully implemented.  The Minister has now promised that he will set up an arbitration committee to deal with the salaries and conditions of service of primary, secondary and vocational teachers within the year.  I feel sure that his promise will, to a great extent, satisfy the teachers for the present, in the expectation <Col N="998" /> of good things coming in the future.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable, when the implementation of the Roe Report was fixed for the 1st January of this year, that in the new pension scales provision was not made for those teachers who were still in the service when the Roe Commission was set up on, I think, the 7th January, 1949.  After all, those teachers did expect some benefit from the findings of that report, and they still hope, and we all hope, that in the near future when, perhaps, more in the way of finance is at the disposal of the Minister and the Government, provision will be made to give the benefit of the new pension scales in the Roe Report to those teachers.  I can assure the Minister that the pensioned teachers are doubly grateful for the provision that he made in the matter of increased pensions for them last year.  There were, of course, some snags, and these still exist, because the pensioned teachers did not, in some cases, receive what they had expected.  It is, however, a great matter that their demand, which had been made over many years, was met to some extent.  I remember that when the demand was made to the previous Minister he said that the Government had fulfilled all its obligations to the pensioned teachers, and he left it at that.</P>
    <P>I want now to refer to the position of lady teachers who have to resign on marriage.  It is not my intention to go into all the arguments which have been put forward from time to time on their behalf.  I would like, however, to refer especially to one section of them&mdash;those who were in the preparatory and training colleges at the time the rule was promulgated.  They entered the service at that time on the understanding that, even though they got married later, they could still continue to teach if they so desired.  The position at the present time is that we are experiencing a difficulty in getting substitute teachers when their services are required, and so we have to accept the services of untrained teachers without any qualifications except, perhaps, that they possess the <Col N="999" /> leaving certificate or have matriculated in the university.</P>
    <P>At the opening of my speech I paid a tribute to Deputy de Valera for what he had done during the short time he was Minister for Education.  I should like now to pay a tribute to the present Minister.  In fact, I think I have already paid a tribute to the very many things that he has done for the welfare of the teachers and for education in general during the past few years.  If I were to enumerate all that he has done it would show that great advances have been made.  In speaking of the Minister it would, perhaps, be no harm if I were to pay tribute also to the officials of his Department.  Like other Deputies, I have noticed that at various times they have been assailed from all sides; that they are bureaucrats and that the Department itself was a sleepy hollow.  I want to say that during my time as a Deputy, I have not found that there have been any delays on the part of the officials in dealing with the matters put before them.  I can say that I, and other Deputies to whom I have been speaking on this matter, have had that experience at all times.  Not only have there been no delays on the part of the officials, but we have received from them at all times the greatest courtesy.</P>

Beidh daoine ag gearán i gcónaí is dócha.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nuair a cuireadh Coimisiún an Ruadhaigh ar bun cheapadar go socrófaí a gcás faoi dheireadh agus faoi dheoígh, go mór mhór taréis an ruaille buaille a chuir lucht an Rialtais ar bun nuair a bhíodar ar an dtaobh seo den Tigh agus taréis na ngeallúintí a thugadar uathu.  Bhí na múinteoirí <Col N="1000" /> muiníneach as an gCoimisiún sin agus mheasadar go raibh an Rialtas seo lom dáiriribh nuair a cheapadar breitheamh den chúirt chuarda mar chathaoirleach air mar is rí-annamh a iarrtar ar bhreitheamh dul i mbun gnótha den tsórt sin, ach tuigtear dos na múinteoirí anois agus tuigtear do chách ná raibh sa chor sin ach cur-ó-dhoras agus an cur-i-gcéill sin a bhíonn ar siúl ag an Rialtas seo de ghnáth agus go bhféadfadh an Rialtas an méid a dheineadar ina dhiaidh sin a dhéanamh gan aon Choimisiún nuair nár ghlacadar ach le caol-chuid de mholtaí an Choimisiúin sin maidir le scálaí tuarastail. Thug an Rialtas droim láimhe le tuarascáil fhormhór an Choimisiúin sin agus ghlacadar le tuarascáil an fhoirbhig agus b'iad an foirbheag ná stát-sheirbhísigh a cuireadh ar an gCoimisiún d'aon ghnó, is dócha, chun dualgas an Rialtais a dhéanamh nuair ná raibh an Rialtas toilteanach an gnó a dhéanamh iad féin.  Ní deirim gur ceart d'aon Rialtas glacadh le pé moltaí a thugann Coimisiún dá shaghas mar gheall ar aon cheist, ach b'é an díobháil a deineadh gur tugadh a mhalairt le tuiscint dos na múinteoirí. B'shin é a dhein an tiubaist ar fad.</P>
    <P>Is é an gearán is mó atá ag na múinteoirí anois nár tugadh na scálaí nua siar go dtí Mí Meán Fómhair anuraídh agus ní gearán gan bunús é mar b'shín é an dáta gur gheall Rialtas Fianna Fáil dóibh go ndéanfaí athbhreith ar a gcás i leith an chostais bheatha agus gach rud mar sin a bheadh le cur san áireamh nuair a thiocfadh an t-am.  Is mar sin, leis, a socraíodh cás na Stát-Sheirbhíseach. Déarfainn gur deineadh éagóir ar na múinteoirí nuair nár deighleáladh leo mar a deineadh leis na Stá-Sheirbhísigh. Do deineadh athbhreith ar a gcás sin agus fuaireadar dea-thoradh. Tá corp-lár an chirt ag na múinteoirí san éileamh sin atá á dhéanamh acu maidír leís an íocaíocht bhreise d'fháil ó Mhí Mheán Fhómhair seo caite agus tá fíor-oblagáid, nó ba cheart dom a rá anam-oblagáid ar an Rialtas é thabhairt dóibh.</P>
    <P>Anois ba maith liom tagairt don gníomh, agus droch-ghníomh im thuairim, a dhein an tAire nuair a <Col N="1001" /> chuir sé an réimniú ard-éifeachtach ar ceal ins na bun-scoileanna.  Rud díobhálach do chúrsaí oideachais ab ea an gníomh sin, mar an múinteoir sárdhúthrachtach a dheineadh a chuid oibre chomh beacht agus chomh críochnúil sin is go dtuillfeadh sé an réimniú sin, ard éifeachtach, déarfaidh sé leis féin anois nach fiú dhó an saothar mór a thuilleadh, ná beidh d'aitheantas le fáil aige ach an méid atá le fáil ag an nduine a thógfaidh bog é.  Ní bheidh aon tarrac air feasta chun mór-ghnímh agus caillfidh na daltaí scoile dá réir.  Dar ndóigh, ní gach aon mhúinteoir atá in ann an gradam sin a bhaint amach, ach an té atá, ba cheart gan cosc a chur leis.  In aon ghnó sa tsaol seo, má tá fonn ar dhuine agus éifeacht aige chun rudaí a dhéanamh níos fearr ná a chomharsain in ionad é tharrac siar ón mór-ghníomh is amhlaidh is ceart é ghríosadh.  Is ceart i gcónaí aitheantas faoi leith a thabhairt don duine a dheineann a chuid oibre níos fearr ná a chomharsain agus sin é an fáth ná chiallmhar an rud é an réimniú sin, árd éifeachtach, a chur ar ceal.</P>

      <P>Ag tagairt d'aois fágtha na scoile d'ardú go 16 bliana ní chloisimid an oiread sin trácht thairis is a chloismís cúpla bliain ó shoin.  Bhíodh an tAire féin ana theith ar an rud agus daoine eile nach é a shuíonn ar an dtaobh sin den Tigh anois.  Ach, do réir dealraimh, tá an scéal dulta i bhfuaire faoi láthair. Is mian liom a rá go bhfuilimse ar thaobh aois fágtha na scoile d'ardú ach nílim dall ar na constaicí agus na deacrachtaí atá sa tslí.  Dá n-ardaítí an aois go 16 ar fud na tíre níor mhór rang nó ranganna sa bhreis a chur ar bun do na scoláirí a bheadh idir 14 bliana agus 16 bliana.  Is é sin le rá go gcaithfí ionad múinte sa bhreis d'fáil dóibh agus múinteoir sa bhreis chomh maith, é sin nó iad d'fhostú ins na Gairm-scoileanna agus níl go leor díobh sin ann fós ná go leor gairm-mhúinteoirí. Pé slí ina ndéanfaí é bheadh costas breise ag baint leis an scéim agus dar ndóigh ní beag a bhfuil dá chaitheamh ar oideachas sa tír seo againn cheanna féin, dar le lucht díolta na gcánach. Ach taobh amuigh den bhreis chostais tá deacrachtaí eile ann.  Feirmeoirí, cuir i gcás, go mbíonn a mic agus a n-iníonacha ar scoil, is minic a bhíonn siad ag tnúth go cíocrach lena bhfanacht ag baile mar go mbíonn cabhair na mac nó na n-iníon de dhíth orthu go mó mhór in áiteanna mar a bhfuil sclábhuithe gann agus ag dul i ngann-chúise in aghaidh an lae.  Ní go ró-mhaith a raghadh sé síos leis na feirmeoirí sin dá gcoimeádfaí greim ar a leanaí ar scoil go dtí go mbeadh an teora aoise 16 bliana bainte amach acu.  Ní taise <Col N="1003" /> don sclábhuí ná don bhfear bocht oibre go mbíonn muirear air.  Ag stracadh leis an saol dó uaireanta is géar a bhíonn cabhair a leanaí ag teastáil uaidh chun pinginní airgid a thabhairt isteach chuige i dteannta pé méid a thuillfeadh sé féin.  B'hféidir nár mhaith leis an bhfear bocht sin a chlos go bhfuiltear ag cuimhneamh ar an dteora aoise scoile d'ardú go 16 bliana agus go mbeidh ar a leanaí fanacht ar scoil dhá bhliain eile uaidh.  Ach ina dhiaidh sin is uile ba mhaith liom dá ndeintí an t-athrú, dá n-ardaítí aois fágtha na scoile.  Tá tuairim agam ná bíonn foghlaim a dhóithin ag an ngnáth-dhuine ag fágaint na scoile dhó ar aois ceithre bliana déag.  Is dóigh liom gur timpeall na haoise sin a bhíonn a mheabhair agus a thuiscint ag teacht chuige i gceart agus cuimhnigh gurb shin a mbíonn d'foghlaim le fáil ag naonúr as an deichniúr sa tír seo.  Ar aon chuma ceist ana-mhór agus ana-thábhachtach is ea é seo agus ba mhaith liom dá nochtadh an tAire a thuairim ina thaobh nuair a bheadh sé ag freagairt. Mar adúirt, bhíodh sé teith agus ana-theith ar an rud tráth dá shaol agus tá súil agam ná fuil maolaithe ar an dteas aige de bharr é bheith ina Aire Oideachais. Is minic a thagann athrú ar dhuine de bharr cúram oifige.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sara scarfaidh mé le ceist an bhun-oideachais, is mian liom tagairt a dhéanamh don scrúdú le haghaidh teastas na meán-scol.  Nuaír ná fuil aon scrúdú béil sa Ghaoluinn, tá baol ann go gcuirfear níos mó suime san ullmhúchán i gcóir an scrúduithe i scríobh na Gaeilge ná mar a cuirfear i labhairt na Gaeilge agus is tábhachtaí i bhfad an labhairt ná an scríobh. N'fheadar an mbeadh aon dul ar bheag-scrúdú í labhairt na teangan a chur ar na daltaí.  Tuigim go maith an deacracht atá ag baint leis sin nuair a chuimhním ar an méid scoláirí a bheadh le cur faoi scrúdú, ach mar sin féin b'fhéidir go bhféadfaí cuimhneamh ar sheift éigin chun a dhéanta.  Do thagair an tAire don scrúdú a bhí ann anuraidh agus dúirt sé gur b'éigin caighdeán na Gaeilge d'ísliú mar gheall ar chomh casta is a bhí na ceisteanna, ach táim in amhras ar thug sé sin cothrom na féinne do <Col N="1004" /> na scoláirí.  Níor laghdaíodh an caighdeán ach ó 40 faoin gcéad go dtí 30 faoin gcéad agus b'fhearr liomsa é bheith orm caoga faoin gcéad a bhaint amach ar pháipéar ciallmhar so-thuigse ná nócha faoin gcéad a bhaint amach ar pháipéar casta do-thuigthe. Ós ag trácht ar pháipéirí scrúduithe dhom is é mo thuairim gur mithid féachaint chuige go leagfar amach páipéirí oiriúnacha i gcóir na scrúdúchán go léir.  Ní bhíonn aon dealramh le cuid de na ceisteanna a cuirtear faoi bhráid na scoláirí.  Bíonn siad mí-oiriúnach uaireanta sa mhéid go mbíonn an t-abhar a bhíonn iontu na mílte slí ó ghnáth-shaol na ndaoine. Sé an t-abhar ba cheart a bheith i gceisteanna ar pháipéirí scrúduithe ná é sin a ceapfaí a bheadh ar eolas ag na scoláirí agus ní hé an t-abhar a ceapfaí ná bheadh ar eolas acu.  Do mholfainnse cúram agus ana-chúram i dtaobh an ruda sin, mar is minic a leagtar scoláirí cuíosach maithe le ceisteanna casta, crosta, mí-réasúnta. Pointe ana-thábhachtach ar fad é seo, is dóigh liom.  Maidir leis na scoileanna gairm-oideachais níl fhios agam an bhfuil an oiread á dhéanamh iontu chun athbheochaint na Gaeilge a chur ar aghaidh is ba chóir.  Iontu sin tá múinteoirí faoi leith a bhfuil an Ghaoluinn agus na brainsí a bhaineann léi mar chúram orthu. B'fhéidir nach i ngach scoil atá an scéal amhlaidh, ach sna scoileanna gurb ea, is féidir a lán maitheasa a dhéanamh ar son na teangan.  Tá daoine ag múineadh sna gairm-scoileanna a bhíodh ag obair fadó, go sealadach mar mhúinteoirí taistil faoi na coistí áitiúla agus ba chóir go mbeadh cur amach acu sin ar an saghas oibre a dhéanfadh tairbhe don Ghaeilge. Tuigtear dom go bhfuilid buanaithe ina bpoist anois agus inphinsin agus brainsí eile léinn á múineadh acu choimh maith le Gaeilge.  Ach fé mar is eol don Aire agus d'aon duine a raibh baint aige le cúrsaí na teangan sa tseana-shaol tá níos mó ná múineadh na teangan i gceist san obair seo.  Tá dualgas orainn na daoine a ghríosadh agus a mhúscailt le feiseanna, le drámaíocht agus le stocaireacht de gach saghas agus táim in amhras an bhfuil feidhm cheart á bhaint as na <Col N="1005" /> múinteoirí sin chun suim na ndaoine thart timpeall orthu do mhúscailt sa teangain.  Is mór an trua go bhfuil na feiseanna imithe agus tá imithe leo ana-chuid den tseana-sprid a bhíodh ann lena linn.  Ba cheart iarracht a dhéanamh chun na feiseanna d'ath-bheochaint agus ní h-eol dom aon tslí a b'fhearr chuige ná trí na scoileanna gairm-oideachais do bhaint feidhm ag na múinteóirí Gaeilge atá bunaithe sna scoileanna sin anois.  Fé mar aduírt ag tagairt do cheist seo athbheochana na Gaeilge dhom is folamh agus is lom é an teagasc féin sna scoileanna gan aoráid cheart an Ghaolachais a chur chun cinn chomh maith.  Ag iarraidh an teanga a chur dá labhairt gan aoráid Ghaelach á cothú is mar a chéile é agus bheith ag snámh i gcoinne an tsrutha nó i gcoinne na taoide.  Sin é an chúis go n-abraim gur cheart dúinn luí amach ar na scoileanna gairm-oideachais seo agus ionaid chun Gaolachais agus chun náisiúntachta a dhéanamh díobh agus is dóigh liom go mbeadh formhór ár ndaoine linn sa chath.  Teastaíonn cothú ón dteangain fé mar a theasódh ó aon phlanda a bheadh ag fás agus is í an cothú is dual dí ná litríocht, drámaíocht, béaloideas agus ceol ár sinsear agus, go mór mhór, an teanga a chur á labhairt go poiblí agus ní h-eol dom aon tslí is fearr chun an ruda sin go léir a chur faoi bhráid an phobail ná feiseanna agus aeríochtanna agus comórtha den tsórt sin a chur ar bun. Mar adúirt mura dtugtar an cothú sin don Ghaeilge, tá baol ann ná tiocfaidh sí chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Ós ag trácht ar na scoileanna gairm-oideachais sin dom agus an feidhm ba cheart a bhaint astu chun an teanga d'athbheochaint, tá cultúr na Gaeilge ana-thábhachtach.  Dhein an tAire tagairt do dhrámaíocht agus a fheabhas is atá ag éirí le hobair na drámaíochta in áiteanna mar Chontae Luimnighe.  Is minic an rud sin agus is ceart a ndualgas sa drámaíocht a chur na luí orthu i gContaethe eile chomh maith.  Ní hamháin gur meán mhaith í an drámaíocht chun an Ghaeilge a chur á labhairt ach tá teagasc agus tógaint croí ann go mó mhór do mhuintir na tuaithe.  Is maith liom <Col N="1006" /> dá bhrí sin go bhfuil an Roinn Oideachais ag tabhairt misnigh do lucht na drámaíochta agus déarfainn gur cheart dóibh duaiseanna a chur ar fáil chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Maidir le múineadh na Gaeilge sna scoileanna, ní dóigh liom go bhfuil aon bhun leis an ngearán a deintear anseo gach bliain nuair a bhíonn na Meastacháin i gcóir na Roinne Oideachais faoí dhíospóireacht againn, go ndeineann múineadh na nabhar scoile as Gaeilge díobháil d'oideachas na leanaí.  Tá dhá choinníoll, áfach, le comhlíonadh maidir leis.  Is iad sin go mbeadh líofacht agus éifeacht cainte ag an múinteoir chun bunús agus brí na nabhar a chur abhaile ar na leanaí agus go mbeadh eolas a ndóithin ar an dteangain ag na leanaí chun caint agus míniú an mhúinteora a thuiscint i gceart.  Taréis an tsaoil níl i gceist ach téarmaíocht agus má comhlíontar an dá choinníoll atá ráite agam ná fuil sé chomh héasca na téarmaí a láimhseáil i nGaoluinn is atá i mBéarla. Ach mura gcomhlíontar an dá choinníoll sin is fearr na habhair scoile a mhúineadh as Béarla go dtí go mbeidh idir mhúinteoir agus leanaí oilte go leor sa Ghaoluinn chun é dhéanamh as an dteangain sin.</P>
    <P>Deíreann daoine liom a thaistealaíonn i dtíortha eachtracha go bhfuil an caighdeán oideachais sa tír seo níos airde ná mar atá sé ins na tíortha lasmuigh, go bhfuil níos mó eolais ag na leanaí ag fágaint na mBun-Scol dóibh in Éirinn ná mar atá ag leanaí den aois chéanna ag fágaint na scol dóibh i dtíortha eile agus Sasana agus America a chur san áireamh.  Dá bhrí sín, ní chreidim ó éinne go ndeineann an Ghaeilge aon dochar don leanbh ar scoil.  Is é a mhalairt de scéal é, is dóigh liomsa go ngearaíonn an dara teanga meabhair an linbh agus go leathnaíonn sé a léargas ar an saol,</P>
    <P>Beatha teangan í labhairt adeirtear. agus is ceart don Roinn Oideachais a chur ina luí ar na múinteoirí gur tábhachtaí i bhfad labhairt na Gaeilge ná a scríobh agus ná a gramadach.</P>
    <P>Sara gcríocnód ba mhaith liom a rá nach mó ná leath-shásta atáim le cúis na Gaeilge i gcoitinne.  Mar adúirt an Teactha Ó Duinn an oíche eile ní mór <Col N="1007" /> an teanga a chur á labhairt i mease na ndaoine i ngnáth-chúrsaí an tsaoil. Is baolach gur fada o'n lá sin fós sinn. Aontuim leis go bhfuil an t-am tagaithe nuair is ceart an Ghaeilge a bheith á labhairt ar na sráideanna, i measc lucht gnoithe.  Connus is ceart chur chuige?  Sin í an ceist.</P>

      <P>Deirtear gur treise sompla ná teagasc.  Níl aon dabht mar gheall air sin, gur treise sompla ná teagasc.  Is beag an tairbhe, dar liom, bheith ag iarraidh an obair mhór go léir a dhéanamh in sna scoileanna agus gan an dea-obair sin a chur chun críche ina dhiaidh sin sa tsaol mór amuigh.  Sin é an laige ar fad atá sa scéal.  Braitheann a lán ar thúismith-eoirí í dtaobh an mbeidh meas ag na leanaí ar an nGaeilge nó ná beidh. Mura mbíonn meas ag na túismitheoirí ar a dteangain féin ní móide go mbeidh meas ag na leanaí uirthi, pé rud a déanfar ar scoil.  Mura bhfásann an meas ar na nGaeilge chucu sa teaghlach ag baile agus iad óg, is beag má fhás-faidh sé chucu go deo ina dhiaidh sin. Tá obair mhór roimh lucht sábhála na Gaeilge fós.  Is féidir leis an Rialtas mórán a dhéanamh, níos mó, b'fhéidir, ná mar atá á dhéanamh acu, ach bheadh sé fuar ag an Rialtas, ag an Roinn Oideachais, ag na múinteoirí, nó ag aon dream eile faoi leith bheith ag iarraidh an teanga a thabhairt thar n-ais mura mbíonn na gnáth-dhaoine lasmuigh sásta a gcion a dhéanamh chomh maith.  Tá dualgas orainn-ne, Teachtaí Dála, ár gcuid a dhéanamh chun dea-shampla a thabhairt uainn. Is breá bog a thagann caint chugainn uaireanta í dtaobh na ceiste seo, ach deirtear gur treise sampla ná teagasc agus cad tá le rá ná gur minicí a thugaimid an droch-shampla uainn, agus cuirim mé féin san áireamh chomh maith nó chomh dona le haon Teachta eile.  Ní fheicim aon chúis, cuir i gcás, ná bíonn díospóireacht ar an Measta-chán <Col N="1008" /> seo gach bliain as Gaeilge ar fad. Dá gcuirinnse tairiscint faoí bhráid na Dála gur i nGaeilge amháin a bheadh an díospóireacht againn gach bliain feasta ar an Roinn Oídeachais agus ar Sheir-bhísí na Gaeltachta ní fheadar an nglacfaí leis.  Ba mhór an cheim ar aghaidh é.  Bheadh tuairisceoirí na bpáipéar nuachta in ann tuarascáil a thabhairt do na daoine amuigh ar na pointí a bheadh faoi dhíospóireacht againn agus bheadh tuairisceoirí na Dála in ann tuarascáil oifigiúil a bhreachadh síos ar ár gcuid cainte. Raghadh an rud sin go léir chun ár gcreidiúna agus chun creidiúint na tíre ar fad.  Ansin b'fhéidir go leanfadh Ranna eile an Rialtais an dea-shampla sin.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis an gComhairle Oideachais atá curtha ar bun ag an Aire caithfidh mé a rá ná rabhas riamh ró-dhóchasach mar gheall air.  Do thuigeas gur dheacair áiteanna a chur ar fáil do na dreamanna go léir a chuireann suim nó a bhfuil baint acu le cúrsaí oídeachais sa tír seo.  Chomh maith agus is cuimhin liom bhí rud le rá ag an gCoimisiún Um Ghairm-Beatha sa tuarascáil a chuireadar amach.  Bé a dtuairim gur cheart tuísmitheoirí bheith ar an gComhairle Oideachais a thabharfadh aire dos na rudaí a bheadh ag déanamh buartha dóibh sin agus bé tuairim an Choimisiúin leis gur cheart daoine a bhfuil baint acu le cúrsaí talmhaíochta a bheith ar an gComhairle sin.  Luíonn sé le réasún agus le ciall, dar ndóigh, nuair is ar thalmhaíocht is mó atá ár seasamh sa tír seo chun slí bheatha a bhaint amach. Tá a lán daoine mí-shásta leis an gComhairle Oideachais mar gheall air sin.  Ba cheart a bheith deimhin de go gcuimhnófaí ar na cursaí a bhain-eann le saol na ndaoine, sé sin, cursaí na talmhaíochta.  Is iontach an scéal é nach bhfuil aon duine mar sin ar an mBord, aon duine ó na tuismitheoirí faoi leith ná aon duine a bhfuil baint aige le talmhaíocht.</P>

      <P>Tá sé mar nós ag Teachtaí Dála, feictear dhom, le fada an lá ceist aithbheochana na Gaeilge d'iniúchadh agus do phlé ar mheastachán na Roinne seo.  Nós é atá beagnach mar thraidisiún sa Tigh seo anois.  Maitear dhom é má deirim nach bhfuilim lán-chinnte gur maith nó gur ciallmhar an nós é.  B'fhearr i bhfad, im thuairim, da ndéantaí é a phlé mar cheist speisialta agus ar ndóigh ní féidir sin a dhéanamh go dtí go ndéantar an rud ba chóir a dhéanamh le fada an lá, sé sin, aireacht faoi leith don Ghaeilge a chur ar bhun agus é a bheith faoi stiúradh Aire ar a mbeadh sé de chúram air bheith gabháil do agus bheith ag plé le caoitheanna agus scéimeanna chun na Gaeilge a thabhairt ar ais mar ghnáth-ghléas urlabhra ar ndaoine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá fhios agam, go maith go bhfuil daoine ann nach dtuigeann a thábhachtaí atá sé go n-éireodh linn an Ghaeilge a shábháil agus a thabhairt ar ais. Tá fhios agam go maith go bhfuil daoine ann, agus go bhfuil siad sa Tigh seo, nach bhfuil sé de dhánaíocht acu a dtuairimí a nochtadh istigh anseo fé mar a dhéanidh lasmuigh.  Ní dhéarfhaidís anseo go bhfuilid in aghaidh na Gaeilge ach cloisimíd uathu, fé mar a chuala féin, gearáin mar gheall ar an rud a dtugann siad &ldquo;éigeantacht&rdquo; air agus gearáin eile faoi nach ceart a bheith ag &ldquo;sáitheadh na Gaeilge síos scórnaigh na ndáltaí scoile&rdquo;&mdash;na sean phoirt ghránna céanna go bhfuil taithí againn orthu le fada an lá.  Ní dóigh liom gur gá aon nod a thabhairt don Aire ina thaobh siúd; is dóigh liom go dtuigeann an tAire atá againn an scéal agus go bhfuil fhios aige cad é an aird is cóir a thabhairt ar dhaoine a mbíonn an port sin ar siúl acu.  Chun <Col N="1010" /> a bheith lán-mhachánta caithfidh mé a rá ná fuilim sásta, maidir leis an Rialtas i gcoitinne, nach dtugann cuid acu an iomad aird ar bhaoth-chaint den tsaghas sin laistigh den Dáil seo agus taobh amuigh, ach ba mhaith liom fógra a thabhairt go bhfuil Teachtaí, ar na Binsí seo ach go háirithe, ná beadh sásta coíche dá ndéantaí aon chúlú ón aidhm náisiúnta atá fógraithe ag gach dream poilitíochta sa tír seo&mdash;nó sa gcuid seo den tír&mdash;an Ghaeilge a chur i réim arís mar ghnáththeangain.  Tá Teachtaí ar na Binsé seo ná beadh sásta coíche a bheith páirteach in aon chúlú den tsaghas sin.</P>
    <P>Ní hé amháin gur mian linn an Ghaeilge a shábháil toisc-gurb í ár dteanga féin í ach ní féidir an náisiún a shábháil má cailltear an Ghaeilge. Tá cath na teangan á throid againn ar dhá líne, cosanta sa nGaeltacht agus líne ionsuithe sna scoileanna agus in áiteanna eile nach iad.  Maidir leis an obair atá á dhéanamh sna scoileanna ní dóigh liom gur cheart dúinn an tAire ná na hoidí scoile a lochtú. Tá obair mhaith á dhéanamh sna scoileanna ach d'fhéadfaí i bhfad Éireann níos mó a dhéanamh dá mbeadh scéim nó córas éigin ann a thabharfadh caoi do na daltaí scoile greim a choimeád ar an nGaeilge nuair a fhágann siad an scoil.  Ní fheadar an bhfuil scéim nó córas den tsaghas sin in aigne an Aire agus ní fheadar an raibh scéim nó córas den tsaghas sin in aigne an iar-Aire, ach déarfainn gur rud tábhachtach é scéim nó córas oibre a thabhairt dúinn a dhéanfadh deimhin de go mbeadh seans ar chuma ar bith ag na daltaí pé oiread Gaeilge a d'fhoghluim siad ar scoil a choimeád agus a fheabhsú.  Is dóigh liom gurb é sin an fhadhb is mó atá le réiteach ag an Aire maidir leis an gceist seo Nílím sásta go bhfuil a dhóthain taighdadh déanta ag an Aire nó ag an Roinn i dtaobh na ceiste sin.  Dá bhfhaightí réiteach ar an fhadhb sin tá mé cinnte go gcuirfheadh sé níos mó Gaeilge á labhairt inár measg. Ní hé sin amháin é, ach dhéanfadh sé obair na múinteoirí sna scoileanna i bhfad níos fusa ná mar atá sé.  Sé atá á dhéanamh againn i láthair na huaire&mdash;deirim é seo agus ná ceapadh an tAire ná aon duine eile gur searbh <Col N="1011" /> atáim&mdash;ná an Ghaeilge a chaitheamh thar thairsigh na scoile chun na noidí agus sinne ar an taobh amuigh ag féachaint isteach ortha.</P>
    <P>Tá an iomarca de chúram athbheochaint na Gaeilge fágtha ar na hoidí scoile.  B'fhéidir go bhféadfaí &ldquo;overstatement&rdquo; a thabhairt ar ráiteas den tsaghas sin, ach má iniúchann an tAire é, chífidh sé go bhfuil cuid mhaith den fhírinne ann. Achaine amháin ba mhaith liom a dhéanamh leis an Aire&mdash;agus is dóigh liom go bhfuil dlúthbhaint idir an méid seo agus an pointe deireannach a dhéanas&mdash;gan dearmad a dhéanamh a thábhachtaí agus a éifeachtaí is atá an amharclann agus an &ldquo;cinema&rdquo; maidir le hathbheochaint na Gaeilge agus maidir leis an troid atá ann in aghaidh na Gaeilge, an dá uirlis lasmuigh dena páipéirí nuachta is dóigh, an dá uirlis is cumhachtaí &ldquo;propaganda&rdquo; atá ann.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom ós rud é gur luas an rud sin moladh a thabhairt don Aire mar gheall ar rud amháin atá déanta aige.  Anuiridh, do vótáileadh suim de chéad punt do dhrámaíocht sa Ghaeltacht. Ní dóigh gur fiú suim chomh suarach san d'áireamh ach ar ámharaí an tsaol do caitheadh an tsuim sin in aon áit amháin agus baineadh úsáid fhónta as.  Caitheadh i ndeiscirt Thír Chonaill é, is dóigh liom, agus do tuigeadh do na daoine a bhí ag plé le drámaíochta ansin a éifeachtaí is a bheadh caiteachas don tsaghas sin, agus ba mhaith liom ardmholadh a thabhairt don Aire toisc go bhfuil an tsuim sin méadaithe go dtí £500 i mbliana.  Ní dóigh liom fós gur leor an méid sin ach mar sin féin taispeánann sé go raibh an tAire sásta ceacht a ghlacadh ón eolas a fuarthas amach as caitheamh an chéad punt agus go raibh sé sásta leanúint ar an mbóthar céana.</P>
    <P>Má tá aon amhras ar an Aire, ba mhaith liom cur ina luí air chomh láidir agus is féidir liom gur mó i bhfad de thairbhe a deineann caiteachas den tsaghas sin ná suimeanna i bhfad níos mó atá á gcaitheamh leis an nGaeilge ag Roinn an Oideachais&mdash; cuirim i gcás, cuid den airgead atá á chaitheamh leis an Ard-Scoil Léinn <Col N="1012" /> Cheiltigh.  Im thuairimse, b'fhearr i bhfad an t-airgead sin a chaitheamh ar dhrámaíocht agus go mór mór ar dhrámaíocht sa Ghaeltacht ná a bheith á thabhaírt ag an Aire don Ard-Scoil Léinn Cheiltigh i dtreo is go bhfoillseóidís leabhra i mBéarla ag cur síos ar an nGaeilge.  Sin ceist gur chóir don Aire féachaint isteach ann agus gur chóir dó géar-iniúchadh a dhéanamh air.  An fiú dó, an ceart dó, airgead a chur ar fáil don Ard Scoil Léinn seo i dtreo is go ndéanfadh siad staidéar ar shean-Ghaeilge agus ar MheánGhaeilge agus go mbeadh toradh a gcuid staidéir ar fad aistrithe go Béarla agus foilsithe i mBéarla.  Tuigtear dom gurb Eilbhéiseach éigin, an tOllamh Wagner, is dóigh liom, a tháinig agus a dhéan staidéar ar chanúint áirithe i dTír Chonaill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom moladh a thabhairt don Teachta Ó Ciosáin as ucht na rudaí adúirt sé agus go mór mhór as ucht an méid a dúirt sé i dtaobh dea-shampla a thabhairt agus an dea-shampla a d'fhéadfaí a thabhairt sa Tigh seo.  Is dóigh liom go bhfuair sé locht éigin air féin ach déarfainn gur duine de na Teachtaí sa Tigh seo é&mdash;é féin agus an Teachta Ó Mongáin, an Teachta Mac Pháidín agus an Teachta Cormac Breathnach&mdash;nach féidir a lochtú sa tslí sin.

    <P>The temptation is always there, on an Estimate of this nature, to approach in on a very broad front, to attempt an all-embracing survey, with the result that one finds oneself floundering in a mass of unimportant, even if relevant, detail.

      <P>This Estimate provides for the spending of approximately £9,000,000.  In so far as direct spending on the revival of the Irish language as a spoken language is concerned, leaving aside the salaries paid to the teachers since they would have to be paid in any event, and including the £5 grant to the parents of Irish-speaking children in the Gaeltacht, the total direct spending on the revival of Irish <i>per se</i> amounts to only £166,000.  Admittedly, I think that figure is greater than any figure previously voted for that purpose. It represents, however, only the 1/400th part of our total State expenditure. I am not including any capital expenditure in that lest anybody should think I am.  That figure represents the 1/400th part of that portion of our Budget, which has been described as our national housekeeping expenditure. It has been stated here and elsewhere that two main national aims remain to be achieved before our struggle for freedom is complete.  The first is the ending of Partition.  The second is the revival of our language.  What sincerity can there be in our attitude if we are so parsimonious as to spend only .25 per cent. of our total expenditure on what is described as one of our major national aims?</P>

      <P>I should have said .25 of 1 per cent.  I do not think it is any harm that we should realise that. I do not think it is any harm to state that figure, first of all, as an answer to the uninformed, stupid and unintelligent criticism which says that too much money is being spent on the revival of Irish.  I think it is important we should realise it also so that, if we are really in earnest about what we describe as a major national aim, we shall be prepared to spend even more money on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1014" /> Reference was made to the fact that this debate has always been conducted in a calm atmosphere.  I think that is so, but I have heard since I came into the House, and read before I came into it, statements in debates on the Vote for Education which left me in anything but a calm mood.  I think we must agree, nevertheless, that this is a subject which should be approached in a calm atmosphere.  I do not know what considerations the Government has given to the possibility of approaching that facet of our educational problem which deals with the question of the revival of the language, in the same way as we have approached the problem of the ultimate reunification of our country.  I throw out a suggestion to the Government and to the Opposition&mdash;I think it is one which merits consideration&mdash;that an all-Party committee should be set up for the purpose of directing, co-ordinating and controlling our efforts in reviving the language.  That suggestion may not meet with approval on either side but I do not think it would do us any harm to consider it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kissane referred to the necessity for concentration on the spoken language.  I would like to endorse what he said in that respect.  I would suggest that neither the attitude of the Department nor the regulations made by it have made that concentration easy or possible where the teachers are concerned. If we lose Irish as a spoken language and retain it merely as a museum piece for the few I do not think anybody could be satisfied that the efforts made were justified.  If we revive Irish as the spoken language, then Irish both written and spoken is safe.</P>
    <P>I understand that the regulations made by the Department provide for what is described as Cursa A and Cursa B.  I do not know whether I have them in the right order, but I think Cursa A refers to the teaching of Irish grammar, Irish writing and everything other than the spoken language. I understand that the inspectorial staff of the Department insists upon undue attention being given to Cursa A.  I think the Minister should direct his <Col N="1015" /> attention to that.  I think he should give a clear lead to the teaching profession by insisting that the policy of his Department is to make Irish the spoken language in the school and that he should insist also upon the pupils being able to express themselves in Irish and let the concentration on grammar and writing come afterwards. A teacher of my acquaintance told me of an experience he had.  I understand this occurred before the present Minister took office.  He devised an eminently satisfactory system which produced splendid results so far as the spoken language was concerned.  He drew a chalk line down the centre of his classroom; one half he called the Gaeltacht and the other half the Galltacht. The only condition that had to be fulfilled was that those in the Gaeltacht portion of the classroom would not speak English; apart from that they were allowed a considerable amount of liberty and latitude.  If they spoke English they were put back across the chalked line into the Galltacht. The children came from a working-class area and he found that his system was succeeding in awakening a love for the language and in inducing the children to speak it.  An inspector visited his school.  He told him this was a grand idea and that he was achieving great results.  But he also told him that he must scrap the system because it was not in accordance with the syllabus.  I think the Minister should overhaul the existing regulations if there are regulations of such a nature as to produce a farcical situation of that kind.  I merely give that as an instance.  My acquaintance with teaching and teaching methods is negligible, but I know that that was the experience of one teacher.  Possibly a teacher Deputy could multiply instances of that nature one hundredfold. I suggest to the Minister that the overhaul of any of these archaic regulations is long overdue.</P>
    <P>Reference was made also, I think by Deputy Derrig, to the question of An Gúm.  I think good work for the language has been done by An Gúm. Much more, I think, could have been done and I should like in whatever <Col N="1016" /> small way I can to endorse the pleas made to the Minister for the granting of a greater degree of independence and autonomy to that body.  One thing which I think should encourage the Minister to do that is the success which has attended the efforts of the Club Leabhar.  If the Club Leabhar, for a certain type of publication published in Irish, have been able to build up a market, as they have, then similarly I think An Gúm, if given a greater degree of autonomy, would be able to show the Minister results which would give him greater satisfaction.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned An Gúm it is only right that I should refer to the work which has been done by a timire of Comhdháil Náisiúnta in the disposal of what we were told in this House was an unmarketable supply of books published by An Gúm.  I should like to direct the Minister's attention to the fact that 18,465 of these unsaleable books we were told about, I think on the occasion of the Budget last year, were sold by one timire employed by Comhdháil Náisiúnta in a period of 19 months from October, 1948, to March of this year, for £936.  I think that refutes the case made in this House that people were not prepared to buy books in Irish.  If there was difficulty, some of it may have been due to the fact that the business methods of An Gúm were not always just as up to the minute as they might be.  I do not want to anticipate what the Minister will be told possibly by another Deputy, but I think he will be told that people who wanted to purchase An Gúm publications and who forwarded cheques and postal orders were left a considerable period without an acknowledgment, and subsequently did not get quite the books they ordered.  I merely mention that in answer to the case made in this House on a previous occasion that these books were being published but that there was no public there for them and that nobody wanted to buy them.</P>
    <P>I made reference already to the fact that the grant of £100 for dramuíocht in the Gaeltacht was being increased to £500 this year.  I should like to urge as strongly as I possibly can on the Minister the <Col N="1017" /> necessity for realising that, if Irish is to be revived, the drama and the films, the theatre and the picture house, are probably the two most potent single factors which he could call to his aid, and that any money spent in that way is not money wasted. In so far as the present Minister is concerned, I think that that is not an appeal which will fall on deaf ears, because the experience of those associated with Gaelic drama and Gaelic theatre has been that, when the present Minister was approached&mdash;I am not attempting to suggest that his predecessor was parsimonious&mdash;he showed a commendable frankness and a readiness to meet the people who wanted to use that vehicle as a method of reviving the language.  I do not think, however, that proper use can be made of the theatre or the cinema merely by giving grants, even generous grants, to single groups or single areas.  There will have to be a much more radical approach to the problem than that.  If I could bend the Minister to my way of thinking, I would have him urging on his colleagues in the Government the building of a number of halls in the Gaeltacht areas for use for the production of plays in Irish, for concerts, for the showing of films with Irish sub-titles dubbed on them or else with an Irish sound track, or for use as community centres so that the dullness and monotony of life in backward places could be made a little more bearable for the people, and so that there would be at least some counterblast to the many voices that are calling on our people, apart from economic considerations, to emigrate.</P>
    <P>Again, if I could bend the Minister to my way of thinking.  I would have him urge on his colleagues in the Government the creation of two wholetime fully professional groups of players touring these halls, say, for two to three nights per fortnight.  The remainder of the time could be utilised by the local people.  Trenchant views on that have been expressed, and the feasibility of it has been endorsed by no less a person than the present producer for the Abbey Theatre.  I think that is something that the Minister should consider.  I will be told that <Col N="1018" /> financial considerations put a scheme like that outside the bounds of possibility. If we weigh on the one hand the possible cost of such a scheme and on the other the fact that we will be doing something concrete to keep our people at home, in addition to taking one of the most definite and practical steps towards reviving the language and keeping the language alive in the Gaeltacht, I think the advantages completely outweigh the possible financial cost.  I do not think the cost need be as great as perhaps will be anticipated.</P>
    <P>Again in that connection I understand that Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge up to recently had an organiser specially for drama, and that it has not been possible for them to keep him on the road any longer.  I understand that when the Minister was approached in that connection he suggested that the work could be adequately done by the utilisation of the vocational instructors.  That is a view from which I dissent.  If people can be encouraged to go into drama classes they will not want to go into the atmosphere of a schoolroom; they will want to go into something which will be a little less regimented, and which will have a little bit more freedom about it.  I urge on the Minister as strongly as I can that he should make it possible for the Comhdháil to reappoint their timire dramuíochta.</P>
    <P>The Minister did at least on one occasion, if not on two occasions, in this House make reference to the fact that every proposal in connection with the language that was put forward was one which necessitated increased expenditure.  There is one concrete proposal which I think has already been made to him, and I should like to repeat it; I do not think it entails the expenditure of one penny piece extra.  That is that routine Government and official forms which are issued by his own Department and many other Departments, be issued, not bilingually or not by having a special form in Irish, but that they be issued in Irish only.  Take a simple form like a birth certificate or a death certificate.  These forms are filled up in English.  There is no reason in the <Col N="1019" /> world why every birth certificate and every death certificate that is issued should not be in Irish.  There are a number of types of licence forms, from a gun licence to a salmon rod licence, that could be issued in Irish without any English version.  I suggest that that is one way in which, without entailing the expenditure of one additional penny, at least a lead could be given.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I do not think was referred to before in the debate is the question of the necessity for carrying on the work of the compilation of a new English-Irish dictionary. That is work of very great importance. It is work which should be undertaken speedily, and it is work which must be done in the broadest and most comprehensive manner possible. The truth of the matter is that there is not extant at present any Irish dictionary which covers even portion of the development that has added so many new terms and words to the language in the last 25 years.  I would urge on the Minister that, in so far as the compilation of an English-Irish dictionary is concerned, he should not allow any motives of short-term economy to influence him in attempting to cut down expense, because it is a work which, if properly done, will be work done not for to-day or tomorrow, but work which will be of value for many years to come.</P>
    <P>I referred already to the use of English in the School of Celtic Studies. I would urge as strongly as I possibly can on the Minister that that scandal&mdash; and I think it is nothing short of a scandal&mdash;should be stopped.  I think the Minister's predecessor and the last Government were responsible for the initiation of that practice.  It is ludicrous.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Deputy, as Minister for Education, was responsible.  I think I know who was responsible.  In any event, leaving aside completely the question of responsibility, cannot we agree that it is ludicrous that money which is supposed to be spent on the language is spent on the study of the language as if it were a museum piece and that people, making a learned and lengthy statement of differences in dialect, then proceed to commit their results to paper and have them published in English?  I think it is carrying matters to a ludicrous extreme altogether when a Swiss professor comes over here, makes a very learned and thorough study of a particular dialect, writes that monograph in Irish and that then it is suggested to him by the School of Celtic Studies that he should publish it in English.  I am indicating this to the Minister as a matter which is, I think, deserving of his attention.</P>
      <P>Again, on the question of the language, one final appeal I make to the Minister is, not to adopt the attitude that, because work was being done for the language outside the Twenty-Six-County area, no financial encouragement should be given to that work.  I think the precedent is there for the Minister to give assistance to groups like Comhaltas Uladh and other groups working for the revival of Irish.  I do not think any case can be made that, because the revenue is collected only in the Twenty-Six Counties, no grant should be given to bodies like Comhaltas Uladh.  I think it is a completely wrong approach to the question and I hope it is one that the Minister will not take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dunne made reference to the question of an Cló Rómhanach.  Certainly if, a number of years ago, anybody had put forward the claims of an Cló Rómhanach as against the Gothic script, I would be inclined to say: &ldquo;We do not want this newfangled idea of an Cló Rómhanach.&rdquo; I now find myself in complete agreement with the views expressed by Deputy Dunne and, I think, also expressed by Deputy Ó Briain.  I think that a good deal of time could be saved in the schools and that a <Col N="1021" /> good deal of effort could be saved, both to teachers and children, by the universal adoption of the Roman script.  I understand that a fairly cogent case has been made to the Minister on this point and that the technical details of it have been worked out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>No, from the Comdhail. I understand further that, from the point of view of the teachers, the amount of labour involved would be reduced inasmuch as there would be only one script to be taught.  I think it is a matter which is ripe for re-examination by the Minister.</P>
      <P>There are many other matters with which I wished to deal but I do not want to weary the House unduly.  I warned the House that there were points of detail with which I felt I was entitled to deal and that I should deal with.  However, let me, in so far as the question of the language is concerned, take this line to the Minister. Let him not fail to come to this Dáil and ask for additional money to be voted if, for any branch of his Department, he can make the case that additional money voted and spent will contribute to the revival of the Irish language as the spoken language of the people.  In my view, he will not find the Dáil either parsimonious or anxious to refuse him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some ten or 14 days ago, the Minister for External Affairs, in the course of a speech which he made, promulgated again the policy which we in Clann na Poblachta advance in respect to education generally.  Again, I should like to direct the Minister's attention to it.  I did it on the occasion of this Estimate last year, and I make no apology for repeating the dose this year.  In our view, there is a fundamental injustice in the refusal of free secondary and university education to those children of the nation mentally fitted to take advantage of it merely because of the fact that the circumstances of their birth are such that their parents cannot afford to send them to secondary schools or universities. If there is any real democracy <Col N="1022" /> in us, if we give to democratic principles any more than lip-service, I think it is our duty to follow the lead of more progressive countries which have already adopted the principle of free secondary and free university education to those of their children able to take advantage of it.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, the expenditure in the Department of Education is in excess, taking the average over the years, of the expenditure of any other Department, but surely, if that is so, there is no Department of State in respect of which it is so easy to justify the expenditure of large sums.  We have heard a lot recently about capital development.  What greater capital expenditure could there be than money spent on the training of children so that in the future they can become the most valuable assets the nation could have?  Any money spent on giving us, in the years to come, better citizens, more useful citizens to themselves, to each other and to the nation, is not money ill-spent and is not money the expenditure of which it is difficult to justify.</P>
    <P>Reference was made in the course of the debate to the fact that, even in so far as our primary educational system is concerned, the State does not take responsibility for the total cost.  I think it is a great pity that we should have through the country, and even here in the city, dangerous, dilapidated, unhealthy school buildings and overcrowded schools, as a result of a system whereunder portion of the money has to be found locally while the remainder is made available by the State.  In my submission, it is the duty of the State, the duty of the Government, to provide out of taxation all the money necessary for the provision of proper school buildings in which our boys and girls will be taught.  I do not make that suggestion in any way to detract from the authority which the local managers have.  In my submission, it is the duty of the State to provide the money necessary&mdash;to the extent of 100 per cent&mdash;for the provision of the buildings that are required.</P>
    <P>Within the past week or so I asked the Minister a parliamentary question <Col N="1023" /> with reference to the provision of free school books.  The Minister does not see eye to eye with me on that point, but I would like to assure him of this, that there are many fathers of families in this city who find it a grievous strain on slender resources to provide school books out of their meagre earnings for all the members of their families attending schools.  It should be done on a universal basis, so that any necessity for a means test will be avoided.  At the moment the position is that if a case is made, either by the teacher or by the parent, the school books can be obtained, but it puts the child in the position of finding himself or herself different from the other children, and perhaps it makes the boy or girl feel that there is the stigma of the pauper attaching to it if it can only be operated by the application of the means test.  I urge on the Minister, even though I have a shrewd suspicion that my pleas and entreaties are in vain, to reconsider his decision about this matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer now to the numbers in some of the classes in city schools.  I understand there are schools with classes of 80 or 90 pupils.  I do not know what the Minister's view is, I do not know the view of the teachers' organisation, but I do know the view of many individual teachers and it is this, that to attempt to teach under circumstances like this is just like whistling against the wind.  It is absolutely impossible for any proper instruction to be given where you have classes of that size.  I know the Minister will say the position is being attended to.  I believe, so far as he is concerned, it is, but he agreed with me when, last week in this House, I put it to him that the decision on that does not altogether rest with him.</P>
    <P>I think it is a matter in which the Minister should have complete authority.  He should be in a position to go to the manager of any school and say: &ldquo;I am sorry, I do not know what your arrangements are, but I cannot permit you to do an injustice to 80 or 90 children, and an injustice is being done to them where you have that <Col N="1024" /> number in your classes&rdquo;.  That is, if you like, an extreme instance, but there are many classes with 60, 65 and 70 children, and I submit that proper education, proper instruction, cannot be given in circumstances like that.  I know the difficulties that are there.  I know that a great building programme has yet to be carried out.  I do not think it should defeat the Minister's ingenuity, however, to find some temporary expedient whereby it will be possible to avoid the scandal of these large classes.  It is not fair either to the pupil or to the teacher.</P>
    <P>The Minister will, no doubt, raise his eyebrows if I now mention immediately after that, the question of raising the school-leaving age.  Admittedly, they are cognate problems, because the raising of the school-leaving age at the moment would accentuate the first problem.  Nevertheless, many of us would be satisfied if we got an assurance from the Minister that he was going ahead with a programme for the building of schools so as to reduce the number of children compelled to receive their instruction in large classes, in order to enable him to raise the school-leaving age.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer now to the attention was directed to the remarks made recently by the reverend chairman, I think, of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee with regard to the question of vocational classes for juveniles employed in certain industries, and the provision of those classes during normal working hours.  Specific reference, I think, was made by the reverend chairman to the clothing and garment-making trades. I would ask the Minister to examine the suggestions made by the reverend gentleman, and if at all possible to put them into effect.  Nobody can view with equanimity the spectacle of youngsters of 14 leaving the primary schools and going, at that age, into a factory where they work fairly long hours, with no opportunity given them for any educational advancement, and no opportunity given for the purpose of learning even the ordinary technique of housecraft, which is essential if <Col N="1025" /> those girls, when they grow up, are to be able to manage their own homes.</P>
    <P>With reference to the application of the School Attendance Act, I have had on occasions the experience of seeing that Act in operation in the courts. There is just one comment I would like to make in respect of it, and it is that there is, I think, quite unwittingly, an approach made which does not achieve the purpose intended. There is an attempt to frighten the child into going to school, while the defaulter, in nine cases out of ten, is not the child, but the parent.  I would not be in the least displeased to see heavier fines imposed on parents.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On this Estimate last year I think I referred the Minister to the question of teaching mentally defective children. I noticed in the public Press that the Minister was one of those who attended the psychiatric congress held recently in connection with the tercentenary of the St. John of God Order, and so it is with a little additional confidence that I renew the plea I made to the Minister last year that particular attention be given to the mentally defective child.  We are lagging very far behind other countries in this respect.  I understand it has been estimated that, of the primary school-going population of Dublin City, 2.14 per cent. are in need of <Col N="1026" /> special treatment and are mentally defective.  That is more than one child in 50.  I understand the Minister stated recently that he had inquired from the Department of Education how it was that nothing had been done about this matter before, and that the reply he received was that the Department was waiting to see the outcome of certain investigations that were being carried on in England.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say that I am not blaming the Minister or the Department in this respect, but I would like to point out this fact, that it might be quite justifiable that we should await the result of the investigations in England if our conditions were on a par with the English conditions. But, inasmuch as they are not, I submit that before we relate our position to theirs we must at least bring ourselves up to their level.  As I understand it, the position in England is that there is special treatment provided in special schools, very limited in number, for children who are mentally defective, but that for 12.15 per cent. of primary school children who are described as educationally sub-normal, special classes, known as &ldquo;M.H. classes&rdquo;&mdash;I understand &ldquo;M.H.&rdquo; means mentally handicapped&mdash;are held in some primary schools, and that, side by side with these physically handicapped children also receive instruction in what are called &ldquo;P.H. classes&rdquo;.  I understand that the whole problem has been dealt with by Professor Treadsold in a statement which I saw attributed to him within the last month.  I cannot vouch for it, but he is an eminent authority, and the figure of 12.15 which he gives for England is the same as the American figure.  I understand that, in point of fact, the percentage variation would be only a very minor decimal, and that the 12 per cent. is a constant factor in all school-going populations both in Western Europe and America.  If that be the case, and if there are 12 per cent. of our children educationally sub-normal, <Col N="1027" /> then, I think, there is a real problem there to which we should face up.  In point of fact there is in this country a gentleman, I think in the service of the State, who spent a considerable period, from four to five and a half years, studying this problem in England and I think that his services and advice on this matter are available to the Government.</P>

      <P>Once the Minister says that, I am satisfied.  With regard to the Council of Education, let me say that I do not propose to flog that particular horse.  I think that every Deputy who has spoken in this debate has dealt with it.  However, lest the Minister should labour under any misapprehension, <Col N="1028" /> I want to assure him that I do not think he was successful in getting, for his assistance and advice, the most satisfactory council possible.  I will leave it at that.</P>
      <P>May I just make a passing reference to the teaching of Irish history?  Those who have had experience of dealing with pupils leaving primary schools, with particular reference to the question of Irish history, have on occasions expressed surprise at the lack of knowledge of recent Irish history which the children appear to possess.  I understand that the teaching of more recent Irish history, even the teaching of history in connection with Easter Week, 1916, and the Black and Tan war, is discouraged by the Department in the schools.  If the Department is discouraging the teaching of history, merely because it is recent, I think they are making it very difficult for us to build up national morale so that the nation can advance.  The Proclamation of Easter Week should hang in every schoolroom in the country.  I know that I recently addressed a parliamentary question to the Minister on this subject and that he voiced another point of view.  However, I return to the charge now in the hope that perhaps persistent dropping may wear away this particular stone.  We have a number of good national ballads which combine sound national sentiment with perfectly good literary English.  A greater attempt should be made to get the teachers in primary schools to teach these ballads to the children and to get the children to sing them.  In that way, pride of race, nationhood and national morale can be built up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going, at this stage, to refer in detail to the question of teachers' pay and teachers' conditions. I am not doing so because I do not hold the Minister primarily responsible. However, let me say that the day the Government set up a commission to inquire into the salaries of the national teachers, and then failed to implement the findings of that commission, they did a bad day's work for education in this country.  The Minister should always bear in mind that if we want to get the teachers to be enthusiastic about their work and energetic in their work of reviving the language&mdash;if we <Col N="1029" /> want them to be, as in many cases we expect them to be, leaders of public opinion and thought in country places &mdash;then we have to have the type of teacher who will be attracted by a decent salary.  To put the teacher on a lower plane than the junior executive officer in the Civil Service is, to my mind, a rejection of that high concept of the teacher and of his functions to which Pearse referred in the <i>Murder Machine.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the general question has been very well traversed. I would, however, like to make a few direct remarks concerning, particularly, the City of Dublin and the national schools in Dublin&mdash;and some of them in the constituency which Deputy Lehane, the previous speaker, and myself represent.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lehane is quite right when he speaks of dangerous and dilapidated buildings.  He knows that in the constituency which we both represent, at least one school should be closed.  It is in the vaults of a church and the teachers and pupils work there under terrible conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has yet received a report which was sent to the Minister for Health by the health committee of the Dublin Corporation. The Minister for Health informed us that he has sent on the report to the Department of Education for the Minister's consideration and attention.  The Dublin Corporation's chief school medical officer reported on 65 schools in the City of Dublin.  In every one of them she found a defect. There was one defect in two schools, two in six schools, three in six schools, four in nine schools, five in 13 schools, <Col N="1030" /> six in ten schools, seven in eight schools, eight in six schools and nine in five schools.  These defects were in heating, lighting, ventilation, floor space, cloakroom accommodation, drinking facilities, washing facilities, playground accommodation and sanitary provision.</P>
    <P>I am in complete accord with Deputy Lehane and wish to drive this point home to the Minister.  It should not be expected of school managers in certain parts of the city, in certain of the poorer parishes, that they should attend to these defects.  They should not be called upon to do repairs or attend to the work of extending their present schools or the provision of new schools.  The task which is imposed on managers in this city at the moment is practically an impossible one. There were 65 schools inspected by our chief medical officer and she has adversely reported on every one of them.  I would ask the Minister to direct his immediate attention to the rectification of those defects.</P>
    <P>The first school I mentioned ought to be closed and some practical approach must be made to that question in the immediate future.  It is not fair&mdash;it is criminal&mdash;to have teachers and children trying to carry on in conditions such as prevail in that particular school.  I know there is a background to it, but the Minister should come to grips with the problem and see what he can do to have a school erected in the district without delay. There are plenty of suitable derelict sites in the area.</P>
    <P>Last year, on this Estimate, I directed my remarks principally to vocational education and I would like to do the same now.  I am sorry to say that the appeals I made to the Minister last year have borne very little fruit.  In vocational education, school building has come practically to a standstill.  The last Minister, Deputy Derrig, when he was speaking here the other day, described vocational education as having become now the cinderella of education.  It is a very apt description.  Without accusing the Minister of neglecting technical education absolutely, I do accuse him of not putting the necessary force behind his <Col N="1031" /> arguments to the Minister for Finance, to see that the much needed schools are built in this city and that provision is made now for the building programme which was mooted many years ago.</P>
    <P>It is true we will be making additions.  There is Denmark Street, Aldboro' Parade, the new school at Mount Street and the new school at Clogher Road.  Clogher Road has not started yet.  Deputies may remember that, two years ago, I was asking in this House when the building of the vocational schools at Clogher Road would commence.  I believe I got an assurance at that time that it would not be too long.  However, what happened was that we went along to the Minister as a deputation from the vocational education committee and we wanted to know how we were to raise money for the building of the schools. The Minister said, quite frankly:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have no money.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Perhaps the Minister for Finance will be forthcoming with the money for the building of schools.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister said there was nothing in the kitty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>It was, as a matter of fact.  That was the actual expression. However, it does not matter.  There was nothing in the pool, anyway.  The Minister directed us to the Dublin Corporation.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Go to the Dublin Corporation and get them to raise £130,000, which will meet your commitments for a year&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;that was two years ago&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and at the end of that time we can talk about the finances for the future building programme.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year, having talked for a year about how we would raise the money, we went to the Dublin Corporation. They raised £130,000 and they are to be recouped 50 per cent.  That money now is already committed, it is spent, as on Denmark Street, Mount Street, <Col N="1032" /> Aldboro' Parade, Clogher Road, Ballsbridge, and the acquisition of sites, just £170,000 has been spent.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Vocational Education Committee find now that they have no money.  We must plan ahead.  We paid £10,000 for a site at Whitehall, £5,000 for a site at Killester, £2,500 for Emmet Road, Inchicore, and £1,500 at Crumlin Road; but we have no money to plan the building of these schools.  Clogher Road is finished, but I do not know when another vocational school will commence.  I understand that the quantities are not yet out for Clogher Road and when they are out we have to go back to the Department again.  Here I might say a word to the Minister in connection with delays.  When the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee decides to do a bit of painting to one of the schools, I think the Department should sanction that within a reasonable time, say a few weeks or a month.  But what happens?  Our clerk of works and our building inspector report to us and we decide that the school needs to be painted.  It goes down to the Department and passes through four or five stages there and then an inspector from the Department comes up to the school to see if it really does need to be painted, and about six months elapse before we arrive at that stage.  However, to get back to the finances, what I want from the Minister is this.  We require for our building programme for the sites mentioned, which we have purchased, approximately £750,000.  I want to know from him where this money is to come from.</P>

      <P>Under the 1930 Act, and after the 1930 Act the Government then paid £1 for every £1 the Dublin Vocational Committee paid.  That was at a time when Cork City and Limerick and Waterford were getting £6 for every £1 they spent.  The ratio to-day is that we get £2 for every £1, while <Col N="1033" /> Cork, Limerick and Waterford get £4 for every £1.</P>
      <P>When I asked the Minister recently whether he could give any guarantee about the raising of money by the Government for the building of vocational schools in this city, he replied to me that he could not.  There is an exceptional case to be made for Dublin, which is the receiving centre for all parts of Ireland.  We have no constant population here.  We have a constantly increasing population.  There is an influx from all over the country, so our problem is a constantly increasing one. The Minister said he could not guarantee that the Government would raise the money.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We pay £2 for every £1 raised by the local rates.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is right, up to a point, but it is not right in relation to the last £130,000 which the Dublin Corporation raised. That is capital expenditure.  The Government only gives £ for £.  That is a most unfair arrangement.  Capital expenditure should be borne by the State.  All future building in this city of vocational schools and national schools should be borne by the State but, in any event, if we were to keep to the old arrangement, we should get £2 for every £1.  We got only £ for £ on the last £130,000 which we raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned as a member of the City of Dublin Vocational Committee first and then I am concerned as a member of Dublin Corporation.  We have to strike a very stiff rate on the people here.  It is most inconsistent that the Minister should speak with one voice, saying: &ldquo;I have no money for you; go to the Dublin Corporation; they will raise it for you; they will increase the rates in doing so&rdquo;, while another member of his Party calls for a reduction of the rates.  It is not consistent. Until we get some solution of this question, scheme will be held up because I doubt very much that the corporation will raise any more money for this purpose.  Already, the ratepayers of this city, apart from capital expenditure, are levied 8½d. in the £ for vocational education.  That is a very fair contribution.  This city has <Col N="1034" /> grown and the need for vocational schools was never greater.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lehane spoke in general terms about the school-leaving age.  To talk at this stage about raising the school-leaving age in the City of Dublin is just nonsense.  If the school-leaving age is raised, as was suggested, to 15, where is the accommodation?  We have no accommodation in the City of Dublin.  The Minister should take a trip through Crumlin, Cabra, Donnycarney and the added areas of this city, and even through some of the central parts of the city, and see the number of boys between 14 and 16 years of age who are running around the streets.  There is no continuation accommodation for them.  Unfortunately, only too many of them are standing up against S.P. offices.  Let the Minister go around the places I have mentioned and see what is happening. Schools must be built.  As Deputy Lehane says, the best investment is in education.  We all know that.  Why does not the Minister ask for the capital moneys?  I would like him to tell me if there is anything for vocational education in the Budget for capital expenditure to help us to build the schools which we require.</P>
    <P>In the past, the Department, referring to vocational schools outside this city, talked of white elephants.  There will be no white-elephant schools in Dublin.  They are needed and they should be provided as the housing schemes are being built.  They should be part of the housing schemes.  I hope the Minister will be able to give us something definite and tell us, in the course of the next few weeks or so, where we stand, because now is the time to plan.  If, after two years, Clogher Road is not started, how long will it take to deal with Killester and Whitehall?  It takes a year to get the plans and more than a year, when the plans are drawn, to get final sanction from the Department.  I would ask the Minister to see that there is some expedition in these matters, particularly in relation to minor repairs which could be done readily and should be done readily.</P>
    <P>Last year, I mentioned to the Minister the difficulty which we had, and <Col N="1035" /> still have, in getting suitable teachers for certain classes, particularly for the classes in higher mechanical engineering. It is quite impossible for us. We have advertised time and again. We simply cannot get such teachers at the figure that is offered.  That is a great tragedy.  As I said last year, side by side with our advertisement, or an Electricity Supply Board advertisement, for a mechanical engineer, with top-notch qualifications, university qualifications, there are found advertisements by outside concerns offering, as a starting salary, £200 more than our maximum scale.  The time has come when there must be a revision of the salaries of all teachers in vocational schools.  It is not good enough.  I feel certain that the Minister agrees with me because he knows the facts.  They have not got, and they never got, the same consideration as national school teachers.  They are in a class to themselves and I think their work is at least as important as the work of a national teacher.  The Minister knows the necessity that there is here for vocational schools.  I have made it quite clear.  I hope he will act on the suggestions that have been put to him from time to time by the committee.</P>
    <P>Last night, the Minister was at a function at which he heard the senior students of our Municipal School of Music.  I believe the Minister will say that the work that is being done in that school is at least very creditable. I believe he will give a palm for certain performances at that function last night.  I know he was very impressed. I would like the Minister to come over some time to the Municipal School of Music and see the conditions under which our teachers have to work.  I am chairman of the sub-committee of the School of Music and I feel ashamed, when visiting lecturers come here from other countries or from the North of Ireland, to bring them into that place.  The conditions under which the full orchestra of over 70 performers, which the Minister heard last night, have to rehearse are intolerable. They have to open every window and throw open all the doors to get some <Col N="1036" /> air into the place.  I think the Minister knows that that place was built originally as a horse fire-brigade station.  Subsequently, it was taken over by the printing school, but it was not good enough for the printing school.  Anything is good enough for music&mdash;that is the attitude of the Department.  I hope there will be plans before the Minister shortly for even the reconstruction of the present premises.  That would suffice for the present.  There are 1,400 students there and they have to turn away about 600.  Students come from all parts of the city.  I hope the Minister will have the plans for reconstruction passed speedily and that, very soon thereafter, he will see that a proper site is secured and a proper building is erected for the Dublin School of Music, including a proper concert hall.</P>

      <P>A Chinn Chomhairle, seo ceann de na meastacháin is tábhachtaí a thig romhainn anseo ar feadh na bliana.  Níl amhras ar bith orainn faoin chúram trom atá ar an Aire Oideachais.  Is mór agus is trom an t-ualach ar thír bhig mar í seo corradh le naoi milleon punt in aghaidh na bliana ar son oideachais. Ach mór mar atá sé, níl éagaoin nó casaoid faoin airgead má bhionn an toradh againn atáimid ag dréim leis.</P>
      <P>Ariamh anall bhí meas agus urraim ar lucht léinn agus oideachais i nÉirinn agus maireann an meas céanna sin orthu inniu.  Ins na háiteacha is boichte san tír tá bród ar na daoine nuair a chí siad buachaill nó cailín ag dul ar aghaidh i gcúrasí léinn ag gnothú scoláireachta i ndiaidh scoláireachta agus ag baint feidhm as an intleacht a bhronn Dia orthú.</P>
      <P>Tuigeann gach duine againn, má tá an tír seo le dhul chun cinn agus ait ónorach a bheith aici imeasc na náisiún Críostúil nach dtig linn faillí nó neamháird a dhéanamh i ngnaithe oideachais.  Sé solas an léinn a lasas an slí dúinn a dhul ar aghaidh.  Caithfimid a bheith chomh hachomair le tíortha eile an domhain i gcúrsaí oideachais ón bhunscoil go dtí an ollscoil.  Agus cé gur trom an costas is beag duine atá á mhaíomh ar an ghlúin óg atá ag éirí aníos chugainn anois.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1037" /> Tá muinín láidir agam as an Aire go ndéanfaidh seisean a dhícheall cúrsaí oideachais a stiúradh agus a chur chun cinn mar is cóir sa tír seo. Molaim agus traoslaím dó as an méid atá déanta aige cheana féin agus níl sé acht dhá bhliain os cionn na Roinne. Bhi an t-ádh orrainn go bhfuair muid Aire Oideachais mar é, fear a bhfuil iomlán a chroí san obair agus croí fairsing Gaelach chomh maith.  San chéad dul amach ghlac sé as láimh na sean-tithe scoile a chóiriú agus a dheisiú, agus tithe scoile úra a thógáil má bhí siad a dhíobháil.  Bhí morán tithe scoile ar fud na tíre agus ba mhór an coir páistí beaga agus múinteoirí a choinneáil iontu.  Bhí na scoileanna seo gan díon ceart os a gcionn, na fuinneogaí briste, na hurláir lofa, ina shiocair tinnis agus aicídeacha do pháistí agus múinteoirí.  Buíochas do Dhia, tá athrú ar an scéal sin.  Tá tithe scoile úra a dtógáil i ngach cearn den tír anois agus gheobhaidh múinteoirí agus páistí saol úr agus sláinte iontu.  Tá súil agam go leanfar den obair.</P>
    <P>Bhí callán mór le seal blianta anuas faoi thuarastal na múinteoirí scoile. Ní gnách toit gan teine.  Bhí abhar leis an callán seo mar is feasach dúinn nach raibh cuid de na múinteoirí scoile ag fáil cothram na féinne, go háithrid na múinteoirí óga.  Deir cuid de na daoine nach bhfuil na múinteoirí a choíche gan gearán.  Is cinnte nach mbíonn mórán eile dá phlé acu ag a gcuid cruinnithe.  Acht sílim go bhfuil leigheas ag an Aire anois a fhágas na múinteoirí gan gearán.  Tá faoi cúirt nó caibideal síochána a chur ar bun a dhéanfas réiteach cothram eadar na múinteoirí agus an Roinn Oideachais. Beidh fáilte againn uilig roimh an chúirt seo nó ba léir dúinn go raibh barraíocht ama caite, caillte ar chúrsaí gearáin ó mhúinteoirí.  Cífear go gcaithfear an t-am seo feasta in obair scoile a rachas chun tairbhe don pháiste. Tá fhios againn go léir gur uasal an obair atá ag an múinteoir&mdash;an páiste óg a stiúradh ar bhealach an léinn agus an intinn óg a mhúnladh i ngrá Dé agus na gcomharsan.  Is maith is fiú an obair sin a dhéanamh go hionraice agus ná fágaimis aon chúis gearáin ag an té atá ina chionn.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1038" /> Níl acht cúpla rud eile ar mhaith liom trácht orthu.  Amuigh thiar sa Ghaeltacht agus áiteacha nach bhfuil scoil ghairm-oideachais mholfainn don Aire na páistí a choinneáil ar scoil go mbeidh siad cúig bliana déag nó sé bliana déag d'aois.  Is iad na blianta deireannacha seo a thógas na páistí an chuid is fearr de léann na bunscoile. Seo dhá bhliain atá caillte ar fad ar aos óg i mórán áiteacha sa tír nach bhfuil scoil gairm-oideachais.  Mholfainn don Aire an dhá bhliain seo a chur leis an scoil-aois sa chruth go bhfaíghidh na páistí seo iomlán tairbhe ar teagasc na mbunscol.</P>
    <P>Rud eile.  Anois ó tharla suim níos mó a bheith ag muintir na tíre i ngnaithe talmhaíochta nár cheart go mbeadh cúrsaí talmhaíochta mar abhar léinn ar chlár na scoile mar atá i Lochlainn agus tíortha eile?  Tá mórán de pháistí na tuaithe i muinín an tailimh le slí bheatha a bhaint amach agus beídh a gcuidiú de dhíth ar Shéamus Díolún ar ball le bláth a chur ar an tír.  Tá mí-shásamh fríd an tír faoi na ranganna ceard-oideachais atá againn mar nach bhfuil go leor múinteoirí ceirde i gcionn na rang seo. Tá ganntanas lucht ceirde againn agus na mílte tithe le tógáil againn.  Gearán atá coitianta faoi na ranganna seo is ea nach é an buachaill óg ar mhaith leisceird a fhoghlaim a gheobhas isteach acht sean-phínsinéir ón Arm no ón Gharda nó an fear siopa, fir nach bhfuil gá le ceird acu acht mar chaitheamh aimsire.  Tá na céadta buachaillí ó sé bliana déag go dtí fiche bliain ag siúl na sráideanna ar bhfearr iad i gcionn ceirde ná an sean-dream seo.  Ba mhaith liom go ndearcadh an tAire ar an taoibh seo den scéal.  Aontaím leis an Teachta Ó Liatháin gur cóir níos mó airgid a thabhairt le drámaíocht a chur chun cinn sa Ghaeltacht.  Níonn léiriú na ndrámaí seo maith mór do chúis na Gaeilge.  Aontaím leis fosta gur cóir hallaí a thógáil do lucht drámaíochta agus ceóil sa Ghaeltacht.  Ba mhaith le Muintir na Tíre hallaí agus rudaí mar sin a chur ar bun fosta.</P>
    <P>Tá mór-bhuíochas na tíre tuillte ag an Aire as an Chomhairle Oideachais a chur ar bun.  Níl amhras nach bhfaighfear tuigse, eagna agus comhairle ón <Col N="1039" /> bhaicle léanta seo a rachas chun socair do chúrsaí oideachais sa tír seo agus a réiteos mórán de na ceisteanna cruaidhe, casta a bhaineas le réim na hintleachta.

      <P>Tuigim go bhfuil a lán ceisteanna achrannacha faoin Ghaeilge ar an Meastachán seo agus is deacair a thuiscint cad é cuspóir an Chomh-Rialtais ar an gceist seo.  Dúirt an Taoiseach, ag tabhairt freagra dhó ar cheist Phairliminte, go raibh sé mar chuspóir ag an Rialtas an teanga d'athbheochaint.  Tá fhios againn go bhfuil cúis na Gaeilge slán faoi chúram an Aire Oideachais ach is eagal liom nach raibh an ghluaiseacht ag dul ar aghaidh mar ba chóir ná mar a bhí sí roimh teacht i réim don Chomh-Rialtas.  Is beag gríosú a friothadh ó Airí seachas an Aire Oideachais chun na Gaeilge d'aithbheochaint. Tá neamh-shuim i ngach Roinn sa Ghaeilge.  Ní úsáidtear an Ghaeilge i bhfógraí Stáit agus cuireadh Béarla ar stampa an Stáit don chéad uair ó bunaíodh é.  Islíodh caighdeán na Gaeilge ins na scrúduithe le haghaidh na Stáit-Sheirbhíse agus laghdaíodh an méid airgid a tugadh don Ghaeilge ó chiste an Stáit i leith irisí, leabhra téarmaíochta agus eile i mbliana agus níl an oiread i gcóir scoláireachta chun na Gaeltachta agus a bhí.  Níl an oiread téacsleabhar á gcur i gcló agus a cuireadh anuraidh féin.</P>
      <P>Más é tuairim an Rialtais gur fiú iarracht a dhéanamh chun an teanga a shábháil, ní foláir dóibh airgead a chaitheamh, go mór mhór sa Ghaeltacht agus san mBreac-Ghaeltacht chun na daoine óga, na daoine a bhfuil an Ghaeilge acu, a chomieád sa bhaile. Ní foláir hallaí agus faichí imeartha a sholáthar dóibh; ní foláir airgead a chur ar fáil don Chomhdháil chun timirí a sholáthar anseo agus ansiúd tríd an tír agus ní foláir páipéirí d'fhoilsiú i nGaeilge gach lá.  Ina theannta san, ní foláir cláir Gaeilge ar an radio a sholáthar agus pictiúirí Gaeilge a thaispeáint ins na pictiúrlanna. Mura ndeinimid sin, beidh ár n-iarrachtaí go léir ar son na Gaeilge caillte againn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1040" /> I avail of the accepted practice of the House to discuss the language question on this Estimate.  Since the foundation of this State, politicians of every shade of thought have been in agreement on this question.  Nobody with any kind of national outlook has been found to deny the truth of the statement of Davis that a nation without a language of its own is only half a nation.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach indicated to us some time ago in reply to a parliamentary question that it was the policy of the Government to endeavour to revive the language, but, apart from this assurance, we have little evidence that this is so.  Rather is the contrary the case.  Since assumption of office by the Government, the annual grant to Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge has been reduced; bilingual printing has been abandoned; Irish has disappeared from official Government forms; for the first time since the founding of the State, a commemorative stamp has been issued in the King's English; and, in our National University, our Irish boys and girls have been refused the Irish version of their examination papers.  In addition to the reduction in the grant to Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge last year, we had a reduction in the grants for books on Irish terms and for the Place Names Commission, which has been reduced practically to a state of impotence.  This year, these reductions have been followed by a further paring of grants aimed at fostering the Irish language and we have reduced grants for Gaeltacht scholarships, for Irish text-books and for the Irish Folklore Commission.</P>
    <P>If the Government, as indicated by the Taoiseach, consider that the revival of the language is a primary and fundamental aim of national policy, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Finance should see to it that the language will not be lost through lack of money.  If they consider that it is worth endeavouring to revive the language, money must be spent in endeavouring to revive it, particularly in the Gaeltacht and the Breac-Gaeltacht, to keep our boys and girls, the youth who have the language, at home. We must endeavour to establish halls <Col N="1041" /> and playing pitches for them, and must endeavour to publish a newspaper in the Irish language, as well as to provide good Irish programmes on the radio for them.  We must make use of the cinema and enable Comhdháil Náisiúnta to provide more Irish timirí throughout the country to direct the work of revival and to help in the organising of feiseanna, aeruíochta, cuirmeacha ceoil and dramaí Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>We would welcome a statement from the Minister as to what exactly is the attitude of the Government towards the Comhdháil.  It is evident from the fact that the grant this year is the same as the reduced grant of last year which occasioned the withdrawal of timirí throughout the country that there is no change of opinion with regard to it.  In view of the estimable purpose it has of organising, banding or uniting all the workers on behalf of the language revival in a movement towards the achievement of success, the purpose for which the Comhdháil was founded, and the confidence which friends of the language throughout the country have in the Comhdháil achieving success, one would expect better treatment for it from the Government. The Minister might also say if he has studied and examined the memorandum embodying the result of the Comhdháil's studies and experience submitted by it and, if so, what is the result of his examination.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of films as an instrument for the revival of the language.  I think that great use could be made of films in the promotion of the language.  Short Gaelic talkies might be provided to permit of Irish being heard for a short while&mdash;say, ten minutes&mdash;during every picture show. The cost would not be very great. Irish in the cinema is absolutely essential if 90 per cent. of the school work is not to be rendered fruitless.  In the radio, we have a powerful instrument for the revival of the language.  Much valuable work has been done already by the radio in broadcasting talks to learners of the language, but the result is not entirely satisfactory.  We have to go much further and, in its Irish features, Radio Éireann should make a particular effort to build up programmes <Col N="1042" /> which will have a special attraction for our youth, since it is with the youth that the saving of the language lies.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister has established a special inspectorate for the Gaeltacht areas and has assigned an inspector to each of them&mdash;Tirconail, Mayo and Galway and Cork, Kerry and Waterford&mdash;and that these inspectors have received instructions to regard the maintenance of the language in these areas not entirely as a school problem but as a problem of regional and national significance, and have been requested to report on the state of the language in these areas and on the conditions which militate against the fostering or help to foster the language.  We would be glad to learn if reports have been made by these inspectors and what is the nature of them.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling abroad that certain Ministers of State have little sympathy with or interest in the revival of the language.  This impression has been brought about by such incidents as the refusal of the Minister for Health to declare a knowledge of Irish as essential for the post of resident medical superintendent of a hospital in Galway, which one might say is in the heart of the Gaeltacht, and the issuing by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs of a commemorative stamp in English.  Indifference at the top is bound to have a detrimental effect on the people generally.  If such an attitude exists amongst Ministers, it should not be tolerated by a Government which professes to be concerned for the welfare of the language.  It does seem extraordinary that there are actually people in the country, and even Deputies here, who still carry on a campaign against what is mistakenly termed the &ldquo;compulsory&rdquo; teaching of Irish in the schools and who call for a reversion to the system of teaching Irish merely as an ordinary subject in the curriculum.  It is almost incredible that there are still Deputies unaware of the fact that the only compulsion in regard to the teaching of Irish is contained in the regulation which states that &ldquo;Irish shall be taught for one hour in every school where there is a teacher competent to teach it&rdquo;. <Col N="1043" /> That regulation applies equally to arithmetic, history, geography and English.  These are all compulsory subjects.  Surely no one would suggest that it should be left to the discretion of the teacher as to whether or not he would teach arithmetic.  Why should it be done in the case of Irish? May I repeat what I said when speaking on this matter last year: there should be no question of a reversion to a state of affairs under which those people who wish to reject or despise the language should be put in a position to do so.</P>
    <P>In view of the increase in the school-going population, which is in itself a very welcome trend, the problem arises as to the provision of teachers to meet the demand.  It is a fact that the existing supply of teachers is dwindling and that it is not sufficient to meet the demand.  That is brought home in no uncertain fashion to those teachers who seek to secure qualified substitutes. They find it impossible to do so.  I am sure the Department must be aware of the position since in two out of every three cases they have to sanction the appointment of substitutes with nothing more than a leaving certificate.  This shortage is also reflected in the cities and towns where the schools are badly understaffed.  In some schools teachers are in control of classes numbering up to 70 or 80 pupils.  Possibly that may to some extent be brought about through lack of accommodation, but it is something that should not be allowed to continue indefinitely.  The children in these schools do not get the education to which they are entitled.  The most the teachers can do is to keep the classes quiet.  That is particularly true of the infant and lower classes.  If the Commission on Youth Unemployment recommends an extension of the school-leaving age and the Government accepts that recommendation the shortage of teachers will be further accentuated. With a view to providing against such a contingency and to alleviating the present position the Minister might consider the possibility of extending the facilities for the training of teachers and the withdrawing of the regulation under which women <Col N="1044" /> teachers are at present compelled to retire on marriage.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of provision, maintenance, heating, cleaning and sanitation of schools.  The present system appears to be about 100 years old.  There seems to have been little or no change for the past century.  The system requires drastic change since it is completely unsatisfactory.  Schools are required in which the teachers and pupils can work under hygienic conditions. This year the Minister has given back £3,000 of the £30,000 cut last year. To my mind £63,000 for this service is entirely inadequate.  It is suggested by one Deputy that the insanitary conditions of our schools may be laid at the doors of the managers since, under the rules and regulations, the manager is responsible for the heating and cleaning of the schools.  He is recouped any expenditure he has to make by the Department, but this sum is withheld in the event of a manager failing to secure or appoint a caretaker who will be responsible for the heating and cleaning of the schools.  Anyone who has experience in this matter knows quite well that this regulation cannot be complied with because of the miserable allowance provided for that purpose by the Department.  Consequently the work of keeping the schools clean and warm falls on the pupils working under the supervision of the teacher.  There is something very radically wrong in a system which leaves such important matters in relation to the health and education of our children to such haphazard arrangements.  It is time some change was made.  Our teachers and our children should not be condemned to work long hours in insanitary schools.  Our children should not be compelled to carry out tasks which sap their vitality and their health. The Minister for Health is interested in the eradication of tuberculosis.  I suggest he should direct his attention towards bringing about some change in a system which shows an utter disregard for the health of our young people. Sufficient money is not provided for the maintenance and upkeep of our schools. Until such time as something is done to improve our schools they will continue to constitute a danger to the health of our children and a hindrance <Col N="1045" /> to their education.  I appeal to the Minister to expedite the erection of proper school buildings to accommodate our children.  In that connection I would bring to his notice the necessity for providing a playground with every new school.  No adequate provision is made for the children's recreation at the present time.  They spend their recreation with their backs against the school wall, miserable and cold, or romping round in muddy pools. I do not think there should be much difficulty in providing a proper playground in the country districts at any rate.  It should not be difficult to secure land for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Of the total sum for primary education this year, £895,940 is in respect of increases in teachers' salaries reflecting the revised scales from the beginning of the financial year.  One cannot refrain from remarking here how unfairly the teachers have been treated by the present Government and how sadly disillusioned they must be.  One cannot refrain from remarking how far removed the awards are from what they were led to expect.  The teachers must now realise that their position is no better, if not worse, than it was under the Fianna Fáil Government which guaranteed them a revision of their salary scales from September, 1949, from which date increases would have been granted rather than from 1st January, 1950, as they have been under the present Government.  In dealing with teachers' pensions, it can be said for Fianna Fáil that they were honest in this matter.  They refused to set up a commission of inquiry.  They preferred to deal with the matter themselves in conjunction with the Department.  They were frank and open and shouldered the responsibility themselves.  The present Government did not do that.  In an endeavour to gain time and to pass the baby on to somebody else to hold, they set up the Roe Commission, the majority report of which they turned down, accepting instead the report of the minority consisting of officials of their Departments. To my mind, the Government were in honour bound to accept, to a limited degree in any case, the findings of the <Col N="1046" /> Roe Commission which they themselves set up and the personnel and the terms of reference of which were made known to the members of the Government before the commission ever sat.  Their failure to do so was a betrayal of the teachers, particularly by those Parties in the Government who secured the support of the teachers by election promises of support and help for the advancement of their claims.  I feel sure that their failure to implement those promises will be reflected in the strength of those Parties after the next general election.</P>
    <P>There is nothing more I have to say, except to stress the need for something more definite than a merely formal statement to the effect that the revival of the Irish language continues to be Government policy&mdash;something positive, some vigorous action which will not alone convince us of their sincerity in the matter, but which will remove from the anti-national element in the country any satisfaction which they may derive from feeling that the language question is being put in the background and is not receiving the attention which it should get.</P>

    <P>Having made these few remarks in Irish, I regret that my knowledge of the language is not sufficient to enable me to make my entire speech in Irish in view of the practice nowadays to devote one's speech largely to the furtherance of the language in the course of this debate.  It has been suggested that unless we in this generation succeed in reviving the language it possibly will never be revived.  I am inclined to agree that that is true.  I have often wondered why, after so long a period in which the language has been taught so diligently in the schools, so few people use Irish in the ordinary course of their lives.  Last year I suggested, and I am still of the same opinion, that it was lack of moral courage which prevented people who knew the language from speaking it.  I also venture to suggest that, side by side with that lack of moral courage, there is also a lack of opposition.  I have always maintained that it takes opposition to bring out the best in anybody. In the days when the Minister and his predecessor learned the language it was unpopular to learn Irish and, because they were Irishmen, they insisted upon learning it.  I feel that if we had some national crisis at present&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have too many national crises at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We probably have too many.  But if we had a national crisis as regards the revival or extinction of the language, or if it was brought home forcibly enough to the young people, I believe that the language would get the greatest fillip it has got since the revival of the national spirit from 1916 onwards.  We have often been told that the vast majority of the people have no interest in the revival of the language, but the representation of Deputies in this House who have a knowledge of the language or, if they have not a knowledge of the language, have a keen desire that the language should be restored, gives that argument <Col N="1048" /> the lie.  I am sure that at least 30 per cent. of Deputies can speak Irish, well or badly, and that at least 95 per cent., whether they can speak Irish or not, are intensely interested in the revival of the language.  Therefore, it must be presumed that the vast majority of the people want the language revived.  The Minister cannot be accused of any apathy in that respect.  Even though many of his colleagues are accused of it, the general public and those of us who are interested in the revival of the language have at least the assurance that one who is keen on the language himself is in charge of the administration of the Department mainly responsible for its revival.</P>
      <P>The last speaker spoke in great detail about the methods that should be adopted and the systems that should be encouraged as a means for the revival of the language.  I suggest to the Minister, if he has not done so already, that he should examine some of these suggestions because I believe there were sound proposals in what the Deputy said.  It is very easy to give lip service here to the question of the revival of the Irish language because it might be popular in a certain direction, but some practical steps that may not have been thought of before, to make not only the learning of the language but the use of it in everyday life more attractive, are necessary.  It is no use for everybody to be depending on the Government.  Unfortunately, in modern times, there is too much dependence on the Government of the day to get things done in almost every direction.  But self-help is the greatest weapon we have in any campaign or in the attainment of objects which we set before ourselves.  If each person who has a knowledge of the language was prepared to use it on as many occasions as he can, I think that such an effort on the part of individuals would be more successful than anything which can be done by local authorities or the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good deal of reference has been made, and I presume will be made, in this debate to the Council of Education. The Minister, after something over two years in office, has honoured his promise to set up that council.  I <Col N="1049" /> do not know if he ever, in the course of the last two years, anticipated that he would select a group which would meet with general approval.  I am sure he did not because the Minister, whether on his own or with others, was a selection committee and I do not believe there was ever a selection committee who selected a team, no matter under what code, that satisfied everybody. It was impressed on the Minister that he should select that council on vocational lines.  In his opening remarks he pointed out the reasons why he could not do so.  I think if he did not adopt a completely vocational criterion, as the basis of selection, he should have been a little more vocational in some respects.  I shall not elaborate or particularise as to what groups or organisations I think should have been represented but I feel, from a casual glance at the occupations of those who form the council, that they are too much connected with the Department in one way or another. The Department has control over all branches of education and most of those who are members of the council are associated in one way or another with some branch of education.  There are very few on the council who have not got such a connection.  I feel that if the Minister went a little outside the types of people who represent some branch of education, or who have some particular interests in a branch of education, that he would possibly have succeeded in getting together a better council.  I know at least one individual on the council who, as far as I know, has no connection whatever with any branch of education.</P>

      <P>Perhaps he is a parent. However, I feel that if the Minister could have succeeded in getting a few more men such as he, there would be a far better prospect of solving whatever difficulties face our system of education at present.  It also occurred to me to suggest to the Minister that he might have considered appointing somebody more directly representative of students in the country.  I do not know how long the council is going to sit or what it is expected to do ultimately, whether it is going to make recommendations from year to year indefinitely in regard to certain things that it considers the Minister should do in regard to education, but I feel if he had one of the people who was at the other end of the cane in the school such a member might be able to make valuable suggestions.  The actual selection of that individual or individuals I agree would present considerable difficulty.  I do not think it would be suggested that a young lad going to a primary school would be fit to sit on the council, but I would say that in secondary schools there are plenty of young boys and girls who might be able to act on the council at least for a period.  The selection could be left to the principal of a particularly large school like the O'Connell Schools in Dublin or the North Monastery in Cork.  If there is going to be a change in the personnel of the council from time to time, I suggest to the Minister that he would consider the suggestion of getting students to act, at least for a time, on the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been inevitably made to the Roe Commission, and the Roe Report.  I shall refer only to one or <Col N="1051" /> two aspects of that report.  I shall preface my remarks by saying that many people, teachers particularly, were genuinely disappointed on finding the majority report was turned down by the Government.  I, for one, and I have no connection with education, and many others thought that the report of this commission was more or less to be accepted by the Government. I do not say for a moment that a specific promise was given before the commission was set up, but having regard to the statements made by the various parties that now constitute the Government or support the Government, the public was inevitably driven to that conclusion, particularly the teachers.  One can sympathise with them when they found that the majority findings were practically completely ignored.</P>
    <P>As the last speaker pointed out, the previous Administration were honest enough in refusing to set up a commission such as this.  I think they based their decision on almost unassailable grounds.  They felt that they, as the Government, were charged with the levying of taxes on the people and the payment of public moneys and, therefore, that they only as a Government should have any say in the disposal of moneys out of the Exchequer.  The Minister for Agriculture, when he was in opposition, accepted that principle.  I quote from the Dáil Debates of the 26th October, 1946, column 232:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not agree with Deputy Norton that a democratic Government can delegate to any arbitration tribunal the duty of determining the salaries, wages and conditions of employment of State servants whose salaries and wages are charged upon the Exchequer.  I do not believe that any democratic Government can divest itself of the responsibility for making the final recommendation in regard to that matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the feeling of the Minister for Agriculture then, and it is reiterated in the then Deputy's closing statement in that particular debate. The Government, having referred teachers' salaries to this Roe Commission, <Col N="1052" /> thought fit to adopt only the recommendations&mdash;they were almost in entire agreement with the recommendations&mdash;of the three ministerial nominees on the commission.  That made their action all the more disappointing to the people who were depending on this commission to have their grievances redressed.  The Minister said he was prepared to adopt in principle the recommendations of the majority report.  He is reported at column 824 of the Parliamentary Debates, Thursday, 20th April, as having said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The main recommendations in matters of principle made in the majority report were accepted by the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>However, I think I can point out one instance in which the recommendations, in principle, of the majority report were not accepted by the Government.  On page 10 of the published report of the Roe Commission, Appendix No. 1, paragraph (b), sub-paragraph (ii), it is stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is recommended that all teachers, trained and untrained, be placed in the revised scales at the point appropriate to their placing in the existing scales or at the point they would have reached had these scales been in operation from the date of their first appointment as a teacher if it is more favourable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They did go to the extent of accepting this recommendation in principle in so far as untrained teachers were concerned, but they did not do so with regard to trained teachers.  If they adopted that recommendation of the majority on the Roe Commission it would have had the effect of giving all trained teachers who had 18 years' satisfactory service the maximum salary on 1st January, 1950&mdash;that is the date selected by the Minister himself. However, the placing that was imposed by the Government ensures that a trained teacher who was not rated as highly efficient could not be placed at the maximum on 1st January, 1950, even though he might have had 20 years' satisfactory service.  I use the word &ldquo;imposed&rdquo; deliberately because the word &ldquo;imposed&rdquo; is the only way <Col N="1053" /> in which I can describe it.  Before the highly efficient grading was abolished I believe there were about 30 per cent. of the national teachers in that grading. That meant that there were seven out of ten national teachers who were not graded as highly efficient.  As a result of the placing that was imposed by the Government in this particular respect seven out of every ten trained teachers are at the moment debarred from receiving the maximum salary, even though many of them have given many years beyond the supposed qualifying number of years of satisfactory service.</P>
    <P>I have some examples here.  Married men teachers&mdash;I am referring to trained teachers&mdash;retiring before 1st April, 1952, and single women and men teachers retiring before 1st April, 1954, can never attain the maximum salary and consequently cannot qualify for a maximum pension even though they may have given 40 or more years of satisfactory service.  I ask the Minister, in view of his statement that the Government had in principle accepted the recommendations of the majority report, to re-examine this particular matter.</P>
    <P>It is rather difficult for me, not being a teacher and not being closely in touch with this problem, to deal fully with this matter, but I have been requested to put certain aspects before the Minister and I trust he will give my observations due consideration.  It is noted with a certain amount of satisfaction that the Minister has promised conciliation and arbitration machinery in the current year.  There are many problems outstanding, matters that were not dealt with by the Roe Commission or implemented by the Government on the findings of that commission. I believe the grievances of the teachers will be met in some way by the setting up of this machinery and ultimately by the acceptance on the Government's part of some of the recommendations following the deliberations of the arbitration machinery.</P>
    <P>It was rather surprising that the Minister devoted only four and a half lines of his statement to the question of the large numbers of pupils in classes.  This, I am told, is a matter <Col N="1054" /> that the Minister was particularly active about when he was in opposition. It is very easy to harangue and barge a Minister when one feels one has no responsibility for carrying out what one might feel inclined to propose.  I believe the Minister when in opposition was genuine in what he said about reducing the size of classes. Many Deputies have spoken on this point here and I will not elaborate on it to any extent.  It has been said that in a class of 50 or even 40 pupils the teacher has enough to do to keep order, irrespective altogether of trying to teach the children.</P>
    <P>I know the main problem is one of providing accommodation.  When that is dealt with the problem will then arise of providing extra teachers.  Having raised the capital to build the schools there will be a consequential drawing on the Exchequer for the payment of the teachers and capitation grants.  This is a matter that the Minister should not put on the long finger. Every speaker agrees that there is an urgent housing problem apart from the building of schools.  Unless this problem is tackled immediately we will find ourselves eventually with classes out of all proportion to what a teacher could manage.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated in reply to a question by Deputy Derrig a fortnight ago that there were about 206 classes with about 60 pupils in each in Dublin. I think if a similar question were asked about Cork the Minister would find a proportionate number of classes in that city with 60 pupils or over.  I know it is impossible&mdash;I was once a pupil teacher&mdash;for any teacher to teach a class of 60 pupils or even a class of 40 pupils and give due attention to the shortcomings of individual students. Everybody knows that in a class, no matter how small it may be, some students will be a little backward. With some individual attention these pupils might be brought up to the standard of their colleagues, but in a large class that is utterly impossible; not only will the dull student suffer, but in the long run the clever student will suffer.  I know the Minister is interested in it, and I feel that he will remedy that position as soon as he can.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1055" /> With regard to the school building programme, I would ask the Minister not to carry it out in a niggardly fashion.  Most of the schools that are being built at present, as far as one can observe driving through the country, are no bigger than large houses.  The playground accommodation is the very minimum.  That should not be so, particularly in cities.  Not only should there be playgrounds of the ordinary size, but, in any school building programme envisaged, playing fields and, if possible, an indoor gymnasium and ultimately swimming pools, should be provided.  I think that far too little attention is being devoted to the athletic aspect of education in this country.  When I was a student learning Latin one of the first maxims I learned by heart and one which I have always remembered, was <i>mens sana in corpore sano.</i>  It would be impossible, I think, to retain a <i>mens sana</i> in the conditions that pertain at present in most of our schools, both rural and urban.</P>
    <P>Personally, I am very interested in the provision of swimming pools.  I know it is beyond the ken of any one manager or of any one school to provide swimming facilities.  I am not now referring to outdoor swimming pools, but to indoor facilities for swimming. It is only when adequate provision is made in that direction that we can include swimming in the curriculum of the daily programme.  Our climate is such that outdoor swimming can only be indulged in, with reasonable safety, for something less than three months in the year, and, unfortunately, these months clash with the long school vacation period.  I would ask the Minister, therefore, in his future school building programme to ensure, in so far as he can, that adequate playing fields will be provided, and, in densely populated areas, to try and secure, if possible, the provision of indoor swimming facilities for one school or a combination of schools.  It is only in that manner that we can provide education in athletic thought and in body building for our presentday pupils.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1056" /> Last year I had occasion to refer to the subject of vocational education. Deputy McCann has referred to it in great detail so far as the City of Dublin is concerned.  I think it has been fairly well provided for generally throughout the country.  Deputies, generally, will admit that in most of our country towns the most attractive building is the vocational school.  Most of these were erected during his term of office by the Minister's predecessor. I would like if the Minister, in his future programme, would adopt the same attractive design, not only for vocational schools but for national schools.</P>
    <P>I pointed out last year that the pupils' minds were not directed early enough in their scholastic course to a career on vocational lines.  The desire always was to cram for an examination and to forget the ultimate object of education.  I think that if, at an early stage in their career, the thoughts of pupils were directed on vocational lines, we would not find the position we have at present whereby our universities are so full that the majority of their graduates have to emigrate.  That applies particularly to doctors and engineers.  I said last year that there was nothing to be ashamed of in being a good artisan.  On the contrary, there is everything to be proud of.  We had in the school that I attended a vocational branch which was described as a trades preparatory school.  If that system were adopted in other schools it would, I think, be far better for the future of this nation.  Lately, we have been lamenting the lack of skilled labour.  As long as the trade unions maintain their present attitude to entrance to industry, and as long as our education is directed too much to the higher level, we shall never succeed in overcoming that shortage.</P>
    <P>I was surprised that the Minister, in his statement, did not refer to the compulsory continuation course in Cork.  Naturally, that question goes side by side with that of raising the school-leaving age.  I forget whether the course which was started and is in operation in Cork was extended to Limerick.  It has been in operation in Cork for several years.  I would be interested to hear the Minister say <Col N="1057" /> whether he has found it a success there and whether he proposes to extend it to other areas.  I believe myself that, as long as the school-leaving age remains at 14, such a course is highly desirable.  It has been a considerable success in Cork.  The teachers have told me that the students who come there enjoy it, unlike pupils who go to other schools.  Some of those students in the City of Cork work in cinemas or in shops and more of them are employed as messengers on bicycles.  Generally speaking, the school makes provision for those who live in the immediate city area.  I would suggest to the Minister that provision for that type of school should be made for pupils between the ages of 14 and 16 who live in the suburbs of the City of Cork.  These are some of the matters to which I was asked to direct the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary to go into detail with respect to the salaries and conditions of national teachers.  One has not been hearing many complaints from the secondary teachers as an organised body.  That does not mean that they have not grievances or that they are completely satisfied with their conditions of service.  The secondary teachers are anxious that they should be put on a par with the national teachers in the matter of a gratuity on retirement and an increase in their pensions.  The national teachers have been granted a gratuity lately, and I know, of course, that their pensions were increased to some degree.  I would ask the Minister to examine that problem and, if he is doing it, to expedite the granting of retiring gratuities to secondary teachers and also to consider the question of increasing their pensions.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I desire to raise and which is becoming almost a hardy annual is the rent allowance paid to teachers in the Cork suburbs. I understand that there are two scales of rent allowances&mdash;county borough and rural.  The county borough scale in Cork is something in the region of £30 per annum whereas for any teacher residing outside the borough the scale is only £10.  Many schools in Cork are, strictly speaking, outside the borough. However, anybody with a knowledge <Col N="1058" /> of Cork knows that the borough boundary is very limited having regard to the actual size of the city.  One can walk from one side of the city boundary to another in something like 30 or 40 minutes but it would take much longer to walk from one end of the city to another, as things are at present. Many of the teachers in Cork are teaching in schools which are situated outside the borough and they are living in houses outside the borough.  Nevertheless, they are subject to the same standards and the same cost of living as their colleagues who reside within the boundary.  A special case should be made in such instances.  Teachers living within a matter of a couple of hundred yards of the Cork borough are given the same allowance as, say, a teacher who lives in the Dingle Peninsula.  It should be remembered that, in the case of a teacher who lives just outside the Cork borough, he will have to pay something like £2 or £3 a week for a house whereas the teacher in Dingle and elsewhere can get it for much less. I asked the Minister last year to consider that matter.  Deputy Sheehan raised it a few weeks ago by way of question in this House.  I think the Minister's reply was that he was giving the matter some consideration.  I appeal to him to expedite a decision in this respect.</P>
    <P>A matter which I did not think of but to which Deputy Lehane referred is the teaching of modern Irish history in the schools.  When I was at school we learned very little Irish history which dealt with the period after the Fenian Rising.  Modern Irish history was completely ignored.  I took it then that it was because modern history was too recent to be included in history books. Deputy Lehane has stated that he understands there is some reluctance on the part of the Government to permit modern Irish history to be taught in the schools.  I think that that state of affairs is very unfair to the growing population and I agree with Deputy Lehane that it is damaging to the attainment of our national ideals.  I agree that it would be difficult to get a completely dispassionate account of what occurred from the days of Parnell onwards&mdash;particularly from 1916 onwards. <Col N="1059" /> Nevertheless, surely it should be possible to arrange that a factual statement be included as a chapter or two chapters in some of the history books.  Until I had time to read it for myself and until I took an interest in politics, I was almost completely ignorant of the events that led up to the establishment of this Parliament.  I know for a fact that many of my comrades in school and that many of those who came after me are almost as ignorant on that subject as I was.  I think that it is unfair and that it is damaging from the national point of view.  I would ask the Minister to examine the matter and to see if some factual declaration of events could be committed to permanent record for the benefit of the present school-going children.</P>
    <P>The Minister was not in the House for all of my speech.  When he has time to examine my remarks, I would ask him to give them sympathetic consideration.  I assure him that if some of them receive his favourable consideration my contribution to the debate on this Estimate in the coming year will not be as long as it has been to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Almost all of the things I wished to say have been said.  I rise to emphasise one or two points which have been raised.  Just before the present Government came into being there was a serious difference of opinion between the present Minister's predecessor and the teachers on the question of remuneration.  I would almost say that the treatment of the teachers was made an issue at the election.  Certain promises were made and, whilst I agree that the present Minister has opened the door a wee little bit for the consideration of these grievances, I want to express my disappointment, with other members of the House, that the Roe Commission Report was not fully implemented. When that commission was appointed I, in company with others who were critical of the previous Minister for Education, thought that it was a fine way of finding out the grievances and of getting independent men to make <Col N="1060" /> recommendations.  I must say that I thought that the recommendations of that independent body would be given effect to.  I wish to express my disappointment at the failure of the Government to give effect to the recommendations of the Roe Commission.</P>
      <P>I would be glad if the Minister would consider favourably the giving of an increased grant for the heating and cleaning of schools, not alone in Dublin but all over Ireland.  The grant they have at present for the cleaning and heating of the schools would hardly give one fire per day in the schools. I am a member of the school meals committee and in that capacity I have visited schools.  On very frosty days I have seen fires which were practically black out.  I have asked those responsible why that was so, why the children should have to sit and shiver in their classrooms, because everybody knows that children cannot absorb teaching when they are suffering from desperate cold.  I was told that the supply of fuel had been exhausted due to the high cost.  The Government should ask the managers of the schools now what they consider a reasonable amount for the cleaning and the heating of the schools.</P>
      <P>I have already said that I am a member of the school meals committee and that in that capacity I visit schools. I have seen classes of up to 60 and 70 children in the City of Dublin.  How can any one teacher, either male or female, handle that number of children at one time and impart a knowledge of the subjects which they have to teach them?  I must say that I think it is an impossible task.  I have seen classes of anything from 30, 40, 50 and in one case 64 children.  That is not fair to the teacher.  It is not fair to the children and it is not fair to the parents who think that their children are being properly educated.  They could not be educated under such difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things which was brought to the notice of the Dublin Municipal Council recently is that the tenement quarter is being cleared, the houses are falling down rapidly and the municipality is spending some millions of pounds, thanks to the Government, in <Col N="1061" /> building up new housing areas.  A very large population is being transferred from the city to the county areas and the cost of the schools is fabulous.  The Government should make up their minds to increase the grants for new schools.  It is not fair to ask the parish managers to accept this heavy burden, which is due to the housing conditions in the city.  When the municipality makes up its mind to send the people to the outskirts, they have to meet a very high cost for building schools.  The grant is not sufficient. The parishioners who are transferred and who have to pay high rents and high bus fares are faced with this problem of their duty to subscribe to the parish managers' funds for the building of schools.  That is a further imposition on them.  The whole method of financing the building of schools requires serious consideration by the Government, with a view to improving the position and making the burden a little easier for the parish managers.</P>
    <P>The present Government and the present Minister have opened the door a little to give some encouragement to the teachers.  They have just barely opened the door to have certain grievances remedied.  Everyone I heard speaking here referred to the fact that a discontented staff, a staff feeling that its efforts are not being appreciated in a practical manner, is the worst thing possible in dealing with the children in any country.  I think it was the previous Minister, Deputy Derrig, who said that there are very many openings now in industry and that there is much encouragement to travel, and whilst we have good teachers willing to impart of their very best to the children we should do something to hold those teachers and not allow them to be encouraged to go to other countries or into business and so leave the profession.  It is a very fine, a splendid and an honourable profession, but if it does not pay as well as those not so honourable, you cannot expect the teachers to stay in the profession and give of their very best.  I hold they are worthy of more attention from the Government than they have got in the past.</P>
    <P>Recently, I found myself asking the Minister a question as to whether he <Col N="1062" /> would state when he would be able to announce increases in the present increments of salary for secondary teachers.  He said that an application had been received from the Association of Secondary Teachers for an increase in the incremental salaries fixed in November, 1946, but he was not at present in a position to say when the consideration of the matter would be completed.  November, 1946!  I think the Government and the Minister have had plenty of time to give consideration to that question and to give the secondary teachers some encouragement. I am aware that when a deputation waited on him to discuss the question, he informed them to the effect that the delay would not be any disadvantage to them, since the matter was being considered; but from 1946 to 1950 is a little too long.  I would ask him and his Department to come to a decision as early as possible and give the secondary teachers the consideration which they deserve.</P>
    <P>I also express my disappointment that the pensioned teachers did not get what most Deputies thought they would get when the present Minister took office.  I will give him credit for having opened the door&mdash;he has not banged it on them&mdash;and I earnestly hope he will give consideration to any further claims they may make, so that they may live in reasonable comfort and have something to enable them to meet the high cost of living.  Those on a fixed pension or on a fixed salary know the difficulty there is in meeting the weekly budget.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister, too, to remember a point which is forgotten by a good many people.  The population of Dublin used to be remembered by the number of days in the year, in that the population was 365,000 some ten years ago.  The population to-day is 500,000 and the school buildings have not been extended accordingly.  Therefore, you have classes double the size, because of the increased population.  We have reason to know of the increase in the municipality, which is making an effort to house them.  The onus is thrown on the Archbishops to find proper school accommodation for them.  I earnestly appeal to the Minister to give consideration to the few points I <Col N="1063" /> have made and, as a result of that consideration, have a contented teaching staff in this country.  We owe a lot to them.  I have heard, year after year, over the last 20 or 25 years in this House, lip service being paid to the teachers.  While it is nice to hear good things being said about you, and thanks and appreciation of your work, whether it be in the teaching profession or in politics, lip service is no good; it is money that counts.  The teachers ought to be paid decent salaries and the pensioned teachers, who did so much for the country in the days gone by, should be given decent pensions.</P>
    <P>I am tempted also by the reference made by the last speaker to history teaching, to say that it is an appalling thing that people forget the period from Parnell onwards to John Redmond. People forget that in that period only so far back as 1912 in the British House of Commons they had a Home Rule Bill passed for 32 counties of Ireland.  People forget that, also, it was the only Act of Parliament passed in the British House of Commons which was never made effective. That was a Home Rule Bill for the 32 counties.  There are children, and there are some senior men in public affairs in this country who do not know that, or if they do they want to forget it.  I remember the time, and I remember poor Joe Devlin saying in 1914: &ldquo;In six months' time we will have the green flag flying in the 32 counties and flying over College Green.&rdquo;  That is forgotten.  The last speaker was perfectly right, that the children of to-day, and some of the men of to-day, do not know of that period.  They ought to be told about it and they ought to be told of the days of the Land League and of the days when Irishmen had no votes unless they owned property. They ought to be told the events of that period.  They ought to be informed of the fight against conscription by the Redmond Party.  All these things should be brought out.  I hope they will be published in our school books and that they will not be given as events seen through a glass darkly but as facts and truth.  From an educational point of view, it is worth while.  I congratulate the Minister <Col N="1064" /> on opening the door a little bit. I hope he will push it open still further. I hope he will push the door of the Department of Finance a little further and remedy the grievances of the teachers and pensioned teachers.</P>

      <P>Nearly every aspect of education has been covered very well in this debate.  I do not propose to say much except on a few points in which I am very interested.  They are points that I brought up again and again when opportunity offered.  I want first to express my disapproval of very large schools, schools of the type that were built in Crumlin and Drimnagh. They were a terrible mistake.  I thought so at the time and said so at the time they were put up.  I believe more strongly now that they were simply a great mistake.  I mention this point to start with because the Minister is now faced with the question of providing schools for a very extensive built-up area and will be faced with two or three problems of that sort within a few years.  I hope that the mistake we made with regard to Crumlin and Drimnagh will not be repeated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear that because the large school has very little individuality about it.  It is a huge machine and must be run as such. Otherwise, having regard to the great number of children and the extent of the building, there would be complete turmoil during the whole school day. Things have to be machined in a way that is not necessary and that is not done in smaller schools.  Some schools are so large that even the teachers in them do not know each other intimately. Certainly the children do not get to know each other intimately. The school, as far as possible, should be an extension of the home.  Huge institutions of that sort bear no resemblance and can bear no resemblance to the home.  Where there is a new, dense population, it would be a far better thing to have three, four or five good-sized schools rather than these terrific monstrosities carrying 30 or more <Col N="1065" /> teachers.  Every teacher beyond nine is a loss.  I mean that a school that requires more than nine teachers deteriorates in value.  I would certainly object to anything beyond the ten-teacher school.  I know that the provision of a number of good-sized schools, but not too large, would probably cost more than one huge building. There would be difficulty in regard to sites and possibly other difficulties. The upkeep of a huge school becomes a terrible imposition on the manager, whereas in the case of a number of schools, separated from each other, there would be a good chance that many of them would fall under new and different management as the years go on.  For instance, the whole Crumlin area was part of Terenure parish and when the schools were built they were all within the one parish.  That parish is now split into five different parishes and if the schools had been dotted over the area there would be different managers over many of the schools and the burden on any one would not be so very great.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Next I want to say a word with regard to the school programme.  I hear it being urged from this, that and the other quarter that such and such a subject should be added to the primary school programme.  To my mind, that is not at all desirable.  The old schools taught the three R's.  Nobody doubts the efficiency and thoroughness with which these three R's were dealt with. The children left these schools rather better equipped in the real essentials than the children of the present day. Why not include history, for instance, in the reading matter of the ordinary reading books instead of making history a separate subject?  If that were done, if there were very simple lessons based on history in the reading books from the second standard to the seventh or eighth standard, the children would leave school with a far better knowledge of history than they would by having history as a separate subject.  That would contribute to having the three R's taught more thoroughly than is being done by having separate subjects such as history, civics and so on.  What is read and what is discussed in the reading <Col N="1066" /> books is more likely to be remembered. If the number of subjects were reduced in that way, if civics, history and so forth were dealt with in that way, the dimensions of the timetable could be so cut down that more thorough instruction could be given in reading, spelling and oral expression. I am perfectly convinced that the children would leave school with a very much better knowledge of subjects dealt with in that way.</P>
    <P>In the old days very great importance was attached to the reading books.  The teachers themselves were examined on them and marked in their professional examinations and they certainly had to get the matter of these reading books into the minds and memories of their pupils.  It is possibly not so easy to do that now because we have such a multiplicity of reading books.  The old readers were a sort of family heirloom; the mother knew them all practically by heart from the infant class up; the father did and the elder brothers remembered them and it was a great help in every way.  I think that the parents were better able to help their children in those days when they had one set of recognised readers.</P>
    <P>Of course at that time we had not the grouping system for the standards. We now have grouping in the smaller schools and I think that it would be necessary to have at least two sets of readers in order to permit that grouping to operate properly.  It would hardly be advisable probably to keep children reading the same textbook for two years as would have to be done if we had simply one set of school readers. I would certainly plead that the number of sets of school readers be drastically cut down and that when it is decided to adopt a set or two of readers they be kept in use for a good long period so that they would become well known and more likely to be remembered by the children who do an ordinary national school course.  So much for the programme and the reading of the books.</P>
    <P>I referred for several years past to the need for better and more intensive teaching of oral expression.  I think that the standard has gone down very much.  Possibly the necessity for the <Col N="1067" /> second language may account for that to some extent.  Certainly I think that the small amount of time we can now give in the schools to reading and the questioning and explanations consequent on that reading is a big factor, but whatever the cause, the oral expression is not nearly so good.  It is pitiable to see some of our children leaving school with scarcely any power of oral expression.  I think that the power of oral expression, particularly in the vernacular, is most necessary to children in making a start in life.  I have seen boys and girls turned down for little jobs and I am positive that in a great many cases they were turned down because they just were not able to speak and make their case.  I would like to see more attention paid to that particular matter.  I am speaking practically now out of my own long experience of 40 years as a teacher. Perhaps it would point to what I have just said if I tell you that the children who go to little private schools cultivate the power of oral expression much better than the children who come to our national schools.  They are much behind the national school children in other respects.  Taken age for age they are much behind them except in that one particular thing, but that proves more valuable to them than a better knowledge of other subjects when they go out to look for jobs.  That is a point we should keep before us when we have the interests of little children and young boys and girls at heart.</P>
    <P>Like the other speakers of every Party I was terribly disappointed that the findings of the Roe Commission were not fully implemented, because if they were fully implemented on the financial side it is doubtful if the teachers would be in as good a position as they were when the salary question was dealt with by the previous Government.  There is no doubt that a process of inflation is operating and in my opinion the full implementation of the Roe Report would fall short in actual value of the settlement we made with the teachers.</P>

      <P>School teachers' pensions are very much improved now and I am very glad of that, but my goodness, why not give it to those who retired some years ago?  I think that we should give any teachers who are drawing their pensions, no matter for how long, the same rate as the present-day teachers. These teachers will cease to exist in a comparatively short time, but for the time they do exist I think they should be placed on the same scale as the present teachers and those who will go out in the future.  I do hope that something better, something just, will be done for those who are drawing their pensions no matter for what number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the grants made to schools are totally insufficient.  When I started teaching, we were able to get people to undertake the cleaning of schools for very little.  Now in the case of some country schools, it is impossible to get an outsider to undertake their cleaning and upkeep, with the result that the teachers and the pupils have to face the job themselves. Owing to the need for paying so much more for work of this sort, I feel that the grants should be tremendously increased. Good grants should be made available by the Government for the upkeep of school premises and for the cleaning of lavatories and school surroundings generally.  I hope that the Government will try to deal more generously with the old pensioned teachers and to put them on a level with those who are now leaving the service.  These old pensioned teachers gave equally long service on the whole and prices have increased for them as much as they have for us who are still in the <Col N="1069" /> service.  I, therefore, beseech the Minister to do all he can to grant the advantages to these teachers who have been out on pension for some time which are granted to those who will go out from now on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McCann raised a point which interested me very much when he spoke of the scarcity of vocational education teachers.  I think that my views and those of Deputy McCann differ slightly in relation to the cause of that scarcity.  Deputy McCann suggested that the scarcity was due to teachers not getting sufficient salaries, but I have been a member of a vocational education committee for a number of years and I never heard any teacher complaining about his salary. As a member of a vocational committee, I can say that we find it very hard to get teachers.  Recently, we advertised two vacancies and we received two replies.  One of the applicants withdrew within a week and the other came down to see the situation in the school, and, when she saw that the school was not in the city, she also withdrew her application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The great cause of the scarcity of these teachers is the fact that there are not enough vacancies and that sufficient teachers are not being trained at present.  There are, apparently, only two training schools in the country and only about 25 vacancies available. <Col N="1070" /> A much greater number should be made available.  The girls go to these training schools, and, after a year at household management, go on to training, but there are only very few vacancies available for them as vocational teachers.  At present the position is that these teachers are hand-picking the posts they will take and the vocational committees, as I say, have great difficulty in getting teachers, due mainly to the fact that very few teachers are passed out each year&mdash;apparently not nearly enough to fill the vacancies which occur in the vocational schools each year.</P>
    <P>Many of these girls are offered alternative positions in the shape of household and hotel management positions. I was recently speaking to one lady who passed through one of these schools and she said she had wasted her time there.  It was very hard during the first year, but in the second year she had only to do 19 hours' study per week.  &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am doing 19 hours' work per day.&rdquo;  Is that what our training schools are turning out these girls for&mdash;19 hours' work per day?  The vocational committee in Kilkenny recently refused to co-operate with the Tourist Board in sending girls for training as cooks because we found that, when we had got them trained, they had merely wasted their time because there were no positions for them.  This girl of whom I speak said she was happy to have any job, that another girl who had been with her in training and who had gone to France and Switzerland to complete her training, was still at home.  I advise the Minister to make more vacancies available for these girls.</P>
    <P>We have heard nothing but complaint about schools and so on since this debate started and we have heard nothing in favour of the Department, but I can say that we in Kilkenny have any number of schools.  Schools are being built all the time.  The fact that we had a Minister for Education who was a fellow Deputy of ours may have been some reason for it, but I can assure the House that, since that Minister left office, schools have gone up faster in Kilkenny.  A lot depends on the managers.  If they will look for <Col N="1071" /> sites and put up the money, the schools will be provided.  We have done it in Kilkenny and I cannot see why other counties cannot do it.  If the Deputies for the areas concerned would start at home and get the people to move, I have no doubt the Department would sanction all the schools necessary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now, having dealt with the language revival, to a matter raised on both sides of the House in regard to the salaries and pensions of national teachers.  I wish to add my voice to the voices that have already expressed disappointment in regard to this matter.  I wish to express my disappointment of the fact that the findings of the Roe Commission were not implemented in full, particularly as regards the date as on and from which <Col N="1073" /> the recommendations were put into operation.  Teachers who were given increases in salary, with which they were not satisfied, under the previous Administration believed at that time that a revision of these scales would take place three years after their coming into operation.  The date was specifically stated to be September, 1949. When the Roe Commission was set up everybody expected that its findings would be put into operation as from that date, but the Government decided that it could not fully implement the findings of that commission.  Despite the fact that the offer was a reduced one the Government should have made the date of payment of the increased salaries and pensions the date on which review was promised by the previous Government&mdash;that is to say, September, 1949.</P>
    <P>In 1946 the salaries of civil servants, Guards, the Army and the teachers were increased.  Civil servants, the Army and the Guards have received increases since that time.  In 1946 civil servants were promised and guaranteed a revision after two years in the light of then existing circumstances.  No promise of an increase was given to civil servants in 1946 by Deputy Aiken, who was then Minister for Finance, but when the revision took place in 1948, in the light of the existing circumstances, an increase was necessary and that increase was given.</P>
    <P>The Roe Commission found that teachers were entitled to increases. Even though the majority findings were not accepted by the Government, the revision should have been retrospective to at least September, 1949.  Those teachers who were nearing retirement were particularly disappointed because, had the revision been made retrospective to September, 1949, all teachers retiring on pension since July last would have benefited by increased pensions.  They were bitterly disappointed. They hoped and expected that they would benefit by any improvement made.</P>
    <P>Last year on this Estimate I spoke of the necessity for the provision of shelters and the construction of proper cement paths around the schools in rural areas.  In my parish since last year the Department has sanctioned <Col N="1074" /> substantial grants, five-sixths the amount required by each school with the local people contributing the remaining one-sixth.  Practically all the schools have been reconstructed or repaired. We expect shortly to have these shelters where the children can stay during playtime on wet days plus the construction of proper cement paths around the school.  I think that should be extended to all rural schools. I painted a picture last year of a rural school in which there were only two rooms and a hallway in between.  Unless there are amenities such as I have suggested we cannot expect our children to grow up into a healthy race.</P>
    <P>Another important amenity is the provision of a proper water supply.  I understand that there is a scheme under consideration for the provision of piped water for ordinary farmhouses. If such a scheme comes into operation I suggest it should be extended to the schools.  As well as being good for the health of the children it would be of assistance in teaching them proper methods of hygiene and sanitation.</P>
    <P>When replying to the debate on this Estimate last year, at column 620 of Volume 115 of May 4th, 1949, the Minister said: &ldquo;What I have said with regard to the maintenance of schools applies to heating and cleaning.  We pay half the cost.  The manager has to apply for it.&rdquo;  The Department pays half the cost of the heating and cleaning of our primary schools.  I think this is one item that should be increased considerably.  Every Deputy who has experience of our rural schools knows the kind of grant that is given I suppose we could take a school average attendance of from 30 to 85. Now the maximum grant that can be given by the Department is £12 to £14. Surely the Minister will agree that it would cost much more than that to pay a man to do the work of heating and cleaning the schools.</P>
    <P>There are 40 school weeks in the year.  We might put the cost of labour at 10/- per week, because you will not get a person to do it for less.  If you get a person adjacent to the school who will agree to do it for that, it will amount to £20 per year.  Then you have the cost of the materials&mdash;the <Col N="1075" /> brushes, dusters, cans and soap&mdash;and the cost of the fuel for the heating.  I realise that in rural Ireland the fuel is supplied by the parents and that the children bring their supply of turf to the school.  In my area we have not to buy turf or timber except perhaps in a bad year when the parents would not have the turf.  I suggest that, including the labour and the materials, it could not possibly be done for less than £60 per year.  If the Government were to pay one-half, the grant would have to be much higher than £14.  I suggest to the Minister that he should consider giving this grant on the same basis as grants are given for school buildings&mdash;that the Department put up two-thirds of the amount, that the local contribution be one-third, and that the local contribution should be either in cash or in kind.  If that were done, it would be a very great boon to the managers and to the parents for the heating and cleaning of the schools.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was introducing the Estimate for his Department last year he intimated that the fees for instruction in cooking and laundry were to be increased.  As reported in Volume 115, column 287, of the Official Report for 8th April, 1949, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The fee for instruction in cooking and laundry has been raised from 8/11 to 12/- per pupil and an extra £2,000 has been provided in consequence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When I read that I took it that that would be the fee.  On 30th March last, however, I put down a question to the Minister on the subject because teachers had complained to me that they understood from the Minister's statement last year that extra money had been provided for the teaching of these subjects, which undoubtedly are very important in rural Ireland, and that they had not been in receipt of this extra remuneration.  The question I put down was:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Education if he will state (a) the fees paid, and the basis on which they are calculated, for the teaching of cooking and laundry work in primary schools, and (b) whether these fees have not <Col N="1076" /> been increased since 1939; and, if so, whether in view of the rise in the price of materials used in the teaching of these subjects, he will consider making a corresponding increase in the fees.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply was:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Special grants are payable, subject to certain specified conditions, in respect of the instruction of girl pupils of national schools in cookery, laundry work or domestic economy. The expenditure on equipment for these branches is a first charge on the total amount of the grant payable in respect of the instruction and is paid to the person (manager or teacher) by whom this expenditure is incurred.  The balance of the total grant is paid to the teaching staff. The grant is calculated at the rate of 8s. 6d., plus 5 per cent. in respect of each girl in whose case the specified conditions are fulfilled.  The present rate of grant has been in operation since 1st April, 1938.  I regret I am not in a position at this stage to consider increasing the rate of grant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder how the Minister can reconcile the statement he made that this extra money was to be provided with his reply to my question on 30th March.</P>

      <P>It is a point which I was asked to make and, having done so, I shall wait for the Minister's reply when he looks into the matter.  I again appeal to the Minister to make the Gaeltacht his first charge for the keeping of the Gaelic-speaking population there.  As he is Minister in charge of the language, I ask him to impress on other Ministers the importance of keeping the language alive in those areas in which it is still a living language. Every effort should be made to provide industries and have full employment in those areas.  If the language is kept alive and spread there by the incentives which I have urged, the embers which are being kindled throughout the rest of the country will be fanned into a living flame that will spread from one end of the country to the other.  We should make full use <Col N="1077" /> of all the forces that are working on behalf of the language and not stint the expenditure of money in co-ordinating all these forces and in making use of the radio and films.  As some Deputies suggested, the raising of the school-leaving age in the primary schools would also be a great help.  I trust the Minister will give heed to the proposals which have been made by various Deputies for the furtherance of the language.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to one matter which has not been mentioned by any Deputy and that is the necessity for uniformity in the national school holidays.  At Easter time, some schools close on the Monday and others do not close until Wednesday or Thursday. The same thing applies to the Christmas and summer holidays.  I think the Minister has had representations made to him on the matter and I would be grateful if he will tell us when replying what his proposals are.  The school meals committee in Dublin and the school attendance committee find themselves in difficulty in connection with this matter.  In the school meals committee we find it is very awkward when we have to deal with some schools closing on one day and others on other days and schools opening again on different days after the holidays.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Bill passes its Final Stage, I should like to express a final word of comment.  The resources of democratic controversy are boundless but I wish to put the severest restraint on myself so as not to occupy too much of the time of the Dáil.  I hope that in some of the things I do say, I shall obviate the necessity of wasting time in future by Deputies on matters on which we have had a complete and final decision.  Many Deputies on the Government Benches, and at least one Minister, have been very vocal and very vehement in regard to one particular matter&mdash;the damage that has been done to security of tenure by the Fianna Fáil Government and the Fianna Fáil Party.  It seems to me that in this Bill the Government and the various Ministers who were so vocal about security of tenure, and the various members of the Party who were all so vociferous, had an opportunity of reversing any decision made during the Fianna Fáil régime, if they thought it did adversely affect security of tenure.  Since they have failed to introduce any amendment to the previous legislation in that regard, I trust that in future we shall have no more long-winded discussions on the evils wrought on the farmer by Fianna Fáil action in land legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certainly since 1923 there has been a new concept of tenure in the country. We no longer choose to regard security of tenure as the security enjoyed by someone like Robinson Crusoe on an uninhabited island.  It takes a long time for statesmanlike wisdom to be accepted but now we have, generally, at last come to the complete acceptance of Drummond's dictum: &ldquo;Property has its duties as well as its rights.&rdquo;  Under the legislation of this country, there is no shadow of doubt, the tenure of land and land ownership are as well protected as anywhere in the world.  In fact, as I have already <Col N="1079" /> pointed out to the Dáil, there is even, due to our history, an ultra-legal security of tenure which makes land useless as collateral for the capital needed to develop it.  Again I want to say that since the Government or any of their loyally vociferous orators did not see fit to introduce into this Bill some section or other that might revise or amend Fianna Fáil legislation, they have no longer any right to discuss the question of security of tenure.</P>
    <P>The Minister has introduced a new system of payment for land.  Some portions of it actually do make a certain difference in the price paid for land legally.  Another section of his proposals is merely wishful thinking.  The Minister said that in future he proposes to pay market value for land but in spite of all our invitations to him to define what exactly he meant by &ldquo;market value&rdquo; we failed to get any definition.  On last year's Estimate, I made the point that if the Minister thought that owners of land were not getting a just price he could, under the terms of the 1923 Act, have paid that price without any further legislation. Market value is no different from &ldquo;fair to the Land Commission and fair to the owner&rdquo;.  If the Minister is an honest man&mdash;of course he is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick) Joseph Blowick">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with an opportunity of being fair to the owner afforded by the words written into the legislation in 1923, there is no reason why he might not have indicated that policy to the Land Commission and increased the price.  The suggestion that &ldquo;market value&rdquo; is a more clear and definite indication of what the Land Commission proposes to do seems to me to be without any adequate foundation. Having, shall I say, pestered him with demands to tell us what exactly he considers &ldquo;market value&rdquo; and to say why he differentiated it from &ldquo;market price&rdquo;, I have no further wish to argue with him on the subject.  I believe he wishes to pay a better price and while he might be satisfied with &ldquo;fair to the Land Commission and fair to the owner&rdquo; he has chosen a new expression, that means now, I suppose, that <Col N="1080" /> the owner will be paid more for the land.  But there is included in this piece of legislation proposals that are not quite strange in Land Commission transactions, that is, that compensation for damage and compensation for disturbance will be paid to the owner. If that has not been the general practice in the Land Commission, it is going to add further to the cost of the land.  There is, however, a further proposal in relation to price which is much more important and much more significant. In future when the landowner, is paid market value, when he is paid compensation for disturbance and compensation for any consequential damage, he is not to be asked to repay to the State the advance which the State made to him for the purchase of the land.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for commitments, the sanctity of contracts, the payment of debts&mdash;these are moral concepts without which there cannot be any successful commercial intercourse between individuals, or between an individual and a Government.  The position is that as regards the greater portion of the land with which the Land Commission will be dealing under this Bill, all that land has been purchased as a result of the State making an advance of the price on very generous terms and over a long period of years.  There is a contract, definite and implicit, between the owner of the land and the man who got the advance, for the repayment of the annuity.</P>
      <P>Some people have said that, because of this country's refusal to transmit the annuities to England, the farmer is no longer liable for payment to the State.  The change of the payee does not seem to me to lessen the responsibility of the payer or to break his contract. There has been only one case in Irish history where a payment was refused and that was as a result of the Act of Attainder of Lord Edward Fitzgerald, when his tenants refused to pay their rents to the British Government, and nobody can, in my opinion, under all the circumstances, make that a precedent for a farmer's refusal to pay the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could talk a good deal on the question of Britain's attitude towards these annuities, but I do not propose to take up the time of the House in so <Col N="1081" /> doing.  Maybe some time I could be invited to County Mayo to lecture on that particular matter; it might be very interesting for the landholders and congests down there in Michael Davitt's country.</P>
    <P>It may be possible to waive a moral concept like sanctity of contract, payment of debts and responsibility of commitments in politics; in the green wood of politics we might bend the sapling without damage, but in the dry wood of commercial intercourse such a bending would be attended by an irreparable fracture.  The pursuit of abstract justice is rather a fruitless one and, while this proposal of the Minister is not commercially or economically laudable&mdash;and it is even morally bad&mdash;nevertheless, politics being the science of the second best, we have to accept a lesser evil in the hope that, as a result of our acceptance of it, the Minister will be able to remove a much greater social evil.</P>
    <P>I want to point out that in paying market value&mdash;and I must assume the Minister conceives what market value is, payment of compensation for damage, payment of compensation for disturbance and the cesser of the payment of land annuities due and repayable&mdash;the price of transactions in land by the Land Commission will be far heavier than it has been heretofore. Furthermore, every cent of this money will now have to be borne by the taxpayer; John Citizen carries the burden.  Therefore, it is not unfair to ask the Minister what his proposals are in regard to land administration in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture has proposed a scheme of land rehabilitation and he has intimated definitely to the Dáil what the cost of that scheme will be &mdash; £40,000,000.  The Minister for Social Welfare proposes to introduce a new scheme of Social Welfare.  He has indicated the amount that will be spent annually by the State in putting this scheme into operation.  Now, when there is no longer a question of a State advance repayable by the farmer in the case of land that is to be acquired&mdash;I assume, purchased in the open market &mdash;we must understand the taxpayer has to assume a very heavy burden of taxation.  It is reasonable to ask, <Col N="1082" /> therefore, what the amount of that taxation will be, roughly, over the years.</P>
    <P>We can only secure some view of that by having a statement from the Minister as to the amount of land possible of resumption, acquisition or purchase for his purposes in the country.  How much land does he want for his purpose? How far does he think that amount of land that he nominates will go towards the solution of congestion? For how many years are we to continue the acquisition, resumption and purchase of land in order to solve the problem which is nearest the Minister's heart?  This is a grave problem involving a tremendous amount of money.  It is a great social problem that we all desire to solve.</P>
    <P>We would like to know now what is the Minister's estimate of the cost of it.  In view of the fact that John Citizen has to find the money, the only basis on which we can tax people is that, as a result of the taxation, we are directly and solely concerned with the abolition of a great social evil, and so every care must be taken by the Minister in future administration&mdash; more than ever before in view of the changed circumstances&mdash;to see that the one particular evil with which we are concerned is the one which he will tackle.</P>
    <P>Another change made by the Minister in existing legislation was the cause of a good deal of discussion here, discussion which the Minister called obstruction.  But the Minister came in without really considering what exactly he wanted, and what the real limit of his needs was, irrespective of its justification or otherwise.  As a result of what he called obstruction, he moderated his view very definitely, and, if only to secure that amount of moderation, the debate on the Land Bill was well worth while.  In a democratic country public representatives must always meet the pressure of public opinion&mdash;call it influence or pull if you like.  They must not merely serve the country and the Dáil, but they are expected to serve their constituents, too.  Of course, when I do that&mdash;that is corruption.  However, all Deputies have been approached by a <Col N="1083" /> constituent at some period or another with a demand, possibly a legitimate demand and possibly otherwise, but with a demand that is urgent and pressing.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows that.  The Minister is a Deputy.  In his own constituency, he is not the big brass hat that we all revere and look up to here, but just a man dependent on the votes of the people, and thus a man to whom demands may be made by the people.  In order to obviate the pressure of that demand, it was decided in 1933 by this obviously corrupt Fianna Fáil Party to remove from the Minister&mdash;that the Minister would divest himself of&mdash;certain powers which, if he had, he might be tempted, by the pressure and the demand in his own constituency or by his own colleagues, to give way to, and so these excepted matters were, to my mind, very wisely excepted.  The Minister proposes to change that, to change the legislation so radically as to make these excepted matters in the 1933 Act partly valueless.  We did protest, and eventually, the Minister saw a little bit of light, and while he does retain to himself certain powers, powers which he will regret, nevertheless we have gone a long way to change his mind, and when he has as much experience in the Department as some of his predecessors he probably will change his mind again a good deal.  Of course, I know that Deputy Commons tried to reverse it the other way.</P>
    <P>There is a great desire on the part of Deputies for speed in the Land Commission. Deputy Hickey is afflicted with that bug.  Now, Talleyrand was really a great minister and he deprecated zeal in making decisions as very often unwise.  I would not urge the Minister to speed.  Of course, looking at the amount of work done under the Minister in the Land Commission last year, I do not suppose I need deprecate the idea that the should be speedy.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in speaking of the Appeal Tribunal, suggested that he was going to make a change on the plea that there was no longer any work for the Appeal Tribunal.  I would like the Minister some time, when he takes a stand, that he would stand just there where he is, not for the purpose of <Col N="1084" /> letting me hit him quickly but so that I would know exactly where he is.  He changed his mind several times as to the reason why he was changing the Appeal Tribunal.  Now, I take the view that when a Government selects a man for a high office that, except he has shown a lack of probity in that office, the Government that succeeds the Government which appointed him should respect him in his office.  That is my view.  I think the Minister was very wrong in reversing the decision that was made by the previous Government in creating the Appeal Tribunal.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat the suggestion that I made in relation to men employed on acquired or resumed estates.  It has been the practice of the Land Commission that such men are given pieces of land, sometimes adequate and sometimes inadequate, for the purpose of compensating them for the loss of their employment.  That system has not worked well, and it is now proposed to adopt a system of a gratuity.  I think the Minister has not gone far enough in relation to that matter.  I want to press on him again the idea that, when an estate is taken over and a number of men lose their employment, the gratuity be decided on which is to be paid to each of these men, and that if afterwards any of them gets land and proves unsatisfactory, he shall not be permitted to sell the land but will be dispossessed and given his gratuity.  I can see a good deal of difficulty in solving congestion if we propose to give small patches of land to various unemployed men on which they cannot make a satisfactory living, or to men who are of themselves personally useless as landowners or farmers.</P>
    <P>The Minister has another idea in regard to land acquisition, that is, the purchase of land offered for sale in the open market.  Whatever reason the Minister had for defining exactly what the price was he intended to pay in relation to resumed or acquired land, I do not think he could have any argument in relation to the question of the value and price of land offered in the open market.  The market value of a farm sold in the open market is the price paid for it and no other.  Market value must, in that particular case, be <Col N="1085" /> market price.  When the Minister introduced this proposal for the purchase of land in the open market, his idea, he told us, was to purchase farms of £12, £16 and £20 valuation, farms with houses, fences, pumps&mdash;all the amenities of a going concern&mdash;and these were to be purchased for migrants. Afterwards he changed his mind and now, apparently, if I understand him correctly, he proposes in a great measure to change the present system of land acquisition and resumption for a system of purchase of every piece of land in the country.  When I heard him say that he proposed to divide these farms I was exceptionally worried because it seems to me that when he proposed to purchase a farm as a going concern, if he proposed to divide it, he would merely destroy the farm as a going concern.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should be more courageous about the price of this land. Deputy Sweetman was most complimentary about the courage of the Minister in regard to this particular Bill.  I think he should have more courage and decide to pay the market price for these holdings he is purchasing because I can visualise that his proposed transactions are bound to be a failure.  If the Land Commissioners will get into a huddle in Merrion Street and decide what the price is to be paid for a farm &mdash;and, as Deputy Commons knows, they are conservative gentlemen&mdash;when their agent goes down to the country to purchase that farm, he is bound hand and foot and there will be no success in the acquisition of these farms.</P>
    <P>Much as I am interested in congestion, I do not think that we can consider congestion solely and neglect consideration of ordinary agricultural economics.  We must be very careful in our transactions in regard to land that we do not create a situation which will be a replacement of the evil which we seek to destroy.  The Minister, I think, knows exactly what I mean. But, there is one difficulty about the relief of congestion&mdash;one great difficulty &mdash;and I think the Minister has only to be told what it is to take action in regard to it, because it is an evil thing, that is, consolidation.  There have <Col N="1086" /> been, during the war years, known to me, the purchase of farm after farm throughout the country by one individual. I know single individuals who bought ten, 12 and 15 farms.  That is eviction.  It is the removal of farming families from the land.  It is as evil a thing, almost, as the evictions of the Land League days.  The Minister has power to step in and take over any one of these multiplied farms and divide it for his purpose and we on this side of the House will give him full support when he is doing so.  I do think it is very wrong to permit any man, because he has made a tremendous amount of money, legally or illegally, in other fields, to evict the farmers of Ireland from their land by the use of that money.  That should be stopped.</P>
    <P>Anyhow, I hope that the Minister will tell us how much land he wants, how much money he wants, how long he will take for the job.  Any ordinary building contractor will give a full estimate of all these things for any building you ask him to put up.  The Minister, with all the resources of his Department, all his native intelligence, all the information that is behind him in the Department, can surely be able to make a very shrewd estimate now as to what exactly he needs in money and time to complete the work, as far as it can be completed, that he wants to do.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Minister said on a few occasions during this debate, explaining certain sections in the Bill, certain omissions in the Bill, &ldquo;I did this for the purpose of tidying up legislation.&rdquo; It is about time that we should try to get rid of the network of legislation that chokes a good deal of activity in regard to land.  Any lawyer dealing with this Bill&mdash;many of them are not too competent&mdash;has, first of all, to examine the Interpretation Act, 1937. Then he has to go on to the Public Works Act; then to the Land Clauses Act.  Then he has to deal with a complexity of Acts&mdash;the Land Purchase Acts, 1881 to 1891.  He goes from there and trips over the Local Loan Funds Act, 1935.  Then he has the Forestry Act, 1946, the Settled Land Acts, 1882 to 1890, the Registration of Title Acts, 1891 and 1942, the Land Reclamation <Col N="1087" /> Act, 1949, the Emergency Powers Orders and 26 sections of seven Land Acts.  How in the name of God is any layman or any legal mind capable of interpreting this particular Land Act? I studied the Land Bill carefully; I confess I did not understand one-tenth of it.  I know and I am convinced that the Minister is in the same position even though he came here to explain it.  I do not blame him.  I can see the muddlement of Deputy Flanagan when he prepares after to-day's 30 questions to open up fire in Offaly and Leix. Thirty questions on land acquisition.</P>
    <P>I do not like the Bill and as far as I am concerned, having said all that, the Minister can have it now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be very brief about this Bill.  I think we should congratulate the Minister on it as it has removed the old standing injustice that was inflicted upon the farming community generally when vested land was acquired by the Land Commission and the price paid for it was not based on the market value.  This Bill at least has made it clear beyond all question that a farmer whose land is vested in him, who is the complete and absolute owner of his own farm, will, if his farm happens to be acquired by the Land Commission, get at least as good a price as a farmer who is still a tenant of the Land Commission.  That is a reform for which many of us have agitated for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To offset that reform, I find certain disadvantages in the Bill inasmuch as the Minister in Section 10 unwisely, I think, sought to obtain and has obtained powers which he would have been well advised to leave to the Land Commission.  Nothing which the Minister said in the course of the debates on this Bill convinced me that there was any justification for his taking on himself these powers.  I am quite certain, having regard to the unjustifiable pressure which is brought to bear upon a Minister for Lands, that he would have been much wiser to refrain from taking the power into his own hands because while the Minister has made it clear that the additional powers which he sought and has obtained are very limited, it is, nevertheless, true <Col N="1088" /> that he is opening a door which may be pushed open still further until he or some of his successors find that they are called upon eventually to discharge the onerous functions which are at present discharged by the Land Commission. I think that that would be a disastrous day not only for the Minister, for whom perhaps we would feel very little sympathy as he was responsible for that position obtaining, but also for the farmer.  I think it is doubtful whether there are any farms in Counties Leix and Offaly which have not been the subject of question and agitation in this House.  That is a serious position and I feel that the Minister was inadvised to set his feet upon this path, and to have taken power to himself from the Land Commission.  I am not going further into the question because it has been debated at considerable length, but nothing will convince me that the Minister was wise or even justified in the step which he has taken.  Everything which the Minister can now do under that section could be done far better by the Land Commission with, perhaps, some light administrative claims.</P>
    <P>I feel that there is no serious danger in Section 23 which has so gravely worried Deputy Moylan.  I think there is no reason why a Government Department should not be free to go out and buy land in the open market from willing sellers.  With this section a farmer who has land to dispose of will have more than one buyer.  I have come across cases of farms being up for sale where the farmer found himself with only one or two buyers and could not get a decent price.  If the Bill becomes law a farmer will always have the Land Commission as an additional buyer.  It will be to the advantage of farmers and also of the community generally, because it will overcome a good deal of red tape or green tape or white tape that delays the acquisition of land.  When a person wishes to sell a farm he wishes to do it quickly.  He does not want inspectors coming and going or an investigation going on for months or perhaps years; he wants to close the deal and get away.  A farmer can now dispose of land to the Land Commission and get paid and the <Col N="1089" /> whole business can be transacted in a few weeks.  The land will be available for any purpose for which the Land Commission requires it.  I do not agree with Deputy Moylan as to how the land which is purchased should be used.  Portion of it may be used for afforestation; portion of it may be used to satisfy the needs of a migrant; perhaps a portion might be given to an uneconomic holder in the district and that would be a benefit, not only to the people directly concerned, but to the country generally.</P>
    <P>Therefore, while there are some weaknesses in this Bill and while there may be some dangers, it is, I think, a step forward at any rate and I think on the whole that it will be a help to the Minister in dealing with this very difficult problem which must be dealt with, the problem of providing land for uneconomic holders and for other essential national purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Moylan in one suggestion he made in connection with the Land Acts.  I understand that, when the Estimates come before us, we are not allowed to advocate legislation on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my only reason for availing of this opportunity to ask the Minister to set his mind to this problem of what I describe as the codifying of the Land Acts.  Deputy Moylan mentioned the various Acts which the legal man or the layman has to deal with before finding out where he stands.  It is practically a full-time job to go through them and I do not believe that there are in the Land Commission itself more than a few people who can grasp or who have any detailed knowledge of all the Acts in connection with the problem of land. It is an absolute necessity that legislation be introduced at some stage whereby these various Acts will be codified, so that the ordinary Deputy, without having to go to a great deal of trouble, will be able to find out the meaning of the different sections.  It would help those Deputies in whom Deputy Moylan is interested and who, according to him, are subject to &ldquo;pull&rdquo;<Col N="1090" /> or influence, because that &ldquo;pull&rdquo; or influence would not be used if the Land Acts were so codified as to be explainable in a simple manner.</P>
      <P>The trouble is that all the Land Acts have shrouded the division of land in mystery.  The man down the country who wants an addition to his holding, if he is a congest or if land is being divided in the area, sees the Land Commission inspector, and, if he gets no satisfactory answer from him, then goes to his local Deputy.  He is no wiser about the matter than the Land Commission inspector and we gather from Deputy Moylan that the position has been that the local man is bluffed and told: &ldquo;We can do nothing for you this time, but your name will be put on the list in connection with the next farm of land being divided.&rdquo;  I do not want to go into details in this connection, but Deputy Moylan gave the opening when he mentioned influence and &ldquo;pull&rdquo;.  I do not want to follow him along that avenue because, though it might be very interesting, it might involve a very long discussion without very much benefit to anybody.</P>

      <P>As I understand there is agreement to complete the Fifth Stage of this Bill to-night, I will not detain the House very long.  As Deputy Moylan said, the Minister can now have the Bill, with all its imperfections, and they are many, in my opinion, for the solution of the problem of congestion. If I understand the problem at all, having gone over certain statistics, I am afraid that the Minister under this Bill will not solve one-tenth of it. However, I do not intend to take up <Col N="1091" /> the time of the House in quoting these figures.</P>
      <P>There is one rooted objection I have to the Bill.  It arises from Section 13, the section which proposes to abolish the Appeal Tribunal.  I feel it would not be right to let the Fifth Stage pass without again referring to this matter. It has already been discussed at fairly good length and I do not intend to elaborate on it except to say that I consider it in the first place, a very unwise step, and, in the second, more or less a step in the direction of victimisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I think about it.  There has been a contract between the Minister and the Appeal Tribunal, because the Minister is carrying on as the successor of the Minister before him, and, before there is any interference with that contract, I think the members of the Appeal Tribunal should be given an opportunity of relinquishing their posts voluntarily.  I do not think they got any such opportunity. As has been said before, the members of the Appeal Tribunal held their position on the same tenure as a Circuit Court judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>It is also my opinion that the Minister's proposal is unconstitutional, because let it be noted that &ldquo;Every lay commissioner appointed to be a member of the Appeal Tribunal shall hold his office as such member by the same tenure as a judge of the Circuit Court holds his office as such <Col N="1092" /> judge.&rdquo;  It will be noted that the tenure attaches not to the office of lay commissioner but to his office as a member of the Appeal Tribunal.  That is where the difference comes in.</P>

I am concerned with the tenure of the members of the Appeal Tribunal and I think it is a wrong and a retrograde step for the Minister to take them away, as it were, from that court of judicial functions and put them into a lower court.  I wonder what the Minister would say if he heard of a proposal to take a circuit judge away from his functions jurisdiction as a circuit judge and to put him into the District Court to function in that court for the remainder of his period of office.</P>

      <P>I would not rise on this occasion at all were it not for one point raised by Deputy Moylan in the course of his very useful contribution, when he referred to the individual with plenty of money who can purchase one, two, three or up to ten farms in this country.  I am glad that Deputy Moylan is of the same opinion as I am.  He too believes that farms should be taken over and made available for the Irish people who will work them.  I want to know from the Minister, or from anybody who can give me the information, what does this Bill do to give such farms back to our own people?  We all know that during the past ten years the chief purchasers of land here have been foreigners.  They have purchased huge tracts of our land on which to establish stud farms and breed racehorses.  They have not purchased these lands for the purpose of engaging in agriculture.  They have purchased them for the purpose of <Col N="1093" /> breeding thoroughbreds, high priced colts, for sale in England and elsewhere. We know perfectly well&mdash;none of us is so innocent as not to know&mdash; that these people are protected by legislation.  The Land Commission cannot and will not interfere with any man, no matter what nationality he may be, who comes in here and purchases farms of anything from 50 to 500 acres for the sole purpose, as he himself points out, of breeding horses.  This Bill does nothing whatever to remedy that situation.</P>

      <P>It is impossible to introduce any legislation dealing with land without its reflecting on our principal industry, agriculture.  Now agriculture is dependent upon the principle with which Deputy Moylan dealt in his speech, namely, security of tenure. Despite Deputy Moylan's protests, I do not absolve Fianna Fáil from blame in that respect irrespective of what they may have done later in their régime.  Security of tenure must be left undisturbed and any Government which tries to interfere with it will be brought to its senses very quickly through force of economic circumstances. Security of tenure, I might point out, is one of the fundamental principles underlying this Bill.  Deputy Moylan also said that a certain amount of criticism was levelled against the Fianna Fáil Government by Deputies who are now supporting this Government. He said one of those Deputies <Col N="1094" /> is now a Minister.  I have a grave suspicion it is myself.</P>

      <P>The principal problem facing the Land Commission is the relief of congestion and the eradication of the overcrowded rural slums which have come down to us as an evil legacy from the past and to which no Government can afford to close its eyes.  That is the purpose of this measure.  If wrongly used, the compulsory powers of acquisition which the Land Commission held could be used as an instrument to undermine our principal industry.  I say that that power was wrongly used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A certain amount of play has been made upon the fact that for the first time the Land Commission will go into the open market to purchase land.  It <Col N="1095" /> has been said that that will cause a certain amount of damage to agriculture. No one has explained why it is wrong for the Land Commission to purchase its needs in the open market.  I cannot see what is wrong with that.  A vast amount of land comes on the market every year.  The Land Commission wants land very badly.  I do not see why we should not go into the open market to purchase that land in the same way as any private purchaser. I cannot see that any damage will flow from the Land Commission purchasing land in such a market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">

Their powers of compulsory acquisition and resumption are unimpaired.  All the energies of the Land Commission will now be directed into one channel towards the relief of congestion.  It is absolutely essential that the Land Commission should have the right to purchase land in the open market.  I cannot see anything wrong in that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cogan is afraid, despite the explanations I have already given, of the powers the Minister is taking under Section 10 of this Bill.  No danger of any kind arises under that section.  The acquisition and resumption of land are still the functions of the Land Commissioners. The allotment of new holdings is still the function of the Land Commissioners.  The allotment of enlargements, where rearrangement is not involved, is still the function of the Land Commissioners.</P>

    <P>Deputy Kissane used the word &ldquo;victimisation&rdquo; in reference to the Appeal Tribunal.  There is no desire on anyone's <Col N="1096" /> part to victimise anybody.  I can assure Deputy Kissane and the House that the members of the Appeal Tribunal will not be victimised under this Bill.  Their salaries remain the same.  Their tenure of office is unchanged. Deputy Kissane tried to make a comparison between them and demoting a Circuit Court judge to the rank of a district justice.  There is absolutely no comparison there at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>What is taking place under this Bill is really allocating two commissioners to a different type of work from that in which they were engaged hitherto.  There is no demotion. Up to this the only argument put forward about this was that it meant demotion; now it is said to be victimisation.  None of these things is taking place.  There is no desire to do that, but there is a desire to put the Land Commission in shipshape, to reorganise it, a thing which Deputy Ruttledge, a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, asked me to do.  If I attempted in this Bill to interfere with the Appeal Commissioners' salary or their tenure of office, I could be accused of victimisation or of demoting them.  Neither of these things is happening in this case.  I am merely allotting them to a different kind of work, and work which is, in my opinion, much more important than that in which they are engaged at present.</P>
      <P>For the information of Deputies who may not be familiar with the structure of the Land Commission, I may say that at present these commissioners sit with a judge of the High Court to decide appeals on price and other appealable matters which may come before the tribunal.  I think that none of these things is half as important as the matters dealt with by the Land Commission Court which can deprive a man of his property.  That is my personal opinion and I am prepared to stand over it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an appeal on price, but by that time the man knows that his land is gone from him.  I say that the fixation of price is only a minor matter compared with the taking of a man's property from him. Instead of being demotion, I say that this is promotion.  The Land Commission fix the price of the land, but the big thing is the fact that the Land Commission is the only court in this country, or indeed in any country that I am aware of, which has power compulsorily to deprive a man of his property. It is a most serious thing.  The Land Commission fix the price and they offer that to the person whose land is acquired or resumed.  It is only on the question of price that there is an appeal to the Appeal Tribunal. If anybody can convince me that the determination of price is a more serious matter than the taking of a man's property from him, I am quite prepared to accept Deputy Kissane's assertion that this is demotion for the Appeal Commissioners, but I do not believe it.  I think they will now have a much more responsible and useful kind of work to do for the country.  I want their help and assistance in that matter and I know I will get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moylan was concerned about the fact that the redemption value of land is not now to be deducted from the purchase money fixed by either the Land Commission or the Appeal Tribunal in the case of acquisition.  He says that a tenant enters into commitments. That is so.  A farmer who agrees to have his land vested in him and signs the necessary forms agrees to accept the ownership of his land which he had not hitherto held because up to the vesting he is only a tenant and the Land Commission owns the land which, perhaps, has been handed down in his family for generations. <Col N="1098" /> He enters into an agreement to pay back some of the purchase price, all of which the Land Commission paid in the course of getting that land into their possession.  This is not violating that agreement.  It is not establishing a system whereby a man can repudiate his lawful debts.  What confronted us was that, under the law as it stood, we found that the Land Commission acquired a holding from a man and, in the determination of the price, they were bound to have regard to a price which was fair to the Land Commission and to the owner.  How the commissioners who were charged with that responsibility during all the years reconciled the two things will be an eternal puzzle to me.  In addition, the redemption value of the land had to be deducted from the purchase money. The effect I want to produce is that the Land Commission when taking a man's land will give him the same price as he would get if he had put it up for sale in the open market.  I believe that he is entitled to that.  I further believe that the Land Commission should not set a bad example because they have all the might of the State behind them in dealing with one individual by taking a man's property from him at a lower price than he could obtain in the open market.  That is what we are doing in this Bill.  We are doing what should have been done many years ago &mdash;giving a man a fair price.</P>
    <P>We had to take into account that if a farmer whose land was being acquired had sold it in the open market he would get the market price and the purchaser would not ask him to give it to him free of rent for ever by redeeming the purchase money.  In some cases the vesting only took place a short time before compulsory acquisition and it turned out that a man got even less than half the value of his land.  I want to repeat so that it will go on record that the State should set a good example by giving a fair price and when I say a fair price I want it to be distinctly understood that the State is not a bird to be plucked. There is no question of giving an exorbitant price or a price above the market value.  The commissioners will have discretion in the matter and, if they think the land is too dear or that <Col N="1099" /> there is any trick being played on them, they can always withdraw from the proceedings and not go on any further with them.</P>
    <P>The amount that the taxpayer will have to pay is also troubling Deputy Moylan.  It is absolutely impossible to arrive at what even the approximate figure would be.  I do not believe that it will be as big as the figure which I see here in sub-head H (3) under which this year alone the taxpayer has to provide £643,000.  It will be a long time before it runs into that.  Whatever the taxpayer will have to pay, I hold that it will not be an exorbitant or a big sum; that it is only fair that the State should shoulder its responsibility and should not ask a private individual to contribute towards the relief of congestion by giving up his holding for half its value.  At the same time, the incoming allottee or tenant is perfectly safeguarded and will get the land under the very same system as obtained heretofore with regard to the fixation of the annuity.  That will mean that the difference will have to be met by the taxpayer, but I say that that is a much better distribution of the burden than the system which obtained up to this&mdash;that in some cases of acquired land the farmer whose land was being taken was compelled to contribute a certain amount towards the relief of congestion, and in some cases a very large amount.</P>
    <P>The codification of the Land Acts was a matter also raised by Deputy McQuillan.  I want to tell the House that that is a huge job.  I do not like to give a promise that it will be undertaken but if I can, it will be, if it is not going to mean any dissipation of staff or upsetting of the normal work of the Land Commission to any considerable extent.  I fully realise that it is a job which must be faced some day.  The longer the present position continues and the more new Land Acts are put on the Statute Book, the harder the problem will become.  The whole land code is intensely complicated. I believe it will take years to do the job thoroughly&mdash;that is, to reduce to one document the whole land <Col N="1100" /> code of this country as we know it. It will have to go back to the year 1870 or perhaps even earlier and will have to embrace not alone Land Acts but other Acts as well.</P>

      <P>Codification would involve that.  A great many of the old Acts have become dead wood which will have to be cut out.  In recommending this Bill to the House, I want to say that I have every confidence that it is going to give the Land Commission greater freedom to achieve the desired end&mdash;the relief of congestion. I do not agree with the pessimistic views expressed that congestion is a problem too large to be solved.  When I come to move the Estimate for the Department of Lands this year, I shall be in a position, I hope, to give figures to the House which ought to more than allay, remembering the position with which we started two years ago, the fears that there is no finality to the relief of congestion.  This Bill will give the Land Commission much greater freedom to deal with the question and at the same time remove much of the contention associated with efforts to solve the problem in the past.</P>
      <P>Finally, let me say that I hope that when this Bill because law, it will go a long way towards raising the land question above the level of Party politics. I see Fianna Fáil Deputies shaking their heads.  I believe that the system this Government has put into operation&mdash;that every man should be treated fairly regardless of political affiliations&mdash;provides the best approach to the problem.  It is bearing wonderful fruits already and I intend to pursue it vigorously with the help of this Bill.</P>

As to the amount of land that the Land Commission will acquire per annum, that will be governed exactly by how much the staff can deal with. One big problem which is going to arise as a result of the passage of the Bill is not so much the disposal of the land acquired under the Bill as the disposal of the holdings which will be left behind by the migrants, the rearrangement and the proper stripping of such land.  The disposal of that land is going to determine the amount of land the Land Commission will require. I could not give an exact figure.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Unemployment at Lusk and Swords.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>To-day at Question Time I asked the Minister for Finance whether he would provide a grant for the relief of unemployment at Lusk and Swords, County Dublin.  The Parliamentary Secretary, in his reply, said that he was not aware of any reason why special measures should be taken for the relief of unemployment in Lusk and Swords, and he went on to indicate that employment schemes such as are administered by his section of the Department are intended mainly to provide employment for men who are applicants for unemployment assistance. He stated that there has not been any significant increase in the number of men in this class in the <Col N="1102" /> areas referred to.  I have had occasion before in this House to comment upon the method of assessment of the numbers of unemployed in relation to requests for grants of this kind.  I think, in the first instance, that he has given a totally false picture of the situation. He quoted figures of unemployment which have relation only to the number of men who are signing or who are in receipt of unemployment assistance. It should be obvious and known to everybody that a man who is in receipt of unemployment assistance must necessarily have been for a very long period signing at the labour exchange and must have exhausted his unemployment benefit <i>in toto.</i>  The number which is given as signing for unemployment assistance in any of these cases does not take into account the number which is signing at labour exchanges and who are in receipt of unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>In the areas to which I have referred, Lusk and Swords, there is widespread unemployment at the present time and it was in order to try to get some alleviation of that unemployment that I put down this question.  I think that an examination of County Dublin in connection with this matter will reveal that Dublin County has asked less in the matter of special relief grants than any county in Ireland since the establishment of this State.  It is a county that has always comprised a number of industrious small farmers who provide quite a considerable volume of employment ordinarily, considering the amount of land which they have to work as compared with holdings in other parts of the country.  It is an area, too, in which there has been a considerable amount of industrial development, and these two things have contributed to the fact that in the past County Dublin has asked very little of this State in the matter of unemployment relief grants. This request of mine to-day in respect of Swords and Lusk is one of the very few requests ever made in regard to unemployment relief in County Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would seem to me that the position has not been examined fully, and it seems to me also, that the reply given by the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="1103" /> to-day does not show up the true position that exists there.  I have been in both those areas within the past couple of days and it is idle to say that there are only 21 men unemployed in Swords when I know that 40 men will attend a meeting which is called purely for the unemployed and that there are others who cannot be there.  There is almost 70 men unemployed in Swords &mdash;that is, between those drawing unemployment relief or unemployment benefit.  There is also a large number unemployed in Lusk and I do not think it is good enough that we should receive a flat refusal when we ask that some measures should be taken to relieve the present position.</P>
    <P>The town of Swords particularly, which is regarded as being the focal point of North County Dublin, is an area where there is no industry of any kind.  It is an area wherein a great deal of unemployment has developed this year because of the fact that whereas hitherto there was a considerable volume of employment on the farms, there is not now that same volume due, in my view, to the passing of compulsory tillage.</P>
    <P>I think the State has a responsibility with reference to those men who are signing on at the labour exchange.  It may be easy for some people to take the view that in this state of things it is a man's own business whether he is working or not.  I do not think that is a correct view to take.  Every man who is unemployed is, first of all, a liability on the State&mdash;he is a dead loss&mdash;and, secondly, he is being denied what must be regarded as his fundamental right, the right to work. Therefore, I feel that the reply which was given to my question to-day is one which should be reconsidered.  The whole question is one deserving of more mature consideration than has apparently been accorded to it up to now.</P>
    <P>One of the contributory causes to the large-scale unemployment in Swords within the past month or six weeks has been the fact that a number of large building jobs have been closed down. At Collinstown there were quite a <Col N="1104" /> number of men employed on the laying of the runways at the Dublin airport. That work has been completed and the men are now unemployed. Then the county council were building 90 houses and there was a considerable amount of employment given to semiskilled and skilled workers.  That work has been completed and a large number of men have been thrown on the labour market.  Will nothing be done for these men?</P>
    <P>I protest very strongly against any inaction on the part of the State Department concerned with this matter.  If these men are going to be left idle, what have we passed legislation through this House for, legislation such as the Local Authorities (Works) Act and other such measures?  Were we merely shadow-boxing when we did that?  It is idle to talk about creating employment, giving full-scale employment, if we have large numbers of men next door to destitution, some of them on the border line of starvation, to use a hackneyed but true phrase.  There are numbers of families in Swords and Lusk who, because of unemployment, are very badly hit.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how the Parliamentary Secretary has reached the conclusion that a grant is not required in Swords and Lusk on the basis of the figures provided for him.  I can prove to his satisfaction, or to the satisfaction of the Minister or any other person who will take an interest and inquire into it, that there is widespread unemployment in these two areas.  In these circumstances, I ask the Parliamentary Secretary, if that is proved to his satisfaction, will he provide a grant for the relief of distress in Swords and Lusk?</P>
    <P>It is to be hoped that in the future we will not have to make requests of this kind.  I do not believe we will because, due to the good work now being done by the industrial development authority, we expect to have at least two factories started in the town of Swords in a short time.  It is hoped these factories will take in the slack so far as unemployment is concerned.  In the meantime, there is a good deal of work which could be done if the money were made available, whether by way of special grant from the Parliamentary <Col N="1105" /> Secretary's section of the Department of Finance or under any other scheme that can be brought forward.</P>
    <P>This area is adjacent to the main north road.  Both Lusk and Swords are adjacent to the main road which runs to Belfast.  There are dangerous corners on that road which could be taken off.  I have seen where, in various parts of the country, money has been spent on roads of secondary importance&mdash;corners taken off where there did not seem to be any great need to take them off.  Here on this road, where traffic is so intense&mdash;possibly so far as traffic density is concerned it is second only to the now famous Bray road&mdash;little or nothing has been done about improving it so far as dangerous bends are concerned.  For instance, there is the corner at Cloughran, close to Swords, and that corner could be made safer for vehicular traffic if money were provided.</P>
    <P>I protest against the Parliamentary Secretary's attitude.  He says that because there are so few drawing unemployment assistance in the district no scheme can be sanctioned.  I suggest that some inquiry should be made so as to discover the total number of men signing on at the labour exchange, drawing unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance, and a grant could be made available in accordance with the number so ascertained.  I can prove that the numbers of unemployed are substantially more than the Parliamentary Secretary has indicated.  I should like him to let us know what will be done for those men on whose behalf I am making this protest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Donnellan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully realise how very interested Deputy Dunne is in this area and in the people out there.  I think if Deputy Dunne is quite fair to me&mdash;as he always has been&mdash;he will admit that on one occasion last year, when he came to me about the position of the unemployed <Col N="1106" /> there, he got a grant.  Therefore, I was rather surprised that he raised this matter on the Adjournment.  He is quite welcome to come any day to my office and as I made it plain to him to-day, if he can make a good case he will find me quite sympathetic.  I indicated to him to-day that there are 21 men in receipt of unemployment assistance and if he can prove to me that there are more in that area who require employment I can assure him I can meet him on that point, and if we can get a scheme through within the limits of the regulations I definitely will sanction one in order to help the unemployed in that area.</P>
      <P>I want Deputy Dunne and the House to realise that for years past the practice has been to confine recruitment on employment schemes to the recipients of unemployment assistance.  I was quite correct to-day when I told Deputy Dunne that the number receiving unemployment assistance in that area was 21.  Since then I have gone into other matters, and I find that the number in that area receiving unemployment assistance and unemployment insurance benefits is not 71 but 41.  I can give an assurance that under the Local Authorities (Works) Act a considerable volume of work will shortly begin in the neighbourhood of the two places mentioned, and it should go a long way to relieve unemployment there amongst the people concerned. If the schemes contemplated under that Act do not relieve the unemployment position there, then I ask Deputy Dunne to be good enough to write to me or call to my office, and I can assure him that so far as it is in my power, within the regulations, to give a grant to get works going, there will be no unemployment amongst the people in that area in whom he is interested.</P>
