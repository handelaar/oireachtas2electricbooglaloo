      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he is aware that in many Dublin schools grievous overcrowding continues; and, if so, if he will state what steps he proposes to take to ensure that, where he is made aware of any case of grievous overcrowding, he has the necessary authority to appoint additional teachers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that a number of the schools in the Dublin area, particularly those on the outskirts of the city, are full to capacity and that some of them are temporarily overcrowded. This is especially so in the case of those schools which are located in the vicinity of the areas which have been or are being built up under the slum clearance schemes.  The provision of the additional school accommodation required for these areas had been rendered difficult owing to the virtual suspension of building during the emergency and by the fact that in the past ten years the school-going population of the primary schools in the city area has been increased by about 10,000. A number of large schemes for the provision of new schools for these areas are in hands and in some cases the work is well advanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additional teachers as may be warranted under the regulations by the figures of enrolment and average attendance are sanctioned in all such cases provided that reasonably adequate <Col N="796" /> classroom accommodation is available.</P>
    <P>The position both as to the provision of new accommodation and the staffing of existing schools is being kept under constant review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say whether he can on his own initiative appoint additional teachers where classroom accommodation is available and the classes are over-crowded?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he is aware of the hardship imposed on many working-class families by the high cost of text books and primers used in the primary schools, and if he will ascertain what would be the cost of providing all necessary school books free for all primary school pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the cost of text books and primers used in national schools imposes any special hardship on working-class families.  A scheme has been in operation for some years under which State grants are made towards the cost of providing text books for necessitous children attending national schools.  It is not proposed to extend that scheme so as to provide for the supply of free books for all national school children. It is estimated that the cost of providing books free to all national school children would be about £95,000 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister considered the manner in which the practice of changing text books and primers <Col N="797" /> in use in the schools is imposing additional hardship?  Has he also considered the fact that the existence of the special fund to which he referred means, in many cases, that a means test operates which embarrasses both parents and pupils in applying for these books?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the latter question, where children are in the position of being necessitous, that fact is fairly obvious.  I have not come up against any really serious difficulty with regard to the question of deciding whether children are necessitous or not.  As a matter of fact, in quite a number of cases the full grant is never taken up in the school.  As regards the change of books, the decision as to what books will be used in the school rests with the manager.  If there are any special cases where, as a result of a continual changing of books, unnecessary hardship arises, I should be glad to have particulars of such cases, because I do not think there is any real necessity for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he has received a motion from the Cork Corporation, passed on 13th September, 1949, expressing their disappointment at his failure to sanction payment of revised scales of salaries for the Cork school attendance officers and requesting him to sanction same without further delay; and, if so, whether he will state the date he received this motion and the date of his reply to the corporation, if any.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I received from the Cork Corporation on 16th September last a copy of the resolution referred to in the Deputy's question.  The officers in question were granted a very substantial increase in their basic scales in July, 1948.  They were subsequently granted the general temporary increase, computed by reference to the cost-of-living index figure of 290, which was allowed to civil servants, officers of local authorities and other groups with effect as from 29th May, 1948.  In view of these considerations, I cannot see my way to sanction any further increase in the basic scales of <Col N="798" /> the officers concerned.  I have notified the Cork Corporation to this effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider that it would be far more courteous to acknowledge the resolution of the corporation without unnecessary delay?  Is the Minister aware that these recommendations were made in the first instance by the Cork School Attendance Committee, which is comprised of well-known educationists&mdash;clergy, ex-teachers and others&mdash;and that it was due to the exceptionally good work of these officers that they made the recommendation? If he will look into the attendance figures of the Cork schools he will see the result of that very good work. Surely the resolution on this matter merited at least an acknowledgment on the part of the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of courtesy, I think very few individuals or bodies can complain of delay in dealing with correspondence by the Department.  So far as this particular case is concerned, there has been delay due to particular circumstances in the consideration of the matter.  If that delay has been the cause of inconvenience or embarrassment to the Cork committee, I am sorry, but I submit it is a very isolated case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that this is the only land in the vicinity which might possibly be used for the relief of congestion in the village of Raigha?  Will he not examine the whole position with a view to seeing if this land, or portion of it, could be used for the accommodation of at least two of the Raigha tenants so that the remaining holdings in the village can be rearranged satisfactorily?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a certain amount of congestion there.  The holdings in Raigha cannot be described as economic, but this land is not the land to relieve such congestion, is it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been examined on several occasions. <Col N="802" /> The Local Loans Fund was established for the benefit of the smaller local authorities who have not the standing to borrow elsewhere on reasonable terms.  Dublin Corporation has been able to procure capital for its housing and other activities independently of the fund and there is no reason to apprehend that it will not be able to do so in future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister appreciate that the rates at which the Dublin local authority have been able to acquire capital have resulted in the corporation having to charge rents to tenants which the tenants in many cases find themselves unable to pay?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

Is he further aware that not so long ago Royal Air Force pilots with less experience and training than Army Air Corps pilots here were taken on by Aer Lingus as additional pilots and had to be sent for further training back to England before they qualified?</P>

      <P>I am not challenging it.  What I am aware of is the number of ex-Irish Air Force men employed by Aer Lingus.  Of the ex-officer pilots, there are three with Aer Lingus and three on air traffic control; of the exregular pilots there are two with Aer Lingus; of the ex-sergeant pilots there are three, and that makes a total of 11.  In administrative posts you have four ex-officers with Aer Lingus and five on traffic control, and of ex-sergeant pilots you have one.  That makes a total of 21 of our ex-Air Corps pilots.</P>

Is the Minister aware that many of our ex-Army pilots had to go abroad to get employment, while ex-R.A.F. pilots were able to come over here and get employment from one of our commercial air lines, although they had not the experience that some of our ex-Army Air Corps pilots had?</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy is aware, or should be aware, that there is an International Air Traffic Agreement with regard to the basic minimum qualifications required for certain posts as pilots.  All the people who passed through our air force had not, up to the date of discharge, complied with these conditions, but they are in the position that, after a short course of post-Army training, they could get employment.  I have no evidence so far that, of the ex-Army men so qualified, there has been any discrimination against them.  I am aware of the fact that a number of our ex-Army flying people who wanted an immediate engagement were not able to get it in this country, but got it abroad.  Under the international agreement they were not qualified for employment as pilots here, but every facility was given to them to get the qualifications.</P>

      <P>A grant from the Hospitals' Trust Fund was made towards the cost of a maternity unit at Edenderry District Hospital in 1941.  The unit was provided but it was never used for maternity purposes.  I have recently informed the Offaly County Council that I consider it essential that accommodation for maternity patients should be made available without delay in Edenderry District Hospital.  I have suggested that alternative arrangements should be made to accommodate the staff of the hospital and that the present staff accommodation should be used as a maternity unit, as was originally intended.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is aware that matters relating to housing are the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government and that he has addressed this question to me because he is of opinion that if the rates of allowances under the Infectious Diseases (Maintenance) Regulations, 1948 and 1949, applicable in Cork City were applicable to persons living in houses built by Cork Corporation outside the city boundaries, the means of the man to whom he refers in the early part of the question would have been such that he would not have been regarded as ineligible for the allocation to him of one of the houses on grounds of insufficient means.</P>
      <P>As it is not possible for me, on the information supplied, to identify the man, I have been unable to make inquiries in the matter.  If the Deputy will furnish me, in confidence, with the necessary particulars I will cause inquiries to be made without delay and will communicate the result of my inquiries to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the last part of the question, which has reference to persons who are corporation tenants residing outside the corporation area, I would refer the Deputy to the reply I made to a similar question addressed to me on 2nd March last.  In that reply I explained that the disparity to which he refers does not necessarily involve payment of allowances at a lower rate to persons resident immediately outside the county borough owing to the discretion in regard to abatement vested in health authorities, but I invited him to bring to my notice any specific case in which there appeared to be hardship.  He has not done so, and I am glad to repeat <Col N="811" /> the invitation now, but the Deputy will appreciate that it will be necessary to furnish me with sufficient particulars to enable me to identify the person concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that this does not refer to an individual case only?  It is a general scale under which a rent allowance within the borough can be given up to a maximum of 15/- per week, but a rent allowance outside the borough can only be given up to a maximum of 10/- per week.  In the case of tuberculosis benefits, a man with a dependent wife is allowed £3 inside the borough and outside the borough only £2 15s. 0d.  The allowance for every child in the case of people outside the borough is 2/-a week less.  I only brought in the particular case of the lone couple because they would have got their full rent allowance of 15/- a week if they had been inside the borough.  On a previous occasion, I asked the Minister would he do what the Minister for Social Welfare does with regard to unemployment assistance.  He told me that the disparity was very slight.  If the Minister will look into it, he will see that the disparity is 5/- in regard to the rent allowance, 5/- in the maintenance allowance for a man and wife, and 2/- for every child.  The difference amounts to £1 a week if a man has a wife and four or five children.  I do not think that the disparity is slight in the case of a man with a small income.  As to the reply about abatement, there is nothing to abate when a man is dependent on his tuberculosis allowance alone.</P>

    <P>For the office of the Minister, the increased cost of administration accounts for £2,599 of the extra £9,350 required as compared with 1949/50.</P>
    <P>As was recently officially announced, I have established an Advisory Council of Education, the functions of which will be &ldquo;to advise the Minister, in so far as pertains to the powers, duties and functions of the State, upon such matters relating to educational theory and practice as they think fit and upon any educational questions and problems referred to them by him.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am very grateful to the Very Reverend Dr. Denis O'Keeffe, Professor of Ethics and Politics in University College, Dublin, for readily and graciously accepting my invitation to take upon himself the great responsibility of chairman, and the labours that must inevitably go with that responsibility.</P>
    <P>The council consists of 30 other members, distinguished as to personal qualification and experience.  I am deeply grateful to them all for the generosity and readiness with which each of them accepted the invitation to serve on the council.  One feature of the situation which I think throws a characteristic and a most encouraging light on the interest in education among all classes, and on the devotion to educational work on the part of those engaged therein, is that in no single instance did any person invited to serve on the council decline the invitation.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the first meeting of the council shall take place on Friday the 5th May, when I hope to discuss with its members the matters likely to engage their early attention. I should like to assure the members of the Oireachtas that the full assistance of the Department of Education will <Col N="819" /> be available for the council in any way calculated to lighten or guide their work.</P>
    <P>I have indicated before that I consider that there are important reasons why the council should not be formed of representatives nominated by various bodies.  In the actual setting up of the council, I have had to approach the matter from the point of view of my personal responsibility as Minister for Education and with a keen appreciation of what from my experience during the last two years I consider to be the most urgent and important matters which require consideration by a council.  I stress this personal responsibility for two reasons: first, there is the fact that the setting up of a council of education is one of the ten points originally set out as common policy of the inter-Party Government. Different Parties or different persons may, however, wish to lay different emphasis on what are the more important matters in education requiring to be attended to, or may have different ideas regarding the structure of a council.</P>
    <P>In the second place, the Report of the Commission on Vocational Organisation unanimously recommended the setting up of a council of a representative type.</P>
    <P>We are obviously not yet in a position in which a council of education can be set up as a piece of systematic vocational organisation, as contemplated generally in the report of the commission; nor is it clear at this stage that, later on, an advisory council of education will develop exactly along the lines suggested in paragraphs 535 and 540 of the commission's report.</P>
    <P>In his foreword, The Most Reverend Dr. Browne, Bishop of Galway, chairman of the commission, writes:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It (the report) has in more than one place made it clear that vocational organisations should develop from existing institutions and follow the laws of organic, vital growth, without violent breach of continuity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The present day or more urgent reasons dictating the establishment of an advisory council of education are, it seems to me, clearly indicated in <Col N="820" /> the report.  It is pointed out that certain facts stand out from evidence given before the commission on behalf of many bodies vitally interested in education.  The report, in paragraph 537, says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;From this evidence certain main facts stand out: first, the need for better co-ordination of all authorities concerned with education; secondly, the neglect of agricultural education in primary, secondary and vocational schools; thirdly, the disproportion between the expense of vocational education and the number and skill of workers prepared by it for industry and commerce; fourthly, the absence of differentiation between the curriculum for boys and that of girls.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This, in fact, emphasises that the matters that require first attention are the better co-ordination of these three principal branches of the present system, and the improvement of the school curricula.  The report further says, paragraph 537d:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is no organ to bring together for the avoidance of overlapping or even for consultation the different educational authorities, with their common general interests. Primary education is not properly co-ordinated with post-primary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And at the end of paragraph 539:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At present it is the practice of the Department to consult a limited number of educational bodies, such as the more important teachers' and headmasters' organisations.  These are consulted only occasionally on selected subjects and always separately and privately, so that no one body is aware of the attitude of the others.  There is no permanent consultative council representing all directly concerned, where differing views could be debated and harmonised, important questions submitted to steady and continuous examination and informed public opinion on educational matters expressed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All this confirms me in the view that what is required at present is the bringing together of a group of persons <Col N="821" /> competent and experienced in the working of primary, secondary and vocational schools for the purpose of considering with as unified a mind as possible the work which can and should be done in each of these three classes of schools, so as to give the best possible education to our children from the infant stage up to, say, 18 years of age.</P>
    <P>The members of the council have been selected by me as persons fully competent detachedly to review and to make recommendations on the curriculum of these three branches of the present system.</P>
    <P>The basic preliminary decisions must concern the work to be done in the primary schools.</P>
    <P>The children will leave these schools, many to go directly into employment, the rest to proceed to secondary or vocational schools.  Those who go directly into employment will require a foundation from which will develop an increasing knowledge and strengthening of character as they discharge the duties of citizenship and worker. Those who go to either secondary or vocational schools will require to be so equipped that the standard of work in these schools will be brought to the highest possible level.  The primary school must, therefore, cater to the fullest possible extent for the education, the character development and the skill-acquisition of the children of primary-school age.</P>
    <P>Conciliation and arbitration machinery has been established already for the Civil Service.  I would hope that before the present year ended it might be possible to establish analogous machinery for the various groups of teachers. Such machinery would help to circumscribe the labour inevitably involved, sometimes in a rather widespread way, in discussing and dealing with questions affecting salaries, conditions of service, etc.  I am anxious to see established as much harmony and satisfaction as may be secured by such machinery.  I feel that it would release for many people for purely educational work energies that are now otherwise absorbed.</P>
    <P>There has been an improvement in the printing situation.  The report of <Col N="822" /> the Department for the year 1945-6 was made available to Deputies in October last; that for the year 1946-7 was made available in November last, and I expect that the report for the year 1947-8 will be in Deputies' hands in the course of a week or two.  It may be a disadvantage to Deputies to get three reports so closely together, but there may be an advantage in that, by a ready comparison, some estimate of progress may be made more easily.</P>
    <P Just="Center">PRIMARY EDUCATION.</P>
    <P>As regards primary education, the accommodation in the training colleges is now being availed of to the full.  The system of appointing or retaining teachers with reference to average enrolment as against average attendance appears to have increased the demand for teachers.  Furthermore, the downward trend in the school-going population has been arrested, and in 1948, for the first time in 15 years, the number on rolls exceeded the number for the previous year.  Since 1942, the number of births registered annually has been roughly 9,000 more than the annual registration in the previous decade For some years prior to the 1st January, 1945, women were required to retire on pension on reaching 60 years of age, provided they had then 35 years' pensionable service to their credit.  As from that date, however, the easing of the problem of unemployment among teachers allowed of the gradual extension of these limits of age and years of pensionable service, so that now women teachers may be retained in the service up to the end of the quarter in which they reach 65 years of age.  Those women teachers who reached 60 years of age in the quarter ending 31st March, 1945, and who were allowed to remain on in the teaching service, retired on the 31st March, 1950, on reaching 65 years of age.  Similarly, future quarters will carry a quota of retirements greater than the corresponding quota for the past five years. These increased retirements will leave more vacancies for young teachers.</P>
    <P>The non-availability of sufficient trained women teachers has made it necessary to postpone the introduction of the scheme for the replacement of the untrained junior assistant mistress <Col N="823" /> by the trained junior assistant teacher. In this connection also, it may be noted that even the annual demand for junior assistant mistresses has shown a very considerable increase.  To meet this increased demand in 1949-50 it was found necessary to modify in certain details the conditions for qualification as junior assistant mistress at the 1949 competition, thereby extending qualification to some 75 additional candidates. The modified conditions also apply to the competition being conducted in 1950.</P>
    <P>Any decision to raise the age up to which whole-time attendance at school is compulsory will raise serious questions of curriculum, accommodation, staff and co-ordination with existing facilities.</P>
    <P>I am actively engaged in the consideration of the problems which arise out of the existence of large classes in primary schools&mdash;particularly in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The primary school certificate examination was again successfully conducted in 1949.  29,673 pupils sat for it and 22,888 or 77.1 per cent. of them were awarded the certificate.  The certificate testifies to the successful completion by the pupils of the national school programme up to and including the sixth standard and their success at a written examination in Irish, English and arithmetic.  Normally, the standard for a pass in these subjects is: Irish, 40 per cent.; English, 30 per cent. for pupils from FíorGhaeltacht schools and 40 per cent. for all others; and 40 per cent. in arithmetic. In the case of the 1949 examination, however, it was decided for that year alone to accept 30 per cent. as the pass mark in Irish.  Some criticism had been levelled at the paper in Irish as being unduly exacting for pupils of the sixth standard and it was felt, on consideration of the whole matter, that a reduction in the percentage mark required for a pass would, in all the circumstances, be warranted, but only for that particular examination in the year 1949.</P>
    <P>Reference was made last year to the improvements which had been effected in the scales of salaries introduced in <Col N="824" /> 1946, particularly in the application of those scales to teachers in the smaller types of school.  Reference was also made to the abolition of the highly-efficient rating, as a result of which the teachers whose service was satisfactory but who had not been rated highly-efficient&mdash;some 70 per cent. of the teachers paid personal salaries&mdash;were enabled, as from 1st April, 1949, to proceed along the scale to the higher maximum salaries formerly reserved for those who were rated highly-efficient.</P>
    <P>The committee which was set up early in 1949 to consider the remuneration and superannuation of national school teachers, and which has come to be known as the &ldquo;Roe Committee&rdquo;, presented two reports&mdash;a majority report and a minority report&mdash;on 18th May, 1949.  The main recommendations in matters of principle made in the majority report were accepted by the Government.  It was found, however, that the actual scales of salary recommended in that report would place a burden of undue magnitude on the taxpayer and the Government were unable to approve of their adoption.</P>
    <P>Following full consideration of the reports, and having regard to the circumstances of the national economy, I formulated proposals in the matter of salary and pension to give effect to the recommendations of the committee which were accepted in principle by the Government.  These proposals were conveyed to the Central Executive Committee of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation on 21st September, 1949.  The proposals in the matter of salary have been implemented with effect as from 1st January, 1950, but it was not found possible to make any payments arising out of the new scales until after the close of the financial year.  In order to implement the proposals in the matter of superannuation, a scheme to amend the National Teachers' Superannuation Schemes must be presented to each House of the Oireachtas for approval.  It is hoped to have the amending scheme ready for presentation at an early date.</P>
    <P>The reports of the Roe Committee and the proposals made to the Irish National Teachers' Organisation have <Col N="825" /> been presented to the Oireachtas for the information of Deputies and Senators, but it may be well to refer to the main features of the present salary and pension position.</P>
    <P>Under the revised scales of salary introduced as from 1st January, 1950, substantial improvements have been effected in the conditions of remuneration of national school teachers.  The actual scales themselves represent a considerable increase at the minimum and at the maximum for all teachers over the scales previously in operation and they must be regarded as being fair and just, having regard to all the circumstances of the time.  The important principle of common scales of salary and allowances for women and single men teachers, which has long been strongly urged by the teachers and which was advocated in the majority report of the Roe Committee, has been implemented.  This is a departure for which there is no parallel in England, Scotland, Wales or the Six Counties, and it is worthy of note that the new common scales apply in full to all serving teachers as well as to new entrants.  The position has now been reached, for the first time, that the appropriate full-scale salary according to qualifications and service will be paid, subject to satisfactory completion of probation, to all teachers in national schools, irrespective of the size of the school.  In addition to the common scales for single men and women, men teachers on marriage will receive a lump sum gratuity of £75 and will also enter, at the appropriate point, a marriage allowance scale rising from £50 a year at the minimum to £125 a year at the maximum.  Married men teachers will, of course, continue to receive the rent allowance at present available.</P>
    <P>The new scales of salary which have been introduced as from the 1st January, 1950, together with the new pension benefits which it is proposed to grant as from the same date will involve the addition to present expenditure of £750,000 a year rising to £880,000 after some years.</P>
    <P>With regard to pension, the proposed amending scheme will provide for the payment of a lump sum on retirement to men teachers of an amount up <Col N="826" /> to a maximum of one and a half times the teacher's pensionable salary in addition to the existing pension up to a maximum of one-half of the teacher's pensionable salary.  In the case of women teachers, pension will be based on one-sixtieth of pensionable salary, instead of one-eightieth as at present, for each completed year of pensionable service up to a maximum of forty-sixtieths instead of forty-eightieths as at present.  The result of this change will be that the maximum pension for women teachers will be two-thirds of the pensionable salary, instead of one-half as heretofore. These improved pension terms will be available to all national teachers without contribution from salary and without any devaluation of existing pensionable service.</P>
    <P>The cost of the erection of new schools, and of the enlargement, reconstruction, etc., of existing schools is defrayed partly by State grants and partly by contributions from local sources.  The grants are made by the Department of Education, up to a maximum total amount which is fixed by the Minister for Finance from year to year according to requirements, and are expended by the Commissioners of Public Works, out of moneys provided in Vote 9, the Public Works and Buildings Vote.  Normally, the grant is two-thirds of the cost, but in necessitous districts grants of more than two-thirds may be allowed.  The grants may be made only in respect of schools which are vested by official leases to which the Minister for Education is a party.</P>
    <P>The principle of the provision of local contributions towards the cost of school building and improvement is an integral part of the managerial system. The schools are the property of the parish and it is considered to be most important that the people should provide a portion of the cost of erection and subsequent necessary improvements, as well as funds for maintenance, in order that the locality may be closely associated with and have a direct interest in the schools.</P>
    <P>The basis of the arrangements for school building and improvement, which is embodied in the rules and regulations, is that the State contributes <Col N="827" /> two-thirds and the locality one-third of the cost, unless in exceptionally poor areas where grants of more than two-thirds may be allowed.  In recent years, however, the all-over local contribution has fallen far short of the expected quota.  During the year ended 31st March, 1950, the State grants towards the total works programme, estimated at £579,000, amounted to £480,000, or approximately 83 per cent. of the total cost, the remaining £99,000, or approximately 17 per cent., being provided locally.  This is some improvement on the previous year, when the local aid towards a total estimated expenditure of £574,000 amounted to £77,000 or only 13.4 per cent. of the total.</P>
    <P>While building prices have increased to such an extent that it would be difficult, in many areas, to raise the normal quota of one-third for new schools or for improvements, etc., to existing schools, nevertheless it is felt that the position as regards local contributions is not as satisfactory as it ought to be.  It is to be hoped that, with a fuller appreciation of their responsibilities and duties, the people of the parishes will, as far as they can do so, provide their managers with the necessary funds to enable reasonable local contributions to be made for the erection, etc. of the schools and for the upkeep of the buildings.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECONDARY EDUCATION.</P>
    <P>The net Estimate for Secondary Education is £926,330, an increase of £30,030 on last year's Vote.</P>
    <P>The additional cost of £13,650 for capitation grant is due to the increase in the number of schools and pupils. This increase has been fairly steady and continuous over a number of years. Since 1930, the number of schools has risen from 306 in that year to 416 at present.  In the same period, the number of pupils has grown from 30,996 to 47,065.  It is gratifying to be able to conclude from these figures that, year by year, facilities for secondary education are being made available to greater numbers of our young people.  I think some expression of gratitude is due to the bodies and institutions <Col N="828" /> whose zeal and co-operation have made that extension possible.</P>
    <P>There is an increase of £9,400 in the incremental salary grant.  This is due to an increase in the number of teachers in receipt of incremental salary and to the necessity for providing for additional increments within the scales for existing teachers.  At present only about one-third of the teachers in receipt of incremental salary have reached the maximum point on their respective scales.</P>
    <P>Examinations are estimated to cost £1,540 more than last year.  This is due to an expected rise in the number of candidates and to the fact that the remuneration of attendants has been increased.  Since 1925, when the intermediate and leaving certificate examinations replaced the junior, middle and senior grade examinations, there has been a consistent upward trend in the number of candidates sitting for the certificate examinations.  In 1930, there were only 5,250 candidates as compared with 14,440 in 1949.  It is expected that the number for 1950 will be up to 15,000.</P>
    <P>Laboratory grants show an increase of £3,000.  The number of classes in respect of which the special grants for science, agricultural science, domestic science and manual instruction are payable has increased by 100 classes compared with last year.  It is regrettable that, in spite of the higher grant payable in respect of agricultural science, very few schools have been willing to introduce that subject into the curriculum.</P>
    <P>The Irish language continues to make reasonably satisfactory progress in the secondary schools.  Of the existing 416 schools, instruction in whole or in part is being given through the medium of Irish in 215, and of these all the instruction is being given through Irish in 107 schools, that being the highest number yet reached in the class A category.  Provision was first made for the financial year 1947-48 for special grants to schools to promote the use of Irish as the ordinary vernacular of the pupils outside the classroom.  All schools are entitled to participate and the schools are divided for the purposes of the scheme into four categories, so that schools which have not yet made <Col N="829" /> any considerable progress in oral Irish may not be in competition with schools where the standard is at the moment much higher.  In the year 1947-48, 118 schools benefited by these special grants, and the scheme is regarded as having operated very successfully to extend the use of Irish as a spoken language in the schools concerned.</P>
    <P>Payments to the Secondary Teachers' Pension Fund will amount to £3,000. This is the deficit anticipated as a consequence of the increase in secondary teachers' pensions under the Secondary Teachers' Superannuation (Amendment) Scheme, 1949.  In former years the annual contributions to the fund by the teachers and their employers were sufficient to meet the payment of the pensions and only a nominal sum of £10 was provided under this sub-head.</P>
    <P>Secondary teachers are in the position that there has been no alteration in their scales of salary since 1946.  I have recently had representations in the matter, which are at present having consideration.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION.</P>
    <P>The net Estimate for technical instruction is £704,730, that is, an increase of £44,350.</P>
    <P>Annual grants to vocational education committees show an increase of £33,548.  The Vocational Education Act, 1947, gave local authorities power to raise progressively larger sums by way of rates for the purposes of vocational education.  When they do so, the State grants, which correspond with the sums so raised, must be increased accordingly.</P>
    <P>There are at present 182 vocational schools.  The fundamental principle on which these schools are conducted is that, on the one hand, they give an education and a training based on the economic requirements of the local community and, on the other, care is taken that general education, character formation and continued instruction in religious doctrine are catered for as fully as possible.</P>
    <P>The vocational schools have a threefold function.  They provide for the continued education of adolescents who are not following a secondary course, for technical instruction for such, and for adult education generally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="830" /> Continuation Education.&mdash;Continuation education extends to both urban and rural areas.  It is a full-time day school scheme for boys and girls between 14 and 16 or 17 years of age, and the immediate aim of the course is to prepare young people for employment. The course includes religious instruction, for which the committees are indebted to the co-operation of the local clergy, and also the teaching of Irish and of general educational subjects, but a very substantial amount of the instruction is in practical subjects.</P>
    <P>Rural Schools.&mdash;Of the 182 vocational schools 120 may be described as rural schools.</P>
    <P>The typical rural school has a staff of three teachers, who devote about two-thirds of their time to the day classes and about one-third to the evening classes for adults.</P>
    <P>The backbone of the day school programme in them is rural science and manual instruction for boys, and domestic science subjects for girls.</P>
    <P>The evening classes are, however, no less important than the day classes. In them, the rural science teacher, a university graduate in agricultural science, meets the young farmers of his area, and these classes, often called, rightly, &ldquo;discussion groups&rdquo;, afford a stimulating opportunity of relating scientific knowledge and agricultural practice.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the manual instructor gives invaluable help in his own sphere.  The trend of modern life tends to reduce the number of tradesmen to be found in country areas, and so the farmer is being thrown ever more and more on his own resources.  For this reason, the skilled services of the manual instructor will, there can be no doubt, be increasingly in demand in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Domestic economy instruction is of first-class importance.  The influence domestic instructresses have had on both town and country life is too well known for it to be necessary to dwell on it.  Their work is excellent.  I should like to see them take an even more active part in the life of the people generally and particularly in the activities of such progressive organisations as the Irish Countrywomen's Association and Muintir na Tíre and in association with Macra na Feirme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="831" /> In regard to the vocational system generally, the total number of students enrolled in all types of classes is increasing annually.  In 1948-9 it stood at 81,077, as compared with 79,126 in the previous year.  In evening classes, the numbers in attendance rose from 37,856 in 1947-8 to 38,866 in 1948-9, but a more marked increase has occurred in the whole-time day continuation courses. In these, the enrolment in 1947-8 was 14,771, while in 1948-9 it rose to 16,430.</P>
    <P>The outstanding feature in the whole-time day continuation courses was the great demand in all centres for admission to the junior technical courses for boys, which are now regarded as the main avenue to the trades.</P>
    <P>There has also been, in recent years in urban areas, a steady increase in the number of local training schemes arranged between representatives of particular occupations and local vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, it is estimated that 4,500 apprentices were enrolled in classes in 1949-50, while in Cork over 100 apprentices were enrolled, in Limerick over 100, and in Waterford nearly 70.</P>
    <P>Irish in Vocational Schools.&mdash;It is the policy of the Department to make the teaching of Irish in vocational schools as attractive as possible, and for this reason the training for the teastas timire Gaeilge, the qualification required in teachers of Irish, includes practice in the teaching of drama, of singing, of dancing, in so far as they are associated with Irish.</P>
    <P>As a result of this policy, good attendance is recorded at Irish classes, not only in the full-time day courses, but at the evening classes as well.</P>
    <P>Satisfactory instruction is given through the medium of Irish in the Gaeltacht counties, viz., Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Mayo and Meath; and certain subjects, e.g., geography, arithmetic and domestic economy, are taught satisfactorily through the medium of Irish in 57 schools in non-Gaeltacht counties.</P>
    <P>In most vocational schools, a social feature is the production of dramas in Irish, and other activities in Irish include <Col N="832" /> claisceadal, concerts, tráthanna na gceist, díospóireachtaí and scora-íochtaí.</P>
    <P>A feature introduced under the County Limerick Committee in the session 1948-49 is worthy of special mention.  There a series of meetings was arranged between students from various Irish classes throughout the county, for the purposes of inter-class debates, concert items, teas provided by the pupils of the centre concerned, and céilidhes or courts of poetry or lectures.</P>
    <P>Nine in all of these meetings were arranged, and from 100 to 200 adults were present at each.</P>
    <P>I should like to see activity of this kind imitated in other areas.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SPECIAL COURSES.</P>
    <P>The following summer courses for teachers were held last summer:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  Irish Drama.&mdash;A course in the production of drama in Irish was held at Taibhdhearc na Gaillimhe, and was attended by 19 teachers of Irish in vocational schools.  The purpose of the course was to enable teachers, particularly those working in the Gaeltacht or Breac-Ghaeltacht, to foster local interest in Irish drama and thereby to strengthen the position of the language socially and as a medium of expression. All aspects of dramatic production were explained and demonstrated, and different types of drama were studied and rehearsed.  At the end of the course, the teachers undertook the entire responsibility for the public performance of a drama, which they produced successfully.</P>
    <P>(b)  Irish and Continuation Subjects.&mdash;A summer course in Irish and continuation subjects was held at the Technical School, Galway.  The course in Irish was organised to enable university graduates and undergraduates in their final year to secure qualifications as whole-time teachers of Irish and general subjects under vocational committees.</P>
    <P>It was attended by 41 students, of whom 18 were awarded the full teastas timire Gaeilge at the end of the course.</P>
    <P>The course in continuation subjects was designed to give teachers of Irish <Col N="833" /> already employed under committees qualifications to teach English, arithmetic and geography, so as to make it possible to employ them economically as whole-time teachers.  Of the 19 teachers who attended, 11 secured teaching qualifications in English, nine in arithmetic and three in geography.</P>
    <P>(c)  Rural Science.&mdash;A course in rural science, for students who had completed their course for the degree in agricultural science and for those in their second last year, was held in the Technical School, Kevin Street, Dublin.  Eighteen students attended and certificates of satisfactory attendance and progress were issued to 12 of them.</P>
    <P>(d)  Agricultural Machinery.&mdash;A summer course in the repair and maintenance of agricultural machinery was held in the Crawford Technical Institute, Cork.  This course, which lasted a month, was designed to afford a limited number of metalwork instructors experience in the repair and maintenance of agricultural machinery, so that they might be in a position to give instruction in these subjects in rural areas.  Seventeen metalwork instructors attended, and a special feature of the course was the co-operation of engineering firms who provided special lecturers, as well as tractors and tractor implements.</P>
    <P>(e)  Rural Building Construction.&mdash;A special summer course in farm building construction was held at Bush, County Louth, for 25 woodwork teachers.  The course was most successful, and many of the teachers who attended it are now planning and directing improvements in farmsteads in their own areas.</P>
    <P>(f)  Art Crafts.&mdash;A special course in art crafts was organised, in this instance not by the Department, but by the City of Waterford Vocational Education Committee, and was attended by 21 teachers.  A wide range of exercises in handloom weaving, book crafts and fabric printing was undertaken, with a view to their subsequent use in classes in vocational schools.  I would like very much to commend the initiative of the Waterford Committee.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="834" /> LOCAL COURSES.</P>
    <P>(a)  Demonstrations of Agricultural Machinery.&mdash;Through the co-operation of the various firms interested in agricultural machinery, a series of demonstrations were given during the past year at Ardee, Athy, Ballinasloe, Dungarvan and Kilkenny.  Lectures and films were given in the local vocational schools, while practical demonstrations were given, by expert mechanics, of the working of the various agricultural implements, such as tractors, mowing machines, cultivators and combined harvesters.</P>
    <P>Attendance at the lectures varied from 35 to 50 farmers, while the outdoor demonstrations attracted from 50 to 200 farmers, in each area.</P>
    <P>(b)  Rural Smithwork and Farriery.&mdash; Intensive six-weeks courses were held in 1949-50 in rural smithwork and farriery at Dungarvan, Tuam and Westport.  The subjects of instruction were farriery, electrical and acetylene welding and repair of agricultural machinery.  Thirteen smiths attended in Dungarvan, 12 in Westport and nine in Tuam.</P>
    <P>(c)  Rural Electrification.&mdash;A number of lectures and demonstrations on the use of electricity in the home was given by engineering teachers under the local vocational education committees&mdash;six lectures at Iniscarra, eight at Two-Mile-Borris, County Tipperary, and a short series to the residents of Inch and Tara Hill, County Wexford.</P>
    <P>(d)  Rural Building Construction.&mdash; Courses in rural building construction in connection with the farm improvement scheme of the Department of Agriculture were held in 14 counties. Of these there were four centres in County Kerry, three each in County Cork and in County Leitrim, and at least one in each of 11 other counties.</P>
    <P>Of the projects concerned, poultry-houses were the most popular: eight were made in County Leitrim, 12 in County Mayo and 12 in County Limerick, of types to accommodate 50, 75 or 100 birds.  In most cases, the joinery was done in the local vocational school and the rest of the work was carried out on the site.  In County <Col N="835" /> Cork, other projects included farm gates, pig troughs and chicken runs.</P>
    <P>(e)  Training of Building Apprentices. &mdash;Courses for the training of building apprentices were organised in three areas.  All the courses were based on the work required for the construction of a two-storey dwelling-house, with special instructors employed to deal with plumbing and plastering.  Ten apprentices were enrolled at a course held at Ennis, 12 at Carrick-on-Shannon and ten at Dunmanway.  The courses lasted eight weeks, and were considered to have been very successful.</P>
    <P>Training Courses for Teachers of Woodwork and Metalwork.&mdash;Vocational education committees have been unable to secure qualified teachers in manual instruction, that is, for woodwork and metalwork, to meet the great increase in the demand for instruction in these subjects in day and evening courses. The Department, accordingly, made arrangements for the holding of two training courses, one for woodwork instructors at Bolton Street School, Dublin, and one for metalwork instructors at Ringsend School, Dublin.  These two long courses commenced in October last and will conclude in June, 1951.  There are 20 students following the training course in woodwork instruction and 14 following the training course in metalwork instruction.  Provision has also been made for instruction in Irish in the Gaeltacht for a period of two months during the summer of this year, with a view to affording these students every possible assistance for the examination for the ceard-teastas Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>In view of the very considerable demand for woodwork instructors, it will be necessary to hold a further long training course for 20 students, and it is proposed to hold this course from October, 1950, to June, 1952, in the School of Art, Cork City, where the City of Cork Vocational Education Committee have very generously afforded us facilities.</P>
    <P>A number of short courses for teachers will be held in 1950-51.</P>
    <P>(a)  Rural Building Construction.&mdash; During the present year it is proposed <Col N="836" /> to hold a further summer course for about 20 teachers to continue the training already given.  It has been decided by the Department to concentrate this year on training in the erecting of an extension to the art teacher's workshop which would be used by him for preparing and storing his materials. The teacher students will thus receive training in the various building processes, e.g., plastering, plumbing, decorating, etc.  The course will be held at Ballina.</P>
    <P>(b)  Rural Science Course.&mdash;The usual summer courses for graduates and under-graduates who propose to become teachers of rural science will be held in Kevin Street School, Dublin.</P>
    <P>Local Courses for Apprentices.&mdash;It is proposed to hold this year two local courses in rural building construction for apprentices also.  These will be held in Ballyhaunis, County Mayo, and in Tralee, and will last eight weeks.  An attendance of 12 apprentices at each course is expected.</P>
    <P>Four local courses in farriery and rural smithwork will also be held this year at Newcastle West, Roscommon Town, Kilkenny City, and Ballinasloe.</P>
    <P>The testing of seed for farmers was continued in the rural vocational schools.</P>
    <P>Another item worthy of note was the showing in vocational schools of a second collection of paintings by Irish artists.  The courses for the diploma in social and economic science organised by University College, Cork, in conjunction with the vocational education committees, and held in Cork, Limerick and Waterford during the session 1948-49 proved extraordinarily successful.  In Cork, 34 adult trade unionists were enrolled and 30 in each of the Cities of Limerick and Waterford. The attendance of these students rarely fell below 90 per cent.</P>
    <P>A first year course has begun during this session in Clonmel, in association with University College, Cork, and introductory courses in preparation for the session 1950-51 have been organised in Fermoy and Killarney.</P>
    <P>To Dr. Alfred O'Rahilly, President, University College, Cork, is due the credit for having initiated these courses, and for the enthusiasm and industry <Col N="837" /> with which they were organised, and it has been a very great pleasure to me and to the officers of the Department to be in a position to cooperate with Dr. O'Rahilly in this very valuable form of adult education.</P>
    <P>Similar courses have begun this year in Carlow and Kilkenny, organised by the authorities of University College, Dublin.</P>
    <P>Building Projects in 1949-50 and 1950-51.&mdash;During the year 1949-50, there were sanctioned 13 building projects, comprising the building of new schools or of extensions to existing schools, representing a total capital cost of £151,000.  It is expected that it will be possible to sanction approximately the same amount of building during the present year.  I am referring to technical schools now.</P>
    <P>This brings me to an important matter.  The Vocational Education (Amendment) Act, 1947, enabled committees to obtain contributions from the rating authorities up to the amount of a rate of 9d. in the £ in the cities and scheduled urban districts, and of 7d. in the £ in country areas. It was not then expected that any addition to those rates would be required for some years to come, if at all.  In the intervening period, however, the staffs of the committees, being paid according to the bonus system operating in the Civil Service, have received increases in pay, and this, combined with the need for expansion to meet the growing demand for vocational education, has upset materially the estimate of future requirements which had been prepared by the Department as the basis for the Act of 1947.  As a result, a number of committees are at present at or very near the maximum point of their income from the rates, aided by the State, and so would be unable after next year to meet their obligations in regard to the salary increments of their officials or in regard to further expansion of their schemes.  In these circumstances, further amending legislation will be necessary during the current year and the proposals for a Bill are at present under consideration.</P>
    <P Just="Center">REFORMATORY AND INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS.</P>
    <P>The net Estimate for this Vote is <Col N="838" /> £155,210.  This is a decrease of £19,640 on last year's Vote.</P>
    <P>A reduction of £2,350 has been made in the provision for capitation grant to industrial schools and as a small decrease is anticipated in the number detained in reformatory schools the provision of £9,100 is down by £150.</P>
    <P>Building and equipment grants are estimated to cost £5,000 as against £18,550 last year.  The amount now provided is a revote, being the balance of a special grant of £40,000 towards the cost of building a new industrial school for senior boys.</P>
    <P>The receipts from parents of committed children and the allowances in respect of such children from the Department of Social Welfare and from the British Ministry of Pensions are expected to reach £15,700, an increase of £3,643 on last year's figure. The total accommodation available in girls' industrial schools is for 4,531 girls.  The number under detention on the 31st December, 1949, was 3,221, a decrease of 50 on the previous year.</P>
    <P>The accommodation available in boys' schools is for 3,394 boys.  There were 2,848 under detention on 31st December, 1949, a decrease of 89 on the position a year previously.</P>
    <P>Provision is being made in 1950-51 for 6,200 children at a cost of £153,750, as compared with 6,300 children at a cost of £156,100 for the year 1949-50.</P>
    <P>A new industrial school is being established at Celbridge, County Kildare, to provide for senior boys from the Dublin area.  The need for this school arose from representations by district justices that, owing to lack of vacancies in the industrial schools in Dublin, they were obliged to commit boys from Dublin to schools at a considerable distance from their homes.  It is expected that the new school will be ready for occupation this year.  A State grant of £40,000 towards the cost of the school was sanctioned in the financial year 1946-47 and £34,932 has already been spent.</P>
    <P>Nearly 2,500 children out of a total of about 6,000 were given home leave in 1949.  I am satisfied that the school managers allow children home on holidays in all cases where it is possible to do so without prejudice to the best <Col N="839" /> interests of the children.  The maximum holiday period is 31 days.  In cases where it was not possible or desirable to allow children to spend the holiday period out of school, arrangements were made by the school managers for picnics, excursions and outings for the children so detained.  Four of the schools (two boys' schools and two girls' schools) provided holiday camps at the seaside for the children.</P>
    <P>In the reformatory school for boys at Daingean, there is accommodation for 250.  The number under detention on 31st December, 1949, was 187, as against 208 in the previous year.  Improved accommodation is being provided by the erection of two new wings which will comprise class-rooms, dormitories, ablution rooms and workshops.  One of the wings was completed and occupied in the summer of 1949.  Work will begin on the second wing in the very near future.</P>
    <P>The school for girls at Kilmacud, certified in April, 1944, has accommodation for 80 girls.  The average number of committed cases under detention there for 1949 was only seven.  There were also on 31st December, 1949, seven others who had been admitted other than by committal by the courts under the Children's Acts.</P>
    <P>Payment on a national figure of 40 is being made to the management of that school as, owing to the small number of girls committed, current expenses could not be met if State grants were paid only on the actual number under detention.</P>
    <P>The school at Limerick has accommodation for 50 girls and the number under detention at present is 31.</P>
    <P>The place of detention, Marlborough House, Glasnevin, is the only one under the control of the Department.  It has accommodation for 50 boys, and the average daily number under detention is about ten.</P>

      <P>Tairgim go gcuirfear an Meastachán thar n-ais chun a ath-rite.  Seanfhocal is ea é, beagnach, anois gur beatha teangan í labhairt, agus má tá aon cheacht ann d'fhoghlaimeodh Aire <Col N="840" /> Oideachais, nó éinne eile a chuireann spéis in obair na teangan, trí obair na scoile, is é ceacht é nach féidir luí go ró-mhór ar labhairt na Gaeilge fhéin. Gidh go gcaithfear cúram maith a thabhairt do chruinneas i gcúrsaí scríbhneoireachta agus léitheoireachta is dóigh liom gurb é an bun-chuspóir ná labhairt na Gaeilge d'fheabhsú agus a leathnú agus gach uile dheis a thabhairt don aos óg chun é sin a dhéanamh.  Ní bhraitheann an labhairt sin ar an gclár is ar an atmoisféir agus ar an spirid sa scoil a bhraitheas sé. Agus caithfimid a admháil gur beag a bhíos de bharr shaothair, go hiondúil, ag an múinteoir bíodh is go ndéanann sé a dhícheall, nuair atá an spirid sin ar iarraidh, spirid nach foláir dá thuismitheoirí féin a mhúscailt agus a chothú sa bpáiste.  Tá a lán de thuis-mitheoirí na tíre seo lán-tsásta cabhrú lena gclann lena gcuid ceachtanna agus trioblóid a chur orthú féin leis an nGaeilge bíodh is gur iomó duine acu ar chaol-chuid Gaeilge.  D'ainneoin iad a bheith taobh le beagán Gaeilge, iad féin agus d'ainneoin an trioblóid a chuireas ceachtanna Gaeilge a gclainne orthu, sílim go bhfuil siad i bhfábhar na Gaeilge tríd is tríd agus aon mhíthuiscint atá ann d'fhéadfaí an mhíthuiscint sin a scaipeadh.  Is dóigh liom go bhfuil siad i bhfábhar, agus is féidir an ceo, má tá sé ann, a scaipeadh anois.</P>
      <P>Tá dream neamhspleách éigin ann, gidh go bhfuil siad ag fáil roinnt airgid ón Rialtas, atá lasmuigh de chúrsaí poilitíochta, is é sin an Chomhdháil.  Do mhol siad rudaí tábhabhtacha le gairid.  Ceann de na moltaí sin ná go gcuirfí teist bhéil ar bun sna scoileanna.  Rud an-dheacair é sin, is dóigh liom, ach má táimid le dul ar aghaidh caithfear é a dhéanamh chun labhairt na Gaeilge a chur ar an mbunús ceart agus caighdeán ceart a bheith ann.  Ní dóigh liom go mbeidh aon slí as ach triail éigin a bhaint as teist mar sin.  Mara bhféadfaí é sin a dhéanamh, b'fhéidir go bhféadfaí rud éigin mar atá ar siúl sna meán-scoileanna a chur ar bun agus duaiseanna leabhra agus mar sin a thabhairt do na daltaí a chleachtas an Ghaeilge go maith agus a bheir deá-shompla.</P>

    <P>Is féidir a lán a dhéanamh tríd an <Col N="841" /> Radio agus an Ollscoil, dá mbeadh toil ag an Ollscoil é a dhéanamh.  Ba cheart go mbeadh sé de dhualgas ar Ollscoil mhuintir na hÉireann leanúint le cultúir agus tradisiún na tíre seo. Ba chóir dóibh a ndualgas a dhéanamh chun ár dteanga a chur in oiriúint, mar rinne na Iúdaigh in Ollscoil Ierusalem agus mar rinne na hAfricanders in Ollscoil Witwatersrand.  Ní féidir leis an Aire, agus b'fhéidir nach féidir leis an Ollscoil féin, é dhéanamh gan dream faoi leith no bord faoi leith a chur ar bun chun tabhairt faoi théacsanna a chur ar fáil a bhéarfas caoi don dalta Ollscoile cúrsaí a leanúint tríd an nGaeilge.  Ach d'fhéadfadh an Ollscoil a lán cúnta a thabhairt, agus tá mé lán-chinnte go ndéanfadh an tAire an cúnamh a thabhairt dóibh.</P>
    <P>Sílim gur luigh an Chomhdháil go láidir, freisin, ar an nGúm.  Sin seancheist agus gidh nach raibh mé féin sásta mar Aire, caithfidh mé a admháil go raibh an ceart acu faoi bhord a chur ar bun i gcóir clódóireachta agus obair an Ghúim ar fad a thabhairt don Bhord sin.  B'fhéidir go bhféadfaí é dhéanamh.  Rith sé im aigne go minic go mb'fhéidir go bhféadfaí socrú no conartha a dhéanamh le foilsitheoirí príobháideacha nó foilsitheoirí tráchtála, mar atá déanta anois ag an gClub Leabhar.  Pé ar bith rud a déanfaí, caithfí an-aire a thabhairt d'obair seo an Ghúim.  Mara bhféadaimís leabhra, agus i bhfad níos mó leabhra, a chur ar fáil, beidh deireadh le litríocht na Gaeilge, tá faitios orm.  Gidh go bhfuil ag éirí leis an gClub Leabhar, ní leor é sin.  Ba mhaith liom sreath leabhra a fheiceál, a bheadh oiriúnach don aos óg.  Tá slí faoi leith le theacht orthu siúd agus tá daoine sa tír atá oilte ar an obair sin.  D'fhéadfaidís na cnámha a fháil ó dhaoine oilte agus craiceann maith Gaeilge a chur ar na cnámha sin.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the question of the primary certificate and the dissatisfaction expressed last year with the paper in Irish.  There seemed to be a good deal of complaint and I am afraid it was utilised to try to create dissatisfaction with the examination. I am sure that the Minister is going into this matter and if it were possible to have a body representative <Col N="842" /> of the teachers, the managers and the Office of Education, perhaps more general agreement might be got about furthering this examination and making it more generally acceptable.  Some years ago, a council in Great Britain, reporting on secondary examinations, gave it as their view that there should be a general certificate at 16, showing the subjects in which the candidates have satisfied the examiners.  It has always struck me that that would be only fair as these examinations, being so largely of a literary character and having such a high standard, often offer considerable difficulties for young people who may be excellent in other ways.  For example, they may be very good with their hands or they may be very good at certain branches of literary work but weak at mathematics.  Or, as may happen in the case of boys, they may be good at mathematics but weak in the other subjects.  If credits could be given to them, their potential employers would know that although they had not the complete certificate they had credits in some of the subjects.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to certain reports which he had received in regard to, I think, Irish and arithmetic in the primary schools and stated that he was asking the inspectors to report to him on the teaching of history and geography.  Perhaps the Minister would give the House more information as to the result of these inquiries.  It is always well to have all the information we can get.  Some of us have a pretty good idea of how things stand, but the public generally and members of this House, perhaps, who are not acquainted intimately with education and directly connected with schools, might like to have that information. There have been so many strictures about educational standards and the poor state of education in this country during past years that it would be well, I think, to have these reports.  I do not believe that you can have perfection or that there are any ready panaceas for the weaknesses which must naturally occur in education so long as human nature is what it is.  We are bound to have widely differing varieties of standards among our pupils and even among our teachers. Whatever examination is being made, <Col N="843" /> will, I think, have to bear in mind the conditions in the schools and the ultimate judgment will have to be on how that work is being performed.  Is it being performed as satisfactorily as it is possible in the circumstances or can it be improved and, if so, in what directions?</P>
    <P>I regret to say that I feel I have a cause of complaint against the Minister in regard to the extension of educational facilities generally.  I remember some years ago the Minister used to remind me of the wonderful plans that were being instituted in Great Britain and the great strides that were being made and of how we were lagging behind.  We also had motions in this House about the school-leaving age and frequent references to that matter. At the moment, the City of Dublin has a population of nearly 500,000.  Most of us remember when it was nearer to 350,000.  That population is still increasing. A very big housing programme is in progress.  The question is whether the existing facilities are sufficient to meet the needs of our city. According to a statement which I received from the Minister we still have this problem.  An example of the leeway that has to be made up is the problem of large classes.  Some years ago the Minister had a habit of twitting me, when I occupied the ministerial seat, about these large classes and about the dreadful situation in Dublin schools under which children were being taught in hordes.  According to a statement which I have received from him, there are some 1,300 classes in which there are 40 pupils or more&mdash;an increase over last year. There is a slight improvement in the number between 30 to 40.  In reply to a parliamentary question last July the Minister said that there were classes of more than 60 pupils up to a number of 72 in the Dublin City areas and ten classes with 75 pupils or over. He then went on to say that he was fully aware of the existing conditions and of the fact that they militate against education of a completely satisfactory standard being imparted to the pupils involved.  Finally, he said that he was having the matter carefully investigated and hoped that everything <Col N="844" /> possible would be done to arrive at a satisfactory solution.  Well, that indicated a certain improvement from a statement made by the Minister and reported at column 292 of the Official Report of the 28th April, 1949.  It is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is admitted on all sides that the position regarding the size of classes could be improved but, in existing circumstances, any movement in this direction would have the serious result of depriving the more out-of-the-way and less attractivelysituated schools of even their present quotas of staff.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will tell us what improvement is being made in this matter.  It seems to me that if we cannot provide proper accommodation for the existing needs in the primary schools then, of course, the other problems of extending educational facilities&mdash;particularly to those over the present school-leaving age&mdash;must be needlessly deferred and that a considerable injustice is being done to those pupils concerned.</P>
    <P>Nobody who has listened to the rather extravagant pronouncements that we have all heard during recent years in regard to the question of the raising of the school-leaving age and, in fact, the provision of higher education of various kinds free for the people, can be other than disappointed at the very slow progress that is being achieved.  Apart from the question of strengthening the position of the language in the schools there seems to be a strong case for adding an extra year &mdash;later two years, perhaps.  There is the necessity for strengthening pupils from the point of view of their general character and of their future work as citizens.  We have to bear in mind that we are in a highly competitive world in which, when the present conditions pass away, as they very well may&mdash;the present rather unreal conditions that we are experiencing&mdash;there will be very stern competition indeed and our whole standard of living and prosperity will depend upon our industrial and agricultural progress.  Therefore, I think it should be a cardinal aspect of the national education policy <Col N="845" /> to go ahead as quickly as possible with extending facilities for further education and making definite plans and arrangements for raising the school-leaving age.</P>
    <P>There is the question of the training of skilled manual craftsmen and the question of apprenticeship.  I think the present Government are in a position to secure the co-operation which, indeed, as far as I know, had always been forthcoming, of the trade union bodies in connection with apprenticeship committees.  There has been no change in the position for a number of years&mdash;we have had the same number of committees.  In other countries comparable with ours, but who have a long tradition of industrial training and a good standard of industrial activity and skill, the greatest possible attention is being given to these matters.  I have always felt that this matter is so important that it would be well worth the Minister's while, if he believes that councils are going to be a cure for these ills of education and that he cannot have a policy without them, to have a special council to deal with the problem of technical education.</P>
    <P>The position at present in the Dublin vocational schools is that the facilities are entirely inadequate.  There is insufficient accommodation for even those who are attending voluntarily.  There are about 10,000, perhaps less, school leavers between 14 and 16 years of age for whom accommodation ought to be provided as soon as possible, but from a reply of the Minister, all the progress that I can see that has been made since I left office is that there are three cases of improvement to schools, some of which used to be merely centres for Comhairle Le Leas Oige, and one new regional school at Crumlin.  There are sites for four other schools.  It is high time, when we hear so much talk of capital expenditure, and so on, that we should push forward as urgently as possible with a plan for extending these facilities in Dublin.</P>
    <P>It is many years ago since the representatives of the schools planned a policy of development.  Some parts of that plan may have to wait.  Possibly <Col N="846" /> there will have to be a priority but the question of a new school of technology for this city, with its 500,000 population, its increasing industries, is an urgent one.  The fact that science is making great strides and that we must try to keep abreast of modern developments makes it essential that more should be done.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the Minister has adopted a rather penurious attitude with regard to this branch of education.  I could almost say that there has been an inclination to treat it as the cinderella of the educational service.  There was a time when we used to hear of the expenditure on the building of vocational schools.  I only wish that we had far more vocational schools and that we had built more of them, if that had been possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister, after he came into office, announced that he had limited the amount of capital expenditure on the building of vocational schools.  I think the figure was £50,000 for 1948-49 and this year it is £155,000 but, in the first year, there was only £37,000 actually expended, including the whole of the programme of new schools and improvements, of which £23,000 was expended in Dublin.  Last year, it was estimated that some £56,000 was spent in the country as a whole and only £17,500 in Dublin.</P>
    <P>When one remembers that the population of Dublin is increasing by some thousands every year, when one considers the hundreds of new families that are being established, when one sees that the number of school leavers is increasing one wonders how the Minister can possibly reconcile his attitude with regard to the extension of vocational education in Dublin with the promises that have been made.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the Minister is rather inclined to put this question of the school-leaving age on the long finger.  I regret that very much.  I believe it ought to be possible to go ahead gradually.  Big centres like Dublin should be tackled.  It may be that there are special problems in establishing suitable facilities in rural areas but, in a big centre like Dublin, where you have a public opinion on this matter, where you have the necessary organisation and where everybody is prepared <Col N="847" /> to go ahead, it seems extraordinary that, apparently on grounds of economy or through some prejudice or other against vocational education that I cannot understand, the necessary progress is not being made.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I think, last year gave as an excuse for not going ahead the fact that the report of the Commission on Youth Unemployment had not been received.  Whether it had been received or not, that commission presented an interim report in favour of raising the school-leaving age.</P>
    <P>It is becoming rather a habit with the Government as regards matters which ought to be the subject of decisions in the ordinary way and on which the Government, through the agencies open to them, ought easily to be able to get full information, to postpone these essential decisions by referring matters to commissions.</P>
    <P>If the Minister's point is that this is entirely an educational matter and that it is a question of how he, having accepted the principle, will proceed, no one will cavil at his taking advice. I should even think that if he went into direct discussions with the authorities concerned, he would probably get quicker and more satisfactory results. But, in his reply to a question of mine yesterday, he told me that this question of the school-leaving age must be examined, not merely from the educational point of view, but from the point of view of economy and finance. I should think the Minister for Finance would be fairly well able to look after that side of it.  In the City of Dublin, large and all as it is and although the kernel of the problem is there, it is a sizable problem, a manageable problem, and the figures indicate that, with the necessary will on the Minister's part, with the financial issues settled, there should be nothing to stop that problem being well on the way to solution in the next few years.</P>
    <P>We are spending some £78,000,000. We are spending some millions on sanatoria.  As the man in the street might say: &ldquo;We are spending a great deal on ill-health and disease.  If we would spend a certain number of millions on the healthy, on the future <Col N="848" /> citizens, the potential wealth of our country, the real wealth of the country, ought it not to be even more reproductive?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the building question.  I notice that building costs have been reduced.  I am very glad to see that, but I admit the level is extraordinarily high still.  It may be two and a half times what it was before the war.  In the Book of Estimates and in the statements of the Minister for Finance we have a new policy announced to us in regard to school building this year.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the Book of Estimates under the Board of Works for expenditure of £724,000 and the Minister for Finance is pursuing the policy that £500,000 of that money should be borrowed.  Of course, it is very pleasant to be able to borrow, if you are in that happy position, but you have also to pay back and the charges are pretty substantial.  It is also a pleasant thought that somebody in the future will have to repay if you have been somewhat extravagant or wasteful. There is no doubt that once that inclination towards borrowing starts, if lenders can be found, it may become somewhat accentuated and we may become rather a prey to borrowing.  We may tend to put off obligations which should fall upon us in the normal course as they come due in the same way as rent, clothing, educational bills and other household expenses.  We cannot put off those expenses or if we do we will create greater trouble for ourselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told the House that this is the first year that segregation has taken place and, of course, he is quite right.  Up to the present, money has only been borrowed for reproductive works that would repay the amounts expended upon them within a reasonable period of time.  If you are going to borrow money for schools which up to the present has been regarded as normal recurring expenditure to be met from the proceeds of taxation, then there is no reason why you should not incur anything else which might be described as deadweight debt in the sense that it will not ever be able to pay any proportion of the charges upon it.  There may be <Col N="849" /> a temptation to go ahead and apparently the only limit is whether the lender is prepared to accept our terms. The Minister has given certain reasons for this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the works shown in the statement are regarded as being of a capital nature because they will be additions to or improvements of State property and will have a long period of life.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It happens that national schools are not State property but are the property of the parochial trustees, I believe. They may have a long period of life, certainly.  The Minister goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It may be true of certain items that they will relieve the Exchequer of annual rent charges.  A further justification...is that the present scale of expenditure is abnormal owing to the slowing up of building during the emergency.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Building was slowed up during the emergency but I think that a reasonable amount was carried on.  In 1938-39, £200,000 appeared in the Estimate and if we assume that money has depreciated in value by 50 per cent, or more, we should allow £400,000 or £500,000 at least.</P>
    <P>I do not understand how it can be argued that the replacement of school buildings is abnormal.  If we take the Irish Banking Commission Report as the opinion of a body of experts who knew something about the subject on which they were expressing their views, we find that what they consider abnormal expenditure is expenditure carried out in periods of depression, public works and so on.  There is no such depression at present, quite the contrary.  If there were, one could understand it.  In fact, the Central Bank thinks that we are in a condition of inflation and should be careful about adding to our public debt.  The report definitely says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It would, however, be improper to admit into this category&mdash;even the category of works which admittedly would not repay more than a portion of the expenditure&mdash;items of expenditure like the provision of school buildings or Civic Guard barracks which on the analogy of commercial <Col N="850" /> practice possess a certain capital character, but which in the life of the State are recurrent needs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is stated in paragraph 566.</P>
    <P>There are 500 schools roughly and the Minister hopes to deal with 50 or 55 schools per year.  According to one list which he has given to me there are 479 schools in urgent need of replacement and it was estimated that there would probably be another 5,000 which would require considerable improvement. At least that was the position in my time.  Therefore, even if you take away the first 500 which are in urgent need of replacement you still have 5,000 more which, no matter what the Minister for Finance may think of their long life, may, as experience has shown, be reduced to a pitiable state if they are not attended to.</P>
    <P>There is not the slightest doubt that replacement every year of a proportion of the 5,000 schools will be a permanent charge and I do not know how the Minister can justify borrowing money for that purpose.  If you can borrow money for that purpose and meet in that arbitrary way items which were paid for out of taxation and were provided for in the annual Estimate, I do not know where you are going to stop.</P>
    <P>I think that calling the new Council of Education by that name is likely to give the impression that it has some executive or administrative functions and I take it that it is not the Minister's intention that it should have any functions whatever of that kind but should be purely advisory.  In view of all that has been said about this council in the past, I think that if it were called an &ldquo;advisory council&rdquo;, as has been done in Great Britain, it would really meet the case better or, if the Minister feels that there are specific questions to which it should address itself and that its task is one of inquiring into particular problems, then a &ldquo;commission&rdquo;. However, the Council of Education it is.</P>
    <P>This Council of Education has been regarded as the prescription for all educational ills and now that it has been established one is inclined to transpose the saying of Dr. Johnson about the dog walking on its hind legs <Col N="851" /> and say that it is not so much the way it has been constituted as the fact that it has been set up that must excite surprise.</P>
    <P>I have always believed that the consultation which goes on between the Minister and managers on the one hand and teachers and the various associations on the other, worked out quite satisfactorily.  Testimony was given of that fact, and not by the spokesman of one organisation only, but of several, and very important spokesmen they were.  Under that system of consultation, we were able to arrange for changes in the programmes and able to arrange for the setting-up of the panel arrangement, with the co-operation of the managers and the teachers, and it came very largely from themselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister came along last year and abolished the highly efficient rating.  He said that he felt, after the discussions he had had with the representatives of the managers and the teachers, that the highly efficient rating had to go.  Why had it to go?  I suggest that the reason it had to go was that the Minister had committed himself in such a way that there was no other course open to him.  We all recognise that there may have been inequalities, or anomalies, or perhaps injustices, in the determination of the highly efficient rating, but the Minister announced during the course of the teachers' strike that the highly efficient rating would have to go.  It was one of the grievances of the teachers and at column 215 of the Debates of 23rd October, 1946, he announced that, in the interests of the children, it could not stand.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the abolition of the rating was a ministerial decision and that we are going to be up against this question of who in fact is making the decision, who in fact is making the recommendation. At certain times, the Minister tries to give the impression that he does not wish to act in virtue of his office as Minister in making important decisions of this kind.  He gives the impression in some of his statements that he would prefer to act rather as a liaison between the State machinery, on the one hand, and the Church, on the other.  I think the <Col N="852" /> Minister has his responsibilities, and certainly in this particular matter, whether we agree that he carried them out well or ill, it was the Minister who took the responsibility.  There was consultation, but the Minister took the final decision and he took it because he felt that the existing situation could not continue and also because he felt that, in the long run, education would benefit.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister categorically whether the association had recommended this course and the Minister said that they did not disagree with him.  The inspectors will not disagree with the Minister&mdash;perhaps the teachers will and perhaps the managers will&mdash;but on an issue where they are all concerned, in respect of which they meet together, and where there is obviously a difference of opinion, or where one opinion is expressed very strongly and the other is rather mute, the Minister may say: &ldquo;I feel it should be so,&rdquo; and he looks back to his own commitments in the matter, if they can be called commitments.  It is rather like the position of the man who was being chased by a bear.  He happened to have a few buns in his pocket and, every few steps he ran, he threw a bun to the bear, but the bear continued to come after him.  The House can judge what was the end of that story.  These promises of the Minister are coming along all the time.</P>

      <P>I want to say in connection with this matter that we are giving increments to teachers for long service.  We recognise that their experience and conditions require that they should get increments.  We give them promotion and, according to the Minister, we still must have a position in which the managers must know how <Col N="853" /> exactly the teachers stand.  If they are not actually called highly efficient, the Minister nevertheless has provided that the managers will know exactly how they stand in their school work.  At column 295 of the Debates of 28th April, 1949, he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am confident that the teachers will respond whole-heartedly to this great change and that by the removal of the irritant we shall be able to command an even more satisfactory standard of work than was being before achieved.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I thought the standard, from all we used to hear, had serious defects and in fact the Minister frequently told us that we were in a state of chaos as regards education.  He continued:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Managers will still receive the detailed statement regarding the work in each individual subject which is at present issued to them and it was the feeling of their representatives at the conference that with this data before them they would be in a position to glean all the information they required as to the progress being made in the schools under their care.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>So that the managers have still to be acquainted with the position.  We are paying bonuses to teachers who have degrees or diplomas.  Apparently, we are not to have a professor of education in University College, Dublin, but we pay a bonus every year to a teacher who secures a diploma.  What is the reason for that?  The reason, presumably, is that the teacher is considered to be better fitted and better qualified for his work.  He has acquired a wider knowledge.  It is not always certain that he is a better teacher than he was before or that he has improved.  The Minister admitted that there was no truth in the statement&mdash;I think I am not exaggerating what he said&mdash;that this highly efficient rating existed for reasons of economy.  I think that, after he became Minister, he admitted that that was not the position, that it was as an incentive and a stimulus to teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what purpose can be achieved by having a dead uniformity. We know that people recognise the <Col N="854" /> merits of a highly skilled teacher. Where he has given meritorious service, he has that reputation in his area and people send their pupils to him. The Minister, however, has told us that he hopes the standard of work will improve.  We may hope so, but I want to call attention to the fact that the reason given for abolishing the rating was not based on the children's future but rather on the annoyance to teachers, the trouble to inspectors and the irritant which the Minister saw in it.  That was one of the Minister's promises coming home to roost.</P>
    <P>We had also during the teachers' strike a lot of talk about conciliation boards and arbitration and one Minister of the present Government, the Tánaiste, recommended, at column 227 of the Debates of 23rd October, 1946, that there should be a board of arbitration set up <i>ad hoc</i></P>
    <P>&ldquo;to deal with the merits of this dispute, and to make a report to the Government on the merits of the dispute, the Government and the teachers beforehand pledging themselves to accept the report of the independent arbitration tribunal, subject to the overriding authority of this House&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a minority and a majority report and the Government have accepted the minority report. That is a matter for the Government, but I think it can be legitimately claimed that the teachers were led to believe that, in fact, this conciliation or arbitration machinery having been set up, the recommendations of that body would be accepted.  The matter is now passed and I think it was rather a mistake on the Minister's part not to have conceded to the teachers what they were looking for in regard to the date, because there is no doubt that this review should have taken place before September last.  It may be said that it was not definitely promised to the teachers in black and white, but I think that they believed that that would be the operative date.</P>
    <P>With regard to the council, the Minister on various occasions proposed in this House that we should follow the recommendations of the Commission on Vocational Organisation in the <Col N="855" /> setting up of the education council. He has since changed his plan.  While Deputies, no doubt, will have their own opinions as to whether it is possible to have every interest possible connected with education represented on the council, whether in fact you can have industry and commerce and agriculture and the parents represented as well, it does seem to the man in the street that the representational idea has somewhat held sway with the Minister. I know that he has had difficulties in this matter and that he has tried to avoid this question of giving representation or even appearing to have given representation to particular organisations or associations.</P>
    <P>I have no wish to go into the question of personnel.  It would be a very invidious matter and I have no fault to find with the personnel in general.  Of course it is not a matter for me; it is a matter for the Minister. Lest anyone might think there is anything personal in the matter, it is entirely a question of the principle of appointing persons, either on their own individual merit and being the best fitted persons to be appointed, or of being there as representing a particular organisation.  It is inevitable, I think, when they are closely connected with an organisation that they should be regarded as representative, and perhaps in the long run we may have to face that fact.  But I think it would have been better to have had a smaller body in regard to which the Minister would have had a freer choice and would have selected those whom he considered not to have a particular representational view in any way but to be persons of experience and capacity in educational matters qualified to approach these questions which will be referred to them in a broad general way and who would be of a type that will regard this matter not from the point of view of how it may affect any interest but from the point of view of the general welfare and the general interests of the children and also the spirit and the general atmosphere&mdash;the influence in the school is often more important than the programme&mdash;the general influence of the teacher and the relations between himself and the pupil.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="856" /> We have three branches of education and, unless the Minister is going to follow this council by appointing three subordinate bodies, I am not so sure that he may not find it will be difficult to deal with each particular branch, because there will be a certain feeling that certain branches are more strongly represented than others and that only those who represent, or who are particularly associated with one of the three branches are in the best position to examine the work of that branch, to have views upon it and to report upon it.  I would have preferred the council to be smaller and I think that if the members had no relations at all&mdash;perhaps that is impossible to achieve&mdash;with the Department of Education and could view the issues entirely in an objective way it would have been more satisfactory.  I think there would have been better prospects, though I hope with the Minister that the whole idea will be to get a unified and, generally speaking, fairly agreed point of view in regard to fundamental questions.  If there is a fairly general common ground and a fairly general coming-together of all the members of the council on the fundamental questions, then of course we can make progress.  But if, as was stated, you are going to have the position that at some stage or other plans for educacational development or reorganisation are going to be adversely affected by having the views of particular interests overweighted and thrown too heavily into the scale one way or the other, it would not be a good thing.</P>
    <P>I take it that this council will report in due course.  I think the criticism of it is that, apparently, in matters like the school-leaving age, the Minister, as the Government has done on other occasions, is going to defer making necessary and vital decisions until he has had a report from the council.  That places the council in a certain awkward position.  The Minister has the final responsibility.  You have the position that the country is waiting for the council's views.  Then, when they publish their views, if they are not unanimous and if the Minister is not in a position to accept them, you will have a barrage of controversy which is not a good thing.  I do not know what <Col N="857" /> the Minister's view is about this matter of reports.  It would, I think, be better to have majority and minority reports where you have two definite points of view put up, even though I do not think that is a good thing, rather than have a review which did not bring you anywhere, where definite points were not advanced upon which lines for progress were indicated.  I know there was a report issued in the past few years which I have not been able to lay my hands upon dealing with education of a very general character and great disappointment was expressed with it because it was largely in the nature of platitudes.  If we are going to make progress, we will have to face the position that the council will have to go into the question of the work of the schools and how that work is being carried out.  If that is accepted by everybody in a good spirit, then we may have good results.  In saying these things I am not finding fault, I am merely suggesting that there are little stumbling blocks which I hope will be removed.  I hope that my fears, if they can be described as fears, will be found to have no foundation.  I should like, however, that we should not have the position that important matters like planning for an extension of facilities generally and for the school-leaving age being raised would have to be deferred for another year or two until the council have reported.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has had brought to his notice the fact that under the Marshall Aid arrangements special facilities and special aids were to be given to the participating countries for scientific and industrial purposes.  I wonder whether in connection with scientific education here, either by way of improving our apparatus and laboratory equipment generally, or perhaps, in addition to that, having our specialised teachers provided with facilities to enable them to see what is being done elsewhere, something could not be done.</P>
    <P>It is difficult at present to get highly qualified teachers.  There is such a call from industry in these countries for highly qualified men and for graduates in science that it is difficult and will be difficult here to get them to go into teaching unless you make it <Col N="858" /> well worth while.  I hope that the Minister will endeavour to make the conditions of these highly qualified teachers who have specialised knowledge&mdash;if they have industrial experience all the better&mdash;as favourable as possible.  I am fully aware of the difficulties. I know that the attractions in other employment are very great indeed. I should like him, however, to look into that question of Marshall Aid. Although it appertains to the Department of External Affairs, I feel that the Minister would have an interest in it, in the same way as he would have an interest, as I said in the beginning, in the recommendations made by Comhairle Naisiunte na Gaeilge.  Even though it is not the Minister's province, he has undertaken to do a certain little job in connection with the university and, apparently, that has been successful.  In the same way with the radio, I think the Department of Education would have some interest in it from the point of view of its potentialities in extending the use of Irish.  There is also the question of An Gum.  Finally, I should like to ask the Minister whether there is any inquiry being carried out into the science and art institution and what is the nature of the inquiry.</P>

      <P>The Estimates for the Department of Education which are before us amount to approximately £9,000,000.  While that may appear a very substantial sum, it is clear from an examination of the problem that, if we are to have an efficient system of education, we cannot have it on an expenditure of £9,000,000 per year.  So far as we in this House are concerned, education is rather a difficult matter. While we provide the bulk of the money for education, we have not a great deal of control over it.  That <Col N="859" /> position has grown up over the years. As the Minister said in introducing the Estimate, only a proportion of the cost of school buildings is provided by the State.  I feel that the burden of providing the total cost of school buildings should be on the State and not on the local people.  If that were accepted, it is clear that the cost of education would be much higher than the Estimate now before us.  It is clear also that, if the reasonable demands of the primary teachers in regard to remuneration were met, the bill for education would have to be substantially higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this Government took over office, it took over a very serious conflict between the primary teachers and the State in regard to remuneration and most of the Deputies on this side of the House, at any rate, had made promises to the teachers that their just demands in regard to remuneration would be met by the new Government so that teachers would be able to free themselves from worries and to devote their whole time to the problem of education. I think that most Deputies felt when the Roe Commission was set up that it was the first step towards the solution of the problems of pay and remuneration that confronted the teachers and that that Roe Commission would remove the grievances under which the primary teachers existed for a very long time.  The Roe Commission sat for a long period.  It examined this problem. All the people, including the chairman of that commission&mdash;other than the representatives of the Department of Education and the representatives of the Department of Finance&mdash;came to a conclusion as to what would be just and reasonable remuneration for the primary teachers.  Unfortunately, the decision of those independent people in that regard was not accepted by the Government.  I think that was a mistake. I think it was a grave mistake on the part of the Minister and on the part of the Government not to accept the findings of that commission.  During the sittings of the commission certain proposals were put forward by the representatives of the Department of Education and by the representatives of the Department of Finance.  Those <Col N="860" /> proposals were considered by the commission as a whole and were rejected. I think it must be clear to every Deputy that those proposals put forward by civil servants from the Departments of Education and Finance were not put forward by these officials on their own but were put forward with the approval and the authority of the Minister for Education and of the Minister for Finance.  Those official proposals were rejected by the commission but, notwithstanding that, and when the commission had finished consideration and prepared and furnished its majority report, the Minister and the Government went back to their original proposals and put those forward to the teachers as a basis of solution of the problem.  I feel that that certainly was a mistake because the only inference to be drawn from it was that the Roe Commission was simply a sham which was set up to spend a considerable amount of time considering the problem but that there was no intention that the findings of the commission would be given effect to <i>in toto.</i></P>
    <P>That action of the Minister and of the Government has disappointed the teachers and has disappointed the Deputies in the House who looked forward to the implementation of the findings of the Roe Commission and the ending of trouble in regard to pay between the teachers and the Department. When the Minister decided to accept the minority view&mdash;the proposals of the officials of his own Department and of the Department of Finance&mdash;he explained that decision by saying that as a State we would not be able to meet the costs that would be involved in accepting the proposals of the majority of the commission.  But, notwithstanding that, and on pressure from the teachers, the Minister agreed to date back the operation of the increase in pay to, I think, the 1st January of this year.  In a matter of this importance&mdash;when the commission had considered the matter in all its aspects, when the Minister had considered it in all its aspects and when the Government had considered it in all its aspects&mdash;the Government's proposal should have been a proposal on which they were prepared to stand but, clearly, they were not prepared to <Col N="861" /> stand on those proposals or on that offer, and they were quite prepared, on pressure, to give something more to the teachers.  That, again, has given the impression that if the pressure is strong enough on the Government, strong enough on the Minister, they will yet give the teachers the scales recommended by the majority of the Roe Commission.  Instead of helping to solve the problem, what has happened in regard to this Roe Commission has left a bad taste in the mouths of the teachers, and it is regrettable that that is so.  It would have been a statesmanly and sensible act on the part of the Government to have endeavoured to accept the majority report and to <Col N="862" /> put it into operation.  The result would be that we would have a satisfied body of teachers and that we would have a public that would have some confidence in commissions such as the Roe Commission. I move to report progress.</P>

    <P>(a)  on the making of the advance, there shall be added, to the purchase money of such holding, part of a holding, or parcel, a sum (in this sub-section referred to as <Col N="867" /> compounded arrears) consisting of 75 per cent. of whichever of the following arrears of the rent payable in respect of such holding, part of a holding, or parcel is the greater (or, where they are equal, of the first-mentioned of them), that is to say:</P>
    <P>(i)  the arrears which at the appointed day have accrued due in respect of any period or periods commencing on and after the gale day next before the said particulars were furnished or the said application was lodged (as the case may be), and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the arrears, not exceeding three years thereof, which have accrued due on the appointed day,</P>
    <P>together with 75 per cent. of the apportioned gale of such rent from the gale day next before the appointed day up to that day where that day is not a gale day, and, save as aforesaid, no payment in respect of arrears of such rent shall be required to be made,</P>
    <P>(b)  where any payment after the said particulars were furnished or the said application was lodged (as the case may be) or in respect of any period or periods commencing on and after the gale day next before the said particulars were furnished or the said application was lodged (as the case may be) has been made on foot of the said rent, arrears shall be deemed to have accrued and the foregoing paragraph shall apply as if no such payment had been made, but every such payment shall be treated as having been made in respect of the compounded arrears and the amount of every such payment in excess of the compounded arrears shall be recoverable as a claim against the purchase money.</P>
    <P>(2)  Sub-section (1) of this section shall not apply in relation to any case as respects which the appointed day has been fixed before the passing of this Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="868" /> This amendment is coupled with the previous amendment and where the previous amendment dealt with repairing and tidying up various paragraphs in the section of the present Bill this amendment tidies up the parent section in the 1939 Act.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 15 to delete lines 41 to 50 and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(12)  Any farm purchased under Section 25, for a migrant, shall be purchased as a going concern and shall not be subdivided or rearranged.</P>
      <P>The Minister in Volume 118, No. 7, column 902 said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the ordinary process of acquisition and resumption ... will still continue in full operation, but under these procedures it is almost impossible to get holdings of convenient size which are equipped with dwellings, outoffices, fences, pumps and so on, and which are ready for immediate allotment as new holdings.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister came into the Dáil with the Bill with one particular intention in relation to these holdings and his intention was so interpreted by the Dáil that Deputy T.F. O'Higgins in Volume 118, No. 7, column 920, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I hope that their first concern will be to purchase farms of a certain limited size and conforming to certain specified standards....  I think we should welcome the power now given to the Land Commission as a going concern where no delay shall be entailed apart from the usual conveyancing delays.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, as generally understood by the Dáil, intended under the section to purchase farms as going concerns, principally or altogether for occupation by migrants from congested districts.  At a later stage, he introduced a custom already adopted under the legislation of taking power to divide these holdings and to distribute them amongst migrants.  We will have side by side two systems of land acquisition: <Col N="869" /> one, the system which heretofore obtained and the other, the system of buying land for cash in the open market.  If it is the intention of the Minister to buy farms, as he at first suggested, of 30, 40 or 50 acres or of £12, £16 or £20 valuation, I am anxious that even though a migrant from a congested district does not give in exchange what would be regarded as something equally as valuable as the holding which the Minister bought, in the search for abstract justice as between the Minister and the migrant, the small farm purchased for that reason should not be divided.  I suggest that if the migrant gets ten or 15 acres more than he deserves in exchange, that should be regarded as just his luck and that the holding should not be divided. I should like an assurance from the Minister that when he buys a small farm as a going concern, a farm with a house, pump and fences as he mentioned, that farm will be left as an integral whole for the occupation of the migrant, even though it may be slightly greater compensation than he is actually entitled to get.  I feel that it would be wrong to cut a field off a small farm, merely in the interest of abstract justice.</P>
    <P>I can see the Minister's difficulty. The Minister, I am sure, did believe that there was quite a tremendous pool of land which could be secured for his purposes in the ordinary way of Land Commission transactions.  On coming into office, he has discovered that that is not a fact, so he seeks to supplement the land available to him by this new system.  I have no objection to that, but I want to ensure that the land acquired will be utilised as fully as it is possible for human means to do it for the relief of congestion.  If you buy a small farm with the declared purpose and intention of putting a migrant into it, you eliminate a good deal of difficulty, but if you propose to go into the open market to buy land for division, which is really for the relief of congestion, you are apt to create a demand by local landless men for that particular farm and that defeats your purpose.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that there may be a danger of unfairness to the owner of <Col N="870" /> the land in that case, because, if the Minister proposes to buy a relatively large farm by this means and to divide it, there will be such a clamour by local applicants and such an agitation that anybody else in the locality who may intend to buy that farm, as he is entitled to, when it is put up in the open market, may be deterred from doing so.  That might suit the Minister, but when he has decided against the payment of market price for such a holding, there is a chance that the owner of the land will suffer severely.  I want from the Minister some sort of agreement with my viewpoint that small farms purchased under this section for the purposes he has set out will not be subdivided, will not be attenuated in any way, but will be given to the migrant, even though it may not be abstract justice.  I hope the Minister will agree with me in that.  In regard to substituting the purchase for cash in the open market of large farms for the usual method of transaction of the Land Commission, I feel that there is a danger of injustice to the owner. There is also the danger that local clamour will keep many people from buying these farms, or trying to buy them, and thus give land at a cut price to the Land Commission, which is not at all desirable.  I should like the Minister to look into these points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>While I would not like to tie myself down to the promise which Deputy Moylan has asked in the way he has asked it, I am in full agreement with all he has said.  I cannot imagine any holding or farm of 40 or 50 acres being attenuated or reduced in size by reason of a field being taken off it.  We all know that such a farm is a farm of very desirable size and that to make it any smaller would be cramping it and doing damage.  The next amendment is designed especially to meet the Deputy's wishes as he outlined them on Committee Stage, to make sure that the Land Commission will not find its hand being forced in an undesirable way after they have bought such land in the open market and to safeguard the vendor.  I made one promise, and I hope that promise will be as binding on whomever will come after me as it is on me, that the <Col N="871" /> moment any undesirable influence arises, as a result of the Land Commission's entry into the market, the Land Commission, so far as I am concerned, will be withdrawn from that method of acquiring land straightaway. I hope the same will apply in the case of whoever follows in my footsteps, whenever that may be.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is right in saying that the compulsory method of acquiring land has been slow, has proved to be disappointing in many cases and that good chances of settling a piece of congestion or rundale has slipped through the hands of the Land Commission, because the law, as it stood, did not give them authority to negotiate straightaway with the seller of the particular holding or farm, the acquisition of which would bring immediate relief to many.  That is the reason I am embarking on this new principle in the Bill, but I want to repeat the warning I have given: the moment that any undesirable practice arises as a result of the Land Commission entering the open market, I will prohibit them from acquiring land by that means.  That will not be interference with their powers, but a matter of Government policy which they are bound to implement.  They will have to revert then to compulsory acquisition.</P>
      <P>The House need not be afraid that small or medium-size holdings will be brought down to the point where they would be almost uneconomic.  That would be most undesirable and I could not imagine it being done.  It may happen that an 80-acre farm may be purchased and that 60 acres would be enough for a migrant.  In that case, I do not see what is wrong with the Land Commission having a means of disposing of the rest.  The Deputy mentioned giving 20 acres over and above to a migrant and then regarding it as being the migrant's luck.  I am afraid that the Department of Finance and the Comptroller and Auditor-General would have something to say to that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot imagine a <Col N="872" /> small farm being divided, other than in the case of small residential holdings stuck into rundale or mixed villages.  In the case of holdings of £2 or £4 valuation already scattered through rundale villages, we mean to purchase them and use them in the rearrangement and reallotment schemes in the village or townland; but in the case of a holding suitable for a migrant, with house, out-offices and amenities left there by the previous owner, I cannot imagine it being touched.  It would be nothing short of madness to do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the assurance the Minister has given to the House, would he not consider putting it in some form in the Bill, binding his successor to the size of farm below which there cannot be division?  If he makes it 40 or 50 acres, I am sure it would satisfy Deputy Moylan.  Where a farm is bought as a going concern for the purpose of putting a migrant into it, I suggest there should be a statutory assurance in the Bill that no farm of 40 acres or less would be subject to division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That would cut across the purchase of holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>No, you can limit it in this section to farms bought as a going concern to give to a migrant and limit the size below which they cannot be divided.  It will not interfere in any way with the taking of plots scattered in rundale areas.  I think Deputy Moylan wants it limited to farms bought for migrants, say for a farmer whose farm is being taken over and to whom this one is to be given by way of resettlement or exchange.  I can envisage the possibility of a nice tidy holding, well developed as an economic unit of 30 or 50 acres, in certain circumstances being pared down a bit. I do not think that should happen.  As the Minister has given the assurance, I am saying it should be put into the statute.  If he consults his officials here, they will agree that in that limited class you can state a statutory minimum number of acres below which there can be no division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still rather confused as to the Minister's intention, <Col N="873" /> he has expressed so many different intentions in connection with the land to be acquired and with which Deputy Moylan is dealing under this amendment. Is the Minister definite now that it is the intention of the Land Commission under this Bill, in purchasing in the open market holdings for migrants, to go after the comparatively small type of holding, say 40, 60 or 80 acres?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  As a matter of fact, it could be any holding from, say, £1 valuation up.  It is the use to which they will be put that is specified in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I know all about the uses.  It would appear from what the Minister has said that the intention under this section is to confine it to the acquisition of small holdings suitable for taking up migrants from small farms.  I do not seem to be able to get from the Minister, and the Minister has not made it clear to the House, whether it is the intention under Section 25 to go into the open market for 400-, 500- or 600-acre tracts of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is possible under this Bill.  It is not precluded at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There has not been a word about that in all the discussion so far as I know.  We seem to be centring around the intention of getting after small holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Read paragraph (c) of sub-section (1).  It says &ldquo;where the Land Commission require the land for the provision of new holdings for migrants&rdquo;.  That definitely includes a big farm which could be split up into smaller farms for migrants.  I do not want the House or anyone else to be misled on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to get the intention clear.  The whole discussion seems to be centring around the small holdings. No matter how many small holdings are acquired, great headway will not be made unless the large tracts are attacked and taken over.  I suppose there is power there to deal with them, if the power is used, but I want to get it clear that, under Section 25 of this Bill, these large tracts <Col N="874" /> will be concentrated on also.  In the acquisition of holdings for migrants we are dealing with under this section, the Land Commission would be better advised to endeavour to concentrate&mdash; when migrating tenants from a congested area where you have fairly substantial holdings&mdash;on getting the large farmer from the congested area to the larger holding procured up the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>We are doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;rather than try to shift the small man.  In that way, more headway would be made.  If the Land Commission concentrate on that policy, I think that what Deputy Moylan has suggested in moving this amendment has a lot to it.  If there is a holding coming on the market in the Midlands or the South, suitable for exchange for a substantial farm in a congested area, it should be taken over as a going concern and, even though it may extend to 100 acres or more, if the migrant is leaving a substantial farm in a congested area it should be offered to him. More effective work could be done by the Minister if he concentrates on that line of country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood&mdash;and I am glad the Minister has cleared the matter up now&mdash;that when the Land Commission decided to go into the market to purchase land, they could acquire holdings the valuation of which was £3 or £300, if suitable for the relief of congestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Provided they are suitable for the purpose.  That is the watchword.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>In the congested areas, there are many little patches of land which have been derelict for a number of years because the holders could not make a living on them.  Those holders would only be too delighted to sell them.  Larger farms for splitting up for the creation of standard holdings for migrants must be got if we are to make any real and fast headway with the problem of congestion.  I have a certain amount of sympathy with Deputy Moylan and to an extent I am in agreement with him.  If, for <Col N="875" /> instance, a congest is removed from a congested area and finds that he is put into a holding which contains, maybe, one and a half or thereabouts the amount of land which he left, it will be just his luck that he will get this good concession.  The best judges of that in all cases are the inspectors of the Land Commission.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other hand, we are faced with the problem that the purchase of a suitable holding for a migrant may be in one of the congested counties.  Let us say, for example, that a farm of 60 acres of reasonably good land in County Mayo comes into the hands of the Land Commission. A migrant may be moved into that and allotted a standard holding of 33, 35 or 40 acres, as the case may be.  There may be congests, within a mile of that holding that has been purchased, who may require additional acres.  In that case that man will have to lose land.  It will be part and parcel of Land Commission policy to bring up the holdings of the few local congests that may be there as well to a standard level.  Therefore, in that case, it would be impossible to accept the amendment. I think the matter should be left to the discretion of the Land Commission officials.  They are pretty good judges in respect of the types of holdings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Two abuses have been mentioned as being likely to affect the sale of land under Section 25&mdash;(1) that a clamour might prevent people from buying and that it would thus reduce the market value and (2)&mdash;and this is one that would be very difficult to deal with, and it has been mentioned by some speakers here&mdash;prior knowledge by the owner of the land that the Land Commission would be interested and, therefore, getting people to puff it.  If there is any virtue in the Minister's claim in regard to the section which deals with market value, why does he not acquire these lands straightaway and give the market value for them? <Col N="877" /> He would thus obviate all these possible abuses.  He cannot make a claim that any injustice would be inflicted on the owner of the land if there is any virtue at all in this claim that market value is being established.  The Minister, in his remarks in relation to Section 25, has created the greatest suspicion about the virtue of the section which establishes market value.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would be very wise to accept Deputy Moylan's amendment.  After all, it is an effort to minimise the grave social damage that may be done by the operation of Section 25, particularly when it is associated with the section which Deputy Moylan proposes to delete.  No matter what the Minister may say on this section as to how these powers will be operated, the power to acquire land under Section 25 and to use it under sub-section (11) of Section 26 will remain. There will be grave pressure on any Minister for Lands to purchase every type of holding that is going up for sale in every part of the country on the plea that it is for the relief of these migrants and then to declare it not so required and to distribute it to people in the district.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, then, I shall make my speech.  As the Bill stands at the moment, the Land Commission can purchase land in the open market, ostensibly on the plea of using it for the relief of congestion and then using it to distribute it to all the people set out who may benefit under the various Land Acts or who may be allotted land under the Land Acts.  That means that the tendency will be for an agitation to be made here in the Dáil and locally, every time a portion of land is offered for sale, that the Land Commission should go down and outbid the local people who want to relieve their own family congestion, as Deputy Moylan put it, and that the Land Commission <Col N="879" /> should buy that land and take it over and then distribute it in the normal way that the Land Commission distribute land.  That is a social revolution and we do not know where it is going to end.  If it creates a situation that there is no one in the country who will provide land for himself out of his own resources but, when land is offered for sale, will simply agitate to get the State to buy it and declare loss on resale, and give it to him at half the annuity, we will have a very grave state of affairs.</P>
      <P>The Minister himself said that there were 250,000 acres of land changing hands in the open market every year. A vast proportion of that land is bought by small farmers who want to buy land for one of their sons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy relate that to amendment No. 13?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>And about one-tenth of which would be quite sufficient annually for the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 13 would prevent the Land Commission from distributing it to local landless men or otherwise.  It would impose a duty on the Land Commission to give it in one lot for the purposes for which it was acquired, for migrants. That, at least, would minimise the danger that we see in Section 25.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 14 does the same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not been allowed to discuss amendment No. 14 and I am taking the Bill as it stands and associating it with this amendment. It is a most dangerous procedure. We cannot persuade the Minister to mend his hand now but I wish that, between now and the introduction of this Bill in the Seanad, he would give this matter thought.  Do not step out into a social revolution of this kind without having fully considered the matter and given the people some more security than simply a Minister's promise on a Bill going through the Dáil.  That promise will not bind the Minister in law.  It will not bind any of his successors in law. <Col N="880" /> It will not stop political pressure being brought on the Minister here, by questions and debates in the Dáil, to acquire all land offered for sale and to use it for the purpose of distributing it to allottees to whom the Land Commission are not empowered to give land under any of the Land Acts.</P>

      <P>I want to support Deputy Aiken in this amendment.  I would like to point out to the Minister that in the last 25 years, particularly since the last war, his own county men have come to the Midlands and have bought this type of farm.  They are exemplary farmers and good citizens.  They are a credit. The Minister is going to stop all that now.  He is going to stop private initiative and endeavour in farming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been a friend of the congests that came from the West to Rathcarne and elsewhere.  Some of them went home again&mdash;not many, but a percentage.  I saw the farms they left in Connemara where I have been for five summers.  Other people went into them and built houses on the uneconomic holdings.  The problem there was not solved at all.  It is a grave problem that requires minute examination. The whole economy of the country is affected by this.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kennedy has completely misinterpreted the whole thing.  Deputy Aiken mentioned a figure that I mentioned previously&mdash; 250,000 acres&mdash;which is an approximate guess.  Nobody knows what is the exact acreage that comes into the open market for sale in any one year.  While Deputy Aiken was speaking, I interjected, when he mentioned 250,000 acres, that one-tenth of it would be more than would satisfy the Land Commission's needs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take this opportunity of saying&mdash;and I hope it will be brought to the notice of every householder in the country who is interested in the question&mdash;that the moment there is the slightest agitation or the slightest pressure being used to either inflate or deflate the price of a holding of land in which the Land Commission may be interested, my reply will be to prohibit the Land Commission there and then from having anything further to do with the purchasing of land in the open market.  Is that clear now to the House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me explain.  This section does not oblige the Land Commission to purchase land in the open market.  It permits them to do so.  It is under the control of any Minister for Lands to give an order to the secretary of the Land Commission at any time to say that the Land Commission shall from this day forward cease to purchase land in the open market for cash.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If it becomes routine in the Dáil to have a dozen or a few dozen questions on the Order Paper every day asking the Minister will the Land Commission bid for such and such an estate or such and such a farm, or if it becomes the practice to ask the Minister why did not the Land Commission offer more money for the land in a district, will the Minister then bring it to an end?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to such a question will be that that is a matter entirely for the Land Commission.  The Minister will have no responsibility for it, just the same as he has no responsibility at present to compel them to acquire or resume a holding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out to the Minister that the Minister has very rightly pointed out that it is a matter of policy as to whether the Land Commission will engage in this practice or not and that the Minister has the power, and rightly has the power to prescribe policy for the Land Commission, but not in any particular individual case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>What I want to know is will the Minister say that the policy of purchasing land in this way will cease if it becomes the practice that pressure is brought to bear on the Minister by a deluge of parliamentary questions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.  I did not say any such thing.  This is developing into a Committee Stage.  I am sorry. Let me say this in conclusion: Deputies have great freedom and privileges in this House.  It is up to them and to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to see whether they abuse them or not.  I do not call that pressure but what I would call very damaging influence would be where local people would try to club themselves together to compel the Land Commission to take this course or that.  That is a thing I hope will never be tolerated. Does that clear the Deputy's mind?  If every Deputy wants to put down a parliamentary question about a holding of land every day the Dáil sits, that is his privilege.  If a Deputy wants to abuse the privilege, that is a matter for himself.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 15, lines 48, 49 and 50, to delete &ldquo;sub-section (1) of Section 31 of the Land Act, 1923, as extended by sub-section (6) of Section 28 of this Act&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;paragraphs (a), (c) and (e), as extended by sub-section (6)) of Section 28 of this Act) of sub-section (1) of Section 31 of the Land Act, 1923, or to <Col N="884" /> the Minister for the purposes of afforestation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to do in a better way what the previous amendment aimed at, that is, to limit the use to which the Land Commission may put that land over and above giving it to migrants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that I can only speak once, but perhaps the Minister will explain to the House&mdash;I think we are entitled to ask&mdash;in what way it is an improvement or in what way it limits the Land Commission with regard to land acquired under Section 25.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite possible under the section as it emerged from the Committee Stage that, as Deputy Moylan expressed it, landless men could be allotted land.  This definitely excludes that.  I cannot make it clearer than that.  It prevents the possibility of such people raising the clamour of which Deputy Aiken and Deputy Kennedy are so afraid when land is offered for sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that under sub-section (1) of Section 31 of the Land Act, 1923, as extended by Section 6 of Section 28 of this Act all these people would be entitled to land.  The Minister has brought in something that was not in the section before, that was not in the section in its Committee Stage and that was not in the section on this stage until he has added it here, that is the question of land for afforestation.  This is land which will be acquired, I presume, in the open market under Section 25 and if it is and the open market price is paid for such land, I certainly have a strong objection to allowing the Land Commission to set trees on it.  The Land Commission have sufficient powers to get land for the purpose of afforestation already.  They have their own method of getting it and their own prices which are to be paid for such lands.  The type of land which is suitable for afforestation is regarded, in the part of the country I come from at least, as land which is not suitable for anything else.  We have&mdash;the Land Commission in particular&mdash;sufficient <Col N="885" /> problems on hands to try to solve congestion without dragging the question of afforestation into the Land Bill.  I do not want land which is bought on the public market at the expense of the taxpayers used for the purpose of afforestation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am trying to point out is that the Land Commission have not yet power under Section 25 to buy lands on the open market and pay the prices paid in the open market for purposes of afforestation as far as I am aware, and I would be delighted if somebody would point out where that power is.</P>
      <P>One of the limitations which will obviously be on the Minister and the Land Commission under this Bill is the question of finance.  I am quite satisfied, and I am sure that every Deputy in the House is quite satisfied, that the amount of land to be purchased on the open market under Section 25 for the purpose of relieving congestion will be governed by the amount of money allowed by the Minister for Finance for that purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount that will be allowed in any one year by the Minister for Finance to the Land Commission for the purpose of buying land on the open market under Section 25 will be limited to the price of land to be used solely for the purpose of allotment to migrants.  I therefore do not want to give the Minister power under Section 25 to use portion of that land for afforestation.  The Land Commission will have plenty on their hands in acquiring as much land as possible for the relief of congestion.  The forestry section of the Department of Lands has sufficient power to get as much land as they need, land that is suitable for the purpose of afforestation.</P>

      <P>There is no reason why it should come in here.  On the other hand, as Deputy Moylan pointed out, on his amendment a moment ago, the Land Commission might purchase a 70 acre farm in order to bring a congest or a migrant into it and they might feel that they were doing enough by giving such a man 60 acres and they might give 10 acres to the Forestry Department to set trees.  If that is so I say it is a &ldquo;cod&rdquo; of a way.  I would sooner make a present of that 10 acres to the farmer and let him set trees rather than hand it over to the Forestry Department after the Land Commission has bought it in the open market at public expense.</P>

      <P>Yes, the Minister's Department bought it.  The suspicion I have about the introduction of the Forestry Department into this matter is that the Department will express the view that the land is not good enough for the purposes of the congests and will turn it over to the Forestry section. That is a high-handed thing to do when the people themselves, who are the best judges of the type of farming they carry on, say that the land is good enough for them.  This is a concrete case in which the problem in the village of Raigha could have been solved, but the Forestry Department purloined the 700 acres and the problem is not now capable of being solved.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister has introduced this amendment, but it does not go far enough, and I ask him to consider the matter further between now and the time when the Bill goes to the Seanad.  The Land Commission will still have power, when this amendment is accepted, to acquire land for the purpose of giving it to migrants under Section 25 and then giving it to people in the locality in which the land is purchased.  The Land Commission will be in the position of going in and outbidding people for land who normally acquire land with their own money and it will tend to put an end to the traditional way in which small farmers have provided land for their sons.  It is a very dangerous course to embark on and may very well lead to a situation in which everybody will be holding back from the purchase of land, even though they are in a position to purchase land for their families, and relying upon the State to go into the market and buy the land, declaring a loss on resale and hoping to get it at a reduced figure and on the basis of half the annuity.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 16, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(14)  Rules made pursuant to the next preceding sub-section may provide that, where an allocation of compensation is made as between any mortgagor and mortgagee, an allocation may be made in respect of both principal and interest and that interest shall be treated as ranking equally with principal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to the principle of the amendment, but I do object to the fact&mdash;and this is a feature of the whole Bill&mdash;that no provision is made by the Minister for the laying of these rules on the Table of <Col N="889" /> the House.  I pointed out the other night&mdash;briefly, because it was suggested I was not quite in order&mdash;that statutory rules can have statutory effect.  I do not say that that will be so in the case of the rules made under this amendment. I agree that rules may be necessary, but it is, and has been, the practice that provision is made that these rules will come before some House of the Oireachtas, so that the Dáil and the country will know what rules are made.</P>
      <P>In an earlier part of this Bill, the Minister for Finance is given power to make rules governing the whole principles of the Bill and it may well happen that the Minister for Finance may make statutory rules, if he so desires, which would even have the effect of repealing some of the sections of this very Bill.  Statutory rules seemed to come as a surprise to the Minister when I mentioned them previously. They can actually repeal statutes and there are certain statutory rules which come to my mind, wherein it is set out that wherever these rules conflict with a statute, the rules will prevail.</P>
      <P>I merely mention these matters in order to point out to the House that here provision is being made for the making of rules, without any provision for these rules coming before the House and that there is in the beginning of the Bill a much more dangerous section, giving the Minister for Finance power to make rules. Goodness knows what rules he might make or what effect they might have. They might perhaps, in effect, be against the whole intention of some of the sections with which we have been dealing, and what I suggest to the Minister is that in connection with these rules, and more particularly the rules to be made by the Minister for Finance under this Bill, the matter should be re-examined before it goes to the Seanad, and, if necessary, a sub-section inserted at the end of this section, providing that these rules when made shall be laid on the Table of this House.</P>

      <P>This amendment is to cover cases in the hands of the Land Commission at the moment concerning the payment of gratuities to displaced employees. Under the previous wording it could be held that where an employee was employed on land in the hands of the Land Commission for some years he was not displaced by the purchase of the farm but by the allotment of the land.  He might have been employed by the Land Commission as a herd or stock manager.  This amendment is to cover such cases as that.

As I understand it, there is no time-limit put on this matter by the Minister.  I understood the Minister had changed his mind about this specific case referred to on the Committee Stage.  I do not suppose there would be many cases on which the Land Commission would have to go back.  Possibly there may be a few <Col N="892" /> estates in the hands of the Land Commission in connection with which this question might arise.  As the Minister is taking this power, I would again ask him to deal with the specific case referred to in Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister would want to do a little more than that.  As reported in Volume 118, column 9, of the Official Reports, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Many allottees of this class who were given allotments on farms have proved themselves quite unsatisfactory. The allotment, in fact, has been wasted on them.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that more than once in the good old days when I was Minister and he was knocking me hard every day.  I agree that it is something we want to obviate.  The giving of land to men because they happen to be employed on an estate which is being divided and, after a few years, giving them permission to compensate <Col N="893" /> themselves in the best fashion they can by the sale of the land is altogether wrong.  I would like the Minister to include in this provision for the fixation of a gratuity to be paid to any such employee.  If any such employee afterwards got portion of the land, the gratuity should not be paid to him and if, after getting the land, he proved unsatisfactory and wanted to sell the land, he should be given the gratuity fixed at first and allowed to get out. That is the only way to deal with such unsatisfactory allottees.  It is wrong to permit men who, by some pretext of employment or other, get a farm of land often valued for £1,000, dissipate it for a few years by letting it in conacre or grazing back to the very man who owned the estate, to sell it in the open market and make a substantial profit.  It is a premium on ineptitude and dishonesty.  I suggest to the Minister that the gratuity should be fixed for such an employee and, if he afterwards got an allotment on the estate, he should not be paid the gratuity.  If, for any reason, such as unsatisfactory working or because he was a failure, he has to get out, he should not get permission to sell the land but should be given the gratuity.  I think the section should be so amended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Cosgrave)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann hereby approves of the Control of Imports (Quota No. 43) Order, 1949.</P>
      <P>There are four Orders mentioned on to-day's Order Paper, but I understand that the confirmation must be moved separately for each.  They all deal with the same matter, so I take it that we can have one discussion on them.  These motions are to confirm the Quota Orders relating to the importation of woven cotton piece goods, as required by Section 4 (2) of the Control of Imports Act, 1934.</P>
      <P>Before the war, cotton piece goods were subject to a duty of 60 per cent. full, 40 per cent. preferential and as an alternative to a review of these duties by the Prices Commission in accordance with the terms of the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement of 1938, the Irish and British cotton industries entered into an agreement whereby the Irish market would be reserved for the Irish cotton mills in the types of cloths in which they then specialised.  This agreement was implemented through the making by the Irish Government in June, 1940, of four Quota Orders (Nos. 39, 40, 41 and 42) under the Control of Imports Acts, 1934 and 1937, covering all classes of piece goods containing more than 60 per cent. by weight of cotton and not exceding 10 ozs. in weight per square yard.  These quotas were suspended from the 24th July, 1941 in order to facilitate the importation of cotton fabrics which were then in short supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the return to normal conditions regarding supplies of cotton yarns and cotton piece goods, representations were made by the cotton weavers here (represented by the Linen and Cotton Textile Manufacturers Association) and their workers (represented by the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union) for the restoration of protection to the cotton industry.  The Manufacturers' Association urged that protection be afforded by the making of new Quota Orders in accordance with <Col N="896" /> a revised agreement arrived at between the British and Irish manufacturers of cotton piece goods.  This agreement which was supplementary to the agreement made in 1939 provided for an extension in the range of cloths to be reserved to Irish manufacturers while at the same time reserving the balance of the market substantially for goods of British manufacture.</P>
    <P>The production of cotton piece goods by the Irish mills, which reached its peak figure of 17,000,000 square yards in 1940, was running at the end of 1949 at the rate of approximately 12,000,000 square yards annually.  This figure represented only one-half of the capacity of the mills and even at this low rate stocks were at that time accumulating.  Because of the continued suspension of the protection afforded to the cotton industry, employment in the Irish mills was being adversely affected by imports which continued to take place at a high level. Imports in 1947 amounted to 40,000,000 square yards, in 1948 to 24,500,000 square yards, and in 1949 to 33,500,000 square yards.  The measure of protection sought by the cotton mills would, it was stated, have the effect of enabling production to be increased to about 25,000,000 square yards of cloth annually with an increase in employment of between 500 and 600 operatives.</P>
    <P>On the 13th December, 1949, the Government made four Quota Orders (Nos. 43, 44, 45, and 46) prohibiting except under licence the importation of woven cotton piece goods containing more than 60 per cent. by weight of cotton.  The Orders took effect as from the 1st January, 1950.</P>
    <P>It is too early yet to gauge the actual effect of these controls on employment in the cotton industry here but the number of operatives engaged should be very considerably increased when the mills are producing the country's full requirements in the types of fabrics to which protection has been afforded.  Imports of cotton piece goods during the first two months of 1950 (which are the latest figures available) and during the same two months of previous years show that there were substantially increased <Col N="897" /> imports during the January-February period of this year.  The high figure of imports immediately following the imposition of the quota controls is due in part to the fact that special facilities were granted to importers to enable them to clear consignments of cotton piece goods which had been firmly ordered before the 1st January, 1950.  Imports should however show a gradual decline for the month of March and ensuing months.</P>
    <P>The period beginning on the 11th February, 1950, and ending on the 31st May, 1950, was appointed to be the first quota period under each of the Quota Orders and quotas were appointed under each of them, the quantities mentioned to be goods manufactured in the countries stated.</P>
    <P>The quantities set aside for importation from the various countries were determined in relation to the trade in cotton piece goods carried on with each of these countries during the year 1949. The year 1949 was adopted as being the most normal and up-to-date period which could be selected having regard to the dislocation of trade during the war years and the gradual easement of the supply position in the post-war period.</P>
    <P>One of the main difficulties which has so far occurred in the administration of the quotas arises from the inclusion under Quota No. 43 of unpatterned poplin shirtings which are manufactured by the Irish mills only to a very small extent and of repp shirtings and cellular shirtings which are not produced here at all.  It is stated by the shirt manufacturers that the demand for unpatterned poplin shirts has increased tremendously during the last 12 months and it has been found necessary to meet the requirements of the shirt manufacturers in these types of cloths by the issue of special supplementary licences.  The possibility of having unpatterned poplin shirtings manufactured here in greater quantities and variety or alternatively of excluding these shirtings as well as repp shirtings and cellular shirtings from the scope of Quota No. 43 is at present being examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary explain what may be a purely technical matter.  There seems to be some increase in the amount of cloth to be imported under these quotas in relative periods, in the years 1947 and 1948 and the present period. It may be due to an alteration in the manner in which they are calculated. The figures I have here would show that in a corresponding period of 1947 less than half the amount of cloth was to be imported as compared with the present period order about which he has spoken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>During 1947 the earlier agreement was suspended, as the Deputy knows, so far as imports were concerned.  Under this agreement, approximately 80 per cent. of the market here is reserved on the basis of imports in 1949 for the Irish mills and the balance from Britain.  Now in addition, as a result of experience during the war years and particularly in post-war years, certain quantities have been imported from the Continent. Under these various quota Orders, on the basis of the 1949 imports quantities are reserved to Britain and also to various other countries.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy wants the actual figures.  In the first quota period it was 1,000,000 square yards under Quota 43&mdash;600,000 from Britain and the balance from Belgium, the Netherlands and other countries. Under Quota 44, it was 80,000 square yards from Britain and 20,000 from elsewhere.  Under Quota 45, it was 2,800,000 square yards from Britain, and the balance from the Netherlands, Belgium, the United States and elsewhere. Under Quota 46, it was 8,000,000 square yards from Britain, and the balance from the United States, the Netherlands, Belgium and other continental countries.</P>

      <P>When progress was reported, I was making some observations in regard to the report of the Roe Commission.  I end these observations by pressing the Minister to indicate, when concluding, that he and the Government will endeavour, within the shortest possible time, fully to implement the majority findings of the Roe Commission.  If the Minister were to give that guarantee now to the teachers&mdash;the guarantee that in the next Budget an effort will be made if not to meet the teachers in full at least to go a long way from the present position to full implementation of the majority findings&mdash;I think it would have a good effect.  It would allay or dissipate that feeling of disappointment and disillusionment that they now have in regard to the whole matter.  I think that is all the more important because undoubtedly the Minister, since he has taken over responsibility for the Department of Education, has gone a long way towards removing a great number of grievances which the teaching profession has had for a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have always maintained that education should be free.  The annual Estimates for the Department should ensure that education is free by the provision of sums for free school books and free school requisites.  Only <Col N="900" /> in that way can it be truly said that our educational system is free to the ordinary people.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made this afternoon and on many previous occasions on the Vote for the Department of Education to the size of the classes. Undoubtedly the classes are much too large.  While classes are too large, it is impossible to give proper education to the children in them.  By herding children into very large classes, as happens here in the City of Dublin, a good deal of the money we spend on education is really wasted.  No matter how efficient a teacher may be, no matter how competent he may be, no matter how well he may be paid, unless he is able to give some personal attention to his pupils, those pupils will not and cannot benefit by the classes which the teacher conducts.  It is essential, therefore, that such additional classrooms as are necessary should be obtained and such additional teachers as may be necessary should be provided so that our classes may be reduced to the number that will enable the pupils in them to benefit by the instruction they receive.</P>
    <P>It was always one of our boasts that when we had obtained our freedom a very high standard of education would be made available to the people.  We are not making that high standard available when we have classes of 60, 70 or 80 children under the charge of one teacher.  We ought to face the fact that it is grossly unfair to those young people that they should be put in the position of being deprived of the standard of education to which they are entitled.  That is what we are doing under our present system&mdash;we are depriving them of the education to which they are justly entitled.  I realise that during the past ten years it has been difficult to provide new school buildings.  However, we have had almost 30 years since we took over responsibility for our own education.  In those 30 years better provision should have been made for new school buildings.  I am not going to talk about the school buildings right through the country&mdash;other Deputies will deal with them.  However, there are schools in the City of Dublin <Col N="901" /> which are a disgrace to a community that calls itself civilised.  Every day as I pass by in the course of my ordinary work, I see children during the recreation break being marched out into the site of a demolished building round which an advertising hoarding has been erected.  I see those little children, in good weather and in bad, being marched into that horrible place to spend a half hour's break, or so.  That place is full of puddles and pools of water and the whole area is less than one-quarter of this chamber.  Those children do not deserve that from us. They deserve something better.  While these conditions exist we ought to hang our heads in shame.</P>
    <P>It was also one of our ambitions and one of our objectives that the school-leaving age would be raised so as to benefit the children.  That matter has been mentioned, considered and discussed over a great number of years and we seem to be as near that ideal now as we were when it was first mentioned. I appreciate the difficulties that face the Minister and his Department and that face us when we begin to consider the bill for education each year but, unless we face the issue and appreciate that we must spend more money on education and continue to spend until we have an ideal educational system, we cannot remove these obstacles to proper education.</P>
    <P>So far, I have referred to primary education.  Secondary education is a matter that causes me considerable worry.  Is the programme of secondary education suitable for the country?  Is it providing the very best training for commerce, industry, the public services, the local services, agriculture?  Is it planned for the purpose of educating our boys and girls towards these ends? Who plans the programme?  Is it done by the Department of Education and has it that particular object in view?</P>
    <P>I feel that the whole question of secondary education and its suitability for our national needs must be examined and inquired into at an early date.  Personally, I feel that our secondary education is not suitable for the purposes I have mentioned and that the system is not planned in accordance with national requirements and national economy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="902" /> In recent weeks the Minister has established a Council of Education and he has done exactly what I, speaking on this Estimate last year and the year before, was afraid he would do, namely, hand-picked a number of individuals who were representative of nothing, who had responsibility to nobody and formed them into a Council of Education. Like Deputy Derrig, I have no objection at all to any one of the individuals on that Council of Education. I am sure it must have caused the Minister a good deal of worry and trouble to select the individuals that he has selected.  They are all distinguished in their own spheres.  But, what was required was a Council of Education that would be representative of the different interests involved and that would be responsive and responsible to those interests.  The parents of this country have a large responsibility in regard to education.  It may be that some of the individuals on this council are parents but I feel that that is not the basis of their selection.  I should have liked to see a Council of Education formed of persons representing teachers, school managers, parents, universities and secondary schools, a democratically elected body rather than a handpicked body such as the Minister has succeeded in obtaining.</P>
    <P>A council democratically selected on the lines I have indicated should have particular responsibilities and particular functions.  As it is at the moment, it is an advisory body.  We do not know how often they will meet.  We do not know what matters will be referred to them, whether they may take the initiative themselves, whether they may arrive at decisions by a majority which, exactly like the majority decisions of the Roe Commission, may be ignored, and, if they are ignored, how long this body is going to last, how long it is going to exist.</P>
    <P>It was one of the points put forward by all the Parties in the inter-Party Government that there should be a council of education but it should be a real council of education, a council democratically elected, properly representative of particular interests and with statutory duties and reponsibilities. The body that has been set up <Col N="903" /> by the Minister does not fulfil these requirements and is not the type of Council of Education that I visualised or that I recommended prior to the formation of the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if the Minister covered this point in his opening remarks but, will this council be entitled to prepare and publish their own reports or will their reports be confidential documents that can only be disclosed by authority of the Minister?  Will their discussions be in private or will they be in public?  Those are matters that require consideration.  A number of matters arise on these Estimates but I propose to confine myself to these particular matters which I consider to be of importance.</P>
    <P>There is a motion to move back this Estimate and I must say that I cannot follow the line of moving back or rejecting it although I am not satisfied that the Estimate is adequate or sufficient for the purpose of providing proper education for the people.  I hope that during the present year the Minister will give the closest attention to those matters to which I have referred and that when we meet this time next year to consider the Estimates for this Department there will be some concrete evidence of a genuine desire, a serious determination, to remove all the obstacles to a proper system of education in this country.  I know that the Minister is well fitted to face serious responsibilities.  I ask him to face those serious responsibilities and whatever the bill may be he will have no difficulty in getting approval for it in this House.</P>

      <P>Gach bliain labhraim beagán ar an Meastachán seo, Meastachán an Oideachais, agus sé mo thuairim gurb é an Meastachán is tábhachtaí agus is mó ar fad atá ag an Rialtas.  Ba mhaith liom moladh a thabhairt don Aire ar dtús mar gur labhair sé go maith agus go bríomhar i nGaeilge i mbliana.  Bhí cúis gearáin agam anuraidh nach ndearnadh sé é agus molaim anois é mar gur athraidh sé an scéal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="904" /> Ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuilim féin mí-shásta faoi staid na Gaeilge ins na scoileanna ar fad, na bun-scoileanna, na meán-scoileanna, na ceard-scoileanna agus an ollscoil.  Níl fhios agam cén fá, ach sé mo thuairim nach bhfuil an spioraid céanna le blianta anuas in obair na Gaeilge agus a bhí tar éis dúinn an Stát seo a chur ar bun ar dtús.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil mí-shástacht na múinteoirí ciontach leis sin mar bhíodar mí-shásta go mór faoi cheist a dtuarastal agus b'fhéidir go bhfuil cúiseanna eile ann, ach sé mo thuairim nach bhfuil labhairt na Gaeilge go mór-mhór ag dul chun cinn mar ba cheart ins na bun-scoileanna faoi láthair.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil an oiread di á labhairt agus ba chóir.  Tá múinteoirí óga ag teacht amach, cuid acu as an nGaeltacht, cuid acu agus an Ghaeilge acu ó dhúchas agus sé mo thuairim nach labhrann siad Gaeilge chomh maith agus chomh minic agus ba cheart leis na páistí.  Ní hí an Ghaeilge gnáth-theanga na bpáistí tríd an lá.  Níl fhios agam céard tá dhá dhéanamh ins na coláistí ullmhúcháin ach níl an spioraid ceart iontu maidir le Gaeilge a labhairt leis na macaibh léinn mar ba cheart.  Ar chuma ar bith nuair a thagann na múinteoirí óga amach ní bhíonn siad ag obair chomh dian agus ba cheart dóibh i measc na bpáistí.  Níl mórán dhá dhéanamh chun na páistí agus na múinteoirí a ghríosadh agus chun cuidiú a thabhairt dóibh an teanga a labhairt.  Bhíos sásta tamall ó shoin nuair a chuala mé an tAire dhá rá gur cuireadh scéim ar bun ins na meán-scoileanna chun na mic léinn a ghríosadh chun na Gaeilge a labhairt.  Is maith an scéal é sin agus tá súil agam go gcuirfidh sé an scéim sin i bhfeidhm ins na bun-scoileanna agus na ceard-scoileanna chomh maith.  Tá fhios agam go maith go bhfuil cuid de na meán-scoileanna ag obair go dian agus gurb í an Ghaeilge an ghnáth-theanga i rith an lae, ach i gcuid mhaith eile níl an scéal mar sin. Is íontach an rud é nach bhfuil aon scrúdú dhé dhéanamh ar na mic léinn maidir le labhairt na Gaeilge.  Ní dóigh liom go mbíonn aon scrúdú béil orthu ó théann siad isteach go dtí go dtagann siad amach agus ní ceart é. Sé an scéal céanna é maidir leis na mic <Col N="905" /> léinn ins an ollscoil.  Is féidir le mac-léinn scrúdú a dhéanamh le dhul isteach ins an ollscoil agus ón lá sin amach níl aon iachall air an Ghaeilge a labhairt.  Sé toradh an scéil go dtagann siad amach agus níl fonn ar bith orthu an Ghaeilge a labhairt.  Tá mic léinn ar eolas agam a fuair scólaireachtaí go dtí an ollscoil&mdash;bhí siad go maith le Gaeilge ins an meán-scoil&mdash;ach nuair a tháinig siad amach as an ollscoil agus nuair a casadh daoine orthu níor mhaith leo focal Gaeilge a labhairt.  Tá rud éigin mí-cheart agus tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh an tAire athrú ar an scéal nó go ndéanfaidh sé iarracht ar chuma ar bith.</P>
    <P>Tá rudaí eile le rá agam ach deirim arís nach bhfuilim sásta ar chor ar bith maidir leis an dul chun cinn ins na scoileanna.  Is ioma cúis atá leis sin ach má támuid le dhul ar aghaidh caithfimid athrú a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>I have been trying to say that I am not satisfied about the position of spoken Irish in the schools whether they are primary, secondary or vocational schools or the university.  I think there is a distinct slackening from the position that obtained shortly after the State was founded.  There may be a variety of causes for that, but I think it is up to us and particularly to the Minister to try to get to the bottom of the question and encourage the children to speak Irish.  I do think that the abolition of the highly efficient marking will do a lot of damage. I know that the Minister did it at the request of the teachers, but I am afraid that it will do a good deal of harm because under this scheme one mark in speaking Irish counted for two and it was a distinct encouragement to teachers to make their pupils proficient and excellent at Irish.  When it is gone, and it has gone, I am afraid it is going to do a good deal of harm. Apart from that, there was certainly a falling back in the speaking of Irish.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated&mdash;and I was glad to hear it, because I did not know it before&mdash;that there is a scheme for encouraging the pupils of secondary schools to speak Irish and I hope he will extend that scheme to the national schools.  There must be some form of encouragement or some form of competition. <Col N="906" /> I think some prizes should be provided for the encouragement of the speaking of Irish by the schools. I do not know what is being done in the training colleges, but I do not think there is a right spirit amongst many of the young teachers coming out, even those who belong to the Gaeltacht. I do not think they are doing as much as they ought to do or trying to get the children they teach to use Irish as a spoken language.  I think also, though many people disagree with me, that there should be more of an attempt to teach subjects like geography and history through Irish.  I think it is a big mistake not to try it. It may not be 100 per cent. perfect, but it is an attempt and one which will bring results, irrespective of what anybody says.</P>
    <P>I have a good deal of practical experience and my experience is that a teacher with a fair fluency, teaching history through Irish, is bound to improve his pupils in the spoken language.  That should be encouraged and, if necessary, a great deal of credit given to the teacher who makes them fairly perfect.  I remember when I was trained&mdash;it was in the British time&mdash; prizes were offered for those who got highest place in Irish in the country and prizes were also offered for teachers who taught Irish successfully two years after leaving the training college.  There is no encouragement at all now that I can see, and there should be some form of encouragement for teachers and for pupils, because something will have to be done with regard to the improvement of the speaking of Irish.</P>
    <P>I may say that my knowledge of practical education is confined mainly to the primary schools and in that respect I need not tell the Minister that there are many defects.  We cannot expect perfection, of course&mdash;there were defects when the Minister came there, as there were defects when his predecessor came there, and I am afraid there will be defects until the end of time&mdash;but there are some things which could be remedied.  I agree with Deputy Cowan that more should be done to provide better buildings.  I do not know about the City of Dublin, but I <Col N="907" /> know that in Dublin there are several teachers&mdash;two, three and more&mdash;teaching in one room.  I think that is outlandish. In the country areas, there are many schools that are unfit for human occupation at all and the sooner these nightmares are got rid of the better.  I know that the Minister, any Minister, has to limit his operations under the direction of the Department of Finance, but I think every Department in the Government should try to end that state of affairs and provide better and healthier schools for the children.</P>
    <P>In other years I had to complain, as I have also to complain this year, about the sanitary conditions of the schools and particularly the cleaning of the schools.  The sanitary conditions in most of our country schools are primitive and a big attempt should be made to remedy that situation.  The cleaning of the schools is still left to the pupils.  There is in every town a vocational school, and, when the teachers in these schools go in there, they find everything prepared.  The national teacher is teaching a relatively much bigger number of pupils and if he does not have the school cleaned by the pupils before he goes home, he has to do it in the morning. That is not fair to the national teachers.  There should be some system under which these things would be done for them.  In many cases, there is no provision for cleaning out-offices and so on, and it is time that something was done to put an end to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>He has a lot of things to do and I am afraid he does not and cannot do them.  The Minister and his Department have the money and are primarily responsible, and I suggest that the Minister should try, whether through the manager or by some other means, to remedy that state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard Deputy Cowan complaining about very large classes.  That may be true of an old school in the country and of a number of schools in Dublin, but I have another kind of complaint to make.  I have to complain <Col N="908" /> of the schools which have almost no pupils at all in some of the classes. I could tell the House of some schools where they have not got a pupil at all enrolled in some of the classes, which is an even worse state of affairs.  That brings me to a point on which I agree with Deputy Cowan&mdash;that the school-leaving age should be raised in country places.  I know there is a problem in the city because the accommodation may not be available for them, but that is not so in country places.  As a general rule, the school population has dwindled.  It is now very small, and, where there were 70 and 80 pupils, there are scarcely 40 now, and so there is plenty of room, and there is no reason why the school-leaving age cannot be raised in these cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that there is a great deal of dissatisfaction amongst primary teachers about the primary certificate examination.  I am not one who will say that there should not be any primary certificate examination, but I say that it is not right to compel all pupils enrolled in the sixth standard to go in for that examination.  Taking the position as it is in country places, you have compulsory attendance only from the age of six to the age of 14&mdash; if they have a long distance to travel, there is practically no compulsion at all&mdash;and so the teacher has only eight years in which to teach all subjects.  I do not know what the present policy of the Department is, but some years ago the policy was to insist on promotion every year, with the result that &ldquo;duds&rdquo; were forced up in the various classes.  I for one promoted pupils and I did so to a large extent under compulsion, because the inspector would want to know why these pupils were not promoted.  It was really regarded as a mark of inefficiency if you did not promote them every year.  The result was, and is, that many pupils going into the sixth standard were and are not fitted for it, and are thereby forced to go in for that examination.</P>
    <P>I suggest that there be no compulsion in the matter of sending them into the sixth standard.  They could be left to a later standard&mdash;the seventh, at least.  A lot of the dissatisfaction of the teachers would then disappear. <Col N="909" /> The teachers say that it is educationally unsound, but I cannot see how it is.  There are some pupils who, even if you talked for ever, will never pass an examination and that should be taken into account.  There is a fair percentage of pupils who will never be able to pass the primary certificate examination, no matter how efficient the teacher is.  There should not be too much stiffness about it.  It should be left optional in the sixth standard, and, before they leave school, by all means let them sit for the primary certificate examination.  Much of the dissatisfaction amongst the teachers would thereby be removed.  Here again the raising of the school-leaving age would make that possible because, if you have them up to 15 years of age, you have a longer period in which to send them in for the examination.</P>
    <P>I was very much struck by Deputy Cowan's remarks about children at playtime going inside an old ruin. That is bad enough in Dublin.  It is easy to get playgrounds in Dublin, but what about something similar happening in country places?  You have boys and girls, particularly boys, having no place to play, except a miserable little school yard and, after playing in it for some time, it is all mud and they cannot play any longer.  That is happening in a country where there is any amount of land around the country schools.  At almost every county convention of the Gaelic Athletic Association year after year you have motions asking for the provision of proper playing pitches for schools and yet nothing has yet been done about it.  I put a question with regard to that to the former Minister for Education and he suggested that the managers had power to do this. I do not know how they have power to do it.  Anyhow, it is not being done. I think the Department of Education or the Government should go as far as getting compulsory powers for the provision of playing pitches for the schools.  It is an extraordinary state of affairs to have the pupils in these schools in wet weather going out to play under the present conditions.  If they are allowed to play in the school it gets into a muddy condition.  If it is a dry day, they have to stand up <Col N="910" /> against a wall when they should be playing a game.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission may have it in their power to do something about this, but they are giving very little heed to it.  In fact, I do not think they are giving any attention to the needs of the school in this respect.  I think that every effort should be made to provide these playing pitches.  It would not be a very costly matter. The local manager will not get a field unless there is some power given to him.  In most cases he would not be able to offer a sufficiently attractive price and he would need compulsory power to get the land.  If we are to develop the health of the race, and I think the Minister is very anxious to have that done, we should provide proper playing pitches both for boys and girls.  There is no reason why girls should not have their camogie at playtime or in the evening.</P>
    <P>The last matter I want to refer to is the remuneration of teachers.  Like Deputy Cowan, I think the Minister has gone a good way in this matter, but he has not gone far enough to satisfy the teachers.  He knows well that there is a great volume of discontent among the teachers with regard to their remuneration, although he has undoubtedly improved on the previous scales.  I may be wrong, but I got the impression, when the Roe Commission was set up, that it was really a question of setting up a body to arbitrate on this question and I thought their recommendations would be accepted. However, they have not been accepted, and I think that has produced a great deal of discontent amongst the teachers.  Like Deputy Cowan, I hope that the Minister will make a genuine effort in the near future to improve the position.  There are some points in the present scale that the Minister has put up and that is decidedly good.  I think that he has made a big improvement in the position of the lady teachers and that is a point I was always in agreement with.  I think that in most cases they do equally efficient work, and it is a very good thing that they are put on a par with the single-men teachers. I expect to be going out on pension myself before long and I am, personally, well pleased that the Minister is <Col N="911" /> giving a retiring gratuity to the male teachers.  That is bringing them on a par with civil servants and officials of local authorities, which is a very desirable thing.  Of course, if the gratuity were given on a percentage of a bigger salary it would be a lot better.  However, it is a big improvement and I hope the Minister will go the whole hog.</P>
    <P>Taking it all round, my feeling is that the matter which requires most attention is the speaking of the Irish language.  We all agree that unless something big is done in this generation with regard to that the opportunity may slip.  I am sure the Minister will get the co-operation of everybody who is truly Gaelic in this country in regard to that matter.  We all realise that it is a mighty big task but, if it is tackled properly and we are really sincere, a great deal can be done.  The Minister has been only two years in office, but I suggest to him that he should get together the inspectors of his Department and representatives of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation and other bodies interested in the teaching of the language and try to devise some means of improving the position with regard to spoken Irish.  I believe that some system of encouragement will need to be adopted whether in regard to the school as a whole or to the individual.  However, it should be possible to get representatives of all the bodies concerned to come together and with goodwill to evolve a scheme for the improvement of the position with regard to Irish.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that some of the university colleges are more in need of attention than anybody else.  Some of them are doing very little or almost nothing in regard to this matter.  I would say that they are spoiling rather than helping the progress of the Irish language. That is entirely wrong.  As they are being subsidised by the State, it is time that the Minister should make them toe the line and do their bit.  They ought to do more than anyone else. They are the educated classes and it is time they should be made do their bit.  I do not want to mention any individual college.  Some of them are <Col N="912" /> doing very good work, but others are doing very little, if anything.  They seem to regard the speaking of Irish as of no importance.  So long as they take up that attitude, I do not see how we can restore Irish as a spoken language. They should be made to realise that, if they are to be subsidised, they should take more than an ordinary part in the restoration of the Irish language.</P>

Na foirmeacha oifigiúla a bhíonn le líonadh ag an bpobal is é an cló sin a bhíonn orthu.  Na fógraí a chuireann an Rialtas ar na páipéirí is sa chló sin a bhíonn siad. An Club Leabhar&mdash;agus creidim go bhfuil beagnach dhá mhíle léitheoirí ann&mdash;foilsíonn siad leabhair sa chló Rómhánach.  Nach léir mar sin go bhfuiltear ag baint níos mó úsáide, in aghaidh an lae, as an gcló sin.  Níl mise in aghaidh an chló Ghaelaigh, chor ar bith, ach tá fhios agam, agus tá fhios ag gach duine atá ag plé le Gaeilge, go gcaithfear úsáid a bhaint as an gcló eile chomh maith.  Tuigeann formhór na scríbhneoirí, agus na daoine atá ag iarraidh an teanga Ghaeilge a thabhairt ar ais, gur gá go mheadh na scoláirí ábalta an cló Rómhánach a léamh agus gur dócha gurb é an t-aon chló a bheas á úsáid de ghnáth amach anseo.  Is dóigh liom dá bhrí sin gur ceart cúpla ceacht, ar a laghad, sa chló sin, a chur sna leabhair do na ranganna sa bhunscoil, agus sna leabhair mheánscoile.</P>

    <P>Tá rud eile atá ag teastáil go géar, is é sin, abhar léitheoireachta i nGaeilge don aos óg.  Páipéirí ar nós <i>Comic Cuts</i> do na páistí, agus leabhair eachtraí agus a leithéidí do bhuachaillí agus do <Col N="913" /> chailíní níos sine.  Ba cheart go bhféadfadh an Gúm na rudaí sin a chur ar fáil go minic agus go fairsing.  Chuala mé daoine ag gearán nach leagtar amach na leabhair scoile, idir Bhéarla agus Gaeilge, ar chuma go mbeidís ag dul i ndeacracht do réir a chéile. Tarlaíonn uaireannta go mbíonn an leabhar don rang íseal níos deacra ná an leabhar do rang níos aoirde.</P>
    <P>Ní foláir nó tá fhios ag an Aire, ná fuil daoine sásta chor ar bith leis an nGúm.  Ceann de na gearáin mhóra a déantar air, an mhoill mhór a bhaineann le leabhair d'fhoilsiú.  Bíonn leabhair acu ar feadh na mblian sar a gcuireann siad amach iad.  Conas is féidir scríbhneoirí Gaeilge a ghríosadh ar an gcuma sin?  Cuireann sé drochmhisneach ar scríbhneoir a cheapadh ná foilseofaí an leabhar go dtí tar éis a bháis, mar a tharla do roinnt daoine. Tá leithscéal bacach acu ag cur an mhilleáin ar na clódóirí.  Ach nach maith gur féidir le foilsitheoirí príobháideacha leabhair a chur amach go tapaidh?  Tá lochta móra, leis, ar an gcóras díolacháin acu, agus ba chóir go mbeadh sé furasta na lochta sin a leigheas.  Níl fhios agam an féidir feabhas a chur ar an nGúm gan an córas a leasú ó bhun.</P>
    <P>Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil oiread tairbhe agus is féidir á bhaint as na scannáin, laistigh nó lasmuigh de na scoileanna, ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge. Is gléas é an scannán nach féidir neamhshuim a thabhairt ann i saol an lae inniu.  D'fhéadfaí leas mór a bhaint as, ní hamháin don Ghaeilge ach mar uirlis mhúinte le haghaidh abhar léinn eile chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Ní thuigim cén fáth nach mbíonn scrúdú i labhairt na Gaeilge riachtanach sna Meán-Scoileanna.  Teastaíonn sin chun teanga bheo a dhéanamh den Ghaeilge agus is tábhachtaí é ná nithe eile a múintear i gclár na Gaeilge sna scoileanna sin.</P>
    <P>Tá rud eile atá ag déanamh go leor díobhála don Ghaeilge, is é sin, an polasaí atá ag an Ollscoil i dtaobh na Gaeilge.  An diúltú a thug Coláiste Ollscoile Bhaile Atha Cliath, tamall ó shoin, páipéirí scrúduithe a leagadh i nGaeilge, ba ghníomh é a bhí lom díreach i gcoinne polasaí an Stáit.  Os é an tAire atá freagarthach i gcúrsaí <Col N="914" /> oideachais, agus caiteachais ar oideachas, ba chóir dó gan ligint d'aon dream, is cuma cé hiad, saothar na múinteoirí bunscoile, meánscoile agus gairmscoile a mhilleadh.</P>
    <P>I prefaced my remarks with those few words in the native language in order that I might obtain the opportunity of practising it here in the House, as we have been advised to do outside the House by Deputies who have spoken here; and that, I think, should be done on every conceivable occasion that the opportunity presents itself.</P>
    <P>It is beyond question that the primary objective of our educational system at the moment is, or should be, the revival of the language.  It seems to me that very little progress has been made in that direction.  The reason for that lack of progress is, in my view, the lack of any united approach to the problem of the revival of Irish.  A Deputy who spoke earlier referred to the advisability of compelling teachers to teach, for instance, geometry and geography through the medium of the language.  I have had the experience in my schooldays of trying to learn those two subjects, particularly geometry, through the medium of Irish; and for any child who is not fluent in Irish such an experience is just mental cruelty and nothing else.  It is easy enough for any of our people who have had Irish <i>ón gcliabhán</i>, who have been familiar with it from an early stage, but for children living in counties where Irish has been dead for over a century it is a very difficult proposition, when they go to school, to have to try to learn a subject through the medium of a language with which they are not entirely familiar.  I think that represents a completely wrong approach to the question.</P>
    <P>In my view, the revival can be achieved only by our discovering a method whereby we can imbue the minds of the children with respect for the language and love of it, and a realisation of its beauty.  Compulsion of any kind, even exercised on the mind of a child, does not have the effect that it is designed to have.  That can be said particularly so far as the minds of Irish children are concerned. <Col N="915" /> Practically everyone is anxious to see Irish revived.  We no longer meet the mentality which was opposed to the revival, but we do suffer from disunity in our approach to that problem.  We have had different schools of thought about the method to be used.  We might make a beginning by trying to make the language more attractive, by endeavouring to secure the publication of children's periodicals in Irish, comic papers, possibly in both English and Irish.  Some newspapers have already embarked to some extent on that and, as far as can be observed, it seems to be a pretty successful line to follow.</P>
    <P>One of the problems which I see in this connection is the problem as to how Irish is to be kept alive in the minds of the youth when they have left school.  Thousands of young men and women&mdash;having gone through their school years and achieved a fairly good knowledge of Irish&mdash;leave school with a fairly good grasp of the language, sufficient to enable them to converse with and to understand people who speak it, and we have the problem of how they are to preserve that knowledge. I think that nothing hitherto has been done to help those people. They are left entirely to their own resources unless they come within the organisational scope of the Gaelic League&mdash;and not all of them have time to take part in such excellent organisations as the Gaelic League.  I believe there should be a policy on the part of the State whereby the maintenance of the Irish language amongst that particular group&mdash;people between the ages of 17 and 25 years&mdash;should be encouraged. That could be done, say, by the Department's offering scholarships in one form or another, by competition, by organising periodic classes or socials but particularly I think it could be done by offering to young men and women, within the age group 17 to 25 years, scholarships to the Gaeltacht in much the same fashion as they are offered to school-going children much younger in years.  Unless the Department and the State succeed in following up the work which has been done in schools in that fashion or in some such fashion, I am afraid that the work which has been done and which is <Col N="916" /> being done in the schools is going to be <i>obair in aisce.</i>  A Deputy expressed the view that if the present generation does not grasp the opportunity which is presented in this matter it may be fatal to the language.  I think that that opportunity is slipping day by day.  I think that so far as the attempt to revive the language is concerned it is in a very poor way.  The results are very poor.  It is very seldom we hear Irish spoken amongst people&mdash; even by those who know it and who are able to converse in it.  It is very seldom heard in ordinary commercial life and in the ordinary life of the nation.  That is a great tragedy and it is a problem which we shall have to tackle if we are going even to hold on to the slender thread which we now have of what was once the language of the whole nation.  I would ask the Minister to indicate, when he is replying, if he has any views upon the particular aspect of how the language is going to be encouraged amongst those young people who have left school with some grasp of it.</P>
    <P>I desire now to refer to the condition of school buildings and particularly school buildings in rural areas.  I am sure the Minister is very familiar with the constant complaints which he receives from various parts of the country in regard to the conditions in a lot of the schools.  Even in County Dublin, which is the premier county, there are still schools which should be demolished and replaced.  In this connection I think it would be of considerable help if the State contribution towards the building of new schools were increased. I know, of course, that the Minister has discretion in so far as the contribution is concerned at the moment: I know that it is flexible and that it can be increased.  However, any increases which have taken place or which are likely to take place over the ordinary statutory contributions are always the result of prolonged representation and necessarily prolonged delay.  I think it would be a good thing if the State contribution were increased so that the balance, which must be raised locally in each case, would not be so large.  At the present time, school buildings are costing enormous sums of money.  A school building in County Dublin, <Col N="917" /> which in 1939 could probably have been built for something in the neighbourhood of £3,500, will now cost between £7,000 and £8,000.  While the amount of money which must be raised locally in the parish concerned represents only a fraction of the total cost, nevertheless it represents a very great burden upon a particular parish which I have in mind and I am sure that that can be paralleled throughout the county and throughout the country because the people in the parish and the people in a rural area are not particularly prosperous. I think it would be a step forward if, in view of the very high cost of building, the State contribution could be substantially increased in respect of the replacement of existing schools which are in a bad condition.</P>
    <P>The question of playgrounds for children affects rural areas as well as cities.  The question of the lack of sanitation is a constant problem in rural areas in County Dublin so far as schools are concerned.  It must constitute a very serious threat to the health of the children, large numbers of whom are attending schools in different parts of County Dublin in which the sanitation is of the most primitive kind.  During the coming year the Minister should pay particular attention to the problem of sanitation as it applies to schools.</P>
    <P>It is difficult enough, in many cases, to get children to attend school with regularity but it is even more difficult when parents take the view that because of the lack of sanitary conveniences, the dilapidated condition of the school, and so forth, there is a threat to the health of their children. That is what occurs in different areas when conditions are bad.  We have come across cases of parents who have, perhaps, come to the conclusion that what their children might lose in education they would make up for in health if kept from school because the schools their children were attending were in such a bad condition or because of the sanitation problem.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to give attention to these two matters and, if he possibly can, when he is replying, to give some information as to what he proposes to <Col N="918" /> do in these respects.  I do not intend to take up the time of the House any longer on this matter.  I feel very strongly that, so far as the revival of the native language is concerned, a great deal of the talk we hear from time to time is only talk and so much wishful thinking.  It is not an easy problem to discover how we are to change the present position of the language in the minds of the children and create the position wherein it will be an object of regard and something to be cherished because, unfortunately, the policy which has been followed in the past has created a disposition against the language and has created difficulties for the progress of the language so far as the schools are concerned. I think we need a kinder attitude in this matter.  Those of us who have any knowledge of Irish at all know that if the mind of the child or the mind of the individual can be opened once to the beauty of Irish that will be sufficient to guarantee the future of the language.  We must find ways of doing that.  We must get rid of the idea that we will do it by compulsion. We will not.  We must find some way of encouraging the rising generation, on whom the future depends, to practise Irish, to maintain it and to regard it for what it is, our greatest national heritage.</P>

      <P>Bhí mé ag éisteacht le chuid mhór de ráiteas an Aire, ag cur an mheastacháin seo ós cómhair na Dála.  Bhí sé níos fearr i bhfad i mbliana maidir le labhairt na Gaeilge.  Labhair sé cuid mhaith Gaeilge ag míniú an mheastacháin dúinn agus tá moladh tuillte aige mar gheall air sin ach lean sé le cuid mhór Béarla nach raibh gá ar bith leis, dar liomsa.  Bhí nós ins an Dáil ag Tomás Ó Deirg ar feadh na mblianta nuair a bhí sé ina Aire Oideachais, an meastachán Oideachais a chur ós cómhair na Dála i nGaeilge ar fad.  Ní thuigim agus ní léir dom cén fáth go n-impódh an tAire ar ais ar an mBéarla.  Cuirim é sin ós a chómhair don chéad uair eile a bheas sé ag caint ar mheastachán Oideachais i gceann bliana, má bhíonn sé ann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Chaith an tAire tamall ag míniú dúinn mar gheall ar an gComhairle <Col N="919" /> Oideacha's atá bunaithe aige.  Mhínigh sé dúinn go mbeadh sé mar cheann de na príomh-chuspóirí ag an gComhairle sin comh-eagrú agus comh-riaradh níos fearr a dhéanamh ar chúrsaí oideachais nó a mholadh dhó conas a déanfar é sin.  Tuigim ón méid sin go ndéanfaí comh-eagrú níos fearr idir na ceithre ranna&mdash;bun-oideachas, meán-oideachas, ceard-oideachas agus oideachas ollscoile. Ach, dar liomsa, an fhaid agus atá cúrsaí oideachais ins na hOllscoileanna, go mórmhór maidir le ceist na Gaeilge, fé mar atáid, dá laighad comheagruithe agus comh-riartha a déanfar is amhlaidh a b'fhearr don oideachas agus do chúrsaí na Gaeilge, agus dob fhearr, im thuairim-se, fanúint go dtí go bhfeicimis an mbeadh sé i gcumas an Aire nó i gcumas aon dreama eile sa tír riaradh níos fearr a chur ar oideachas Ollscoile, go mórmhór maidir le ceist na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an gComhairle Oideachais, ba léir ó chaint an Aire nár chuir sé ar bun é de bharr aon mhaitheas a dhéanfadh sé i gcúrsaí oideachais nó de bharr aon fheabhas a chuirfeadh sé ar chúrsaí oideachais, ach gur cuireadh ar bun é de bharr na margaíochta rúnda a tharla nuair a gineadh an Rialtas so atá ann anois.  Is mar gheall air sin amháin atá an Chomhairle seo ann.  Ta aithne phearsanta agam ar triúr nó ceathrar de na daoine atá curtha ag an Aire ar an gComhairle seo. Is eol dom an saothar atá déanta acu in obair na Gaeilge leis na blianta móra fada.  Bheadh iontaoibh agam as na daoine seo, an triúr nó ceathrar díobh a bhfuil aithne agam orthu ar aon choiste nó comhairle nó ár aon eagraíocht a mbeadh baint acu leis.  Mar gheall air sin, tá mé sásta anois nach raibh an droch-amhras a bhí agam maidir leis an gComhairle seo ceart. Ní féidir liom a chreidiúint go n-éireodh le h-aon iarracht a déanfaí tríd an gComhairle Oideachais seo ar aon churisteach a dhéanamh ar chúrsaí na Gaeilge, an fhaid is atá na daoine seo in a gcomhaltaí de.  Bíodh san mar atá, mar a dubhairt mé cheana, creidim go bhfuil an Chomhairle seo curtha ar bun ag an Aire de bharr na margaíochta rúnda agus na comhcheilge ba bhun le comh-dhéanamh an Rialtais atá anois ann.</P>

      <P>Tá mise ag cainnt anois.  Ní féidir liom an tAire a chlos go maith agus mar gheall air sin, b'fhearr liom mo chuid cainte a dhéanamh.  Ní fhéadfainn gan bheith ag cuimhneamh freisin ar na cainteanna a chloisimis blianta i ndiaidh a chéile ó Risteárd Ua Maolchatha, atá anois in a Aire Oideachais, nuair a bhí sé ina Theachta Dála ar an dtaobh seo den Tigh.  Bhíodh sé ag cur síos go fadálach gach bliain i ndiaidh a chéile nuair a bhíodh an meastachain seo á phlé ar na ranganna móra a bhí anseo i scoileanna áirithe ins an gcathair seo, Baile Atha Cliath.  Bhíodh sé ag cur síos ar chómh dian agus chómh mór is a bhí an cruatan a bhí á chur ar na scoláirí scoile, ar lucht ceannais na scol agus ar na múinteoirí, go raibh orthu obair a dhéanamh ins na ranganna móra sin.  Is léir ón méid a chuala ar an meastachán seo agus ós na freagraí a thug sé ar ceisteanna an tseachtain seo nach bhfuil aon leigheas mór déanta aige, in imeacht dhá bhlian, ar na gearáin sin a bhí aige, maidir leis na ranganna móra i mBaile Atha Cliath.</P>
      <P>Ceist eile a bhíodh á plé aige anseo gach uile bhliain ná aos fágála na scol d'árdú.  Bhí socraithe ag Rialtas Fianna Fáil é sin a dhéanamh sar ar tharla an t-athrú Rialtais.  Ní léir go bhfuil aon ní á dhéanamh ag an Aire chun an socrú sin a chur i ngniomh cé go mbíodh sé féin, agus Teachtaí eile ins na Páirtithe eile atá páirteach ins an Rialtas, glórmhach mar gheall ar an scéal seo leis.  Is cuimhin liom gur pléadh an scéal seo ins an Dáil cúpla blian ó shoin agus bhí Vótáil anseo mar gheall uirthi.</P>
      <P>Níl aon ní déanta cheana, go bhfios domsa, agus is léir ó ráiteas an Aire inniu nach bhfuil beartaithe aon ní a dhéanamh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá rud eile ann, agus bhíomar bréan ó bheith ag éisteacht leis, sé sin, chómh híseal is atá caighdeán an oideachais sa tír seo.  Bhíodh sé sin ar siúl bliain i ndiaidh a chéile ó tháinig mise isteach sa Dáil sé bliana déag ó shoin.  Bhíodh an chainnt ag <Col N="921" /> dul i méid agus ag neartú in aghaidh na bliana ó bhinsí Fine Gael, go mór mhór ar chómh híseal is a bhí caighdeán an oideachais mar gheall ar an obair a bhí ar siúl ins na scoileanna ar son na Gaeilge.  Sin é a bhí le tuiscint againn.  Níl sé sin le tuiscint ó ráiteas an Aire anois ar aon chor.  Tá fhios agam féin, tá fhios ag éinne againn go bhfuil aon eolas aige ar an scéal, nach raibh sé sin fíor ariamh agus nach bhfuil sé fíor anois.  Tá fhios againn go bhfuil an caighdeán chómh hard sa tír seo, maidir le bun-oideachas, meán-oideachas agus ceard-oideachas, is atá in aon tír eile cosúil linn nuair a chuimhnímid ar na constaicí go léir a bhí le sárú againn agus na deacrachta fé leith a bhí againn anseo nuair a bunaíodh an Roinn Oideachais ar dtús.  Buíochas mór le Dia ní raibh mórán den chaint sin le clos sa díospóireacht seo agus ní raibh mórán den chaint a bhí anseo bliain ó shoin maidir le múineadh tré Ghaeilge agus chómh díobhálach is a bhí sé.</P>
    <P>Ceist eile a raibh go leor cainte ar siúl mar gheall uirthi chuile bhliain a raibh ceist an oideachais á plé ná ceist stáid na bhfoirgneamh, na drochscoileanna go léir a bhí ann agus an gá a bhí ann le scoileanna nua a sholáthar. Do réir an eolais a thug an tAire dúinn mar fhreagra ar cheist a chuir an Teachta Tomás Ó Deirg air tuigim go bhfuil suas le cúig céad droch-scoil ar fud na tíre seo fós. Tuigim chómh maith go bhfuil dhá cheann déag nó fiche ceann i gContae Luimnigh agus go bhfuil trí cinn i gCathair Luimnigh.  Tuigtear dhom go bhfuil súil ag an Aire leath-chéad scoil a sholáthar in aghaidh na bliana feasta.  Sílim go raibh isteach is amach leis an méid sin á dhéanamh sul ar tháinig an cogadh agus aimsir na práinne a chuir isteach ar obair thógála i gcoitinne.  Go bhfios domsa tá cuid mhaith droch-scoil in iarthar Chontae Luimnigh pé scéal é agus tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh an tAire a dhícheall chun an scéil sin a leigheas.</P>
    <P>Tá fhios agam go maith agus tuigim go maith nach ar an Aire amháin atá cúram na hoibre seo; tá na bainisteoirí i gceist, agus tá Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí i gceist chómh maith. Tuigim go maith gurb é an bainisteoir <Col N="922" /> a chaitheas tús a chur leis an obair sa chéad dul síos agus go mbíonn eagla ar na bainisteoirí bochta an cúram trom sin a thógáil orthu féin. Ní locht orthu é uaireannta mar ní ins na paróistí is saibhre agus is fearr as a bhíonn na scoileanna sin de ghnáth.  Caithfear aghaidh a thabhairt ar obair thógála na scoil, leanacht di chómh mhaith agus is féidir linn agus airgead a sholáthar di chómh maith agus is féidir go mbeidh an galar leigheasta.  Is dócha nach bhfeiofimid féin an lá sin.</P>
    <P>Thugas fé deara go ndearna an tAire rud amháin a thaitnigh go mór liom, sé sin, gur thóg sé faoina sciathán féin an deontas le haghaidh na bpáipéirí Gaeilge.  Sílim gur rud maith é seo agus is é an fáth adeirim é sin ná go dtuigeann an tAire scéal na bpáipéirí Gaeilge agus scéal na Gaeilge i gcoitinne níos fearr ná aon Aire eile atá san Rialtas anois agus go bhfuil suim aige sa scéal sin.</P>
    <P>Mholfainn dó an rud céanna a dhéanamh maidir leis an Coimisiún Log-ainmneacha.  Tá an meastachán sin fé chúram Roinne eile i láthair na huaire agus ba mhaith an rud é, is dóigh liom, dá ndéanfadh an tAire Oideachais an rud céanna is a rinne sé maidir le deóntas na bpáipéirí Gaeilge, sé sin, é a thógáil faoina sciathán féin. Tuigeann sé an scéal níos fearr agus bheadh sé níos báidhiúla leis ná an tAire go bhfuil an obair faoina chúram anois.</P>
    <P>Mar is eol don Aire, cuireadh deireadh leis an obair sin nuair a tháinic an t-athrú Rialtais.  Obair an-tábhachtach agus an-tairbheach don tír í agus dá dtógadh an tAire faoina sciathán féin an vóta sin bheinn ag súil go dtosnófaí ath-uair ar obair an Choimisiúin Log-ainmneacha agus go gcuirfí i gcrích í go luath.  Bhí súil nuair a cuireadh an Coimisiún ar bun i 1946 nach dtógfadh sé ach cúig bliana chun na hoibre a chur i gcrích agus go gcosnódh sé ar fad £25,000 nó £30,000 agus go mbeadh na log-ainmneacha sin go léir ar láimh shábháilte feasta. Dá bhrí sin bheinn ag súil go ndéanfadh an tAire amach anseo nó go luath an cheist sin a scrúdú féachaint an bhfaigheadh sé cúram an Choimisiúin cómh maith le Vóta na bpáipéirí Gaeilge.</P>

      <P>Rinneadh tagairt san díospóireacht seo do cheist an Ghúim.  Is ceist í atá ag déanamh tinnis dúinn le blianta anuas ach thuigeas ón Aire go bhfuil feabhas ar cheist na clódóireachta le bliain anuas agus más mar sin é ba cheart go mbeadh feabhas ar chúrsaí an Ghúim chómh maith.  Tá súil agam é, mar tá an scéal dona go leor.

Deir siad gur ceart gur eagraíocht den tsórt sin a thógfadh cúram na hoibre seo&mdash;litríocht na Gaeilge agus leabhra a sholáthar do Ghaeilgeoirí.  Táim ar aon intinn gur ceart é sin a dhéanamh feasta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ní mór a dúrathas anseo mar gheall ar chúrsaí gairm-oideachais ach bhí socair ag Rialtas Fianna Fáil, bhí beartaithe acu, go raibh gá le timpeall 100 gairm-scoil eile ar fuid na tíre, go mór mhór gairm-scoileanna tuatha. Sílim ná fuair an tAire aon locht ar an tuairim sin.  Tá eolas agam ar cheann de na gairm-scoileanna seo a dúnadh bliain ó shoin agus is dócha go bhfuil sé dúnta fós.  Ceist is ea í seo a bhfuil smacht ag dream eile seachas an tAire uirthi agus is é an dream atá i gceist agam ná an coiste contae gairm-oideachais nó an coiste cathrach gairm-oideachais, do réir mar a tharlaíonn; ach san am atá caite tógadh scoil anois agus arís in áit mhí-oiriúnach, agus ba chóir féachaint chuige roimh ré, chómh maith agus is féidir, go <Col N="924" /> dtoghfaí na hionaid is oiriúnaí agus is fearr, agus sa tslí sin ní bheidh aon bhaol go dteipfeadh ar cheann de na scoileanna sin.  I Luimneach tá gá le dhá scoil nua eile sar a mbeidh ár ndóthain de na gairm-scoileanna sin againn.  Tuigim go mbrathann sin ar an gcoiste áitiúil níos mó ná ar an Aire.  Is iontach an méid maitheasa atá déanta sna scoileanna sin chun feabhas a chur ar shaol na tuatha agus ar chúrsaí na tuatha agus chun an sórt sin oideachais a leathnú níos mó ar fud na tíre.</P>
    <P>Sílim gur thuigeas ón Aire&mdash;nílim cruinn mar gheall ar an méid adúirt sé i dtaobh na timirí Gaeilge&mdash;go raibh tuille le hoiliúint chuige sin sna blianta atá romhainn amach, agus dhein sé tagairt leis do na cruinnithe a bhí ar siúl thíos i gContae Luimnigh anuraidh&mdash;oícheanta Gaeilge a tugtar orthu&mdash;agus d'éirigh go han-mhaith leo.  Is maith liom gur thug an tAire faoi ndeara an dea-obair atá ar siúl ag na timtirí sin.  Is trua nach bhfuil duine nó beirt eile acu ar fáil ag an bpobal anseo agus ansiúd sna bparóistí. I gContae Luimnigh, ní dóigh liom go bhfuil aon rang den tsórt sin ar siúl acu, ach arís ní ar an Aire a bhrathann sé sin ach ar an gcoiste áitiúil.  Tá an coiste gairm-oideachais i Luimneach an-mhaith agus níor staonadar riamh ón rud ceart a dhéanamh nuair a cuireadh i dtuiscint dóibh go raibh gá le rud fónta éigin a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Tá an tAire ag bronnadh, do réir an mheastacháin seo, £6,000, an méid a bronnadh anuraidh, ar Chomhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge.  Bhí £10,000 ag dul don chomhdháil seo sa bhliain 1948-49 agus ag an am sin ní raibh an chomhdháil sásta leis an méid a bhí á sholáthair dóibh.  Theastaigh níos mó airgid uathu.  Nuair a thosnaigh Aire Airgeadais an Rialtais seo ag spáráil airgid d'iompaigh sé a shúile ar an gComhdháil agus ar an deontas dóibh agus ar dheontaisí eile dá shórt.  Bíodh sin mar atá, tá plean molta anois ag an gComhdháil&mdash;is dóigh liom go bhfuil siad tar éis dul chun cainte leis an Taoiseach an tseachtain seo&mdash;maidir le hobair na Gaeilge.  Thuigeas ón litir a scríobh an tAire go dtí an Chomhdháil anuraidh nach raibh sé lán-tsásta leis an obair a bhí idir lámha acu.  Tá rud amháin <Col N="925" /> ann, pé scéal é, agus mura ndéanfadh an Chomhdháil aon rud eile ach é, b'fiú go mbeadh an Chomhdháil ann&mdash; is é sin, an Club Leabhar a chur ar bun. De bharr an Club sin a bheith bunaithe, tá sé deimhin anois ag aon scríbhneoir a scríobhann leabhair a nglacann an Club leis go ndéanfar margadh dó agus tá ag éirí go han-mhaith leis an iarracht sin.  Is mór an ní gur deineadh é agus is mór an chreidiúint don Chomhdháil gur deineadh é.</P>
    <P>Dhein mo chomh-theachta, an Teachta Ó Ruairc, cur síos ar cheist na Gaeilge, sna bunscoileanna go mór mhór, agus ba mhaith liom aontú le rud amháin adúirt sé, is é sin go bhfuil gá níos mó, go bhfuil géar-ghá le labhairt na Gaeilge a chothú in gach aon tsórt scoile.  Tugtar an iomarca cúraim, is dóigh liom, don léitheoireacht agus don scríbhneoireacht agus ní tugtar aire go leor don chaint. Más féidir leis an Aire agus leis an Roinn aon phlean nó aon chleas a tharraingt chucu a mheallfadh na daltaí scoile, na mic léinn sna meánscoileanna go speisialta, chun níos mó Gaeilge a labhairt le chéile sa rang agus taobh amu dhe agus ar na faichí imeartha, beidh obair an-mhaith ar fad déanta.</P>
    <P>Bhíos ag tagairt anseo cúpla nóimeat o shoin don athrú a rinne an tAire mar gheall ar an deontaisí le haghaidh na bpáipéirí Gaeilge.  Tá airgead eile ag dul do chúrsaí oideachais in aghaidh na bliana agus ba mhaith an grádh Dé go mbeadh a chúram ar an Aire Oideachais chomh maith.  Is é an tAire Airgeadais atá freagarthach ann go dtí seo, sé sin, án Vóta le haghaidh na nOllscoil.  Deirtear nach ceart cur isteach ar shaoirse na nOllscoil agus tá gach éinne anseo cuid mhaith ar aon intinn leis sin, ach tá ceist faoi leith ag baint le ceist na nOllscoil sa tír seo, go mór mhór coláiste amháin. Níl sé ceart ná cóir nach mbeadh caoi ag an Dáil seo an scéal sin a phlé agus do réir mar atá an scéal faoi láthair ní féidir é a phlé.  Caithfimíd an t-airgead a vótáil bliain i ndiaidh a chéile, agus gan eolas ar bith le fáil againn ar conas a caitear é nó ar cad é an beartas atá ag an dream a dtugaimíd an t-airgead dóibh.</P>

      <P>Is cuimhin liomsa go maith é&mdash;is é sin, maidir le cúrsaí na Gaeilge.  Bhí sé mí-shásta, an uair sin, mar gheall ar staid na Gaeilge i ranna Stáit agus sa Rialtas fré chéile.  Tá mise i bhfad níos mí-shásta inniú ná mar bhí seisean an uair sin.  Cúrsaí oideachais atá dá bplé againn sa Mheastacháin seo agus is dócha nach bhfuil cead agam tagairt a dhéanamh d'aon rud eile.</P>
      <P>Dúirt an tAire, sa ráiteas a thug sé inniu, go bhfuil sé ag smaoineamh ar ghléas moladh beirte a chur ar bun maidir le cheist tuarastal na n-oidí, múinteoirí de gach aon tsórt.  Nuair a cuireadh ar bun an Coimisiún, go raibh Pádraic Mac Giolla Ruadh i gceannas air, bhí sé in intinn gach aoinne go gcuirfí na moltaí i bhfeidhm. Tá súil agam nach gcuirfear i bhfeidhm moltaí an mholadh beirte seo mar gheall ar thuarastal sa dóigh inar cuireadh i bhfeidhm moltaí an Choimisiúin. Ba chóir go dtuigfí roimh ré gur moladh beirte ceart a bheadh ann. Bhí an scéal céanna dá phlé againn blianta ó shoin maidir leis an StátSheirbhís, agus bhí toghchán faoi chomh maith&mdash;agus is cuimhin leis an Aire cad é an toradh a bhí ar an toghchán a tharla i 1938.  Má cuirtear an gléas seo ar bun, ba chóir don Rialtas glacadh leis na moltaí&mdash;mar ba chóir i gcás an Choimisiún a cuireadh ar bun athrú anuiridh chun moltaí a thabhairt don Rialtais maidir le tuarastal múinteoirí na mbunscoileanna.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sílim gurb é an Teachta Ó Ruairc a rinne tagairt don ghéarghá le faichí imeartha do na bunscoileanna. Cheap mise go raibh cumhacht ag Coimisiún na Talún faoi Acht 1933 na faichí sin a sholáthar, ach bhíos ag cur tuairisce le déanaí agus gheibhim amach anois nach bhfuil an chumhacht sin acu.  Sílim go bhfuil sé de chead ag bainisteoir bunscoile, mura féidir leis páirc a sholáthar in aon tslí <Col N="928" /> eile, iarratas a chur isteach go dtí Coimisiún na Talún ag iarraidh orthu é a sholáthar.  Nílim ró-chruinn anois faoi, ach thuigeas gur mar sin a bhí an scéal.  Tá géarghá leo, gá chomh géar agus atá le scoileanna nua, in áiteacha.  Ba chóir go scrúdófaí an cheist, féachaint cad é an leigheas atá le fáil ar an easpa faichí imeartha i láthair na huaire i scoileanna áirithe.</P>
    <P>Bhíos ag éisteacht leis an Teachta Ó Duinn sa mhéid a dúirt sé i nGaeilge, agus is trua nár lean sé i nGaeilge, mar labhair sé go cruinn agus go gonta agus go líofa.  Ní bheinn ar aon aigne leis an rud a mhol sé mar gheall ar chló agus litriú.  Tá sé deacair go leor ar na múinteoirí agus ar na scoláirí bheith ag plé le cló amháin agus le litriú amháin; agus go dtí go mbeadh an scéal i bhfad níos sábháilta ní dhéanfainn aon chur isteach ar na cúrsaí sin.  Bhíos tráth go láidir i gcoinne aon athrú a dhéanamh ar an gcló.  Do réir mar atá, do bheinn sásta le haon chló in aon chor dá mbeadh an teanga slán ó bhaol.  Is minic a chuala mé an cheist dá chíoradh agus bhí sé mar thuairim ag daoine cialmhara dá nglactaí leis an gcló Rómhánach breis agus caoga blian ó shoin gurbhfhearr a bheadh an scéal inniu, mar do bheadh a lán Gaeilgeoirí i ndon é a léamh, agus bheidís i ndon na seana scéalta a scríobh síos, in ionad iad a bhreith leo go dtí an uaigh.  Ós rud é nar deineadh an uair sin é, b'fhearr é d'fhágaint do ghlún eile.</P>
    <P>Ní aontaím le cuid de na rudaí adúirt an Teachta Ó Duinn agus níl mé ar aon aigne leis sa mhéid adúirt sé mar gheall ar éigeantacht agus mar sin de.  Cuid den seanphort is ea é sin.  Bhí an seanphort sin le clos againn le blianta ach creidim, mar sin féin, go raibh an Teachta Ó Duinn i ndáirire sa phort a bhí ar siúl aige anocht.  Is i mBéarla d'fhoghlaim mise na habhair scoile ach, bíodh siad le foghlaim againn i mBéarla nó i nGaeilge, tá orainn é a dhéanamh. Taithníodh sé linn nó ná taithníodh, bíodh suim againn ann nó ná bíodh, tá éigeanteacht de shórt áirithe ag baint leis an saghas sin oideachas. Sinne a bhí sna bun-scoileanna sa tír seo faoi na Sasanaigh, tá fhios againn go maith nach raibh rian ná rath ar <Col N="929" /> an obair i nGaeilge go dtí-go rahib sé mar chúram ar gach oide scoile i ngach scoil ar fud na tíre an Ghaeilge a mhúineadh, an méid dob fhéidir sin a dhéanamh i dtosach.  Anois, is é an scéal atá ann ná gur ar éigin atá scoil sa tír nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge ar siúl inti.  Nuair a thosnaigh an obair 25 bliana ó shoin ní mar sin a bhí an scéal.</P>
    <P>Ní aontaím leis an Teachta Ó Duinn gurb amhlaidh atá an scéal anois ná nach bhfuil dul ar aghaidh maith déanta in obair na Gaeilge.  Tá dul ar aghaidh maith déanta agus tá athrú mór togtha sa tír seo.  Aoinne adeir nach bhfuil, ní thuigeann sé an scéal agus níl aon eolas aige ar an scéal. Chonnaic mise an dá thaobh.  Chonnaic mise na scoileanna sar ar tháinig an t-athrú agus tá fhios agam agus tá aithne agam ar na scoileanna agus ar na scolaírí ó tháinig an t-athrú.  Is féidir dul áit ar bith ar fuid na 26 contae i láthair na huaire agus caint a dhéanamh leis na daoine óga agus ní gá duit aon fhocal amháin a rá i mBéarla.  Ní mar sin a bhí an scéal nuair a thosnaigh mise mar thimire do Chonnradh na Gaeilge i mbliain a 1920, 1921 agus sna blianta ina dhiaidh sin.  Chonnaic mise an t-athrú ag teacht.  Chonnaic mise an lá nuair nach raibh gá focal Béarla a labhairt leis na daoine óga.  Deirim gur athrú mór agus athrú le leas na tíre an t-athrú sin agus táim buíoch de Dhia gur ceadaíodh dom an lá sin d'fheiscint.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>The calm atmosphere in which the Estimate for the Department of Education has been discussed certainly augurs well for the future of education in this country.  The Minister deserves the nation's thanks.  He has allayed many of the old fears, bitternesses and troubles of the teaching profession.  The laying of a solid foundation in that respect augurs well for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a great deal for some time past about a council of education. It has recently been established.  From the names of the members of the council and from what I hear, I think that we have a national Brains Trust with a proper balance and from that should spring a proper system of education for the country.  After all, our greatest bulwark is a contented teaching <Col N="930" /> profession.  The Minister has made every effort to bring about that state of affairs.  It is unfortunate that in the past few years there were troubled times in the teaching profession.  Even yet, things are not what they should be but, slowly but surely, they are being set right.  I assure the Minister that the majority of the teachers are very thankful&mdash;more than thankful&mdash;for what he has done for them.</P>
    <P>A fair number of young teachers in this country are rather dissatisfied with their conditions, and rightly so. These young people, who are on the lower rungs of the ladder, find that their salaries are far too small to enable them to cope with present-day conditions.  I know some of them and they are in the unhappy position that if they want to get married they cannot do so because their salaries would not be sufficient to cater for two. They really have a grievance.  I would ask the Minister to consider their position sympathetically and to see that the younger teachers get an increase in their salaries.  I feel sure that the financial resources of the State will permit of that being done.  That is one grievance which I find among the younger teachers.  The middleaged and the older teachers are well satisfied with what the Minister has done and they are very thankful to him.</P>
    <P>The principal thing about which I wish to speak to-night is education in the country districts&mdash;I do not know much about the matter as it affects the big cities.  I am satisfied that a good deal of work has to be done to provide proper schools in my county.  Very many of the schools there are not fit to house cattle, let alone children.  Some effort should be made to get on with the proper building of new schools. The Minister is a good man for that job and, with the co-operation of the Department, the managers and the teachers, I hope it will be done with the greatest speed.</P>
    <P>The school-leaving age is a big prolem, too.  We see young people of 14 years rambling about until they are 15 and even 16.  I hope the Council of Education will look into that matter and see if anything can be done in <Col N="931" /> respect of the school-leaving age.  That period in a young person's life is the period during which we can lay the real foundation for a good future.  If a young boy is allowed to drift between the ages of 14 and 17 he may become a wastrel whereas if his mind is focussed on a proper line of thought he can become a fine honourable man and a credit to his family and his country.  Therefore, every effort should be made to hold on to these young people in their manhood and girlhood and to mould their characters so that they will become good citizens.  We must not forget that it is on these young people we are depending for the future national balance of a good progressive nation.  We can have that if we take the proper steps in good time. I know that the matter is safe when it is in the Minister's hands.  I know that he is thinking of these problems and trying to find a solution of them.  If we have contended teachers, good schools and co-operation between the managers, the parents, the teachers and the Minister, there is no earthly reason why we cannot lay a good foundation for the future of education in this country.  No serious grievance should ever again be permitted to exist amongst the teaching profession. Every effort should be made to prevent such a state of affairs and the strike which we had should never occur again.</P>
    <P>There are two people in this House to whom I would entrust the future of the national language and these two people are the present Minister and the Leader of the Opposition.  With the present Minister in charge&mdash;and with the outlook which he has&mdash;the language is safe in his hands.  There is no need to talk about the question of the Irish language so far as the Minister for Education is concerned.  He will see to it that slowly but surely the Irish nation will emerge solid and balanced. I thank the Minister for all he has done on behalf of the nation and the teachers and hope that the few remaining grievances of the teachers will be removed and that the Council of Education will prove most successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BridgetMRedmond" hpid="Mrs. Redmond Mrs. Redmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just a few words to say on this Estimate.  I feel <Col N="932" /> rather strongly about it, because I consider that it is one of the most important, if not the most important, that will be coming before the House this year.  I agree with the last speaker that education is safe in the hands of the present Minister.  I realise, however, that he has a very difficult task before him if he is going to face facts and I want to put a few facts before him this evening; perhaps they are not popular ones, but they represent what the general public think.  I think that public money should be spent in the way that is best for the nation.  It is all very fine to vote away money here and to have high ideals with regard to one thing or another without caring how the money is spent or from whence or where it comes.  I think the best thing for one to do is to say what one thinks and feels with regard to the Estimate under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As other speakers have said, there is much to be done so far as many of our rural schools are concerned.  Many of us, perhaps, are led away by looking at some magnificent school in the city or large town, whether it be a technical school, a Christian Brothers' school, or whatever kind of school it may be.  But, in the country wayside places such as I have to visit on occasions there is very much to be desired so far as the children's comfort and the teachers' comfort are concerned. We all realise that if the children have not comfort they have not any encouragement to go to school and that there is very little encouragement for parents to allow them to go on wet days, because, unfortunately, many of the schools are not very well heated and in fact are not fit for human habitation at all.  Therefore, instead of some waste of money which I consider is at present going on in this Department, it would be wiser to spend that particular amount of money on the reconstruction of schools or building of new schools in these outlying districts with regard to which I understand the Minister will in time be notified.  I would ask the Minister particularly to look into this question of the heating of the schools and the building of new schools.  It is not fair to have everything <Col N="933" /> centralised in the city or in the towns to the detriment of the people in the country disticts, because everyone has his own part to play so far as the nation's future is concerned.</P>
    <P>It is important that we should have contented teachers.  In the past we have had some disputes and discontented teachers.  Unless your heart is in whatever type of job you have you will not have the will to work in whatever line you are engaged.  Therefore, I believe the Minister has done a very wise thing in setting up this Council of Education.  Glancing over the names of the members, I feel that these people will, in their judgment and wisdom, recognise the genuine grievances whether of the teachers as a whole, or of individual teachers.  I think it is a good thing that teachers' grievances can be rectified through the Council of Education.  I think the setting up of this council is a wise step to take, because it will relieve the Minister of many things in the inner working of the Department which possibly he may not have time to concentrate his attention upon.  I think it is a very good thing to have somebody in an advisory capacity on whom he can rely for information on these things.  I have no doubt that these people will advise without fear of being contradicted if they believe they are right and without fear of being criticised for having the courage of their convictions in saying what they think and what they believe to be right, whether it is a popular or an unpopular thing to say.  That is their function, because this council is being set up to be helpful in regard to the promotion of education.</P>
    <P>We have heard a good deal about the strides we have made in this country in the past and the strides we are now making so far as education is concerned. I happen to come in touch with a few people from time to time who have quite a different opinion. Much as they would like to throw bouquets at any particular Department, which is the popular thing to do, they regret that they cannot throw them so far as the general education of the children of the present day is concerned. Many people feel that, instead of making strides ahead so far as education <Col N="934" /> is concerned this country has gone backwards and that our children are not now as well educated to earn a livelihood and to face the world as they were heretofore when they had not many of the present-day advantages. I think that many people, if they analyse the truth of that statement, will have to say to themselves, whether they like it or not, that it is a true one.  We hear a lot of talk about things that are popular, but we should deal with facts.  One fact is that we have children leaving school at the age of 14 and we are told that it would cost too much money to keep them on for another year.  The years between 14 and 16 are most important for a boy or girl who is looking towards some future employment.  If they could be kept at school for at least another year, the money which that would cost would be very well spent.  We should make that compulsory, because at that time they are beginning to realise that they are fitting themselves for an opportunity to earn a livelihood when they come to the age of 15 or 16.  Before they are 14, children have not got sense to realise their future responsibilities. If they were kept at school between 14 and 15 years of age, they would realise then and set their minds to training themselves, but we have been told that it would cost too much money.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, a lot of money has been wasted upon the teaching of compulsory Irish.  That may be an unpopular thing to say, but it is a sensible thing so far as the people in the country districts and the people generally are concerned.  It is all very fine to make suggestions and to have high ideals, but to put them into practice is not so easy if you have not a thorough knowledge of the language which the general public understand and which they wish you to speak when making application for a job.  I have no objection whatever to the teaching of Irish, but I think that it can be overdone.  Many teachers and managers of secondary and national schools have said to me that it would be much more satisfactory if it could be taught as a language as it was before, when people learned it because it was their native <Col N="935" /> language.  It was an ordinary subject which you learned, not because you were forced and because it was pushed down your neck and was something you had to go through with the fear of failing the examination at the end of the year, and possibly failing the entrance examination for some profession simply because you failed in Irish, which meant that you took an instant dislike to the language without knowing the reason.  It would be a much better idea to let people learn it because it is their native language and because they should love it.  It should not mean failure in an examination simply because you are not a brilliant Irish speaker because, in the main, the Irish is left behind when the job is got.</P>
    <P>It is time for plain talking and for reasonable people, in the hurry and bustle of 1950, to get down to brass tacks and to understand that everybody has to make a living, and that it does not make sense simply to talk a lot about the language and to have a lot of money spent on it while our schools need heating and re-equipment, while our teachers, perhaps, have various grievances, while our children are not educated as they used to be and while, generally, the public are discontented and disgusted. That is what I think about the whole situation.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to consider relaxing to some degree this business of failing a candidate in every examination if he does not know his subject through the medium of Irish, because in my time it gave everyone enough to do the subjects in the language which they knew.  It gave me my best to learn anything I did learn in the language I knew and to pass an examination in that language.  It is very hard for a child who has not got Irish in the home environment to learn mathematics or other subjects through the medium of Irish and to have the same success as he would have if he was encouraged to do it without dislike or dread when June comes for the final leaving examination.  I think it is unjust to the schools who have not <Col N="936" /> got 100 per cent.  Irish that they should be penalised and other schools put in a prior position to those who are equally good in their own way.</P>
    <P>There is the question of the technical schools.  A great deal of money has been spent in the last few years on these magnificent buildings, but I am inclined to think, and I think many people are inclined to think, that many of the advantages of these technical schools are not availed of.  Very few seem to avail of the magnificent opportunities now afforded to them by the State for which, long ago, people had to pay.  I hope the Minister will review this matter.  I hope the Council of Education will review it also and see if something could be done to make it compulsory that children should attend for a certain number of hours each week at the technical school in their particular district, wherever they are lucky enough to have one.  We have always been told that a girl's place is in the home.  How few young girls at the present time know how to do anything in the home, although within a mile or two of their own home there may be a technical school that will teach them, free of charge, how to do things and the best way to equip themselves for their future life. The same applies to boys.  Many crafts can be taught in these schools, free of charge, and a boy can make himself proficient in such things as carpentry or other crafts that would be very helpful to him in future life.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to make a special note of this point and to consider, quite apart from the school-leaving age being raised by, say, another year, whether it should be made compulsory that every boy and girl should attend for a few hours at least each week at the ordinary technical school, which very often is within reach of their homes.  It is not too much to expect a boy or girl to have some sort of finish at the age of 16. Something ought to be done by the State in regard to this matter that has been so neglected in the past.  In 1950 Ireland can wake up to the fact that, with the advantages we have now, compared with long ago, our boys and girls should be made wise.  They <Col N="937" /> should be compelled to attend the technical schools for a few hours each week just as the child is compelled to attend school.</P>

      <P>Chuir mé an-spéis sa chaint a rinne an cainteoir deireannach i dtaobh caighdeán oideachais.  Dúirt sí nach bhfuil an caighdeán chomh hard agus a bhí sé sa tsean-am.  B'fhéidir nach bhfuil sé chomh hard.  Thug sí mar údar tuige a bheadh sé mar sin, an Ghaeilge a bheith a húsáid sna scoileanna.  Ba mhaith liom mheabhrú do na daoine atá ag cleamhsán faoin chaighdeán gan a bheith chomh hard agus ba chóir, go bhfuil daoine i dtíortha eile ag déanamh an chlamhsáin chéanna.</P>
      <P>Le linn an Chogaidh, casadh bean Shasanach liom féin.  Tá mé ag ceapadh gur innis mé an scéal seo cheana ar an Meastachán seo.  Tá sé meabhraithe arís dom mar gheall ar an gcaint an a rinne an cainteoir deireannach.  Ba mháistreás scoile a bhí sa mnaoi sin a casadh liom. Dúirt sí liom gurbh é a tuairim daingean go raibh an caighdeán oideachais sa tír seo rud éigin níos airde ná mar atá sé i Sasana.  Dúirt mé féin léi go raibh malairt tuairime ag daoine áirithe sa tír seo agus go raibh siad ag fáil locht ar mhúineadh na Gaeilge mar gheall air. &ldquo;Shiúl mé an tír thré chéile,&rdquo; adeir sí, &ldquo;agus tá mé lán-chinnte de go bhfuil cailíní na hÉireann níos oilte ná cailíní den aois chéanna i Sasana.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Má tá meath ar bith ar oideachas sa tír seo, ba cheart go mbeadh na cainteoirí atá ad iarraidh an locht d'fhágáil ar mhúineadh na Gaeilge, smaoineadh níos dóimhne a dhéanamh ar an gceist agus, má dhéanann siad san, tuigfidh siad, pé ar bith meath atá ar an nGaeilge, gurb iad na rudaí céanna is údar le meath na Gaeilge agus is údar le meath an oideachais i gcoitinne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Níl sé fíor a rá go raibh na daoine níos oilte fadó.  Ar ndóigh bfhéidir go bhfuil scéal fé leith sa dáil cheantar a bhfuil mise mar Theachta Dáil dhó ach féadfaidh mé a rá anois nach bhfuil an oiread daoine a fuair scolaíocht le deich mbliana fichead anuas gan a bheith i ndon litir a scríobhadh nó a léamh <Col N="938" /> agus a bhí.  Bhí i bhfad Éireann níos mó ann gan eolas ar bith acu ar scríobhadh i nGaeilge nó i mBéarla.  Tá rud amháin sa tír seo nach raibh ann cheana, is é sin, go bhfuil formhór na ndaltaí scoile a bhí ar scoil le scór blian anuas i ndon an Béarla agus an Ghaeilge a scríobhadh.  Luíonn sé le réasún ar ndóigh nach mbeadh muinntir na Galltachta i ndon an Ghaeilge a scríobhadh chomh maith le muinntir na Gaeltachta agus <i>vice versa</i> ach san am chéanna tá an dá dhream ann agus an ceangal sin eatarthu anois nach raibh eatarthu ariamh cheana.  Dá mbeadh féin-rialtas ag an tír seo&mdash;im thuairimse ar aon chuma&mdash;agus cúrsaí oideachais faoi stiúrú agus faoi smacht mhuintir na hÉireann deich mbliana fichead nó dhá scór blian ó shoin agus an deis oideachais ag na daoine an t-ám úd atá acu anois, tá mé lán-chinnte go mbeadh an Ghaeilge leath-shábháilte anois.</P>
    <P>Ar ndóigh is fíor go mbíonn an saol nua ag cur isteach ar chúrsaí na Gaeilge chomh maith le cúrsaí oideachais i gcoitinne.  Tá fhios agamn nuair a bhíonn tarramgtí eile ag chur isteach ar dhaoine óga nach mbíonn dúil acu sa léann.  Ní maith leis an aos óg&mdash;agus níor mhaith leo ariamh&mdash;a bheith sáite sna leabhra, sáite sa staidéar, agus caitheamh aimsire nó siamsa le fáil acu. Pé ar bith rud eile is féidir a rá faoi, tá an saol níos siamsúla anois ná mar a bhí ariamh.  Ní féidir a rá ámh, go bhfuil múineadh na Gaeilge ag cur isteach ar an oideachas.  Má tá fonn ar dhalta an Gheilge a d'fhoghlaim beidh fonn air Béarla agus áireamh agus na hábhair eile a d'fhoghlaim agus mura bhfuil fonn air an Ghaeilge d'fhoghlaim ní bheidh fonn air aon cheo eile d'fhoghlaim.  Tá fhios againn ón am a rabhamar féin ar scoil nach mórán fonn a bhíos ar an aos óg foghlaim ar bith a thógáil.</P>
    <P>Rinneadh tagairt anseo don Chomhairle Oideachais agus b'fhéidir nach bhfuilim ar an intinn chéanna agus a bhí bliain ó shoin nuair a mhol mé don Aire gan a leithide a chur ar bun ar chor ar bith.  Níl fhios agam cén tuairim atá agam anois, ach tá rud amháin brúite isteach im intinn, is é sin, go bhfuil gluaiseacht na Gaeilge laidir sa tír i gcónaí pé ar bith rud is féidir a rá faoi dhul chun cinn na <Col N="939" /> Gaeilge féin.  Ní gá dhom a rá go raibh fonn ar dhaoine bheith ag moladh don Aire, Comhairle Oideachais a chur ar bun mar gurb é an rud a bhí thiar in a n-intinn go gcuirfeadh an chomhairle deireadh leis an rud ar a dtugtar &ldquo;compulsory Irish.&rdquo;  Tá sé cruthaithe anois, tá mé ag ceapadh, ón taobh sin den scéal ar chuma ar bith, go bhfuil an chomhairle neamh-urchóideach, agus ní féidir linn tuairim ar bith eile a bheith againn faoi mar níor shuíodar fós.  Dúirt an tAire nach mbeidh feidhmeanna le comhlíonadh ag an dream seo ach go mbeidh siad ag plé le tuairimí agus le teoiricí. Ní dona an rud é sin ar ndóigh mar tá an tír seo lán le tuairimí agus le teoiricí agus is maith an rud go bhfuil áit éigin ann chun na tuairimí agus na teoiricí a chur á bplé agus meas ceart a thabhairt orthu.  Ar ndóigh níl an oiread sin cainte anois ar Chomhairle Oideachais agus a bhí sul ar cuireadh ar bun é.  Cruthaíonn sé sin go bhfuil gluaiseacht na Gaeilge, mar atá ráite sa tuarascáil a chuir Comdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge amach, chomh láidir agus a bhí sé nuair a cuireadh Conradh na Gaeilge ar bun i dtosach báire.</P>
    <P>Mhol mé cheana, sul ar tháinig an Rialtas seo isteach, anuraidh agus arú anuraidh, agus tá mé ag dul á mholadh anois&mdash;agus feicim freisim é i dtuarascáil na Comdhála&mdash;gur ceart níos mó aire a thabhairt do labhairt na Gaeilge sna scoileanna.  Ar ndóigh ní hé sin mo thuairimse féin amháin. Dúirt múinteoirí scoile liom i scoileanna taoibh amuigh den bhfíor-Ghaeltacht go bhfuil caighdeán réasúnta ann maidir le scríobhadh agus le léamh na Gaeilge ach go bhfuil na daltaí an-lag ar fad nuair a thagann sé chomh fada le comhrá ná caint a dhéanamh. Chuir mé an-spéis sa rud arís nuair a léigh mé an tuarascáil a chuír Comhdáil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge amach.  Ar na riachtanaisí is práinní cuireann siad an ceann sin, gur ceart tuílle aire a thabhairt do labhairt na Gaeilge. Ní gá dhomsa níos mó a rá faoi sin. Dúirt an Teachta Ó Briain, an Teachta Ó Ruairc agus daoine eile é agus is cosúil, nuair atá go leor daoine ar an tuairim chéanna, gur ceart rud éigin a dhéanamh faoi.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="940" /> Maidir le ceist seo na Gaeilge caithfidh mé rud éigin a rá anseo faoi intínn agus faoi aigne mhuintír na Fíor-Ghaeltachta.  Tá mé féin ag ceapadh go bhfuil an iomarca cainte á dhéanamh faoin nGaeltacht bhocht. Déanann daoine caint&mdash;agus admhaím go bhfuil a gcroí san áit cheart agus go bhfuil siad dílis agus dúthrachtach&mdash;ach ní féidir bheith ar aon tuairim eile ach go bhfuil siad adiarraidh áit faoi leith a dhéanamh den Ghaeltacht ar nós na reservations i Meiriceá a bhíos ag na hIndiaigh Dhearga.  Tá mé féin ag ceapadh go bhfuil sé sin gan céill, gan réasún, gan tuiscint, gan breithiúnas.  Is minic a chuir mé ceist ag cruinnithe sa bhFíor-Gaeltacht ar mhuintír na Gaeltachta, agus nuair adeirim go bhfuil daoine taoibh amuigh agus faitíos orthu go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht ag meath agus an Ghaeilge ag fáil bháis ann is é an freagra a fhághaim go mbeadh fonn ar mhuintir na Fíor-Ghaeltachta an Ghaeilge a choinneáil beo i gcónaí an fhaid is a bheadh fhios acu agus go mbeadh siad cinnte go bhfuil muintir na hÉireann fré chéile á iarraidh, ach má brúitear isteach in intinn na Fíor-Ghaeltachta nach bhfuil muintir na hÉireann ach ag mugadhmagadh faoi cheist na Gaeilge, ón lá sin amach tréigfidh muintir na Fíor-Ghaeltachta an Ghaeilge.  Is minic adúradar liom gur mó an sondas a chuirfidís i scéala ar bith a thaispeánfadh dhóibh go raibh na daoine taoibh amuigh, i gcathair na Gaillimhe in Áth Luain, i mBaile Átha Cliath agus sna cathracha eile, ag cur níos mó spéise sa teangain, nó dá bhfeicfeadh siad iad ag dul isteach in a sluaite in amharclainn ag breathnú ar scannáin i nGaeilge nó ag dul ina sluaite ag breathnú ar dhrámaí i nGaeilge agus mar sin de.</P>
    <P>Dar ndóigh is í an teanga a bheas ag an náisiún an teanga a bheas ag muintir na Gaeltachta sa deire agus cé thógfadh ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta é sin?</P>
    <P>Sé an tseirbhís is mó a dhéanfas leas do mhuintir na Gaeltachta ina dtír féin ar chuma ar bith, seirbhís an oideachais.  Tá níos mó maitheasa agus leasa déanta do mhuintír na Gaeltachta ag na scoláireachtaí agus rudaí den tsórt sin ná aon cheo eile. <Col N="941" /> As sin, tagann an smaoineamh eile gur ceart, má tá buanaíocht ar bith le bheith sna seirbhísí atá á gcur i leataoibh ar mhaithe leis an nGaeltacht, tuille airgid a sholáthar le tuille oideachais a thabhairt doibh.  Níl mé a rá gur ceart iad go leír a chur isteach sna Ollscoileanna nó na meánscoileanna. Tá gá, agus b'fhéidir gá géar, le scoileanna gairm-oideachais a sholáthar.  Tá trí cinn molta le tamall anuas do Ghaeltacht Chonamara&mdash;an Chloch Bhreac, an Cnoc agus Oileán Arann. Ba mhaith liom iad sin a fheiceáil ar bun sul a thiocfas an Meastachán seo arís os comhair na Dála.  Ar nós cuid eile den tír, níl gach duine óg sa Ghaeltacht in ndon an buntáiste is fearr a bhaint as an meánscolaíocht nó an ollscolaíocht, agus ba cóir, má támaid i ndáríoibh i dtaobh sábháil na Gaeltachta aon rud is féidir a dhéanamh chun tuille seirbhísí den tsórt sin a chur ar fáil dóibh.</P>
    <P>Rinne an Teachta Ó Briain tagairt do scéal na Gaeilge agus don chló agus don litriú.  Ní dóigh liom gur gâ bheith ag déanamh scéal mór den chló nó den litríocht, agus is é mo thuirim féin go bhfuil sé thar am an litriú nua a chur i gcion.  Is cuimhin liom nuair a thosnaigh mé ag léamh na Gaeilge gur beag nár scanradh mé nuair a chonaic mé na focla agus ba míorúilt é dá bhfédfainn na fuaimeanna adúirt an máistir linn a bhaint as an lítriú a bhí ar na focla.  Tá mé ag ceapadh go bhfuil na daoine atá ag tosnú ar léamh na Gaeilge anois ar an tuairim chéanna. B'fhéidir go dtabharfadh an tAire agus é ag cur deireadh leis an díospóireacht seo eolas éigín dúinn faoin bhfoclóir nua mar ní dóigh liom go ndearna sé tagarit ar bith dó sa ráiteas a thug sé dúinn.  Ba mhaith liom freisin a fháil amach cén litriú a bheas ann.  Tá mé ag ceapadh, os rud é go bhfuil glactha leis an litriú nua, gur ceart go mbeadh an litriú sin sa bhfoclóir nua sin.</P>
    <P>Níor mhaith liom aon cheist achrannach a thabhairt isteach sa díospóireacht seo mar faoi na ceisteanna móra is dócha go bhfuilmuid uilig ar aon intinn. Is trua go mbreathnaítear ar an Meastachán seo mar Mheastachán na Gaeilge.  Ní dóigh liom gur ceart é sin.  Tá sé sin ar nós an rud a rinneadh mar gheall ar &ldquo;Seachtain na Gaeilge.&rdquo;<Col N="942" /> Tá daoine ag clamhsán mar gheall ar sheachtain amháin Gaeilge sa mbliain agus is dógh liom gur cosúil an clamhsán sin le breathnú ar an Meastacán seo mar an t-aon mheastachán amháin a bhaineas le sábháil na Gaeilge.  Ba cheart go mbeadh baint leis an gceist sin ag gach aon mheastachán chomh maith leis an Meastachán seo.  Níl aon dhream faoi leith sa Tigh ar aon taobh ciontach sa rud sin</P>
    <P>Mar dúras, níl mé ad iarraidh aon cheist achrannach a thabhairt isteach sa díospóireacht, ach ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh don choiste a scrúdaigh ceist tuarastal na múinteoirí, Coiste Roe.  Ní fheicim aon difríocht idir an méid a dhein an Rialtas seo agus an rud a rinne sean-Rialtas Fianna Fáil ach amháin gur chuir an Rialtas seo coiste ar bun, gí go raibh sé socraithe roimh ré cad é an méid airgid a soláthrófaí do na múinteoirí. Marach go raibh an scéal amhlaidh, ní dóigh liom go glacfaí le Minority Report.  B'fhearr i bhfad, agus bheadh sé i bhfad níos sásúla sa deireadh dá n-abróidh an tAire leis na múinteoirí, leis an I.N.T.O.: &ldquo;Tá an oiread seo airgid le fáil agaibh agus roinnigí sibh féin é.&rdquo;  Sin é an rud a dhein Fianna Fáil agus gí nach raibh na múinteoirí sásta, tá mé ag ceapadh nár fágadh chomh dían iad agus a fágadh an t-am seo iad.</P>
    <P>Tá muid uilig ar aon intinn i dtaobh na múinteoirí.  Ba mhaith le gach dream sa tír seo go mbeadh na múinteoirí sásta, mar, sa deireadh thiar thall, támuid ag brath ar na múinteoirí agus ar na bunscoileanna le bunchloch na Gaeilge a shábháil.  Tá fhios againn go bhfuil dualgaisí ar an Aire agus ar an Rialtas i dtaobh airgid phoiblí agus an bealach ar ceart é a chaitheamh agus nach bhfuil iallach ar bith orthu glacadh le moladh Ó choiste ar bith.  San am céanna, is dócha go bhfuil fhios ag an Aire anois gur chuir sé dallamullóg ar na múinteoirí, gur chuir sé amú iad, nuair a chuir sé an coiste sin ar bun.  Tá súir agam nach ndéanfar aon bhotún mal sin aon uair eile, mar ní dóigh liom gur ceart dream mar na múinteoirí a chur amú mar sin.  Is iad an dream si tábhachtaí atá in ár measc iad agus caithfimid iad a shásamh chomh maith <Col N="943" /> is fhéadfaimid.  Mar adúirt mé, tá muid ag brath orthu leis an nGaeilge a shábháil.  Tá muid ag brath ar shábháil na Gaeilge agus tá mé ar aon intinn leis an gcainteoir deireannach i dtaobh airgid a chaitheamh ar na rudaí tábhachtacha. Muna bhfuil duine ar thaobh sábháil na Gaeilge, tá mé ar aon intinn leis nó léi gur airgead amú é pingin ar bith a chaitheamh ar mhúineadh na Gaeilge.  Má chreideann duíne go bhfuil muid ar nós cuma liom i dtaobh sábháil na Gaeilge, ní cheart pingin a chaitheamh, ach má chreideann go mbeadh anam na tíre caillte dá gcailltí an Ghaeilge, ansin ní féidir a rá go bhfuil leath ár ndóthain á chaitheamh ar shábháil na Gaeilge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather interesting to find so many Deputies anxious to speak on this Vote for the advancement of education, since when speaking outside I am afraid we are all rather guilty in that, as a rule, we seldom refer to this question.  After all, it may be regarded as one of the most important with which the country has to deal.  It has been truly said that the progress of a nation depends on the education of its people, so while it does not appear to be a popular subject with the ordinary electorate, there are, of course, very many people who are most anxious for the proper education of their children.  Therefore, it is only right that all the facilities possible should be afforded to the children of the nation so that they will grow up to be good citizens.  This is a question that should not be dealt with from a political point of view, and I am very glad to see that during the whole course of the debate it has been dealt with as one on which all Parties are agreed that we should join together to try and do our best for the welfare of our people in the matter of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Giles who, when paying a tribute to the present Minister, referred also to the present Leader of the Opposition.  In all fairness, I, too, would like at this stage to mention in passing that during the short time he was Minister for Education the teachers were satisfied that <Col N="944" /> he was one of the best that we had up to that period.  He was certainly better than the one he replaced and who afterwards succeeded him.  We often wondered, as teachers, why it was that the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party did not control more the activities, or perhaps the inactivities, of the Minister whom he appointed.</P>
    <P>When dealing with education, we must think first of all of the child and what can be done in order that he may receive the best possible education that the State can afford.  In order that that may be done, we must think of those responsible for his education and see that everything possible is done to have a well-trained, fullyequipped and contented body of teachers.  We must see that the schools in which the child is taught are some of the best built, best equipped and most comfortable buildings in the State.  So far as the teacher is concerned, we must make sure that the conditions under which he works and the system of inspection which sees that he does his work efficiently are such as to give him thorough confidence.</P>
    <P>As regards the training of the teacher, I do not think that the best possible method is being employed. At the present time the vast majority of teachers have to enter a preparatory school, where they are segregated more or less from the rest of the community for a period of four years. After that they have to spend two years in a training college.  I forget when that system was introduced, but I hold that a teacher, to be fully qualified, should be able to carry out his duties not only on behalf of the children but from the social point of view.  It would be a much better system if the candidate for the profession of teacher would first of all proceed to the university, where he would take out a degree, B.A., or B.Sc., or something like that, just as the students there have to do for entrance to other professions&mdash;or teaching could be made a profession there.  Having obtained that degree, if he or she wished to enter the teaching profession, there would be two years in a training <Col N="945" /> college, not perhaps, as at present, cut away, but ensuring that they would gain more experience in the various types of school in the vicinity of the college.  Then those teachers would enter the profession fully equipped, certainly feeling they had no inferiority complex and that they could do their part for the welfare of <Col N="946" /> the children they had to teach.  I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; the Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adojurned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 25th April, 1950.</P>
