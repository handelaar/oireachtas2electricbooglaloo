      <P>There are over 90 questions on the Order Paper for to-day and over 100 for to-morrow. To expedite matters perhaps we could get the co-operation of Deputies in not putting supplementaries which are unnecessary or which are not to the point.  We may go past four o'clock in order to dispose of all the questions which have been put down for to-day.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to evicted tenants as defined in Section 2 (d) Irish Land Act, 1903, and Section 31 (i) (c), Land Act, 1923.  It is the practice to deal with claims by evicted tenants, or their representatives, according as land becomes available in the district in which the evictions are stated to have taken place.  The vast majority of claims have been disposed of and any authentic and eligible cases still outstanding will receive such favourable consideration as the Land Commission may find possible.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 31 and 32 together:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Miss H.H. Cooke was an applicant for the position of sub-postmistress at Baltinglass post office.  She had been employed as assistant by the former sub-postmistress for the past 14 years. During that period there has been no serious complaint regarding the conduct of the office.</P>
      <P>Mr. Farrell was considered the most suitable candidate on a general assessment of his qualifications.  It would be contrary to practice to give a detailed evaluation of the qualifications of the candidates on the lines requested by the Deputy.</P>

Is he aware that Miss Cooke has had 14 years of satisfactory service in that post office and does he think it is fair to deprive a person of the benefit of 14 years' satisfactory service to the public, to the Department and to the community?  Further, does he think it is fair to appoint to that position a person who has no previous experience whatever, who holds a licensed premises and other business of a widespread nature, including land?</P>

      <P>At the end of November, 1950, the balance to credit in the stabilisation fund was £17,525 0s. 9d. Withdrawals from the fund in the years 1948, 1949 and 1950 were:&mdash;1948, nil; 1949, nil; 1950, £18,598 17s. 9d.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the withdrawals in 1950 was to enable the export price of bacon to be kept at the same level as in 1949, and thus maintain prices received by pig producers.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy's supplementary is somewhat delphic, perhaps I might help him by reading over for <Col N="1739" /> him the statement that was issued. This is it:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The general suspension of the prohibition on export of fat and store pigs will be ended as on Tuesday, 28th November, at midnight.  Pigs presented for export after that hour will not be allowed to proceed.</P>
      <P>The decision to permit export of fat and store pigs was taken in order to avert a threatened reduction in the price payable by curers for pigs of suitable weights and it has effectively operated to this end.  There is no likelihood of the price of pigs falling below 190/- to 200/- per cwt. in the future and farmers should confidently expand production in anticipation of a permanent and remunerative market for maximum production, based on home-grown barley and potatoes and skimmed milk together with such supplies of imported maize as production may require.  There is no prospect of any scarcity of feeding stuffs to meet the demand, however production may expand.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Chinn Chomhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>With regard to the &ldquo;three-club plan&rdquo;, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to his question of the 15th November, 1950, on this subject.  This plan is designed to facilitate groups of farmers organised under the aegis of Muintir na Tíre, Macra na Feirme, and similar bodies, who apply through their national executives for the services of a technical adviser to advise on such projects of agricultural production as the groups may select.  Since the date of that reply, three advisers have taken up duty and others will be appointed as required.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;parish plan&rdquo;, to which I referred in this House on the 30th November, is intended to make available to every group of three parishes in the congested districts a parish agent whose duty it will be to help farmers to get out of their holdings a better livelihood for themselves and their families.  As I said on that occasion, the parish agents will be appointed from the ranks of existing agricultural overseers and assistant agricultural overseers and through selection based on competition from other categories of Department of Agriculture personnel.  I would, of course, welcome the co-operation of Muintir na Tíre, Macra na Feirme, and similar bodies interested in the betterment of farming conditions, in the establishment of parish councils.  Final details of the plan are at present being worked out by my Department and I hope to be in a position to publish full particulars in a short time.</P>

      <P>No.  I am satisfied that the interests of rural workers receive <Col N="1746" /> special consideration under the flour and bread rationing regulations.</P>
      <P>Under these regulations additional allowances of flour and bread are granted to turf workers and to agricultural workers residing not less than two miles from their place of employment. In addition supplementary allowances are granted during the harvest period to <i>bona fide</i> harvest workers.  In the 1950 harvest period extra rations were granted to 775,000 applicants during a period of nine weeks ended 13th October, 1950.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that the Minister for Industry and Commerce stated in the Dáil, on November 8th, that transactions on current accounts between this country and the monetary areas of other countries participating in the European Payments Union are estimated to have yielded credit balances of £10.9 million, £2.5 million and £10,000,000 in the years 1947, 1948, and 1949, respectively, and if he will state whether this country, if the Government had decided to participate in the European Payments Union on the same basis as other member countries, would not eventually have been entitled under the provisions of the agreement to receive gold or dollars against similar credit balances arising in the future; and, if so, the reasons for his opinion, expressed in the Dáil on November 29th, that the Government's decision to participate in the European Payments Union only indirectly, as part of the sterling area, does not result in benefit to Great Britain as the representative of the sterling area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McGilligan) Patrick McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the reply received by the Deputy on the 8th November to the question about the balance of payments on current account between this country and the monetary areas of other countries participating in the European Payments Union.  The figures supplied to the Deputy refer to the net balance on current account with all members of the union, including the sterling area, and, as was stated in the <Col N="1747" /> reply, the whole of the balance unaccounted for was treated as current sterling earnings in arriving at the credit balance for the years 1947, 1948 and 1949.  The figures indicate that our surpluses with Great Britain have been large enough in recent years to outweigh our deficits with the rest of the sterling area and with the monetary areas of the countries participating in the European Payments Union.  It is extremely doubtful whether this position will be maintained. The deficit with continental European members has increased this year, while the credit balance in our transactions with the sterling area has dropped considerably.  The indications are, indeed, that we shall have a deficit with the monetary areas of the European Payments Union countries as a whole of several million pounds in 1950.  Countries which incur deficits with the union are liable to be called upon to discharge part of their debt in gold.</P>
      <P>Apart altogether from the unlikelihood that any surpluses with the union would emerge to our credit or, in any event, would be of such cumulative amount as to attract &ldquo;gold&rdquo; payments, I invite the Deputy to refer to the provisions of the European Payments Union Agreement as to the manner, other than payment in gold, by which debts may be discharged by the union.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is due to the fact that we could not demand any payment in gold dollars in any circumstances. If the Deputy will read Article 14 of the Agreement he will see that where our balance is with the sterling area or with England then they can pay us in sterling or with their own currency bought with sterling, but there is no chance of getting gold.</P>

      <P>The percentages requested by the Deputy are as follows:&mdash;1949, (a) 53 per cent., (b) 42 per cent., (c) 5 per cent.; first nine months of 1950: (a) 45 per cent., (b) 49 per cent., (c) 6 per cent.</P>
      <P>In 1949 an exchange of approximately 2,000 tons of Irish oats for an equivalent value of United States maize from Western Germany was approved (a) to dispose of surplus oats, and (b) to acquire maize without dollar expenditure.</P>
      <P>In a few cases payments for exports to one of the European Payments Union countries was accepted in the currency of another for reasons of commercial convenience, and as there was no loss of exchange involved, the total value of such exemptions was small.  In a few cases also payments for parcel post exports to United States personnel in Europe was accepted in dollars.  The total value was insignificant.</P>

      <P>Three State cars were sent to Strasbourg for the use of members of the Irish delegation and secretariat to the assembly and to the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe for the 1949 session and again for the first session in 1950.</P>
      <P>The cars in question were Garda Síochána cars and Garda drivers went with them on each occasion.  In 1949 they were absent from Ireland from the 4th August to the 13th September. In 1950 the cars left Ireland on the 29th July.  One returned on the 19th August, another on the 26th August and the third on the 29th August.  The different dates of return are due to the fact that not all the assembly's activities concluded on the one date.</P>
      <P>The cost of the transport of cars from Ireland to Strasbourg and back amounted to £328 for the two years and the total cost to public funds of transport, insurance, drivers' expenses, etc. amounted to £1,149.  Four members of the Irish delegation are entitled to the use of cars at public expense so that it should not be assumed that the sum mentioned represents additional expenditure.</P>
      <P>I should add that the arrangement to send State cars was more economical (and more convenient) than to hire cars in Strasbourg.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the total additional capital grant which the Electricity Supply Board would require to date to supplement the grants made on the basis of 50 per cent. of the cost of constructing the rural electrification network to offset the deficiency in the revenue from final charges; the estimated loss to the board during the present financial year by reason of the delay in revising the basis of the capital grants, the sources from which the board is meeting this loss, and whether any decision has yet been reached by the Government as to the percentage of the network construction cost to be offset by free grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing rate of subsidy of 50 per cent. of the capital cost of rural electrification was necessarily an estimate as there was at that <Col N="1756" /> time no experience of constructing or operating a rural network in this country.  Moreover, since the estimates of the cost of the scheme were framed considerable increases have taken place in the cost of labour and materials.  Furthermore, experience of the economy of the scheme is still very limited, as no area or group of areas has yet had the opportunity to develop its revenue or to stabilise its expenses. It has, therefore, been decided to defer a review of the adequacy of the subsidy until after the end of the year to 31st March, 1952.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that while normally engineers with electrical qualifications are most suitable for work on the rural electrification <Col N="1757" /> scheme, the shortage of engineers so qualified has led the board to employ, as the best substitutes available, civil engineers.  Such engineers, however, do not regard work on the rural network as affording them useful experience, and they are therefore inclined to seek employment elsewhere on work more closely associated with civil engineering proper.  In addition to advertising in the Press the advantages of employment in the Electricity Supply Board were explained to final year electrical engineering students of all the Irish universities.  Those interested were asked to present themselves for interview.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that grave discontent exists amongst the tenants of the new cottages in County Dublin due to the high rents and the working of the differential rent system; and, if so, whether he will have examined the possibility of fixing the rent in each case to be at the rate of 10 per cent. of the householder's earnings and have no charge on the family.</P>

      <P>The first part of the Deputy's question was the subject of a reply by me to a similar question on the 23rd November, in the course of which I pointed out that the present system of graded rents in County Dublin is subject to review by the county council at the end of the present year.  As regards the second part of the question, the introduction of a new system or the amendment of the existing one is a matter for the county council in the first instance.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister <Col N="1765" /> give any direction in this matter at all?  We have here a Minister representing the Government and the Labour Party but does the Minister consider it fair that a road worker who got an increase of 5/- a week in County Dublin should have 3/6 of that 5/- taken off him by the county council for additional rent?  That is the system of differential rents that is in operation in County Dublin.  I ask the Minister to go into the matter again because people are in a bad way as a result of the manner in which the differential rent system is being operated in the county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want again to assure the Deputy that it is not a differential rent system but a system of graded rents that is in operation in the county. The system, as I have stated, is subject to review by the council at the end of the present year.  It is entirely a matter for the council.  The Minister does not impose a differential rent system or a graded rent system upon them.  It is the local authority themselves who have the decision in the matter.</P>

      <P>To meet the needs of the Laytown and Julianstown districts five cottages are at present in course of construction and provision for the acquisition of sites for a further 38 <Col N="1766" /> cottages was made in a compulsory purchase order made by the Meath County Council this year.  The acquisition of five of those sites was confirmed in a first confirmation order dated the 26th September, 1950, and one site was rejected as unsuitable.  Objections were made to the acquisition of the sites for the remaining 32 cottages and it was necessary therefore to hold public inquiries into the making of the order in so far as it related to those and other opposed sites.  The order as a whole is a very large one, relating to various areas in County Meath and necessitating an extensive series of inspections, and quick decisions on the opposed portions have not therefore been possible.  There will, however, be no avoidable delay in issuing these decisions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Generous grants and subsidies are contributed by the State towards the cost of housing so as to enable local authorities to provide houses at rents within the capacity of the tenants to pay.  It is a matter for the local authorities, in fixing rents, to apply this financial assistance in such a manner as to bring the rents to be <Col N="1767" /> charged to the poorer tenants to levels within their paying capacity.</P>
      <P>I have frequently stressed the need for applying State grants in this manner and the best way in which it can be done is, in my opinion, by the operation of a system of differential or graded rents.  Such a system ensures that not only State assistance but also contributions from the rates are applied where they are most needed.</P>

These complaints have been carefully investigated by one of my inspectors whose reports indicate that the lettings have, on the facts available, been made in accordance with the requirements of the Housing Acts and regulations.

      <P>On a point of order and procedure in the House with regard to the addressing of questions. I addressed questions to the Minister for Local Government and to the Minister for Health in regard to preparations and plans in regard to civil defence and air raid precautions.  I understand that, on the initiative of one of the Departments concerned, one of these questions has been disallowed and that the question to the Minister for Health has been transferred to the Department of Defence.  In connection with these questions, in my submission to the Chair, the Minister for Local Government has responsibility in the matter of civil defence, if only consultative, under Section 29 of the Air Raid Precautions Act, and I submit that the questions which I asked, which were merely to elicit information as to whether any attention was being given to this matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Ceann Comhairle is responsible in that matter.  I was shown the question.  I looked up the Acts.  I do not agree with the Deputy's interpretation.  In Section 20 there is talk of consultation, which the Minister for Defence, who is the responsible Minister under the Air Raid Precautions Act, need not follow. Therefore, the responsibility rests with the Minister for Defence.  Section 29, as far as I can recollect, adumbrates the possible dissolution of a body if it does not do certain things but the primary responsibility, according to Section 2 of the Act, rests with the Minister for Defence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The matters contained in the Supplies and Services <Col N="1776" /> Bill naturally have given rise to a prolonged debate in the House.  I do not intend to travel over the ground which was covered on the last day when this Bill was under discussion.</P>
      <P>I think it is apparent to us all that the cost of living is a very serious matter for the country; it is serious for all sections of our people.  Some sections can, to a certain extent, take steps to alleviate the hardship which rising prices may bring.  The better-off people are in the position that to them the burden is not so severe.  Other sections, particularly organised labour, can take steps should the occasion arise to alleviate the burden of rising prices as it affects them and the value of their real wages.  There is, however, a large section of people who are not in any organisation, who are not in any trade union and who have not much money.  I refer to clerks, small professional people, small earners&mdash;white-collar workers.  It is to them that this is a very real problem, a very real danger.</P>
      <P>Last Thursday I said that while, to a certain extent, the increase may be caused by matters outside the control of the Government, nevertheless it is the duty of the Government primarily, and also of all sections of the people, to lessen, in so far as it is possible to do so, the effect of rising prices at home.  That can only be done by increasing the production of the things we can produce, by stepping up home production and by ensuring that more and more we become less dependent on imported goods.  There are certain articles we must continue to buy, but there are many things a greater production of which we can look forward to at home.  Labourers and employers have a great contribution to make in the direction of solving the burden of rising prices.  The general body of consumers, the white-collar workers who have not any redress, expect from workers and employers an important contribution towards the task of reducing prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has dealt with this matter very capably.  I think he has put the problem before the country in a fair way.  He told us that up to the last four or five months <Col N="1777" /> prices and wages were more or less stabilised, but during September, October and November the tendency towards a price increase became apparent.  That is the situation which must be dealt with now.  That is an approach which must commend itself to the country.  With regard to any further increases, if we are going to take powers under this Bill and if we look forward to a vista of controls such as we had during the emergency&mdash;but I hope far wider and far sterner&mdash;we should start off on this principle, that the prices obtaining last August should be the prices obtaining for all goods unless good reason is shown to the contrary.</P>
    <P>Again, the Government, by its price control system, should freeze all prices at the figures obtaining under normal conditions.  Then, in relation to each commodity, let them have their machinery for fixing new prices, let them have whatever procedure may be devised under this Bill, but the onus should be put on everybody seeking to increase prices beyond the level obtaining two or three months ago to show that costs have increased to such an extent as to entitle them in ordinary justice to a certain margin.  It is only by taking a step of that kind that the Government will ensure a continuance of the confidence of the people in their policy of price fixation.</P>
    <P>There were certain matters dealt with during the debate that I think require some reference now.  The Opposition, in discussing this measure, have behaved in rather an extraordinary manner.  Some years ago it used to be fashionable for Ministers of the then Government, when speaking at dinners and luncheons in different parts of the country, to lament that there was not a strong Opposition in the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass and Deputy de Valera, Senior, who were Ministers at the time, used to make that remark from time to time.  To-day we have as important an economic problem facing this House, the Government and the country as a whole as ever we had, and while it is right to say that the country must expect a lead from the Government <Col N="1778" /> and is getting it, it would not be too much to expect from the Opposition some evidence of what their policy might be in such circumstances.  I think they owe that to their supporters and to the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is well able to look after itself. Deputy Lemass's contribution to this debate was absolutely devoid of any evidence of a policy.  So far as he is concerned apparently, apart from saying that this Government has failed to reduce prices, he has given no evidence of what he or his Party would do if faced with this problem and faced with similar circumstances.  That being so, we are entitled to use our own knowledge of what the Fianna Fáil Party did in the past to imagine what they would do now under similar circumstances. I have no doubt that, if Deputy Killilea's Party were in power, the Deputy would be very strong in convincing the people of his constituency that the Government he was supporting was correct in reimposing and freezing wages and incomes in this country.  Apart from what we know they did before, we can have no indication of what might be the policy of the Opposition in regard to this problem. I think it is worthy of note that the only evidence of concern with regard to this problem of the rise in prices given in this House comes not from the Opposition; they are quite complacent about the matter; they are not concerned about it.  Were it not for the fact that supporting this Government there is the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and other Parties who have their ears very close to the ground, I do not believe that this discussion would be taking place here to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are matters which certainly are worthy of note.  I do not think it is going too far to say that on this important matter the Opposition has evinced no real interest and that it has disclosed no real policy.  It certainly has failed to play the part that an Opposition should play, and to that extent it is regrettable that Fianna <Col N="1779" /> Fáil Ministers used to say that we have not in this country a virile and strong Opposition.  But, since some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies did happen to mention with some feeling of concern one or two price increases which they as individuals deprecated, I should like to refer to these matters.  I heard Deputy Vivion de Valera refer, amongst other increases in food prices, to the fact that the price charged for meat had increased under this Government. I do not want to deal with this in detail, but I think if there is one matter that the ordinary housewife should be thankful to the present Minister for Industry and Commerce about it is the question of meat.  If ever a Minister had to withstand an organised demonstration with regard to an increase in the price of any commodity, the present Minister had to withstand it in connection with meat prices.  A consistent campaign was carried on not merely for one or two months but over a period of two years seeking an increase in the price of meat, and that was successfully withstood by the present Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It comes very poorly from Deputy Vivion de Valera to chide the Minister about an increase in the price of meat after that campaign had been met and defeated by the present Minister.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that the price of meat was increased, I think, by 1d. per lb.  The price was increased shortly after the Government took office.  But Deputy de Valera did not tell us why that increase took place.  It took place because Deputy Lemass, as Minister for Industry and Commerce prior to the 18th February, 1948, had entered into a solemn agreement with the butchers in this country.  He had given them a solemn undertaking in those days that he would, after February, 1948, permit an increase in meat prices by a certain figure.  That undertaking having been given it was honoured by the present Minister after the change of Government, and it was merely honoured because it had been given by the responsible Minister at that time.  It is in those circumstances that the present Minister, the Parliamentary <Col N="1780" /> Secretary and the Government generally are going to be chided by Deputy de Valera with regard to increases in meat prices.  They, surely, are entitled to say, if the Opposition were in power, that that increase at least would have been permitted.  They are further entitled to say that were it not for the action taken by Deputy Lemass that increase might never have been allowed or permitted.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGrath and some other Deputies deprecated an increase in the cost of living as represented by an increase in bus fares and railway fares, and other transport charges.  I wonder if Deputy McGrath was ever in this House after the change of Government took place listening to Deputy Lemass thumping the desk opposite, and asking the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, in view of the insolvent condition of Córas Iompair Éireann, when he was going to permit an increase in transport charges?  Is it not true to say that, if ever a campaign was carried on by the Opposition for an increase in the cost of living, Deputy Lemass carried that campaign on for an increase in transport charges?  He was privy and very privy to the condition of affairs in Córas Iompair Éireann as a former Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He made the case here, time and time again, that this Government should, in the interests of that company, substantially increase transport charges. Again, I think it is true to say that if he had continued to be a Minister, and if his Party had continued to be the Government, such an increase, as has taken place in transport charges, would have taken place at a far earlier date.</P>

      <P>Go back to the West.  You do not know what you are talking about.  We heard that case made here time and time again.  It is hard for us to be patient with the kind of two-timing tactics which we get from the Opposition.  Thirdly, there used to be quite a Tuesday-afternoon wail in this House by Deputy Ó Briain, Deputy Corry and a few other Opposition <Col N="1781" /> Deputies as to when the Minister for Agriculture was going to increase the price of milk to the dairy farmers of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That case was made by these Deputies.  The suggestion was made by Deputy Corry, Deputy Ó Briain and all the rest of them that the dairy farmers were put out of business by this Government as the price of milk was not increased. That is one little tune that is being blown softly on the Fianna Fáil whistle to the farmers of this country.  But, when discussing in this House the big problem of prices, we have Deputy Vivion de Valera talking about the cup of tea that he had for his breakfast and being critical of the fact that this Government was allowing a price for milk which was unfair to the people of the country.  Where is the Fianna Fáil policy in that?  If Deputy Corry and Deputy Ó Briain&mdash;I do not know whether Deputy Allen joined in that particular effort&mdash;but perhaps he did in others&mdash;speaking as Fianna Fáil Deputies and spokesmen of the Opposition, are going to advocate particular prices for particular commodities produced by the farmer, then what is the sense of Fianna Fáil Deputies representing city constituencies suggesting that the prices demanded from them are in some respects unjust and unfair? The milk prices criticised by Deputy Vivion de Valera were Fianna Fáil prices fixed by the Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture.</P>

I do not think there is a Fianna Fáil Deputy from the city in the House now from whom we could get the other side.  Deputy Corry thinks that the prices of milk allowed to the farmers are scandalously low.

      <P>The Opposition evidently thought that on this question of the cost of living it would be all very well if they could make speeches which would only concern the people of Dublin City.  They were quite content in thinking that these particular debates and the speeches that they make here would not be held against them in their own constituencies down the country.  But I want to tell them that they are making a very big mistake if that is their view.  Our people are not fools and they will very quickly catch out any Party in opposition who tries to play two tunes at different times, one to the people of Dublin City and one to the people in the country generally.</P>

      <P>It is the concern of the Government to deal quickly with this problem of rising prices. Generally speaking, leaving aside what I am sure were only jocular references by Fianna Fáil Deputies to food prices, it is perfectly clear to me at least that where essential commodities are concerned, such as the clothes we have to wear and things of that nature, there will be a tendency for prices to increase and that tendency will be quite apparent.  There is a latent danger that certain people will avail of external difficulties, of the rearmament drive in Europe and all over the world, of devaluation and kindred matters to use these difficulties for the purpose of justifying an increase in the prices of the commodities they sell, <Col N="1785" /> even in the case of those commodities already in stock or those that can be manufactured at home.  That happened in the case of blankets last September. I think that tendency will be most apparent in clothing apparel generally.</P>
      <P>I have suggested to the Government that it should freeze prices as from a certain date.  Having done that, I have suggested that the Government should consider in relation to each commodity whether a percentage increase might be justified.  With regard to clothes generally I would suggest that consideration should be given to the possibility of providing &ldquo;utility clothing.&rdquo;  I know that there is a certain public opinion against such clothing. I know there are certain people who think quite <i>bona fide</i> that we should not introduce such clothing here.  I know there are people who would regard the provision of such clothing as unsound and wrong.  It is quite clear, however, that in the next three, four or five months we shall have to face the effects of a 700 per cent. increase in the price of wool with a consequential increase in the cost of textiles generally.  If it is our purpose to cushion the effect of these increases we must provide our wage earners with clothes and footwear at reasonable prices.  I have been told by people engaged in clothing manufacture here that it is quite possible to manufacture with good material at a reasonable cost a utility suit of clothes to sell at a reasonable price; but I have also been told that the trouble lies with regard to clothes generally.  Most firms producing clothes and selling the finished article provide in, for instance, a suit of clothes things which bear far too high a percentage of the cost of the entire suit.  I have been told that it should be possible to provide a simpler type of suit of reasonably good material at a fair price, something on the style of the utility clothing provided elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I foresee that it is in clothing generally that the greatest increase in price will come and that it will most quickly manifest itself in clothing.  I urge upon the Parliamentary Secretary to give consideration to the provision of utility clothing.  If the Government <Col N="1786" /> does consider the question of freezing prices at a particular level from a particular date, then these tribunals and advisory committees envisaged by the Government can be safely charged with the responsibility of sifting and dealing with all applications for an increase in prices above the level actually fixed.  I do not think any step the Government can take under existing international conditions will be effective to prevent some increase in prices, but I do believe that the worst effects of a rise in prices because of external conditions can be avoided by action taken by the Government now.</P>
    <P>With regard to the jeers hurled at us by the Opposition in relation to promises to reduce the cost of living, this Government can take pride in the fact that since it assumed office in February, 1948, being fully conscious of its obligations to the people and realising that the main concern of our people at that time was a fall in the real value of money, and realising that that fall could be dealt with either by an increase in wages and incomes generally or by a reduction in prices, this Government has in the last two and a half years up to August last maintained prices at a stable level despite the fact that wages did increase two or three times in that period.  To that extent the Government succeeded in reducing the cost of living and giving to our people a better return in value for the money they earned.  That situation was achieved by the policy of this Government, by an increase in production generally and by the steps taken by the Government to effect that in the last two and a half years.</P>
    <P>The Government is now faced with an entirely new situation calling for new steps and a new determination. Having listened to the Parliamentary Secretary's speech when introducing this Bill, I know that the gravity of the situation is apparent to the Government. I suggest they should start now on the lines I have indicated and, if they do that, the worst effects of the situation will be avoided here.</P>

      <P>I do not know where Deputy T.F. O'Higgins, Junior, was during the last three weeks while we <Col N="1787" /> were debating this very serious question and making a very considerable contribution to the debate from these benches.  The contrast is rather remarkable.  From the Government Benches no Minister has made any contribution to this debate with the exception of that made by the Parliamentary Secretary, who is in charge of the Bill.  From the Fine Gael Benches only two Deputies&mdash;the two Deputy O'Higgins &mdash;made a contribution to the debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring only to those who spoke while I happened to to be in the House myself.  They made speeches which were very serious contributions to the economics of the whole problem&mdash;and a very difficult subject it is, as everybody appreciates. Deputy O'Higgins made one of his usual points, that there was not a strong Opposition.  The Deputy cannot, I suggest, justify that statement when there is an Opposition that is coherent in its point of view, which has principles, which has a strong discipline and a very definite attitude on important questions of policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The usual cry is raised by Deputy O'Higgins that the Opposition Party have not put forward any policy themselves. That is a very old catch cry. It is not the duty of the Opposition to put forward a policy.  The Opposition is not the Government.  The Opposition is there for the purpose, very definitely, of criticising.  They have not the machinery of Government at their disposal.  They have not got all the economic facts and the files which would render it possible for them to <Col N="1788" /> put forward a policy and deal with all the objections and criticisms of the other side.  It is for the Government to do that and not for the Opposition. However, if the speeches which I have mentioned are carefully read through, quite a number of suggestions will be found in them which will be very valuable to the Government because our attitude all along the line is not to be destructive, but to criticise only where there is a lack of policy, and to be as constructive as we can in the circumstances in which we are placed.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made that it was wrong for us to put the standstill Order into operation during the emergency.  That is a complete misrepresentation of what happened. Wages actually increased on the average by about 60 per cent. during the period of the Fianna Fáil Administration. The volume of employment also increased enormously during that period.  The foundations were laid for a whole industrial policy during the same period.  We did put a standstill Order through which operated both against wages and profits at the time. We were experimenting with the whole system of control of profits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Experimenting&rdquo; is a good word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>We were experimenting, but nothing has been done since.  I might say that Deputy Larkin misrepresented us on that question, because we did establish an index figure which was not anything of the nature that he represented it to be.  It was an experiment to carry us over a period and at the time we went out of office we actually had the Prices and Efficiency Bill ready to enact, which I think Deputy Larkin supported at the time, but it has not been put into operation yet.  Then he challenged us for not having done anything, ignoring the obvious fact that we have been in opposition ever since and have had no power to do anything.  It is for Deputy Larkin now to insist on the enforcement of the Prices and Efficiency Bill and on any other measure which may effectively control or help to control prices.  Complete control has not been achieved in any other country but we <Col N="1789" /> can only hope to arrive at some measure of control.  Our quarrel with the present Government is that they started off by saying that this problem could be easily dealt with and that the cost of living could easily be kept down.  They got into office on that mandate and, while they have been in office, they have done absolutely nothing.  How they are going to do it is a question for them.  If they are going to reduce the cost of living by 30 per cent., as they promised, they will have to increase subsidies by £30,000,000 a year.  Without doing anything to reduce the cost of living, they have already increased taxation by £12,000,000.  Of course that increase is again reflected in the cost of living and especially in the costs which have to be paid by the farmers.  A reaction has therefore taken place in farmers' prices.  We tried to impose a standstill Order to prevent costs rising.  Now costs have risen and you cannot easily fix prices.  You cannot freeze prices because, if you do freeze prices, you will have to freeze wages as well.  Does Deputy Larkin suggest that one can be done without the other?</P>

Deputy O'Higgins mentioned the increased cost of transport as being one of the causes for the increase in the cost of living.  Of course it is, but Deputy Lemass's point was that if you had an increase in the beginning in transport costs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is one thing that stands out clear and that is that we stabilised the prices of tea, bread, sugar, flour.  We did it by means of a subsidy.

You will have to stick to the Fianna Fáil policy if you intend to stabilise prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The index figure has been knocked &ldquo;bawways&rdquo; because of the double price system which you have instituted for essential commodities. Workers who work hard have big appetites, and they consume a great deal more sugar, tea, flour and bread than an ordinary person.  They have, therefore, to buy more than they are allowed on the ration.  It is these workers who are paying the blackmarket prices and not rich people who can make up for the shortage in the ration by buying other commodities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  We had a general price for all bread, tea, sugar and so on.  It was you who made the differentiation.  In conclusion, I would like to say that the Fianna Fáil Party have always, both in Government and out of Government, had the greatest concern for this question of the cost of living because it has the most cruel influence in the economic life of the country; it is the most permeating; it affects the weaker classes of the community. Organised labour is able to stand up to it but unorganised labour, the white collar workers and the weaker elements in the community, suffer far more from the effects of a rise in the cost of living than anybody else.  It has a general disturbing effect upon the whole economic fabric of the country.  For that reason it was a constant headache and source of thought to our Government when we were in power.  Our main quarrel with the present Government is the casual way in which they have faced up to the problem and the official statements in which they have tried to mislead the people to believe that there has not been a rise in the cost of living when every housewife in the country could tell you the contrary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>As a preamble to what I am about to say on the Supplies and Services Bill, I should like to give the Parliamentary Secretary an exhortation that was given at one time by a famous French general, the English translation of which is &ldquo;They shall not pass&rdquo;.  My version would be &ldquo;They shall not increase&rdquo;.  Whatever ideas may be put forward in this House, whether they are constructive or destructive, I believe that delaying action is a very serious matter at the moment for the purchasing and consuming public.  While we are debating the best methods, under legislative authority, to combat the actions of the parasites and leeches of commerce, trades, or interests, the Parliamentary Secretary, who is acting at present for the Minister for Industry and Commerce, should use the power, which I <Col N="1792" /> believe is at his disposal, of imposing a standstill Order on increases.</P>
      <P>Everybody realises that criticising each other's contribution or having little knocks at each other in this House will not improve the situation for the people we represent.  I should like to know how long it will be before this Bill comes into operation and how long it will be before the machinery which it creates will become operative and will produce results.  In the meantime, what will happen?  We can only judge by past experience.  In the past few months the price of goods has been stepping up by practically 100 per cent. At the moment the public that we represent, the consuming and purchasing public, have their backs to the wall.  That applies in particular to the poorer section of the community.  I would exhort the Parliamentary Secretary to take immediate steps to see that those people who cannot retreat further are not annihilated.</P>
      <P>This Bill, undoubtedly, is overdue. Some of us who live in rural Ireland and who probably, from time to time, might not be taken too seriously by the intellectuals of all Parties, have been telling stories of what has been happening in rural Ireland since devaluation. Devaluation was used immediately by a particular category&mdash;I have no hesitation in mentioning the people dealing in textile goods&mdash;as an excuse to inform their customers that they must anticipate an increase in the price of textiles in the very near future.</P>
      <P>Recently an announcement appeared in the daily Press in regard to the price of wool in Australia.  Wherever is the grapevine between the commercial people in this country and Australia, I do not know, but I would say that they had the news almost before it was announced on the radio and the price of wool stepped up to a figure out of all proportion to what was paid for it. The wool that was sold as a manufactured article was probably wool that was bought a year, two years or three years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a great deal of criticism of the Labour Party, particularly by some of the mealy-mouthed individuals in the Opposition&mdash;the people who never made a mistake or <Col N="1793" /> never made a false promise in their lives.  No wonder Deputy Killilea would smile.  The Labour Party decided on a particular action and they have made no apology for it, namely, to put the originators and implementers of the standstill wages Order on the Opposition side of the House and to give them a rest for a bit.  They have been given that rest but, candidly, I can see no improvement in their mentality.</P>
    <P>A certain attitude has been adopted by Deputy Childers who has a very calculated and impassioned way of making a speech.  I believe that he is more interested in the people that this Bill will chastise than in the people whom they are victimising at the moment.  He calmly suggests, about a pair of boots costing 35/-, that the manufacturer makes a profit of only 8d.  He may have a more intimate knowledge, by virtue of his position, than I have, but I am sure that common sense would tell anyone that it is absurd to suggest that the manufacturer has only 8d. profit on a 35/- pair of shoes.  You might find that in Aesop's or Grimm's, but I do not ever remember reading anything like it.</P>
    <P>We all understand that the Opposition will be very anxious to criticise, but there is such a thing as constructive criticism.  Deputy Corry, representing East Cork, seemed to be interested more in rock phosphate from North Africa and coal than he was in the price of blankets or wool or some of the other commodities that Deputy Vivion de Valera mentioned the other night.  Probably some farmer Deputies will appreciate the position with regard to the spreading of phosphate. Approximately 8 cwt. go to the acre.  The Cork Harbour Board charges at the rate of 2/9 a ton.  Therefore, the price per acre to the farmer spreading rock phosphate would be something like one-fifth of that.  I do not know what type of economics Deputy Corry had in mind but, unlike Deputy de Valera, Deputy Corry kept very far away from high finance.  He spoke about 9d. a ton in coal.  He may have had something at the back of his mind. I cannot, however, see where any reduction in rock phosphates will bring about a reduction in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1794" /> It is very peculiar that the same Deputy has submitted a motion to increase milk to the consuming public. I wonder does he realise the conditions of the people who are living in the Belmont houses in Cobh, the Sarsfield Terrace houses in Youghal, in the Clonmult Terrace and in Rosary Place in Midleton, in St. Mary's Crescent, and St. Bernard's Place, Fermoy, and St. Fanahan's Place and Liam Lynch's Terrace in Mitchelstown?  I wonder if it is likely that Deputy Corry in some of his peregrinations would visit those areas and would he have a talk with the people there about increasing the price of milk?  I am sure he would get their benediction.  He might get more than their benediction and I do not think he would be very long there.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGrath has assumed the role of Boss Croker in the Fianna Fáil Party in another assembly to which I belong.  He made a very good contribution about black markets and other things.  He referred to hospitals and he suggested that the Minister for Health, by virtue of a direction to private hospitals quite recently, increased maintenance charges there.  I have not very much knowledge of the charges of private hospitals.  I know very well that if I were ill and if I could afford a private ward in the hospital in Fermoy it would do me grand.  For the information of the House I will read a letter issued by the Department of Local Government and Public Health, Custom House, Dublin, 26th August, 1943:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Chara,</P>
    <P>I am directed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to refer to the circular letter from this Department, dated 5th February last, P. 18/1943, on the subject of the admission to district institutions of persons not eligible for assistance, and to state that in most of the draft regulations submitted the charge in force for patients in single beds and in private wards is unnecessarily low ...&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy Vivion de Valera mentioned several commodities and as I said afterwards he was very informative. He quoted a lot of articles of food.  Some of them are necessities of life but more of them are just luxuries. It may be that he was taking into consideration the fact that, at the moment, this world is presented with the danger of another great war, and that as a shadow Minister for Defence, or, if I am not procrastinating, as the future Commander-in-Chief of the Irish Army, he was probably trying to create a force that would throw back the invader.  I have very serious doubts as to whether that was his object or not.  I have the idea that, for some months past, a certain atmosphere was being created in this country.  There was a war scare and questions were being asked about preparations for war.  I believe there was a slight touch of the red-herring in all those questions and utterances that were asked and made by the shadow Minister and other Deputies of the Opposition.  I have the idea that the red-herring was drawn across the path of the public while certain other things were occurring. We know the people who went to the Gresham in 1947 and signed a charter of exploitation there, and we know their friends.  We know that some of them are, at the moment, battening and fattening on the money of the purchasing and consuming public.  This war scare was perhaps dangled before the public so that those people would get a certain opportunity, and that, when the time came to avail of it, they could increase the price of textile goods by from 50 to 100 per cent.  Unfortunately, they have got away with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass did not make a single constructive suggestion during his speech.  He could not see a reason for this or for that.  Surely, after his 16 years of experience and knowledge as Minister for Industry and Commerce, he should be able to put the thing in its proper perspective, as well as the <Col N="1797" /> difficulties facing any Government when the parasites of commercial enterprise get going and start to raise the ante, in the parlance of poker.  I believe in open agreements and in open discussions and I fail to see what objection there can be to a public investigation when people apply for increases in prices.  Why should not an inquiry be public?  I do not believe it will have any deleterious effect on those people, whether they are wholesalers, middle-men or retailers.  They have a very strong organisation.  They can regulate their prices to the best advantage, come out in public and make the best case they can for them.  That is not going to deprive them of any profits to which they feel they are entitled.  Our people are reasonably-minded and, if convinced that a case has been made for an increase in the price of any commodity, I am sure they will be quite prepared to accept it, just as at the moment announcements are made in the Press by the Minister, through the machinery at his disposal, that he is convinced that an increase in prices should take place.  The increase operates immediately.</P>
    <P>The proposal in this Bill is to set up an advisory committee which can take all the facts into consideration.  When an application is made for an increase in the price of any commodity, it will be investigated before the tribunal. The people making the application will have the services of the wizards of finance, the costings experts who, if you like, can make a shilling out of a pound or a pound out of a shilling, at their disposal.  I believe that the objecting public should have the same assistance, and that the very best men that can be procured should be on that tribunal to examine the accountants engaged by those manufacturers, middlemen or retailers to see that they are only allowed a fair profit.  I do not think it is going outside the bounds of ordinary justice to do that.</P>
    <P>We were elected to this House primarily for the purpose of protecting the people who put us here.  Some say that we were elected on false promises.  Of course, we are the only people who ever did make false promises! I suppose that by our sins we shall be known, and that the people <Col N="1798" /> at the other side of the House, when they were in opposition before, never made promises.  Did they make them in 1932 or did they make them later in 1937 and 1938, 1943 or 1944?  Their promises became so played out in 1948 that the public realised that they had been exploited long enough.  The result is that they are now on the right of the Chair, and we are on this side.  Again I ask the Parliamentary Secretary immediately to put a standstill Order on prices, particularly on the prices of textile commodities.  If he does not, these people will avail themselves of the opportunity to step up prices further.  Then, when the Australian wool comes in and when it is made into cloth, they will look for a further increase. Even if that is not given, they will be quite satisfied because they will have had at least a year of increased prices which they should not get.</P>
    <P>I take a very strong view of this. There is no use in our blowing hot here and blowing cold outside.  If some of the Opposition Deputies would refrain from turning the debate into a bit of a joke, it would be a lot more helpful to the people who are anxious to try and bring down the cost of living and give the public an opportunity of buying commodities at prices which would give a fair profit and which would also be fair to them.  I could not at all agree with some of the statements which included butter in the case made against the Government with regard to the increase in the cost of living.  After all, we must be reasonable.  When the Fianna Fáil Government was in power the butter ration was two ounces up to a month before the general election. We have increased that ration and the people have not to go to the black market for butter.  Deputies from Cork City should know that 10/- and 12/- per lb. was paid for butter in Cork City during the Fianna Fáil administration.</P>
    <P>We have increased the tea ration. Deputy Vivion de Valera went into hysterics over the price of off-theration tea.  I have known tea to be sold on the black market in my town for £2 a lb. and not a word was said about those parasites and leeches who were charging that price for tea.  Sugar was sold for 3/- a stone and there was <Col N="1799" /> nothing said about it.  Bread was sold for 2/6 and 3/- per 2-lb. loaf.  In that case, the people were caught and fined £50, but they made that practically on three batches of bread.  Now there is a terrible clamour about the white bread.  The people I am concerned about are those who can only afford to buy the bread made from the 85 per cent. extraction flour.  They were the only people the Opposition were concerned about at one time when they claimed to be the poor man's Government.</P>
    <P>Amongst the foodstuffs mentioned the other night were candied peel and things like that.  I was wondering whether we were in a Gilbert and Sullivan atmosphere when Deputy Vivion de Valera read out certain statistics. I am surprised that some people, who proclaimed themselves to be the benefactors of the poor, listened to him. Amongst the items he included the price of milk.  We are accused of being a Coalition Government.  We are, but we are not a splinter Party like the Party opposite.  We have Deputy Corry asking in a motion for a further increase in the price of milk to the consumers.  I daresay he has not done that without getting the benediction of the &ldquo;big chief&rdquo;.  I do not believe that the rigid, implacable, discipline of brass hats of the Fianna Fáil Party would allow any private Deputy to put down a motion in this House without its getting their benediction.  That motion is listed for discussion in this House.  Yet, Deputy Vivion de Valera says that we increased the price of milk, while one of the oldest members of his Party wants to charge extra for milk to the people of Cobh, Midleton, Youghal, Fermoy and Mitchelstown for the winter months, irrespective of whether they may be single or married, or whether they have small or big families.</P>
    <P>Is there not a great difference between a Coalition Government which is trying to do the best they can for the people and a splinter Party such as that?  One of the Fianna Fáil's front benchers, a shadow Minister for Defence, accuses us of increasing the price of milk, while Deputy Corry is <Col N="1800" /> looking for an increase in the price of milk.  Incidentally, that would increase the price of butter, because he is also looking for an increase in the price of milk delivered to the creameries.  Some of these Deputies, particularly Deputy Lemass, could be very helpful in opposition. I have paid a tribute in this House before to Deputy Lemass and I repeat it.  Undoubtedly, he rendered valuable services during the difficult period which this country had to pass through.  Some of us who were aware of the difficulties he had to encounter, highly appreciated that.  I am afraid that Deputy Lemass in opposition is a different man from Deputy Lemass as Minister for Industry and Commerce or Minister for Supplies.  I am sure he will realise that there is a critical situation facing this country and indeed facing the whole world at the moment with all preparations for war and that he will be a little more helpful during the Committee and Report Stages of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I conclude by asking the Parliamentary Secretary again immediately to enforce a standstill Order on the prices of commodities on which he should realise he can enforce it, and that we will not be faced with the position where we shall have to take measures that may not be for the betterment of the people we represent.  The sooner a standstill Order is put on the better it will be for the Government.  The machinery being at his disposal, I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary, acting on behalf of the Government, will put that machinery into operation immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Keane prefaced his remarks by saying that the machinery available&mdash;to use his own words, I think he said the machinery at hand&mdash;should be used for the purpose of freezing prices.  I hold that is an admission that the machinery is already there and that there is no great need to amend this Bill or the legislation in existence in order to achieve that object.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Charges have been levelled against the Opposition Deputies who spoke in this debate that they are not taking cognisance of the facts and that they <Col N="1801" /> are trying to plead their case on the make-believe, as it is termed, that this Party did nothing while it was in office to keep prices down.  Before the present Government took office, and this is well known to everybody, very definite promises were made that not merely would they keep down prices but they would reduce them considerably. In respect of one prominent member of the present Government, a certain figure was mentioned and quoted.  I shall not go into that now, but I hold that the keynote of all the criticism of the Opposition is that the Government did not reduce prices; what is more, I hold they did not even make a genuine attempt to keep prices down by using the machinery Deputy Keane stated they had at hand.  Everybody knows that long before devaluation and long before the Korean war prices were rising.  Can the Government or the Parliamentary Secretary explain what was done during that period to keep prices down and to keep the cost of living from rising?  I cannot see that anything whatsoever was done.</P>
    <P>We have only got to take a few examples.  Institutions were mentioned during the debate.  Institutions are a pretty fair criteria as to whether or not the cost of living has remained static, decreased or increased.  In County Galway we have several public institutions.  The central hospital is a public institution.  The cost of maintenance of a patient there has increased from 6/- to 8/- per day in the public ward.  That increase took place long before the Korean war.  It took place, in fact, 18 months ago.</P>
    <P>I have here a bill sent out from Ballinasloe Mental Hospital to a particular individual in respect of the maintenance of a member of his family, a member for whom I hold he is not responsible.  Nevertheless this bill was sent out.  From 1st April, 1948, to 31st March, 1949, the charge for maintenance was £125 2s. 11d., and from the 1st April, 1949, to 31st March, 1950, it was £131 19s. 10d.  That was an increase of almost £7 in one year for the same type of maintenance.  That was before the Korean war started.  The devaluation of the £ may be brought <Col N="1802" /> in in order to bolster up any excuse that may be made, but the fact remains that the cost of living went up.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keane made great play with Deputy Major de Valera's statement in relation to the price of milk and he also criticised Deputy Corry for introducing a motion here to still further increase the price of milk.  But he found fault with Deputy Major de Valera because he criticised the Government for allowing the price of milk to increase. Deputy Keane says that we speak with different voices.  He says that one section of our Party represents the urban viewpoint and that the other section represents the farming or rural interests.  I would say that is true of practically every Party in this House.</P>
    <P>I am a farmer and I was here on the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I suggested to the Minister at that time that he should stabilise or fix the price of wool.  I know how the Minister treated that suggestion in his reply. I know he did not intend to sneer, but one could almost take his remarks as such.  He said that the farmers were then getting at 4/- per lb.&mdash;that was the price in County Galway at the time &mdash;as much for the fleece as they got for the sheep during the Fianna Fáil period of office.  In my opinion that was a very poor answer and the proof of its poorness is now apparent.  The mismanagement by the Government in the case of wool is typical of their mismanagement in every other line of policy.  That matter was used against me at the local elections; it was said that I was the farmer who advocated the fixing of the price of wool at 4/- per lb., thus depriving the farmers of County Galway of that to which they were entitled.  That kind of propaganda did not get very far as results subsequently proved.  The majority of the farmers of County Galway are under £20 valuation.  They sold their wool at 4/- per lb. immediately it was clipped.  After that the price started to advance.  Week by week there was a further increase.  Eventually it reached 7/- per lb.  We hear a good deal of talk about the price of Australian and New Zealand wool, and its possible reflection in the price of clothing. <Col N="1803" /> Despite the fact that a certain amount of foreign wool has to be used or is being used in the manufacture of cloth here, at the same time it is on the price of Irish wool that the manufacturers, the wholesalers and the retailers go in order to put up the price of the suit length; and nobody can deny that.</P>
    <P>What is the position in County Galway now?  The farmer with 20 sheep sold his wool at 4/- per lb.  Taking the average weight of a fleece at 7 lbs., it means that he got 28/- for each fleece&mdash;a price he never expected he would see, I will quite admit, but the man who could afford to hold on and take a chance is now getting 10/- a lb. for it.  That means that for a 7-lb. fleece he is getting £3 10s. as against the 28/- which his poorer neighbour got.  The difference is £2 2s. in the price of the fleece.  As I say, the price reached 7/- a lb. in the month of September. What happened then?  We were given to understand, at any rate, that a conference of the woollen interests was being called by the Department of Industry and Commerce. Naturally enough a number of people down the country got it into their heads that this meant that wool was then about to be controlled.  The wool agents and the wool merchants took full advantage of that, I can tell you.  They carried on the old trick of closing down altogether for a few days with the result that a number of people who had held on to the wool brought it in and sold it wherever they could at 5/6 or 5/- a lb.  Then we were told after another week or so that the conference had broken down.  If the Government, the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary, try to defend that kind of shilly-shallying tactics, robbing the farmers of County Galway, after we had been told that a number of the farmers who held it over were justly entitled to get what they could and I was being twitted and held up to public ridicule in County Galway&mdash; I do not see on what score such tactics can be defended.  But that is not all.</P>
    <P>On the 20 sheep whose fleece the farmer sold at 4/- a lb. he lost <Col N="1804" /> £2 2s. 0d. per fleece, or a total sum of £42 in hard cash.  To farmers in other parts of the country that may seem an insignificant sum, but what is the position going to be now?  He is going to lose at the other end as well.  He is going to pay at least 50 per cent. more for clothes for his children and himself than he paid this time 12 months.  For the purposes of easy calculation, we shall say that he paid £10 for each suit of clothes required by himself and four members of his family last year.  This year he will be obliged to pay £15 per suit length. That will mean £25 more added on to the £42 he has already lost, and the Department of Industry and Commerce does nothing about it.  I stood up in this House, as I said, and knowing the position in the past, knowing how the farmers had been so often tricked in respect of this commodity, I had no hesitation whatsoever in taking that unpopular step of seriously asking the Minister for Industry and Commerce on that occasion last July to control wool at 4/- and 5/- per lb. As I say, I got what I might term, although I know it was not intentionally, a sneering reply.  It is not alone the farmer who sold the wool that will be hit.  This will hit every person in town and country.  The Government could easily at that time have controlled wool at, say, 5/- per lb.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that it would be outside the bounds of possibility for them to have set up an agency whereby they would hand over to the wool manufacturers of this country their requirements based on what they manufactured the previous year.  They could have at the same time exported the surplus and got the highest price possible for it.  With such money as they received in excess of 5/- per lb. they could have subsidised the wool they handed over to the manufacturers and given it to them at the same price they purchased wool in 1949.  In that way the manufacturers would have no case to come to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to ask for any increase under that heading.  That is the position as I see it in respect to wool.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1805" /> Then we have the Government coming along here, telling us that everything possible was done to keep down the cost of living, and that it was only when circumstances over which the Government had no control intervened, that they were forced to introduce the measure now before the House.</P>
    <P>My charge against the Government is not so much their failure to reduce the cost of living as they promised prior to the 1948 elections; my charge against them, and it is the charge of every Deputy.  I am sure who sits on this side of the house, is that they failed to take any steps whatever to keep it static or keep it controlled despite the fact that, according to Deputy Keane and others, they had the machinery at hand to do so.</P>
    <P>There are other matters of which I could speak&mdash;the fuel situation, for instance, which has had such a sad history that it scarcely need be referred to.  Nevertheless, the Government came in here in 1948 and threw all the drochmheas they possibly could on hand-won turf.  They actually abolished it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I am as well able to read as Deputy McQuillan.  Why did they not go on with the machinewon turf or the semi-automatic machine-won turf?  Why did they not develop the bogs so that the machines could be used?  In 1949 they almost abandoned it altogether and Deputy McQuillan knows that very well.  They abandoned in 1949 a number of the <Col N="1806" /> bogs on which they had machines in 1948.  In fact, they offered the machines for sale to private individuals.  I wonder will Deputy McQuillan deny that fact.</P>
      <P>It is easy to talk and to say that everything was done.  Everything was not done and the result of it all is that the people were so discouraged by the line of action that the Government took in 1948 that the majority of those who were producing turf left the country and emigrated to England, America and elsewhere, with the result that, if we are faced with another crisis to-morrow, the big difficulty, the only difficulty, in dealing with the fuel situation in the coming year will be lack of labour. They were driven out of the country by the policy that was put into operation by the present Government and backed by Deputy McQuillan, Labour and all the others.  That is something that they cannot get away from.</P>

      <P>This is a serious matter and it has to be tackled in a very serious way.  The freezing of prices could have been done in an easy and gradual way if the machinery that was already to hand was used, as was explained by Deputy Keane.  That has not been done.  We are to get an advisory committee.  We have had committees and commissions on every acute problem that confronted the country since the present Government took office.  Emigration was to be stemmed, if not altogether stopped.  We have had a Commission on Emigration for the last two years and nine months and we are still awaiting their report. It is a case of Nero fiddling while Rome burns.  There are commissions on various other things.  Now we get another commission under a different title&mdash;an advisory committee, that will inquire into prices and all the rest of it. Deputy McGrath pointed out last week that we had a commission to inquire into the flour milling industry.  Their report has not yet come to hand.</P>
      <P>Are those who are being hit by rising costs expected to wait another three or four years until the advisory committee examines the cost of raw material, the cost of manufacture, the cost of the finished article, the cost to the wholesaler, the cost to the retailer and the cost to the consumer?  If so, I say that the cost of living will continue to soar and wages will continue after them.  If the machinery that is to hand is not used in a proper and discreet fashion, used as was originally intended and operated under Fianna Fáil, the fact of appointing an advisory committee will not be very helpful and those who are finding it difficult to carry on at the present time will find their position quite impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no reason in the world, I think, why we on this side of the <Col N="1808" /> House should support this Bill or allow it to pass without a division, because the fact remains that we are charging the Government, and charging them correctly, with neglect of a fundamental duty in not giving effect to their promise, not merely to reduce prices, but to keep them to their proper level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene in this debate only for the purpose of trying to set the debate in a correct perspective, so as to enable the House to discuss this whole matter against the background of the wage and price policy of the Fianna Fáil Party.  In 1939 we were told in this House on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Government that it was the policy of that Government to peg wages and to peg prices.  We had a declaration then on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Government that nobody would be allowed to make unreasonable profits out of the war, and that nobody would be allowed to get away with profits which were unjustified. The general intention then, as expressed by those who spoke for the Fianna Fáil Party, was that prices would be rigidly controlled on the one hand, and the justification for that was stated to be the freezing of wages on the other hand.</P>
      <P>Everybody who has been familiar with the circumstances from 1939 to 1946 knows perfectly well that, whatever that policy may have been in conception, it was a dismal and a ghastly failure so far as the workers of this country were concerned.  As one surveyed the operation of that policy during the seven years from 1939 to 1946, one got one clear picture before his eyes, that those who were producing and marketing goods were being allowed to get away with inordinate and extortionate profits on the one hand, that they accumulated wealth that they never previously dreamt of, while on the other hand, the mass of the working people, the small men of no power and no property were held vice-like to a standard of living which is a reproach to any civilized Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was the position at the end of 1946?  Is there any worker or any <Col N="1809" /> apologist for the Fianna Fáil Party who will dare to contend that, taking the period from 1939 to 1946, any worker was better off in 1946 than he was in 1939?  Is not it as plain as a pikestaff that during that period, so far as the workers were concerned, they endured economic crucifixion at the hands of the Fianna Fáil Government because their wages were kept low while, on the other hand, we had created a new hierarchy of wealthy people, arrogant in their wealth, arrogant in their opulence, challenging anybody who dared to question their right to make extortionate profits, yes, and threatening with a cheque book at election times because one dared to question the profits that these people were allowed to make under the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>Will Deputy Kissane or anybody else in the Fianna Fáil Party tell me, in 1950, that it was for keeping prices low that a bunch of industrialists in this city issued an appeal for funds on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party at the last election in order to keep that Party in power?  Was that done in appreciation of the Government controlling prices or is it not more likely that that was done in appreciation of the way in which the workers' standard of living was depressed while the wealthy elements of the community were allowed to get away with a bundle of swag that astonished even themselves?  Yet, in the face of these facts, which are incontrovertible, we get Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches upbraiding this Government because it is not controlling prices.</P>
    <P>I have before me a trade union publication which declares that the operation of the Fianna Fáil wage fixing policy was such that living standards were depressed so much that by the beginning of 1947 real wages were more than one-fifth below pre-war level and that was the result brought about by the wage and price fixing policy of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>We have further evidence.  Here is a chart prepared by the Central Office of Statistics.  This chart shows the rise in the cost of living; it shows the wages of workers in transport and the wages of workers in industrial undertakings. Deputies can see here on this <Col N="1810" /> chart the effects.  Here is the rise in prices described by this curve; here is a curve showing the wages of the industrial workers.  That gap, that balloon, represents the Fianna Fáil policy of keeping wages down, on the one hand, whilst allowing prices to rise in that balloon-like manner, on the other hand.  Every portion of that balloon represents hardship so far as the wage-earning classes of the community are concerned.  That chart is available for anyone who wants to inspect it.  It ought to bring a blush of shame to the face of anyone who attempts to defend the wage fixing policy of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>I say here and now that the declaration which was made in 1939, that we were going to have controlled wages, on the one hand, and controlled prices, on the other hand, represents the biggest political swindle ever put over on the workers.  The effect was to depress their standard of living, whilst those already well endowed with this world's goods were allowed to line their pockets and to amass wealth they never thought they would own.</P>
    <P>What was the position when we took office?  We found the workers, as this trade union document says, with their real wages lower by one-fifth than they were in 1939.  They had just come out of the evil effects of a wage-freezing policy, a policy which stripped their wardrobes and their very houses and left them no reservoir of accumulated goods.</P>
    <P>That was the position in 1948.  On taking office we realised that this vicious policy of wage freezing should not be countenanced in any circumstances. One of our first acts was to recognise the fact that the standard of living of the workers had been reduced, that in 1948 that standard was less than it was in 1939.  We sought to make amends and provide compensation by a generous approach to the whole problem of wages, an approach which resulted in our giving, so far as we were employers, increases to a variety of public servants, sanctioning increases for road workers, approving increases for agricultural workers, and generally showing that our line of policy in the economic field was in the <Col N="1811" /> direction of enabling workers to get compensation for the increased cost of living and for the sacrifices which they had made during the war period.</P>
    <P>Would that have been the policy if the cheques of the industrialists had secured the return of the Fianna Fáil Party in 1948?  Will anybody dare to say that that would have been the policy?  We have here in the Dáil Report of the 15th October, 1947, a declaration from the then Taoiseach, Mr. de Valera.  After referring to the situation which was developing the then Taoiseach indicated, on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Government, that that Government, not satisfied with the hardships they had inflicted on the workers from 1939 to 1946, were again beginning to sharpen their swords to give battle for a new wage freeze.  He then announced, in column 389 on the 15th October, speaking of the Fianna Fáil Government:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government regards this temporary limitation of wage increases as vitally necessary in present circumstances, and if the trade unions cannot undertake such an agreement as I have outlined, either because there is not unanimity amongst them or because their rules prevent the union executive entering into firm commitments of this nature, then the Government will produce proposals for legislation to the same effect.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, in October, 1947, the Taoiseach in the Fianna Fáil Government was declaring that if the workers would not voluntarily agree to continue to bear the unreasonable sacrifices which Fianna Fáil had imposed upon them from 1939 to 1946, then the Fianna Fáil Government was going to reimpose by legislation another wage freezing policy.</P>
    <P>One can imagine what the effect of that would be if it had been in operation for the past two years and nine months.  That was to be the economic policy of the Fianna Fáil Party in 1947.  Happily, an outraged electorate made sure they would never implement it.  Not even the cheques of the industrialists, who got rich under Fianna Fáil, could save the Fianna Fáil Party <Col N="1812" /> from the anger of the electorate at that time.  So far as the ordinary workers are concerned, so far as the men who depend on wages and salaries are concerned, the choice for them in 1948 was a continuance of Fianna Fáil wage freezing and that would have been in operation and they can measure the plight to which they would have been reduced, with wages frozen and prices permitted to rise.</P>
    <P>It is against that background that the House has to consider this matter. I can understand Deputies who may want this Government to go further in this or that direction; I can understand and appreciate that point of view, but let nobody be so politically foolish as to imagine that the remedy is to put that Government back, to freeze by legislation the wages of the workers, and yet, with an hypocrisy that is probably without parallel, plead at the same time, as that Party does plead, that it is concerned with the welfare of the workers.</P>
    <P>Let us take the situation as it developed from 1948.  As Deputy Keane has said, when we came into office we found the butter ration as low as two ozs. of butter, and tea was a smaller ration than it is to-day.  After a short time in office we increased these rations and they are higher to-day than ever they were during the Fianna Fáil period from the point of rationing onwards.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, we repealed the penal taxes which the Fianna Fáil Party imposed on tobacco, on cigarettes, on cinema seats and on the beverages which the ordinary workers consume, and we did that at a cost of £6,000,000. I can tell Deputy Kissane for the Fianna Fáil Party that many Fianna Fáil supporters around the country were extremely pleased that there was in office a Government which gave them these simple luxuries at a lesser price than their Fianna Fáil friends would do.</P>
    <P>There has been in this debate criticism of the index figure.  The Parliamentary Secretary's speech in connection with this Bill has been grossly misrepresented, if not deliberately twisted to give the impression that he said something other than what <Col N="1813" /> he did in fact say.  Now, let us look at this cost-of-living index figure.  At best, it purports to be nothing more than a rough and ready means of measuring price movements.  It does not purport in any way, and it never did, to be a scientific method of measuring the cost of living of any family, of even an average family.  Its purpose was to indicate, in a broad way, without measuring the extent of family expenditure, the movement of retail prices.  Someone has already suggested that it should never, in fact, be described as a cost-of-living index figure because it does not measure, and never purported to measure, the cost of living. It was the British who originally called it a cost-of-living index figure.  We inherited the figure and the machinery from the British.  They have since described it as an index of retail prices. We continue, however, to call it what it really is not, namely, a cost-of-living index figure.</P>
    <P>Now, it has been suggested and, of all persons by Deputy Lemass, that he has no faith in a cost-of-living index figure.  What he did not tell the House was that in 1947 his Government was responsible for introducing the present method of compiling the cost-of-living index figure.  They selected the commodities to be priced; they selected the method of ascertaining the prices of these commodities; they selected the method of weighting these commodities, and they devised the machinery to give us the final index figure.  All that was done by Fianna Fáil and under Fianna Fáil.  It is being done to-day by the very same people whom they appointed to do it, and, whatever imperfections it has to-day, were imperfections which were breathed into that whole method by the Party opposite that was responsible for creating the mechanism.  Yet, they pretend now to have no use for their own brain child, the 1947 method of ascertaining the cost-of-living index figure.</P>
    <P>I say that is dishonest politics.  I say that it is sheer hypocrisy to pretend now that we have done something with the index figure when they know, if they spoke the truth, that the index figure operating to-day is the index <Col N="1814" /> figure produced by the mechanism created by the Fianna Fáil Government. I say it is fraudulent to pretend to believe that the index figure has in any way been altered by this Government.  The Government does not touch the index figure; it is not concerned with it; it is a pure mathematical calculation made in accordance with the formula designed by the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>What the Parliamentary Secretary said in this debate, and what cannot be challenged by reference to the Fianna Fáil price index mechanism, is that between August, 1947, and August, 1950, that index figure remained stationary.  Some figures moved up, and others moved down, but over that period it remained stationary.  It gave in 1947 the same result as in 1950, and vice versa, and it gave it by employing exactly the same type of operation as that designed by the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary said that, he told the merest and the barest truth, and when the trade unions, which raised this matter at the Labour Court and had the benefit of a consultation with the Director of Statistics, examined this whole question of the index figure, they did not attempt to make any case that the index figure was other than what we said it was, a rough and ready method of measuring price movements.  The figure which it produced in August, 1950, therefore, is as accurate as whatever the figure was in August, 1947.</P>
    <P>Since August, 1950 there has been a change.  We are fools if we do not recognise the changes which have been brought about.  The first change was devaluation in September, 1949.  It was then believed that devaluation would have immediate and serious consequences for those countries in the sterling area which were compelled to buy either manufactured goods or raw materials from the dollar area.  Happily, so far as we were concerned, the worst prognostications did not materialise for a long time.  We were able to buy at the old prices, or to rely on supplies which had been bought before devaluation.  In other words, we in this country had delayed action effect so far as devaluation was <Col N="1815" /> concerned.  It was only in recent months that evidence was forthcoming of the increased prices which will have to be paid for commodities in which there is a dollar content, either in the manufactured article or in raw material.  The effect of that devaluation, however, was this.  It meant that for every £1 for which we used to buy goods, either manufactured goods or raw materials in the dollar area, instead of it buying us 20/- worth of goods it only bought us approximately 13/6 worth of goods, and inevitably, in circumstances such as these, the cost of imported manufactured goods, or the cost of raw materials from the dollar area, was correspondingly dearer. Even where we did not buy in the dollar area, but in the sterling area, goods or raw materials which had a dollar content, we were compelled, because of the experience of that country with the dollar area, to pay even in the sterling area a higher price for goods with a dollar content.</P>
    <P>Will anybody pretend to believe that that did not make a profound change in our whole approach to the problem of getting raw materials for our industries from the dollar area, or a profound change in the importation of other commodities which we had necessarily to get from the dollar area? Has anybody here any remedies to suggest as to what we should have done in view of devaluation in our circumstances, and particularly those who linked us indissolubly to sterling?  In the circumstances presented to us in September, 1949, there was no alternative that we could adopt to avoid devaluation of the £ and that fact has been admitted in public speeches by members of the Party opposite.  But devaluation had necessarily a significant effect on our whole economy and devaluation was not alone.</P>
    <P>In recent months we have had to face the situation which has arisen as a result of the Korean war.  Does anybody suggest that we could have forseen that and stock-piled against it? Everybody who has studied the matter realises that even a great nation like the United States was, if you like, caught on the wrong foot by the outbreak <Col N="1816" /> of the Korean war.  Having regard to the ever-changing circumstances in Korea and what has boiled up as a result of that conflict during the last couple of months, will anybody attempt to say that we could have insulated ourselves against the world consequences of the outbreak of war in Korea?  Is it not clear that that whole conflict has compelled even the most powerful nations of the world to revise their whole economy?  Countries which were giving over their entire industrial potential to the production of more goods for export in order to bridge their balance of payments have been compelled to devote a substantial portion of their internal economy to the production of arms and munitions of war, with the inevitable result that the economy of these countries has been partially dislocated.  Many commodities which were freely available six or 12 months ago are no longer available at the old price because they are now regarded as essential war material.</P>
    <P>We can, of course, if we wish, make up our minds that we are going to import nothing from the dollar area.  We can make up our minds that we are not going to look in the world markets for those commodities which are becoming scarce as a result of the Korean conflict and dear as a result of that conflict and of devaluation.  What does it mean?  It means a complete convulsion in the whole pattern of our life. It means that we shall have to do without things which we do not produce ourselves.  It means a complete reorientation in the life of our people. The scarcer these commodities become the more the tendency will be towards still greater increases in the price of raw materials which we must import, and still dearer manufactured commodities, if we feel it necessary in the interest of our national life to continue to import these commodities.  It is sheer lunacy to suggest that we can possibly insulate ourselves against the effect of the Korean war or out-croppings of that war, together with the effects of devaluation.</P>
    <P>World prices are rising.  Prices are rising to-day in every country in the world, and it is dishonest not to recognise that fact.  Butter is 7/6 a lb. in <Col N="1817" /> Italy; the cheapest meat is 3/2 a lb., and you have to stew it in order to eat it.  Similarly, in France, butter is 6/9 a lb., and coal is £13 a ton.  Figures have been quoted in this debate to show what the prices of certain commodities are in certain countries.  In the United States, the 2-lb. loaf is 2/-; here it is 6¼d.  If you take other commodities, such as eggs, you will find they are 5/- per dozen in the United States and, when this figure was ascertained, they were 3/3 here. You will find that in Canada butter is 4/1 per lb.; it is 2/8 here.  You will find that sugar, in Canada, is 8½d. a lb. and 4d. here.  That is not the full measurement of the increased cost of living because, even in Europe, price ranges are still higher than they have been in the countries which I have quoted.</P>
    <P>If all this is happening throughout the world, does anybody seriously imagine that we can escape?  I do not think we can, because our economy is very largely interdependent with the economies of the world.  We have to buy raw materials from these other countries to sustain life here and to keep the wheels of industry moving. So long as we have to do that, we will never be able by our own efforts to cushion ourselves against the influences and the factors which make for high prices in these other countries.  In the situation with which we are faced to-day, and with the danger of increased prices, it behoves us to be more vigilant than ever in dealing with this problem of prices.  Scarcities must not and will not be allowed as an excuse for indiscriminate increases in prices against our own people.  In the circumstances which have superimposed themselves on our economy in recent months, price control machinery must not only be maintained but, in the Government view, price control machinery must and will be improved, and that will be done immediately.</P>
    <P>Deputy Beegan took a pathetic delight in believing that the present machinery was adequate.  Other members of the Fianna Fáil Party, when in office, paid tribute to the price-control machinery.  I want to say here and now on behalf of myself, and with <Col N="1818" /> a full sense of responsibility for what I am saying, that the public of this country have no confidence in the present price-fixing machinery.  They have no confidence because they are not allowed to see how it works and they do not know what is going on. So far as the ordinary man in the street is concerned, he buys a commodity one day at a particular price and he sees an Order in the papers the next day, perhaps, saying that the price of that commodity is increased. He has seen no public examination of the question.  He has seen no microscopic examination of the basis upon which the increase is sought to be justified.  So far as he is concerned, he only knows that the price has jumped since he last bought the commodity and he darkly suspects that it is being done by somebody going into a Government Department and persuading some simple-minded person there that he should have an increase and that the increase takes place automatically.</P>
    <P>That does not in fact happen, but a false impression is given of the examination which is applied to applications for price increases.  Nobody can blame the public for having no confidence in a price mechanism which they are not allowed to examine, which they are not allowed to see in operation, and where they are denied an opportunity of analysing the elements which make for, and the factors which operate against claims for price increases.  In other words, you cannot sell the public confidence in a price-fixing machine which operates in the dark so far as the community is concerned.  That method of dealing with prices has got to end.  This Bill is designed to end it, and it will end it quickly.  We propose in this Bill to set up not an inconsequential advisory committee which can ponder over a problem sent to it for a period of months, but a price tribunal, a virile, vibrant, representative body of three or five citizens, selected on the basis of their competence and on the basis that they are citizens of standing. The function of that tribunal will be to examine every application for an increase in prices.</P>
    <P>I would like to make it clear here and now on behalf of the Government <Col N="1819" /> that that price tribunal will not be an automatic machine for registering price increases.  That tribunal will be expected to undertake the most critical and the most microscopic examination of every claim for an increase made to it, and there must be no increase given by that tribunal unless the case for such an increase is proved beyond all possibility of doubt.  If there is to be a doubt, it is the public and not the applicant who will get the benefit of that doubt.</P>
    <P>We do not want these applications for increases examined in the confines of a Civil Service office by two or three civil servants, on the one hand, trying to hold the scales for the community and, on the other hand, the alert producer trying to get his pound of flesh. We want this examination carried out in the full light of day, and we want to make sure that the public Press will be available to report the applications for increases and to read the examination of the witnesses before that tribunal.</P>
    <P>In addition, we shall ensure that so far as this tribunal is concerned there will be adequate representation on it for consumers.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce will be responsible in the last resort for price fixation.  There will be no evasion of ministerial or governmental responsibility in that regard.  Every application for an increase in price must go before the tribunal, and must be sifted by it, and that body will ultimately report to the Minister, and the responsibility will be on the Minister to decide on the facts as presented to him.  This House will still be a watch-dog for the community in examining the day-to-day actions of the Minister in relation to price control.</P>
    <P>This tribunal will do something more.  Not only is it new, not only is it something that Fianna Fáil never contemplated or, having contemplated it, would never permit to operate, but we propose to throw this tribunal into the full light of day by giving it an opportunity of examining in public, applications for increases in price, and the Government will assist that tribunal in its operations by making available to it, at its request, the <Col N="1820" /> group profits of the manufacturers, or the individual manufacturer, who goes before the tribunal looking for an increase in price: in other words, the tribunal will not deal with these matters in a vacuum.  When an application for an increase in price comes before it the Government will, if requested by the tribunal, say: &ldquo;Here is the list of profits which have been and are being made by that particular industry; now that is the background against which you should weigh that application and come to a decision in the light of the full knowledge that you now have.&rdquo;  That is something that has never happened before.  That is something that does not happen to-day.  There is no public examination of applications for increases with that information in the background. But that information will be in the background in the future, and the group profits will be available for the most meticulous examination in respect of any application which comes before the tribunal.  I think you will all agree that by giving the public this type of tribunal, a public tribunal with all that information at its disposal and one on which the community, as represented by consumers, will have adequate representation, we are doing in respect of price control something that has never been attempted here before.  I hope that what we are doing in this respect will inspire public confidence in the Government's new method of dealing with price fixing.</P>
    <P>Every aspect of profit-making will likewise be brought within the control of this tribunal.  It will have the power not merely to review group profits but also the power to review some of the rather unusual practices which have operated in industries from time to time in the past.  It will have an opportunity of reviewing everything that contributes to the making of profits, including the writing up of assets and the subsequent distribution of bonus shares, sometimes by industries not very long in existence.</P>
    <P>The tribunal, too, will be empowered to deal with the question of profit margins.  The present method of price control ensures profits to all the handlers of a commodity and the price to the consumer of these goods is based <Col N="1821" /> upon ensuring such a profit to everyone who handles the goods; if a particular commodity costs 1/- to produce and if the wholesaler gets 2d., the subwholesaler 1½d. and the retailer 3d., if that commodity goes up in price, they all continue to get the same percentages even though their costs of handling have not increased and, in some instances, they get these wholesale and sub-wholesale profits although the goods do not move from the place where they were manufactured.  That type of delicate mechanism, operated as it is to-day, will be brought under review.  The rates of discount and the margins of profit will be subject to examination.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves frankly how many people will we keep on the basis of paying them profits between the time the article is manufactured and the point at which it ultimately reaches the hands of the consumer.  We could, if we liked, put in half a dozen more classes and let them all get a little and let the consumer pay in the long run. But prudent people may think that we have now reached the stage and the consumer has reached the stage where he no longer thinks he ought to be asked to carry so many at such an expensive price as he is paying to-day. However, that is a matter which will be subject to examination by this tribunal.  So far as the Government is concerned every scrap of evidence relating to profits will be made available to the tribunal in order to assist it in its deliberations.</P>
    <P>I have told the House that we propose to set up this tribunal primarily for the purpose of examining applications. We propose to do more than that.  We propose to introduce without delay a price freeze.  There may be a case for a profit freeze though there are difficulties in the administration of any such freeze; but at least there will be a price freeze, the most extensive and practical price freeze that we can devise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will it be a general one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be a general one and the Deputy will be tired counting the commodities that will be affected by it.  We propose, in addition, to reimpose <Col N="1822" /> a wide area of price control to bring back under price control commodities which were released from that control.  It must not be assumed that price control will be at the existing levels.  Some people manufacturing commodities which have been freed from control have not been unwilling to step up the prices unjustifiably. Nobody need assume from what I say that he will be allowed to get away with unreasonable margins of profit. Whatever price fixation is done it will be done with a view to skimming off every scrap of unreasonable profit-taking by those who try to engage in that vicious ambition.  So far as price fixing is concerned, there is, then, the governmental body.  So far as price freezing is concerned, there is in principle no governmental objection to price freezing.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of what is the best and most effective way to do it.  It will be done almost immediately when the Government has made up its mind as to the best method to adopt.  If, after having fixed prices, after having imposed a price freeze, some producer says that the price is too low, then that person can go to the tribunal. There he can make his case for an increase in price, but he has got to know that the tribunal is a watch-dog for the community, that there is not going to be any easy road to quick profits and that the tribunal is not going to be merely a rubber stamp for increasing prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the Government is concerned its attitude in relation to profits is this: it wants to ensure that the honest, decent man or woman, the honest trader and the honest firm, which invests capital in an enterprise, will be permitted to get a reasonable return on that capital.  We want to permit the decent manufacturer, the good industrialist, the good provider of services, to obtain a reasonable return on his capital to assist him to pay decent wages and to observe decent conditions of employment.  If there is unreasonable profit-taking, then the Government intends to rake off these profits for the benefit of the community, either by the reimposition of the excess corporation profits tax, or by some <Col N="1823" /> equally effective method of taxation of extra profits.  It would be better, of course, if it were not necessary to resort to this method of siphoning off profits.  It would be better if the excess profits were ploughed back into the industry.  It would be better if those concerned with producing goods would fix prices at levels that would not give rise to excess profits.  It would be far better if we could maintain a reasonable price level and if price control does not ensure that we can get reasonable prices without excessive profit-taking, then I see no alternative left to us except to resort to this method of taxation of excessive profits.</P>
    <P>We do not wish, as I say, to pursue a policy of profits taxation because of any doctrinaire policy in that field. We do not want to impose such taxation for the mere sake of imposing it, but we must insist that the community will be protected against speculators, protected against all those who in that field have shown the sheerest contempt for the community's welfare.  There are imperfections, of course, in any scheme of excess corporation profits tax.  There may be better and other forms of taxation. If there are, they will be resorted to in preference to an excess profits tax.  It will be necessary to devise a scheme, however, which will not result in portion of the excess profits being retained by those who make these excess profits.</P>
    <P>There is just the probability that, this time, the community in its own interests, may find it necessary not to share the excess profits with the maker of the profits but to rake them off entirely so that they can be used for the benefit of the community.  That is not a desirable course to adopt; it is not something that we want to do for the mere sake of doing it, but the people who now make excess profits have it in their own hands to remedy the situation. They can reduce prices and not make these extra profits but if, in the face of the public weal and the public demand for reasonable prices, they still go on, Shylock-like, demanding their pound of flesh from the consuming public, then there is no alternative but to rake off every penny of the extra <Col N="1824" /> profits.  I hope, however, that by a display of wisdom and fair play on the part of manufacturers, this course will not be rendered necessary but it is well to give them notice this evening that there is going to be no more trifling with excess profits, and that the community is not going to be bled by one small section which wants to line its own pocket to the detriment of the community in general.</P>
    <P>One other matter falls to be mentioned in this connection.  I said earlier that prices and profits examination would be on a broad basis.  In that connection, the tariff industries will call for a special review.  We have a number of industries which have been functioning for many years past, on the basis that the community deliberately levies taxes on itself to keep these industries going.  That was done for the purpose of assisting the particular industry, to help it through its infancy, into its adolescence, and, finally, to reach its industrial manhood.  The beginning of the manhood of some of these industries has long since passed and what we have to ask ourselves to-day is, are we going to permit the benefits of a tariff arrangement which allows certain manufacturers to be content with producing 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 per cent. of the requirements of the home market, in respect of the goods which they produce, and having the rest of the community paying a higher price for the imported article because the home manufacturer will not endeavour to step up his production to supply the entire home market?</P>
    <P>I think we have got to remember that this tariff was given for a limited period and for a particular purpose, and I think the time has now come when those who have got the backing of tariffs should produce the entire requirements of the home market; otherwise the public should not be asked to continue to pay day in, day out, levies which they voluntarily imposed on themselves in order to assist in sheltering these industries in their infant and adolescent years.  Full development in that respect would not only help to reduce prices, but would help to provide opportunities of expanding employment for our people. <Col N="1825" /> We have now reached the stage in the production of goods when sheer laziness and sheer inefficiency must not be allowed to send up the price of goods which consumers must buy.  If inefficiency and laziness result in the production of an article at a price higher than it would cost if the industry were producing for the entire home market, then there has got to be an examination and a review of the whole position.</P>
    <P>May I conclude by saying that we are offering the House on this matter a first-class tribunal?  It will be composed of vigilant citizens charged with a special task.  There will be no question of dealing with applications for increases in a manner weighted in favour of giving increases.  We propose to institute a price freeze as well, but both these things will be done quickly and there will be price control over a wide range of commodities.  We propose that should anybody get through that net and still make extra profits, these extra profits will be raked off for the benefit of the community.  In the world situation through which we are passing, in the critical times that lie ahead, this Government's policy will be, that if there are hardships to be borne and sacrifices to be made, then the greatest hardship and the greatest sacrifices must fall on the backs of those of our people who are better able to bear them than the weak and helpless sections of our community.</P>
    <P>In this debate we had from the Party opposite a declaration that they would vote against this Bill.  I do not mind whether they do or not, but let them know this, when they are doing it: every vote against this Bill is a vote against this new prices tribunal&mdash; something that the Party opposite did not set up; every vote is a vote against price freezing; every vote is a vote against the reimposition of the control on prices and every vote is a vote against the reimposition of the taxation of excess profits.  That is what the Party opposite will be voting against.  That is what they can do if they like and, if they do that, you cannot blame the public outside if they <Col N="1826" /> remember that they fought the last election on industrialists' cheques.</P>

      <P>This is a very short Bill.  Its meaning is clear in the operative section.  I do not think that it will be necessary for me to stress at any length the circumstances that directed us to introduce this Bill.  It is sufficient to say that the lady in question, the widow of the late Lord Mayor, Terence MacSwiney, could have had a pension for the last 26 years.  At that time, she was well blessed with the world's goods.  She did not apply.  Times have changed.  Her circumstances are different.  Hence this Bill.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the Minister has brought in this Bill.  What I feel about it is that it is a pity that the Bill was not more comprehensive in its scope so as to cover other persons very similarly placed.  This country owes a duty to itself to see that the widows and the children of persons who laid down their lives for the country are reasonably looked after.  That is why I would have liked if the Bill, instead of being limited to one individual, were wider in its scope.  I am sure it is only necessary to mention to the Minister, in that connection, that it is time a more comprehensive measure was introduced that would make provision for the widows and the children of the persons I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>There is some provision in another Bill for widows of the men who signed the Proclamation of 1916 and who were executed.  There is a general feeling that that Bill should be extended to cover the children of those persons, and I would avail of this opportunity to press on the Minister the necessity for bringing in a more comprehensive Bill of the scope I have mentioned that will make proper provision for those particular people.</P>
      <P>Question agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 17 to delete &ldquo;1952&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;1951&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see no reason why this Bill should be continued in its present form for a period of two years.  The practice was in this House in respect of legislation of this kind for a Bill to be continued from year to year and there is a very particular reason why the House should not extend the scope of this measure beyond one year.  I pointed out on the Second Stage of this Bill that the Opposition would not be prepared to allow this Bill through at all if there were any other safeguards left to the public, but the position was, if we opposed this Bill, that there would be no machinery whereby the people in houses and the people who are being exploited could get any possible protection.  Therefore, we are forced to agree to this measure as a temporary measure, but <Col N="1828" /> there is no good reason why we should give the Minister a blank cheque until December, 1952, in connection with this measure.</P>
    <P>We have already pointed out that there are three main matters that the Minister or the Government has to deal with in this measure.  They are&mdash; the question of furnished lettings, the question of temporary convenience lettings and the question of new houses built since 1941.  The Minister and the Government, by referring this matter to a commission, have simply shirked their responsibility.  There is no reason why the House should continue to allow the Government or the Minister to shirk their responsibility in this matter for a day longer than is necessary.  We pointed out to the Minister before that the Government could make up its mind on these three vital issues that are agitating the public mind in 24 hours, if they wanted to.</P>
    <P>There are other matters which this commission may deal with, but on these three vital questions that the public are concerned with, it is a matter of yes or no.  Are the Government prepared to cut out furnished lettings from the protection afforded by the increase of rent code?  If they are, the Minister could do it in this Bill.  Are they prepared to stop this loophole in the increase of rent code as regards temporary convenience?  If they are prepared to do that, they can do it by one line in the Bill.  Are they prepared to control houses erected since 1941?  If they are, they can do it in the Bill.  There is no reason why these three matters should be sent to any commission, except one obvious reason, and that is that the Minister or the Government is afraid or is unprepared to give a lead to the country.</P>
    <P>We feel that we are forced by the vacillation of the Government to allow this legislation through as it is, as a temporary measure, but we must allow it through only for the shortest possible time.  Is there any reason why the Minister cannot make up his mind, irrespective of the commission, before the end of next year?  Why does he want to continue this measure to December, 1952?  He assured the House <Col N="1829" /> that the commission now sitting will have its report in very shortly and that there will be no undue delay.  Then why take power here to prolong this measure for two years?  Is there any reason why this Bill should be continued so long?  If it is true what the Minister states, that he expects to have a report from the commission in a short time, then there is no necessity to have this Bill continued so long.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the experience of the House has been that the previous commission on this subject took five years to report.  The experience of the House in respect of the plethora of commissions that we have had from this Government is somewhat similar.  We are waiting still to hear from many of them.  I am afraid the same will happen in connection with this commission. Therefore, I urge on the House, in view of the urgent need of a decision on these three vital matters, not to give the Minister power to continue this law for another two years. If it were only for 12 months we would have something to hope for.  It would give Deputies a chance to review the position in connection with the tribunal that has been set up.  We can ask the Minister the why and the wherefore if nothing has been done.  Surely, December, 1951, is quite long enough to give the Government a chance of making up its mind on this question?</P>
    <P>If this amendment is not accepted, and if the Minister wants to insist on continuing this legislation to December, 1952, I want to impress on every Deputy that those who vote against the amendment will be voting for a continuance of the exploitation of those people who are being exploited in this city and elsewhere throughout the country through this gag of furnished lettings; they will be voting for a continuance of the hardships on people who have been afforded temporary convenience and they will be voting for a continuance of the hardships among the people who have been exploited through the scarcity of housing and the people who are suffering because their houses have not been controlled since 1941.  Every Deputy who votes against the amendment will be voting for the policy of putting these vital matters on the long finger.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1830" /> Every Deputy knows that there is no justification for referring these three vital questions to a commission.  There is no justification for the Government waiting until December, 1952, to deal with these vital issues.  I recommend this amendment to the House and I suggest the House should extend this measure only until December, 1951.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an aspect of this case put by Deputy Moran which, I think, should bring Deputies, from Dublin in particular, to urge the Minister to consider the amendment very seriously.  The Minister knows very well that the mere enacting of a continuation law is a very simple matter.  In the case of an essential continuation Act there is never any delay, so that there is really no case for having a two-year period here unless the Minister thinks that this Act is going to run as it is for two years.  If there is going to be any radical amendment of the Act&mdash;if there is likely to be&mdash;in the course of the coming year, surely the sensible thing is to have this Act applying only for one year, which is the ordinary custom?</P>
      <P>It is true that the Act initially was for five years, but it was then thought that its provisions would be required over five years and it was enacted for that period with the positive intention of covering those five years.  Here the question is simply one of continuing an enactment and the ordinary procedure has been to do that for one year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it did, but I would like to check up on it.  Nobody can be blamed for drawing the conclusion that the Minister and the Department do not anticipate any radical change in the legislation for two years. If that is so, then the tribunal that has been set up must be regarded to some extent as window dressing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned Dublin.  I wonder does the Minister realise&mdash;if he does not, he can ask representatives of the Dublin constituencies sitting beside him and <Col N="1831" /> on his flank&mdash;that the problem of rents is as serious and has evoked as much public interest as the problem of the cost of living?  Does the Minister realise that?  Representing, as he does, a rural constituency, he may not. Therefore, I ask him to inform himself on that matter.</P>
    <P>I hasten to add that the problems involved appear to be extremely difficult. There are the problems of corporation houses and the Rent Acts. There are the problems of furnished lettings and the Rent Acts.  It is only since I came into the House that another type of problem was mentioned to me.  Are we to take from the fact that the Minister has provided for a two years' period that he does not anticipate being in a position to deal with these problems inside two years? If the Minister is serious, the proper thing to do is to adopt Deputy Moran's amendment and continue this for a year.  If anything unforeseen happens, he has only to bring in another continuation Bill and that will give Deputies a chance of discussing the matter with the Minister and, through Deputies, it will give the people who are affected by these problems an opportunity of having it dealt with in a place where it can be discussed in a routine and proper manner.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows, problems of this nature can only be satisfactorily discussed on some legislation.  If I attempt to raise this matter by way of question, I will have only half an hour and in that period the Minister must get ten minutes, so that discussion of the problem will be restricted to half an hour, of which period the Minister must have ten minutes.  In that way I am precluded from dealing as I would like to with such problems if I can only raise them on the Adjournment.  If I tried to raise the matter on the Minister's Estimate, he would appeal to the Chair, and the Chair would rule, as it has ruled, that legislation cannot be discussed on a Minister's Estimate. Therefore, if the Minister succeeds in putting off the day of reckoning for two years he muzzles the lot of us from talking on the Rent Acts, short of doing so by means of a Private Deputy's motion.  The Government, I <Col N="1832" /> know, has control over Government time, and we all know how long it takes to get a motion in Private Deputy's time taken.  If the Minister, note the &ldquo;if&rdquo;, by, shall I say, evil design were to set himself out to preclude further discussion, or of dealing with this problem for two years, he could hardly do it in any better way than by enacting a Bill to continue the status quo for a year, and avoid thereafter having it raised on the motion on the Adjournment in an inadequate way, or on his own Estimate, discussion on which would be precluded.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will take our submissions on this in the spirit in which they have been given.  I have outlined these points not in any sense of making an accusation against the Minister, but rather to indicate what can be the result of a two-year period. I can see absolutely no objection whatever to making it a one-year period.  It would cost the House very little time to enact a recontinuance Act a year hence if that should be necessary.  All the blandishments of the Minister, and his references to the new tribunal, are only to be rivalled by the references to the prices tribunal.  Surely, we may expect to have this problem dealt with, so far as the Minister can deal with it, well within the next year.  There will be three sessions before this time next year.  I think, therefore, that the case which Deputy Moran has made is unanswerable. I have added my few remarks principally to stress the urgency of the situation from the point of view of the problems occurring in Dublin, and to point out to the Minister that these problems are as serious in their effect as the problem of rising prices is in Dublin at the moment.  If the Minister does not believe me he can refer to Deputies who are supporting him in this House.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister as a gesture of good faith and of his earnestness and as a sign that the fears that have been expressed in regard to the efficiency of this advisory body, are without foundation. I think the Minister could very well get up and say that he is accepting the amendment.  He could say that without doing what he had to do on another Bill&mdash;to fight it and then <Col N="1833" /> turn around, when public opinion was against him and accept the amendment. He knows the amendment that I refer to&mdash;the one on the Courts of Justice Bill.  He did that when he felt that he was being coerced by public opinion.  As regards the City of Dublin and its environs, I can assure the Minister that public opinion, if nothing else, will coerce him into tackling this problem before the year is out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a case for having this Bill for one year only.  The point was raised by Deputy Moran that houses built since 1941 have not been controlled.  I remember they were deliberately left out at the time the Consolidation Act of 1946 was passed.  We felt that if they were controlled there would be no houses built for letting.  I remember saying at the time that if we got complaints of overcharges for newly built houses, the question of extending control to them would be considered.  I wonder if the Minister has got any complaints.  I thought that he would have given us some information on that point when he brought forward this Bill, that is as to what has been the effect of not controlling houses built since 1941.  Everyone realised at that time that in the case of houses built in the conditions which then obtained&mdash;the cost of building had increased, and the cost of materials and wages had increased&mdash;it would be impossible to let them at the same rent as houses built earlier.  I should be glad to have some information on that point from the Minister. Can he tell us if many houses have been built for letting since 1941, and whether he has had any complaints in regard to overcharging, having regard to the greatly increased cost of building?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first Rent Restrictions Act was passed as a war measure.  The way in which the Dáil proceeded at that time was that each year for four or five years a Bill was brought in which reduced the valuation limit of houses that were controlled.  Take a house of £60 valuation.  I do not think that the people who would be prepared to rent such a house need any protection.  I thought so at the time.  Still we did <Col N="1834" /> not know how things would turn out. We decided that we would control houses up to £60 valuation in the City of Dublin and the Borough of Dún Laoghaire, and £40 elsewhere.  I should imagine that, by this time, that so far as Dublin is concerned, the Minister would be justified in reducing the valuation to £45.  A house with that valuation is a pretty big house. In the country, it would be a very big one indeed.  If houses are to be built for letting, the Minister will have to consider reducing the valuation limit.  I have been told by people with fairly good incomes, who are not in a position to buy a house, that if they could get one of that type for letting they would take it.</P>
    <P>I know, of course, people are afraid to let houses now because as soon as one does that, one might as well hand the house over to the person who rents it.  I realise that we had to have a Rent Restrictions Act.  Those who remember the period before the first great war are quite well aware that it was quite easy to get a house in any part of Dublin for letting.  Since the Rent Restrictions Act was passed, there has been a reluctance on the part of people to let houses.</P>
    <P>On the general question of postponing this for two years, I think the Minister has a very bad case.  When I was Minister, hardly a month passed that I did not get demands from the Opposition about furnished lettings. This Government has now been in office for nearly three years, and it has not made any move to do anything. I know it is a very difficult problem. They found in England that there was no cut-and-dried way of solving it. What they did was to set up regional tribunals, each area being treated differently.  I am not saying that that would be an easy thing to do here, but I do say there is no necessity for this commission.</P>
    <P>I have to agree with those who say that this is simply shelving responsibility. By taking a two-year period, the Minister is giving an indication to the commission that he does not expect to hear from them for two years.  When I was in his place, I was persecuted about this matter.  We have <Col N="1835" /> asked very few questions about it because we knew the difficulties. There was no such consideration, however, when we were the Government. As I say, the problem is well known, and the Minister should be able to say definitely whether he is going to do anything about it or not.  He ought to know that by now.  I know we could not have remained much longer in office without coming to a decision. This is merely shelving the responsibility.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Moran said, we know how long a commission takes to consider a matter.  I am not going to blame the commission for that because, to get a proper commission, it is necessary to get people from practically every walk of life.  They are busy people who do their work voluntarily.  In the case of a judge, he has a lot of other work to do and can only attend in his spare time.  Consequently, it will take a long time to come to a decision, if we are to judge by other commissions. Some which were set up in our time have not reported yet.  A couple of years before we went out of office there were a couple of commissions and we are still awaiting their report. This is simply a device for doing nothing.  At the very outside, in two years' time another general election will be due.  I do not think this Parliament will last very much longer than two years.  It will be somebody else's responsibility then.  That is the best proof that that is what the Minister is up to, but it will not work.  I think we ought to accept this amendment and make it one year.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will tell us what has been the effect of the Housing Bill, 1946.  Has he any information as to how many houses were built for letting?  I doubt very much if there have been many houses built for letting.  If he has not that information, I will understand it.  Before he brought in this Bill, however, he ought to have fortified himself with that information because he must have expected that somebody would ask that question. Have there been any houses built for letting, apart from corporation or local authorities' houses?  I think there was <Col N="1836" /> an amendment, when I was Minister, seeking to put these local authority houses under the Rent Restrictions Act.  I would not agree to that at the time and I would not be in favour of it now.  I do not think there is any case for it.  I certainly took that stand. If the Minister is taking the same stand now, I will support him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Deputy A Deputy">

      <P>But he is in the Government now and he knows a lot more, or at least he has to admit that he knows, although he probably knew it then.  He has to admit now that he knows the other side of the problem.  I certainly would not support in our Party bringing in corporation houses or local authority houses, because, if you did, you would find that a lot of local authorities would not go on with building.  If the Minister is going to bring that in, I think he would be very foolish, but I know he will not.  I do not see any reason why he should not accept this amendment for one year. When a Rent Restrictions (Amendment) Act was passed formerly it was done for the purpose of extending the Act for a year and reducing the valuation limit to something like £30.  It became dangerous then and the Government stopped, and I think they were right. I think the £60 valuation was too high and also the £40 valuation in the country.</P>

The Minister, I am sure, will appreciate <Col N="1837" /> that the three problems mentioned by Deputy Moran and Deputy de Valera are urgent, and much more urgent in the city, of course, than they are in the country.  While I can sympathise with the case being made for this amendment, and while I can see good reason in the case being made, at the same time, in view of what the Minister has stated with regard to his intention to give us a completely new Rent Restrictions Act, I would be inclined to give him the two years he asks for, particularly as the new Act can, of course, repeal the continuing Act.  I think that that ought to meet the case which is being made.  I am sure Deputies opposite know that the Minister is as appreciative of the urgency of the problem as they are.  It would be, perhaps, inconvenient to extend the Act for just one year.  It may be that in 15 months from now the Minister will be in a position, as a result of the report from the tribunal, to introduce the new measure.</P>

I am not asking him to do too much when I ask him to accept the amendment, because it will provide an opportunity of reviewing this matter at least every 12 months.  There is nothing new in that. We had a Temporary Provisions Act in regard to the Army which, in its own way, was a most important Act. It provided an opportunity of reviewing and it also provided the Minister <Col N="1838" /> with the opportunity of coming in every 12 months and bringing in the necessary amendments that he thought desirable.  I will not suggest that the Minister wants to shirk discussion.  I know him well and I do not believe he would shirk discussion.  It is because of that fact that I appeal to him not to dogmatise on this matter now but to provide us with the opportunity of reviewing the situation annually.</P>

I have set up this commission and I have asked them to report upon certain aspects.  On the Second Reading here I gave an undertaking to certain Deputies on the Opposition Benches that if in the interval there was any particular aspect of the Rent Restrictions Act that, in their opinion, required immediate amendment I was prepared to carry out their wishes though I object to piecemeal legislation.  At the behest of certain members of the Opposition I brought in here an amendment to the principal Act when a case was made for that amendment and when I was satisfied that hardships had arisen or were likely to arise in the future.  Deputy Boland says we should come to a decision upon this matter very quickly.  I think the Opposition Deputies did come to a decision because the Opposition brought in the 1947 Act.</P>

Being a Minister, I suppose I am precluded from giving evidence before the commission, but I do know something about the problem. I am satisfied that the whole question requires urgent review, but I am equally satisfied that a year is too short, and that it would not be sufficient in which to make the necessary examination or give the commission an opportunity to report and subsequently examine the proposals they will make, and then frame the necessary legislation arising out of that report.  As I said when I was introducing this Bill, I could have put it into the Expiring Laws Bill for another year.</P>

The only objection is that it is too short.  I appeal to the Deputies on the Opposition Benches not to make the whole thing ineffective.  Instead of their appealing to me to reduce it to 12 months, I appeal to them to give me the time that is required and I assure the House that, provided I am Minister, I shall do everything in my power to give effect to the legislative proposals that are required within the two-year period.  That is as reasonable a statement as I can make.  It is necessary that the legislation should continue. It is necessary that no hardship should be inflicted on anyone and that no unjust or unreasonable burden should be put upon any section of the community.  It is reasonable that the community should get an opportunity of explaining their needs and their demands before a commission.  I am taking therefore, as I say, the most reasonable line that can be taken.  I want to do everything in the most efficient way possible.</P>

Deputy Timoney said it would be a very nice thing to wait two years and he is quite prepared to give that time.  The answer to Deputy Timoney is that he is not living in Dublin City under furnished lettings; he is not living here in Dublin sitting under a letting for temporary convenience; he is not living in a house where, if the rent goes up, he must either get out or pay the increased rent; he is not in the unfortunate position in which young married people in Dublin find themselves where, if there is a <Col N="1842" /> family, they are thrown out, whether they like it or not, due to the fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that these gaps are left in our legislative code.  We have not heard one word from the Minister in justification of continuing this legislation for a period of two years.  The only admission we got from him was that he realises the matter is urgent. If the matter is urgent, why not agree to the amendment?  If the matter is urgent, should he not appreciate that it should come before the House for discussion before 12 months?  If he wants to introduce legislation as a result of the findings of this commission there is nothing in this Bill, even if it limited to a period of 12 months, to stop him from doing so.  We have no objection to this commission sitting until Tib's eve and making representations on the finer points and the niceties of the law from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three vital matters affecting the public throughout the country which could be dealt with inside 24 hours.  The Minister knows that.  It takes no commission to make up his mind in connection with these matters. It is a question as to whether he or the Government will make up its mind. It is all very well for him to say that he realises the matter is urgent.  If it is urgent it is poor consolation to the sufferers to be told that in the fullness of time, in a period of two years, on the eve of the next general election the Minister will introduce legislation to deal with these urgent and pressing problems.  I think it is quite clear from what the Minister has said that he can make no possible case for the extension of this Bill until December, 1952, except the fact that now emerges that the Minister does not want to face this issue until 1952.  He does not want the House to face this issue again during the lifetime of the present Dáil. I would ask Deputies from the city who realise, as I realise, that this matter is urgent, to exert their influence on the Minister so that he may see reason in the matter.  If the Minister accepts the amendment, we can have a discussion <Col N="1843" /> of these matters in 12 months' time.  I, personally, am not hoping for a discussion of this matter in 12 months' time.  I think the Minister could still introduce legislation which would enable us to have a discussion in the next session on these three vital problems and let the commission bring in its report in its own good time.  I think that if the Minister is prepared to face up to these problems, we could still have legislation introduced.</P>

      <P>Extending the Bill for two years means putting these problems in Limbo for the next two years and preventing the House from discussing them for the next two years. We shall then hear people going around the country saying that some kind of Bill is to be introduced and we shall have more of these speeches at election times about what is going to be done for the people who are suffering hardship as a result of ground rents. The Minister will say that he is awaiting the report of the commission which may possibly never report.</P>
      <P>If I could have put down an amendment continuing this legislation only for three months or six months, I would have done so.  Why does the Minister, if he has any serious intention of dealing with these problems, seek to continue the present legislation for a two-year period?  I think the Minister has made no answer for the case to the amendment, and I would impress particularly on city Deputies that if the Bill is continued in operation for a period of not more than 12 months, we shall be able to make the Minister account for his stewardship in this connection at the end of that period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in the position that I cannot see how the acceptance of this amendment would better the position one whit in so far as the vital and pressing problems to which Deputy Moran referred are concerned.  I do not think that there is a great deal in the amendment <i>per se</i> nor do I think that there is any great validity in the Minister's objection to it.  In so far as the vital problems are <Col N="1844" /> concerned, they are not affected by the acceptance or rejection by this House of the amendment.  A lot of the discussion and the references which we have had, while it has been useful to have the observations, have not, to my mind, been strictly relevant to the question posed by the amendment at all.  If I thought the rejection of the amendment gave the Minister <i>carte blanche</i> to put all these problems into Limbo for two years, I would be opposed to it, but Deputy Moran knows as well as I do that rejection or acceptance of the amendment does not affect the issue one whit.  I think quite frankly that the Minister might have adhered to the normal procedure and asked for an extension of the Bill for a further period of 12 months, but the Minister has given us certain reasons for not doing so.  They are not terrifically cogent, but I do not think that the point at issue between Deputy Moran and the Minister is one of very great importance.  What is important is that we should have from this tribunal at as early a date as possible a report which would enable the Minister to bring in a comprehensive measure dealing with all the problems involved.  There are gaps to be closed and I think that I would probably be in a position to support Deputy Moran or any other Deputy who came along with an interim measure to close some of the gaps pending the receipt of the tribunal's report.  I do not think that the question whether these powers are to be continued until 1952 rather than to 1951 affects the issue, good, bad or indifferent.  The argument made by Deputy Moran is one with which I am in complete sympathy, but it bears no relation to the case made for the amendment.</P>

      <P>May I, for the benefit of Deputy Con Lehane, who was not here when the point was made, repeat the case made for the amendment? The next occasion upon which this House will have an opportunity of adequately discussing this matter will be one of two&mdash;namely, the occasion on which the Minister introduces a Bill or some other measure relating to it, or the occasion on which this Bill <Col N="1845" /> comes up for renewal again.  Questions are inadequate to raise the matter sufficiently, and on the Estimates the matter is out of order.  Therefore, as I have said&mdash;and the Minister knows that in this matter I am making no accusation against him; I am only bringing it forward hypothetically; I do not think it is the Minister's intention&mdash;if the Minister were trying to put this on the long finger and to avoid discussion for another two years, he could hardly have chosen a better method.  On the other hand, I do think it desirable that within a year we should have a chance of discussing the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be a very effective outlet, shall I say, on occasion. Everybody will understand if the Minister is up against an insuperable difficulty in introducing a new Bill that he can come in with a continuation Bill, and I remember Ministers having done that before, bringing in Bills to continue the existing legislation for a period, and it was taken as the normal procedure.  That being so, I see no reason for departing from precedent in this case.  May I say in reply to Deputy Lehane, that he has a formula which he seems frequently to use? I have just taken it down.  I wonder does the Deputy realise how often he brings it up: &ldquo;If I thought so-and-so I would be against the Bill.&rdquo;  That is a favourite phrase of the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lehane will pardon me but I have noticed that he uses very often this convenient phrase, for evading responsibility, if you like.  Perhaps I have a certain amount of sympathy with Deputy Lehane, sitting behind a Government that does not always act in accordance with Deputy Lehane's professions.  For that reason I can understand his difficulty. The point is that, whether Deputy Lehane thinks anything or does not think anything, the hard fact remains that if this Bill is passed it will <Col N="1846" /> depend completely on the Minister as to whether we will have a chance of discussing this matter generally within two years.  I wonder are people satisfied with that.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lehane's approach is <i>non ad rem,</i> and I had better get back to the Bill.  There is that serious objection.  There is something more serious arising out of what the Minister said last, and it is this: The Minister says: &ldquo;I think it will take two years.&rdquo;  In fairness to the Minister, I must say that I understand him to say that it will take two years to produce the Bill which it is his ambition to produce.</P>

    <Col N="1847" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  To get the Bill that it is his ambition to produce, the perfect thing, will take him two years.  There are two comments on that.  Unfortunately, if one waits for perfection, one never does anything. One has to do the best one can.  The Minister can be fairly certain that, no matter what he does, with these difficult problems particularly, his remedy will not be perfect, any more than his predecessor's remedy was perfect, or any more than all the legislation that was passed in this Parliament and the British Parliament in relation to this very difficult matter was perfect.  So that, from that point of view, the Minister is, shall I say, deluding himself.</P>
      <P>There is another matter.  The Minister hastened to add to that the suggestion that he will deal with urgent matters.  Already, the urgent matters have been enumerated for him.  Already strong expressions of opinion from various quarters have been made on these urgent matters.  This commission, if it is to be effective, should be in a position to report on these.  The Minister, here and now, before he leaves the House, could write down a list, referring them to the tribunal, and get a quick answer.  If that is the Minister's intention, it would be considered letting him have his two years for his perfect Bill, provided he undertook, enumerating the matters that he would deal with&mdash;furnished lettings, local authority houses and these other matters&mdash;to deal with them separately because, if the Minister's suggestion that he will deal with them means anything, it means that he will bring in legislation to deal with them <i>ad hoc</i> in the interim period, that is if he is not trying to fob me and everybody else off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is the position, I suggest to the Minister that before we close this debate to-night he should indicate that in cases of the problems that have been mentioned he will act within the next year or so.  Remember that this date in the Bill plus the Minister's statement in the House is an indication to landlords and tenants alike that the status quo will remain as it is generally for two years and it is only fair to those people who are affected by these <Col N="1848" /> problems that they should have some idea of their prospects.</P>
    <P>The Minister has issued some kind of vague warning in respect of 1941 houses.  It is relatively vague.  But, even that vague warning will have its effect and it would be highly desirable, if he is waiting for his completely revised legislation for two years, that he would give some indication of what the attitude in regard to these pressing problems is.  That will be fair to both parties.  It will enable tenants to look ahead and it will enable landlords to look ahead and will obviate a great deal of possible friction in between.  If the Minister simply leaves these problems in the air, with the prospect that they will not be tackled for two years, there is a temptation to both parties to this difficult problem to do the best they can for themselves, which is probably the best thing for neither party in the long run.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons, and particularly having regard to the attitude of those Deputies&mdash;I say it in all seriousness&mdash;like Deputy Timoney and Deputy Lehane, who have manfully supported their Minister in this amendment, having regard to the very weakness of the case that they can put up, the Minister should be convinced that this is not a thing that he should fight about, that the more sensible thing, the thing that would command most public confidence, the thing that would give the greatest earnest of his determination to tackle this problem, would be to say, like a good soldier: &ldquo;Yes, I am going to do this thing in a year, the serious part of it anyway.  I will face it within the year, and I will take the amendment.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I cannot understand the objection to this amendment. It is agreed by the Minister that this matter is urgent.  Dublin Deputies have known for a long time how urgent some of these questions are, particularly the question of furnished flats and temporary convenience lettings.  If we pass this Bill as it stands, it means that for two years we will have no really effective way of raising this question and if, at the end of two years, the commission has not reported or, the commission having reported, legislation is not ready, it will mean <Col N="1849" /> that the Bill will have to be further continued.  We are, unfortunately, inured to that sort of thing.  It is with the object of trying to prevent that and to ensure that at least the question will be dealt with within two years that I favour the introduction of a period of one year so that, instead of anticipating a period of two years, the Minister, his officials and the commission will anticipate one year and will take it that they must have the measure ready in one year.  One year would be quite long enough and too long for a number of people who are suffering.  These are my reasons for supporting the amendment.  The question is so urgent that an effort should be made to deal with it in one year. There has been long consideration about it.  Two and a half years ago the Minister told us, in reply to questions, that the matter was under consideration. It may continue under consideration for the whole of the next two years.</P>

      <P>As I told the <Col N="1850" /> House, it is imperative that the facts of the situation would be established beyond yea or nay.  We had in the House this evening statements from Deputies expressing various points of view.  What are the facts?  Deputy Boland, Deputy Moran or Deputy de Valera do not know.  As regards furnished flats, we have had certain information, but again, as everybody knows, information and facts very often differ, and differ substantially.</P>
      <P>I have told the House that a year is too short.  I could, if I liked, ask for a year and fool the people into thinking I was going to do it in the year. I hope to do it within the year, but I am not going to bind myself to that period.  I am binding myself to this, that within the two years not only will the necessary legislation be drafted, but it will be put through the House. That is reasonable and anything else, in my opinion, is unreasonable.  I have also given a pledge to Deputy Briscoe, that if any member of the Opposition brings me substantial evidence to show that there is something that requires urgent legislation, I will be prepared to consider it and to act with the same speed as in the other case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>In his introductory statement the Parliamentary Secretary was at great pains to show that the price control machinery had operated effectively and efficiently up to recently.  He dilated at some length on that point.  In striking contrast with that, it was interesting to hear a quite contrary note in many of the speeches that were made from the benches behind him.  Some of the speeches that I listened to last week made me feel that I was back again in the period before the change of Government.  One would think that Deputy Lemass was still Minister for Supplies, and that Fianna Fáil was the Government, because all the attacks seemed to be in that direction, and that, even now, the Parties who had directed for so long a period their attacks against the Fianna Fáil Administration could hardly shed their minds of the impression that a change had not taken place.</P>
      <P>We were told that price control had worked quite effectively until the blast came from Korea.  Devaluation was also mentioned.  Was not the decision to devalue our money taken by the Government on their own initiative? If devaluation has proved to be a curse rather than a blessing, would the Government not take the responsibility for the decision themselves?  If the position which has arisen out of the Korean war is to be offered as an excuse for the recent increases in prices, is it not permissible to ask why there was so much uninformed and prejudiced criticism of the Fianna Fáil Administration on these matters when war was somewhat nearer to us than far away Korea and when the whole world, in fact, was locked in a life and death struggle and ships had a very restricted part of the oceans on which to voyage to get the supplies which were needed?  Of course the position has proved that the machinery set up by Fianna Fáil was quite effective except in the most abnormal circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very difficult to know what provisions the Dáil is asked to vote on since the Tánaiste made his speech this evening.  He told us that a tribunal is being set up.  I understand that the body to be set up will not have the powers usually given to a tribunal, that it will merely act in an advisory capacity.  In any event, the Tánaiste said that there was going to be a complete and general freezing of prices.  One would like to ask why the Tánaiste came in almost at the last moment to make this sensational announcement, because there is nothing in the Bill which provides for the freezing of the prices and it is quite obvious from a reading of the Bill that the body to be set up will not be given any such powers.  If, in its advisory capacity, it recommends to the Government that there should be a freezing of prices, the decision to freeze or not to freeze&mdash;there are a great many people freezing at the present time because of coalition <Col N="1855" /> policy&mdash;will still be a matter for the Government.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the attitude of Deputies would be if this Bill when we received it contained a far-reaching proposal of that sort.  Without in any way wanting to be offensive to the Tánaiste, I want to say quite frankly that I do not accept his statement that there is going to be a freezing of prices. I believe that it has been introduced by him because the Bill is regarded by a number of his supporters on the Government Benches as being quite inadequate for its purpose, particularly in view of recent developments.</P>
    <P>A great many of the criticisms I listened to last week were criticisms of racketeers.  I do not think this measure is calculated or designed to deal with the activities of racketeers.  In connection with that matter, I should like to remind Deputies how we dealt with racketeers when we were able to prove rackets against them.  I should like to remind them further how that was criticised in this House and that it was very effective when it was applied. When Fianna Fáil went to the extent of using the power of the Military Court to check this racketeering, we remembered what was said then.  We were told that it was tyrannical and unconstitutional.  If we are to believe some of the statements made on this Bill, some of the Deputies would go much further than we went then.</P>
    <P>Of course the question of prices cannot be discussed without relation to the question of supplies.  I think that is obvious.  The war has been over since 1945 and there has been a much freer flow of trade for the last three years since this Government came in than there was at any period during the war. Surely then the supplies situation ought not be as stringent as it is at present, either supplies from overseas or from our own resources.  Take the question of agricultural products.  Many of the complaints at the present time have relation to foodstuffs which we are capable of producing ourselves.  There has been a great deal of boasting about the increase of agricultural products. Very often the administration of a Government is likened to budgeting <Col N="1856" /> for a household.  What would be said of the head of a house if he allowed the sustenance of the household to run out on account of high prices, and if the members of his family were to be left hungry?  We boast about the increase in the export of agricultural products.  Even if that export is necessary to buy other goods, when we come to the position that exists at present there should be a recasting of views about it.</P>
    <P>Let us relate that question of exports to the devaluation of money. We have not been told in any great detail by the financial experts why devaluation was necessary at the time it took place.  We are told now that we are feeling the effects of it.  I believe there was a time when the Irish pound, without any official action, did fetch more in exchange across the Atlantic than the English pound.  If there had not been devaluation, is it not obvious that we could get as big an income from a smaller volume of agricultural exports and, in consequence, have more to go round at home among our own people?  That applies to any of the foods that we export.</P>
    <P>Wool has been mentioned here and we have been charged with taking up two different attitudes in regard to it. We were challenged and we were told that our remarks about wool being permitted to soar in price was an attack on the farmers.  We know that when Fianna Fáil was in office wool was controlled. We know the lambasting the Fianna Fáil Administration received because of their action in that connection. The farmers who sell wool did not expect to receive as high a price as 8/9 or 10/- per lb.  In that connection a great deal of jealousy has been created among the farmers themselves because it is not every farmer who has wool to sell.  In my constituency the farmer who has wool to sell in any quantity is fairly comfortably off.  This year his profits have been enormously inflated because of this wool racket and in consequence those farmers who have not enough land on which to produce wool and who have been deprived of other sources of income since the change of Government are looking askance at this wholly irrational wool market.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1857" /> With regard to fuel, I want to try to avoid making the pun that it is a burning question at the present time. It is certainly a topic of prime importance. A very extraordinary thing happened in my constituency this winter.  Turf had to be brought from the centre of Ireland into West Galway. We have often heard about bringing coals to Newcastle.  Importing turf from the midlands to the west of Ireland is something that cannot happen without the people of the west taking serious note of it.  I was told in reply to a question here that the stopping of the hand-won turf industry in the west had nothing to do with the present shortage of fuel that exists there.  On the face of it that is, of course, quite untrue.  When Deputy Beegan was speaking someone interjected that it was we ourselves who stopped the hand-won turf industry. That matter arose on a previous occasion here, and I remember dealing with it exhaustively then in so far as it referred to my own area and to other areas with which I am acquainted.</P>
    <P>If one looks up the Book of Estimates for the year 1948/49, a book prepared by the Fianna Fáil administration although the estimates were actually handled by the present Government, one will find there a sum of almost £2,000,000 for the provision of hand-won turf, turf produced under the auspices of the county councils as well as Bord na Móna.  On looking up the Appropriation Accounts for that year one finds that only £220,000 of that £2,000,000 was spent.  With reference to the question as to whether or not we stopped the hand-won turf industry, I want to state that an organisation for the carrying out of the hand-won turf industry had actually been set up. When the change of Government took place that was dissolved and the men who had been appointed were sent home.  The bogs had been marked out and the stations allocated.  The whole scheme was ready to go into operation. The people who lost their employment as a result of the present Government's decision were not all supporters of Fianna Fáil, as has been proved.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil method of checking <Col N="1858" /> any increase in prices during the emergency and immediately afterwards was that of subsidisation.  Some Government spokesman said here last week that subsidies never really took on any sizable appearance until there was a change of Government.  That, of course, is not true.  We had not, perhaps, got on to the subsidy method of dealing with the cost of living quite as rapidly as the British had, but that is easily understandable.  In any event, from 1939 to 1945 subsidies were increased from £1.4 million to £6.4 million.  In the year 1943 the cost of living was stabilised as a result of these subsidies.  In Britain, subsidies increased from £20,000,000 in 1939 to £250,000,000 in 1945, and they stabilised their cost of living there two years earlier than we did.  The steady increase in subsidies if proof positive of the effective method adopted by the Fianna Fáil Government to check a possible rise in prices.  In the Book of Estimates for 1948-49, the last year for which we prepared Estimates, one finds the very big figure of £12,767,000 for food subsidies alone, a further £1,000,000 for fuel subsidies and almost £2,000,000 for the turf, to which I have already referred.  There has been a drop in these subsidies since then.  I am not including agricultural produce subsidies because they were in existence even before the emergency; but even if they are included, a comparison with the figures since 1948-49 down to the present year shows that there is a tendency to decrease.  Notwithstanding that, the total bill for government, as shown in the Book of Estimates, has gone up by £8,000,000 between 1948-49 and 1950-51.  It was down to £65,000,000 in 1949-50.  It is quite obvious that if a check to prices is to be applied it can only be applied in circumstances such as Fianna Fáil produced by subsidisation, if the Government cannot increase the output sufficiently to make rationing unnecessary. Claims were made here with relation to the reduction of £6,000,000 in taxation.  That £6,000,000, as everybody knows, was imposed by the previous Government who subsidised the essential articles of diet, flour, bread, butter, tea, etc.</P>

    <Title>Agricultural Workers (Weekly Half-holidays) Bill.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points I wish to make to-night and there are a few matters which have been mentioned here upon which I have made a note.  Some Deputies referred to the fact of the increase in wages and also drew attention to the fact that, side by side with that increase, agricultural workers are now getting a week's holidays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that since the advent of the present Government increased wages have been given to farm workers.  It is equally true that farm workers will now, please God, enjoy what they had never hoped to enjoy before the advent of the present Government &mdash;a week's holidays.  Because they will be getting this week's holiday and also because they got an increase of 5/- a week a good while back, Deputies may say that we are putting an added burden on the farmers to the extent of the few shillings involved in giving a half-holiday per week to the worker. Naturally enough we are entitled on the other hand to draw attention to the other side of the picture, and to say, without fear of contradiction, that if the wage of the farm worker is to be considered in its entirety, and if the question of the week's holiday is to be brought too far, the one worker above all others that was treated in a most careless and disgraceful fashion in the past was the farm labourer.  There are Deputies who have been in this House for the last 25 or 26 years but I think that not even the oldest Deputy can stand up and say openly that the farm worker was ever properly paid. The farmer, even in times of prosperity, failed to realise his obligations in so far as his workers were concerned. We can also say that when the farmer had a bad day the whole world knew it but when the farmer got an increase in prices and enjoyed a greater meed of security, no one would be told of the added benefits the farmer <Col N="1861" /> was getting.  Least of all, would the farm worker be told.</P>
    <P>The present rate of £3 per week fixed by the Agricultural Wages Board is by no means sufficient to entitle us to say to the farm workers that because of that wage we cannot ask the farmer to carry the extra burden of a few shillings a week represented by a weekly half-holiday.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that £3 a week was the minimum wage.  That is correct, but as I have told the Minister it is futile for us to imagine that even a small percentage of the farm workers are getting more than £3.  It is correct that in certain regions farm workers may be getting more than that, but I say here openly, that not alone in South Cork for which I happen to be one of the Deputies, but in many parts of County Cork and adjoining counties, the truth is that there is a good percentage of these workers not getting even £3.  I know that the Minister's answer may be why I do not report it, but we have to face everyday life as we know it.  I know of many instances of farm workers who are married and who have young families and who have certain obligations to these families. Because a labourer happens to be living in a labourer's cottage in a certain district and has no hope of getting a cottage in some other locality, he cannot get security and a genuine wage in his own area.  Through the Chair, may I remind the Minister that I am not dealing with fancies, that there have been instances where personally I had the responsibility and acted up to it of reporting a case where the minimum wage was not being paid.  Unfortunately, the result was that no farmer in that parish would employ the man concerned afterwards.  Of course, the old law of supply and demand had something to say to it.  The supply was greater than the demand and so long as the supply is greater than the demand in any part of the Twenty-Six Counties, farmers will definitely victimise a man because he asks for what he is entitled to, the minimum wage established by law.</P>
    <P>May I mention one other difficulty to the Minister.  In fairness to him I will give credit to the Minister for saying that he hoped that every farmer who <Col N="1862" /> could do so would give a half-day to the workers.  Actually, the position less than two years ago was that many farmers were giving a half-day.  They believed at that time that a half-day was compulsory, but when they found out that it was not compulsory, they at once stopped giving it.  Travelling through the country we often listen to employers saying at present: &ldquo;We cannot possibly give a half-day,&rdquo; well knowing that for months before they were giving a half-day.  Very often it happens in the country that a man will hold out to see what his neighbour is going to do.  I actually know of instances where farmers were blackmailed by some of their fellow-farmers because they were giving a half-day.</P>
    <P>The point was also made that it would not be well to enact legislation of this character as it would be better to have this concession given as a result of discussion between representatives of farmers and the workers.  I long ago gave expression to my view on that matter.  It is an admirable suggestion, as I told the Minister, but admirable and all as it is, it will not work in many parts of the country&mdash; not because of any fault on the part of the workers or the representatives of the workers, but because the law demands in this country that before any group can negotiate with another group in labour matters it must have a negotiating licence.  The farmers have not got the negotiating licence.  We reminded them of the fact that they could get coverage from farmers in counties such as Dublin.  The trouble in the South is that they have not got the negotiating licence, have no intention of getting a negotiating licence and refused to accept the suggestion that they should get coverage from any other county.  We are, therefore, in the unfortunate position that they can say that they cannot discuss it because the law debars them.  We are faced with that obstacle to a genuine discussion. It would be much easier for us if we could get the other representatives to sit at a conference table and to discuss the matter with us.  I am telling the Minister now that he should not for one moment blame the workers or their representatives but the system.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the <Col N="1863" /> handicap that the fluctuation of prices imposes on farmers.  We have at all times made it clear that we are behind the farming community in their demands for a fair price for their produce.  That is our policy because, when the farmers receive fair prices and fair profits, we can demand a fair proportion of those prices for the workers.  Deputy Martin Corry, speaking on another occasion&mdash;not on this Bill; I notice he is not even in the House&mdash;pointed out that the farmers were in a terrible position, that they were at the mercy of middle men and handlers in buying fertilisers and other essential requirements.  He suggested that farmers should be able to buy and sell at the world prices.  Although at times it is supposed that we are opposed to the farmers and their demands, we agree with many of their demands, but we could never go so far as to support the claim that the farmer should sell at world market prices because it has often happened that, to suit other countries, to suit cartels and combines, world market prices were allowed to drop far below a fair and just level.  We believe that the regulation of prices for agricultural produce should operate internally.</P>
    <P>I will give credit again to the Minister for his approach in the matter of prices for agricultural produce.  The regulation of prices must operate internally and must not depend on external markets or international markets.</P>
    <P>I shall be as brief as I can because we must get this matter decided yes or no.  I noticed to&mdash;day, in connection with certain questions that were put down, that one Deputy was very worried, perhaps he is justified, about the Border, across which our little pigs have been trotting hell for leather for some time past.  I would ask Deputy Smith, through the Chair, does it ever dawn on him that that Border is not closed to human beings?  Did it ever trouble him when agricultural workers had to cross that Border?  Does it even trouble him now if he is hiding behind a ditch, a built-up border of his own and his Party, saying they cannot support the farm workers?  We are <Col N="1864" /> more interested in human beings than in animals.  Those of us who have our names to this Bill, and every member of our Party, are more interested in getting justice for the agricultural worker than other people may be who, when it suits their convenience, give lip service.</P>
    <P>I understand that there will be a free vote on this matter.  A free vote gives everyone the right to act according to his conscience and to express his views, a thing which did not exist in this House for many years up to two years and nine months ago.  I would remind Deputy Smith that the farm workers across the Border, who may be handling the pigs that have been going over, have £4 8s. or £4 10s. a week, not £3, and that if the pigs do not arrive at the end of the 48-hour week the farm worker will not be there to receive them whereas on this side of the Border they would be expected to stick it out, and there would be no such thing as a half-holiday.  We do not thank anyone in opposition for the fact that the farm workers have got a week's holiday.  On one occasion I rejoiced in the spectacle of Deputies, who found pleasure time and time again in attacking the Minister for Agriculture and the agricultural policy of this Government, trotting into the lobby with that Minister saying &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the Labour members in connection with an amendment.</P>
    <P>May I remind the spokesmen of the Opposition that I have in my possession the names of 14 members of the Opposition who are willing and anxious to support this Bill?  If there is to be a free vote on this matter, let them give freedom to the members of their Party, let them for once be entitled to act according to the dictates of conscience, let them demonstrate that they can vote as they wish.  I challenge Deputy Smith on that.  Let him make up for his past misdeeds to-night.  If they decide to abstain from voting, I will leave it to the farm workers of the Twenty-Six Counties to decide whether Fianna Fáil are for or against a half-holiday for farm workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has been interesting from many points of view. <Col N="1865" /> Not the least interesting facet of it has been the fact that we had one contribution from the entire Opposition. Of course, we all know very well that for Deputies coming from rural areas who have got up at election time and persuaded the spalpíní, the farm labourers, to trot down to the polling booths and vote for them, it is very difficult to come along here now and cast their votes, to take a stand on this issue, because it is not a very popular issue with many of them, particularly those of them who may be supported by the farming elements who would not be classed among the small farmers of this country.</P>
      <P>We had a contribution from that giant amongst orators, Deputy Smith. It consisted of a series of questions characteristic of Deputy Smith, who is always seeking information and who has an insatiable appetite for it.  His speech consisted of a series of questions which had nothing whatsoever to do with the substance of this Bill.  It is perfectly obvious to everybody here &mdash;it has been for the past two and three-quarter years&mdash;that the driving force so far as the Deputy is concerned is not anxiety for the agricultural workers, but rather an entirely different emotion, a dislike of the Minister for Agriculture.  I do not think an unworthy emotion of that kind should influence any member of the House in his decision on this Bill.</P>
      <P>We have rested our case for this Bill upon the question of simple justice. We have arrived at the half-century mark in the 20th century and here we are shouting our lungs out in the Parliament of the Republic for four hours as a half-day for an agricultural worker.  I think we should be ashamed of ourselves in this Parliament that we did not do this thing a long time ago. All we are asking is that a man should not be made work like a horse for 54 hours, that his working week should be reduced to 50 hours.  We have not yet got an indication from the Opposition as to what they intend to do.  Deputy Smith was so busy making up the minds of his colleagues that he forgot to indicate what they propose to do.</P>

      <P>There was a motion brought in by Deputy Cogan to refuse this Bill a Second Reading.  As has been perfectly obvious to us all, Deputy Cogan has been gravitating for a considerable time towards the Opposition Benches.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been obvious, too, that Deputy Smith and, I am sure, Deputy Lemass and others, are quite willing to make use of Deputy Cogan as far as they can in order to embarrass this side of the House.  That is quite obvious to everybody.  Deputy Cogan neither made a good case for it nor did he represent the minds of those for whom he professes to speak.  I suppose I am as familiar with the small farmers as any member of the House. Probably there is a great proportion of small farmers&mdash;small in the sense of men working from 10 to 20 acres and who rear families creditably on such farms&mdash;in my constituency than in the constituencies of many other Deputies. <Col N="1867" /> I suppose there are in my constituency as many if not more of that kind of small farmer as there are anywhere in Ireland.  When these farmers, who employ one or two men, first heard of this idea of a half-holiday for agricultural workers, they did not receive it with open arms, they did not receive it kindly, but in time as they put it into practice they found it was quite workable, that there was nothing in it that did any harm to agriculture.</P>
      <P>Every argument raised against the Bill has been an effort to prove that the half-holiday has been impracticable, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, that it would be too great a drain on a farmer's resources.  Deputy Cogan dwelt on the impossibility of the proposal and concentrated on trying to prove, to his own satisfaction at least&mdash; we know the position&mdash;that this proposal would represent an imposition of £13 a year on every farmer.  Of course, that is ridiculous, because every farmer does not employ workers.  The proportion who do employ workers is merely a fraction of the whole.  We all know the majority of farmers are of the small type who employ members of their own families and this Bill would have application only to farmers who employ men for wages; in other words, farmers who employ men who are not members of their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This cannot be said to represent any cash imposition upon a farmer.  He is not asked to pay more money to the workers.  He is asked so to arrange he working week that it will be reduced by four hours in order to afford the agricultural worker, upon whom he is depending, a half-holiday. We do not ask that it should be compulsory that the half-holiday would be on a Saturday.  It would be very desirable if it were on a Saturday, but we appreciate that in every other county as well as in Dublin there must be a certain accommodation whereby a worker would remain to do work that may need to be done on a Saturday afternoon, particularly in the harvest time, if the weather has been inclement on other days.  We appreciate that it might not be possible to enable two agricultural workers who may, for instance, be milkers, to take the half-day <Col N="1868" /> on the same day.  Therefore, there must be a variation.  What we are asking for is that the principle of giving the farm labourer a half-holiday should be written into the Statute Book and made part of the law.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan and his colleague, Deputy O'Reilly, endeavoured to prove &mdash;and a very poor effort it was&mdash;that this proposal would mean a burden upon the farmers.  Deputy Cogan also indicated that in his view this concession, as he described it, could not be given until the volume of agricultural output was substantially increased.  It is interesting to examine just what the position is in relation to agricultural income.  A great deal of nonsense is talked from time to time by those who profess to represent farmers as to what is being done for the farmers of this country.</P>
    <P>The farming community, as such, is getting State aid to the amount of between £10,000,000 and £11,000,000 annually. In 1938, the income of the agricultural community was £35,000,000, and in 1949 it was £100,000,000.  That was no small increase.  It represented an increase of 186 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corry must accept these figures the same as anybody else.  He will find them in an answer given to a recent question by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, nobody sought to disprove them.  Deputy Corry or Deputy Lemass is at complete liberty to do so if he wishes.  Agricultural prices show an increase of 153 per cent. over pre-war prices.  Agricultural incomes have increased by 186 per cent. over pre-war, and prices by 153 per cent.  I agree that, in many cases, a number of our farmers are not getting sufficient, but with the advance of the policy of the present Minister we all hope the day will come when they will get more.  Quite a big number of the farmers of my constituency agree that they never saw a better year than last year, so far as prosperity is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear a great deal about the agricultural workers and their wages. <Col N="1869" /> Deputy Corry is wont to dilate on that at times, but the agricultural workers received an increase of only 123 per cent. since pre-war days.  That is a good deal less than the increase that has taken place either in regard to the incomes of the agricultural community or in regard to prices.  I believe that these figures, which can be examined, are indisputable.  I simply bring them into the discussion to show that Deputy Cogan's argument had very little substance in it.  I am not basing this case on figures or on hours or on minutes of work done.  I am basing it on decency to human beings.</P>
    <P>We have been told, on occasion, that this kind of legislation may drive a wedge between the farm worker and the farmer, and that this question should be left to the goodness of the farmer&mdash;to treat his worker as he thinks he should be treated.  We are told that, if we disturb the harmonious relations which exist in rural Ireland, we will be doing a bad day's work. There is nobody more anxious than I am to maintain these harmonious relations, where they exist.  Harmony is of very little good if you have on the one hand the degree of prosperity represented by the farmers and, on the other hand, the conditions of relative slavery represented by the agricultural workers on the other.  In doing this small thing it seems to me that the Dáil will be doing no more than its duty to what is, as I said before, the largest single group of workers in any single occupation in the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture adopted somewhat the attitude of Tadhg a' dá Thaobh in which he would like to see every farm labourer with a half-holiday and would urge every farmer to give his farm labourers a half-holiday, but would not legislate in that direction.  He put forward the point that it was one thing to provide an amenity for a worker over whom you had direct control and another thing to thrust your view on your neighbour. That was a very plausible argument.  It has always been used to prevent any kind of legislation of a progressive nature.  As the Minister well knows, it seems to me that the real barrier and the real opposition to this legislation <Col N="1870" /> does not spring from any other fact than that these unfortunate agricultural workers are, numerically, in a minority in the country, and that the votes lie with the farmers.  This House is proof positive of that.  The majority of the people of this country are farmers who own bits of land, whether they are small or big, and that for every agricultural worker working for a wage there are five landowners. That is the key to the situation, that some parties or some Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party evidently are afraid that, by passing this legislation, it may mean in some areas a loss of votes to them.  It is, I think, a very sad thing that that yardstick should be applied in this case.</P>
    <P>I think, too, that the Minister in putting forward his view on the matter might easily have gone to the extent of assuring us that he could vote for this measure without having any qualms in so far as the compulsory end of it is concerned.  Every step ever taken to improve workers' conditions eventually had to receive the backing of law.  The nature of the employment of agricultural workers, the manner in which they are scattered through the country, the fact that they work in many caes on their own and that they have not got that sense of collective strength that urban and city workers have&mdash;all these factors indicate that they require special protection and special consideration.  That consideration and that protection can only be afforded by this House by putting into law certain minimum conditions which must be observed so far as they are concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy P.D. Lehane spoke very much along the same lines as the Minister and, in common with every Deputy who spoke on the debate, indicated his great concern for the agricultural workers.  One would almost think it was election times when one heard so much sympathy expressed for the agricultural workers.  How much of that sympathy is going to be expressed in the Division Lobby?  I am quite sure there are amongst Fianna Fáil Deputies many who would like to vote for this measure.  Deputy Burke, my colleague in my constituency, will find himself in <Col N="1871" /> an awkward position if he has to abstain on the instructions of the Party Whip from voting for this measure, or if he has to vote against it.  I would be the last person to take political advantage of Deputy Burke.  So far as the western Deputies are concerned, the less they say about it the better. We know that in the Fianna Fáil days the agricultural workers in the west had half-days every day as a result of Fianna Fáil policy.  I do not propose to detain the House very much longer and I am sure Deputy Smith will be very glad to hear that.</P>

The Deputy referred to very many things, including the road grants of bygone years, a question that is rather worn out now and of very little use.  Deputy Smith and Deputy Lemass, I think, would have been wise to have taken advantage of this measure and voted with the Labour Party, even for political reasons alone.  Unfortunately, they have not displayed that much political foresight and are worried about what the Government are going to do.  We are asking Deputies of all Parties to vote for this Bill.  Any Deputy who does not vote for it, no matter what argument he may put up in regard to Government direction or the lack of a lead from the Minister, will not excuse him from the fact that it is obvious he is using that as a cover to deprive the agricultural workers of a half-holiday.  That will be made plain up and down the country.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Meath Hospital is one of the oldest, and in some respects, one of the most famous medical institutions in Dublin. Originally it was opened on the Coombe in 1753, where it was intended to afford medical assistance to the working population in that neighbourhood. It was moved to Skinner's Alley in 1757; to Meath Street in 1760 and to Earl Street in 1766.  In 1770 the erection of a new building was commenced which now forms part of the Coombe Lying-in Hospital.  In 1774 another hospital was erected by private subscriptions of £2,000, which served as the county infirmary and since 1867 financial grants have been made to the hospital by the Dublin Corporation.  In 1816, the present site in Heytesbury Street was taken.  It formerly belonged to Dean Swift and was called the Dean's Vineyard.  On the 24th December, 1882, the present hospital was opened and £6,000 towards the cost of the building was a gift from a Thomas Pleasants.  The County Dublin granted £5,000 and donations and subscriptions defrayed the balance of the building expenses.  Since that date, 1882, the hospital has continued to serve the sick poor of Dublin unceasingly and the generations of students and nurses who have passed through its wards have brought the medical fame of Dublin and of the Meath Hospital throughout the length and breadth of the civilised world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking back over the work of those who gave their services to the various Dublin hospitals, under conditions far different from those of to-day, I consider that we must record our keen appreciation of the services rendered. Some of the leading men of the then famous Old Dublin School of Medicine were attached to the Meath Hospital. Sir Philip Crampton, William Stokes, R.J. Graves and John Cheyne were amongst the many who served on the staff with distinction.  The first member of the illustrious Stokes family to become associated with the hospital was Whitley Stokes, who was appointed <Col N="1876" /> physician to the hospital in the year 1818.  He it was of whom Wolfe Tone wrote: &ldquo;He was the very best man that I have ever known.&rdquo;  Apart from his medical career, he was a prominent member of the United Irishmen prior to 1792.  His more famous son, William Stokes, was attached to the hospital from 1826 to 1875, and he, together with his colleague, Robert Graves, first instituted the system of clinical instruction at the bedside, which revolutionised medical teaching throughout the world and brought well-merited fame, not only to the Dublin School of Medicine but to the Meath Hospital.  It may indeed be said that Stokes laid the solid foundations for all our present knowledge of the heart, while Graves was the father of all modern glandular therapy.</P>
    <P>In more recent years the Meath Hospital has not failed to keep its position in the forefront of Dublin medicine and, together with St. Laurence's Hospital, was amongst the first of the Dublin institutions to start intensive specialisation within it walls.  It would be impossible to enumerate in detail the development of the Meath Hospital throughout the years, but the hospital has invariably been at the disposal of the sick poor of Dublin, and to-day I am pleased to record that the tradition of this hospital, in the matter of medical science, has been very definitely maintained by a fully qualified medical staff specialising in various treatments.</P>
    <P>No provision was made in the Act of 1816 for a register of electors, that is of Governors or Governesses.  This omission is rectified in the Bill.  Under the Act of 1816 payment of a subscription of £2 2s. 0d. immediately prior to the annual meeting&mdash;and it might be that the payment of £2 2s. 0d. was made while the annual meeting was in progress&mdash;qualified the subscriber to vote for the election of members who would act during the year as the committee controlling the hospital.  Originally, and down to the passing of the Local Government Act, 1898, it was prescribed that an annual general meeting should be held at which the election of the joint committee members took place.  By an Order under the Act of 1898 the election of the joint <Col N="1877" /> committee was ordered to take place triennially.  It might be that a person to qualify as a governor and to be entitled to vote, might subscribe £2 2s. 0d. only in the year of the election provided the subscription was paid prior to the date of the election.</P>
    <P>There is no provision for holding a ballot under the law at present.  This Bill provides:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  That a person to be qualified as an elector for the control of the hospital must have contributed since 1944 £10 10s. 0d. to the hospital;</P>
    <P>(2)  that a register of electors be compiled and that a person must be qualified to vote;</P>
    <P>(3)  that each elector gets an opportunity of registering his vote by post.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Two prohibitions in the Act of 1816 are repealed&mdash;the limitation regarding acquisition of land and the exclusion of graduates of any medical school other than the College of Surgeons and Physicians.  There may be some difference of opinion amongst Deputies regarding some sections of the Bill, notably that requiring the payment of a £10 subscription, but I think that whatever little difficulties present themselves in that way will be overcome during the Committee Stages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the amendment standing in my name:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete the word &ldquo;now&rdquo; and add at the end of the motion the words &ldquo;this day twelve months.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The amendment was tabled by me at a time when the affairs of the Meath Hospital and the method of government of that hospital were the subject matter of an action in prospect before our courts.  Because I felt that it was undesirable that matters which were to be dealt with and issues which were to be decided by the courts should be the subject matter, even at one stage removed, of legislation by this House, I tabled the amendment which stands in my name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the court of first instance has dealt with the matters <Col N="1878" /> which were argued before it does not essentially change my approach to this Bill.  I am not in a position to say to the House that the courts will not be further troubled with the issues which separate the two disputing sets of controversialists who contend for control over the Meath Hospital.  I am not in a position to say definitely to the House that the matter is finished as far as the courts are concerned.  That is something upon which, perhaps, the sponsors of the Bill might be in a better position to enlighten us.  What I do feel is that it is improper that the time of this House should be taken up for the purpose of giving, or attempting to give, legislative sanction and the sanction of this House to the view held by one particular set of disputants for control of this hospital.  I have no views as to the rights or wrongs of the matters in dispute, but I do feel that it is not by the introduction of a Private Members' Bill before the Dáil that the issues which separate them can best be determined, particularly when we are so close to the situation which gave rise to the recent litigation, so close to the situation in which the two parties to this dispute have been locked in contentious argument.</P>
    <P>I would urge on the sponsors of this Bill that the proper course for them to adopt is to withdraw this Bill for a period of 12 months.  I would hope that, before that period would have elapsed, the Minister for Health would have come into this House with his definite and concrete proposals as to the future government and management of this hospital.</P>
    <P>I think I can say without fear of correction that all Dublin Deputies and Deputies from constituencies other than Dublin constituencies realise the very splendid and excellent work that has been done by this institution and by the very eminent medical men who have been associated with it both in the recent past and in the more distant past.  I would urge as strongly as I can on Deputy Doyle, who sponsors this Bill, and upon Deputy O'Higgins, who seconds it, that if they have at heart the proper government and proper management of this hospital, in the interests of the plain, ordinary <Col N="1879" /> citizens of this city, it is unwise for them to come into this House as partisans in a dispute and to ask this House, in effect, to take sides in that dispute, because that, I suggest, is the effect of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not think that this House should be asked to take sides in that dispute. I would hope, if they took the course which I suggest to them, that within the period mentioned in the amendment, namely, a period of 12 months, the Minister for Health would bring before the Dáil definite and concrete proposals as to the future government and management of the hospital, in the interests of the citizens.</P>
    <P>Retrospective legislation or legislation intended to achieve a setting aside, as it were, of the decision of a court, is something which this House should not view with approval.  I believe that I am not unfair in suggesting to the House that the present measure could come within that category. Do not ask Deputies to take sides in this dispute.  Do not seek to deal with what is a matter for the Department of Health, for the Minister for Health.  Do not seek to deal with that by a Private Members' Bill.  Let the appropriate Minister come before the House with his proposals.  Do not ask Deputies to come down on one side as partisans in a dispute between two groups of private citizens, both of whom, I am sure, are animated by the most unselfish and highest possible ideals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lehane has laid emphasis on the fact that the effect of the Bill which is now before the House might be that it would be taken as an action operating against a decision of the courts.  In that respect, may I say I think it is desirable that it should be pointed out that this Bill was introduced into the House before the case actually came before the courts?  So far as my personal view goes, and I have no hesitation in expressing it, I would say that the action of the people concerned in bringing a matter into the courts when a Bill had been submitted in this House was unwise; I say very <Col N="1880" /> definitely it was an unwise course to adopt.  But the matter did proceed along those lines, and may I put it to Deputy Lehane, as one who understands the position of governors in a hospital in this city, that he is extremely innocent if he expects that because the court has given a particular decision, the administration of the particular hospital concerned is going to be along lines that everybody desires?  I do not think so.  My experience is against it, and my knowledge of the facts would be completely against it.</P>
      <P>I can envisage what might happen if the matter is left where it is, and in order that the House may understand where it is, may I put this point of view, that in all the voluntary hospitals, and this Bill might serve as a pattern or headline for most, if not all of them, so far as their meetings and the election of governors would be concerned there is no franchise that can be easily distinguished; there are no standing orders and very little in so far as procedure is concerned.  I put it to Deputy Lehane that what might happen at the next general election, if matters remain as they are, is something along the lines of what our sports writers are wont to say; there will be a clash of styles at that particular meeting, to put it mildly, and medical interests and the interests of the poor are bound to suffer in consequence.</P>
      <P>This Bill very properly purports to lay down a franchise that will be recognised. Certain qualifications will have to be obtained and due notice of an election, with the names of the candidates, will have to be circulated.  All that will give an opportunity to those interested in the welfare of the hospital to know what is going to happen and the type of people they are called upon to represent.  I am authorised to say this on behalf of my colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Strange though it may seem, there are two weaknesses in this Bill.  One is in connection with what might be termed a penal clause relating to the qualifications.  I can say that will be altered in Committee.  It is open to any member to do so, if the members responsible for the Bill will not already have done so, in order to ensure that it will be brought more into line with <Col N="1881" /> what might be regarded as the accepted procedure in a House like this.</P>
    <P>There is a second point, and that is again one that I understand my colleagues have agreed on.  It will be amended in Committee.  It is this, that the representation of the hospital will be brought on a more acceptable scale than even the Bill proposes.  My experience in hospitals of this character where you have in relation to governors something that changes from year to year is this, that the hospital is likely to suffer from the point of view of continuity of policy.  I can very well envisage that if the position of the Meath Hospital remains as it is, you may very well have a perpetuation of that state of affairs.  The solution to me, and it is a view shared by my colleagues, is that there should be a broader representation of the local authorities.  I think nobody will object to that.  You have types of people coming from the local authorities who are representatives of all sections and in themselves they form the continuity so far as policy is concerned.</P>
    <P>The men sponsoring the Bill will be prepared to accept in Committee an amendment suggesting a broader representation so far as the Dublin Corporation is concerned and so far as the Dublin County Council is concerned.  It must be remembered that this hospital is doing a remarkable amount of work for local authorities throughout the country.  We will be open in Committee to consider an amendment that representatives might be accepted from the general council of county councils.  With an improvement of that character, I suggest that the objections of Deputy Lehane might be removed.  You will have a better understanding and you will have a feeling of confidence.</P>
    <P>As regards the people who are responsible for the hospital, there is one gentleman&mdash;I presume it would not be right to mention his name&mdash;whose lifework is known with gratitude and appreciation, not alone throughout this country but in other countries as well. This Bill will enable a committee of that character to ensure that they will have the services of a surgeon of that type.  I appeal to those who may feel <Col N="1882" /> that there is anything in the nature of partisanship in this Bill to put that idea out of their minds.  I say there is not.  The aim that inspired us to move the Bill was to ensure that the Meath Hospital and the people it serves, not only the poor of Dublin, but the poor of the county, will have the best service that can be placed at their disposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure the House that what Deputy O'Sullivan has said represents exactly my own view.  I agree with the objections to which he has referred.  I hope that in Committee we will be able to decide upon a broader representation, and that we can meet those who may object on the question of the annual subscription. My approach and the approach of the other sponsors of the Bill is simply this, that we want to see the Meath Hospital run as efficiently as possible.  As Deputy Doyle mentioned in the course of his remarks, the Meath Hospital has a very old tradition. It has a splendid tradition in relation to surgery and medicine, and a fine reputation in relation to its service to the poor.</P>
      <P>We believe that this Bill is necessary. I do not for one moment want to refer to the recent law case.  I do not think that that matter arises.  I have thought for a considerable time that a Bill of this kind is needed.  The Meath Hospital is more than a Dublin institution; it is a national institution. Consequently, I feel that when we are amending this Bill in Committee there might be representation provided for, say, the general council of county councils on account of the contributions which come from the various boards of health throughout the country.  These are briefly my reasons for supporting the Bill.  On the Committee Stage, when amendments are tabled, I will have an opportunity perhaps to make some other remarks in relation to the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cogan has given notice to raise on the motion for the Adjournment the subject matter of Question No. 50 on last Wednesday's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I gave notice that I would raise on the Adjournment the question of the manner in which the appointment of a sub-postmaster in Baltinglass was made.  I regretted that the Minister, through illness, was unable to be present to answer that question last week, and I am glad that he is here to-night to explain what prompted him to make this extraordinary appointment.  Miss Katie <Col N="1884" /> Cooke acted as postmistress for many years in Baltinglass.  Last April, at the age of 83, she decided to retire and to assign her premises, which had been used as a sub-post office, to her niece. She made that decision, believing that her long and faithful service in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, as well as the long and faithful service of her niece, also in that Department, would be appreciated, and that no difficulty would arise in having this office transferred to her niece.  The Minister, however, had some time previously made a rule which, at any rate, debarred Miss Cooke from securing the transfer, and which provided for the advertising of that position.  I do not know if the Minister at the time foresaw coming events.  It really does not matter very much, and I am not much concerned, as to whether the position was advertised or not.  I am solely concerned about the manner in which the appointment was made, about the type of person who was appointed, and about the injustice that was inflicted upon Miss Helen Cooke.</P>
      <P>We have always believed that merit should be taken into consideration in the making of public appointments.  We have always believed, or at least I have always believed, that political pull or political influence should not be the main consideration.  Miss Helen Cooke had 14 years of faithful service in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. It is a quibble, a contemptible quibble, to suggest, as was suggested last week, that she was not a direct employee of the Department.  She was doing the Department's work in her post office.  She was managing it and assisting her very aged aunt to manage the office, and with that long service she was at least entitled to fair consideration. Was that consideration given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I spoke to the Minister about this matter, after the position had become vacant, he told me that there were some small complaints against Miss Cooke.  He told us to-day that there were no serious complaints against her.  Complaints?  What does the Minister mean by complaints? There are complaints against every public official in this country from the <Col N="1885" /> highest to the lowest, but have there been any charges proved against Miss Cooke?  I asked that question to-day.  I asked it, too, of Miss Cooke's superiors in the Post Office service.  I asked the postmaster of Naas if there had been any charges or irregularities of any kind proved against Miss Cooke, or even seriously alleged, and he told me that the sub-post office in Baltinglass was one of the most regularly run, one of the most correctly run, post offices in the country, and that, if anything, the two Miss Cookes, Miss Helen Cooke and her aunt, erred perhaps in being too strict in enforcing all the regulations of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Yet, this is the conscientious and faithful family that has been victimised.</P>
    <P>We have in Baltinglass this family of Miss Cooke and her aunt.  They have run this post office for years.  It is being taken from them now.  Miss Helen Cooke's aunt is now an invalid. She is 83 years of age, she is in very feeble health and she is depending on her niece for her living.  Yet these two poor defenceless people have been ruthlessly deprived of their sole means of livelihood in order to provide an appointment for a hanger-on of the Minister's political Party.</P>
    <P>That is the position as it stands to-day.  I do not ask for tears from anybody.  The people of Baltinglass do not want any tears shed.  They are prepared to fight their battle through to the end, regardless of what opposition may be piled up against them. <i>(Interruptions.)</i>  I think that some Deputies here are beginning to find that, from beginning to end, they have no ground to stand on.  When they have no case, they think that by barracking and interrupting they can prevent me from presenting the true facts of this case&mdash;the glaring facts, and this glaring injustice against two defenceless women.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion has been made that, in some way, Miss Cooke and her aunt were not true nationalists or good Irish citizens.  I challenge any <Col N="1886" /> Deputy to go down to Baltinglass and make that charge.  Everybody in Baltinglass knows that Miss Helen Cooke has always been a staunch, true nationalist, though her position as sub-post mistress did not allow her to take an active part in Party politics.  It has been suggested that her opponent for this position gave service in the L.D.F., but did not Miss Cooke also give faithful service in the Irish Red Cross all through the emergency?  Is it seriously suggested that a lady sub-post mistress could put on battle dress and carry a rifle during the emergency? That is the contention that is being made here now.  The L.D.F. was established to defend this country and not to wage war on lone defenceless women. It was never intended that service in the L.D.F. should carry with it the opportunity of securing lucrative jobs.</P>
      <P>The statement was made on behalf of the Minister that suitability of premises was a consideration in the making of this appointment.  The Minister knows that the premises which had been used as a post office are first-class premises.  They have been used exclusively as a post office, no other business was carried on there, and they are eminently suitable.  The premises to which it is proposed to transfer the post office are a licensed premises which have never been carried on regularly. That is the position as everybody in Baltinglass knows and, because they know it, they are determined&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A determined effort is being made to prevent the case of Miss Cooke being heard in this House.  An attempt is being made to shout down the first Deputy who has raised this question.  I want to make my statement as briefly as possible as my time is limited, and Deputies know that, but I will make my case.  The question of financial stability arises and also the question of character.  The Minister knows the relative merits of the financial stability of this family who have been there for many years and that of their opponents.  I will pass over the question of character.  Who is the person appointed?  He is a young man who has got this position which has been taken from these two defenceless women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>He served the country, what you never did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>He is a young man in his twenties and in the full vigour of health.  He is the son of an extensive merchant, holding a large licensed premises, a large drapery, a butchery and a grocery business.  That young man has many opportunities available to him without taking away the livelihood of two defenceless ladies.  Surely a man in the full vigour of health with such a large business premises has the world at his feet, so to speak.  He has opportunities of making a living without encroaching on the living of two <Col N="1888" /> people who have served the country and the Department faithfully and well.  I have answered the question with regard to his service in the L.D.F. Nobody will take from him the credit due to anyone who served in the L.D.F.  There were hundreds of young men in the Baltinglass district who also served faithfully in the L.D.F., but they did not seek to take from Miss Cooke her means of livelihood.  The only merit that the successful applicant can claim is that he is the son of a man who was a member of the county council up to the last election and who is a member of the Minister's Party.</P>
      <P>The issue raised by this question and the issue raised in Baltinglass is whether we are to have public positions filled on the basis of merit alone or on the basis of political graft and corruption.  That is the clear-cut issue raised by the people of Baltinglass upon which they are prepared to stand vigorously to the end.  There is no merit whatever on the side of this appointment.  It bears on its face all the marks of the cold-blooded brutality and immorality of Soviet rule.  The Minister has many times denounced in Wicklow Red rule and Communism. He has even accused members of the Labour Party of Communism.  What is Communism but a form of gangsterism which fills up appointments, not on merit, but on the basis of those who served most faithfully on the Party line.  The people of Baltinglass are standing firm on this issue. As I told them in Baltinglass last week, they have lighted a fire which has spread throughout the land.  It is a fire which will blaze and burn until the public life of this country is finally and permanently cleansed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to register a protest against the action of the Minister in perpetrating such a gross injustice on a member of a family which had been associated with the post office in Baltinglass for such a long period.  It boils down to this.  We have in the person of Miss Helen Cooke a lady who has carried out the duties of sub-postmistress on behalf of her aunt for the past 14 years, and who has given 100 per cent. service so far as post office work or the responsibility entailed by that work is concerned. There has been nothing against her.  In reply to a question, the Minister stated that there was no serious complaint, and we can take it that there was nothing against the young lady.  Her financial position is not questioned. She has earned the trust imposed on her, has performed her duties satisfactorily, and is a credit to her family. Now why did the Minister decide to overlook the application of Miss Cooke when there was such a record of service behind her and behind her family? Why did he decide to appoint a young man who, from the point of view of practical experience in the important work of conducting a sub-post office and from the point of view of the technical knowledge required to carry out that work, had not the qualifications that Miss Cooke had?  We all know and all the people of Baltinglass know that the particular gentleman concerned had no qualifications whatever.</P>
