      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether, in view of his Department's proposal to pay forestry workers the same rates as are paid to county council road workers in all counties where forestry workers are employed, he will explain why it is proposed not to pay County Dublin forestry workers the same rates as are payable to road workers in that county, but instead, to base their wages on those of County Wicklow road workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the intention to fix forestry labourers' wages at <Col N="8" /> parity with local road workers' rates in all districts.  For example, forestry labourers will be paid 62/- a week in counties where road workers are paid less than that amount.</P>
      <P>In County Dublin the road workers' rate of wages is obviously influenced by the special circumstances obtaining in the immediate vicinity of Dublin City.  Forestry workers in this county are employed in districts adjoining County Wicklow, and it is considered more appropriate that they should get the same treatment as their fellow-workers in the latter county.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that exports of wool from this country to Holland are being re-exported to the U.S.A. at a lower price than would be economic for Irish exporters due to the fact that the Dutch buyers pay for the wool in sterling obtained by them at a rate lower than the official exchange rate, thus undercutting potential Irish exports to the U.S.A.; and, if so, if he will state whether the Government intend taking any steps to prevent the consequent loss in dollars to this country, particularly in view of the need for developing a dollar trade to the fullest possible extent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first part of the question, I am aware that, in some instances, Irish wool sold to the Netherlands has been re-exported from that country to the United States of America at prices below those at which Irish wool can be sold economically in the dollar market, but I am not aware that such circumstances always arise from the use of &ldquo;cheap&rdquo; sterling by the Dutch merchants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the second part of the question, there is no control over exports of wool, and presumably an Irish exporter who sells to the Netherlands rather than to the United States <Col N="11" /> of America does so because he receives a better price for his product.  I understand that recently the Netherlands Government have agreed to take measures to restrict transactions of the kind referred to by the Deputy where sterling area products are concerned. The situation is being kept under review having regard to the importance of maintaining and expanding our dollar exports.</P>

As the Deputy will be aware, I have settled a short-term hospital building programme including the most urgently needed works for completion as quickly as possible and a substantial section of the work is already in progress.  To avoid the danger that progress generally would be slower if too extensive a programme were attempted, a number of desirable projects such as the new Cavan County Hospital have had to be deferred for inclusion in the building programme to follow that at present in progress.  I can assure the Deputy that there is no intention of abandoning the project and that it will receive every consideration when the question of settling the succeeding programme comes for decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he is aware that the contractors engaged on the erection of the regional sanatorium, Merlin Park, Galway, and the extension to Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe, have decided to install concrete window sills instead of cut stone, thus depriving a number of craftsmen of their means of <Col N="22" /> livelihood; and, if so, whether, in view of the employment that would be given and of the artistry and durability of cut stone as compared with concrete, he will take steps to ensure that stone will be used in the window sills of both hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no responsibility for the type of materials used in the building of the extension to Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe, other than that I have made it a condition to the making of a grant from the Hospitals Trust Fund that as far as possible materials of Irish manufacture should be used.</P>
      <P>As regards the regional sanatorium at Merlin Park, Galway, which is being built under my direction, the contractor is carrying out the work in accordance with the plans and specification which I have approved.  The use of concrete window sills is in accordance with the specification.  While I understand and sympathise with the Deputy's views, I am advised that the use of cut stone window sills instead of concrete would entail additional expenditure on this project.  As the Deputy may be aware, the cost of this sanatorium will be of the order of £1,250,000.  He will appreciate my responsibility to see that the funds at my disposal are used to the best advantage to provide satisfactory accommodation for the patients.  The welfare of the patients would in no way be affected by the substitution of cut stone for concrete window sills and I would, accordingly, not feel justified in incurring the extra cost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the extra cost of providing cut stone window sills and giving employment to craftsmen who are now half employed would not be heavy and that such a policy would be much more economical than a penny wise and pound foolish policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">

      <P>As I say, I have the greatest sympathy with the Deputy's views on this matter, but, in relation to such a vast project as that which we are undertaking in Galway, it is very necessary that we use the <Col N="23" /> amount of money at our disposal to the very best advantage from the point of view of the health services.  As to the extra cost, I understand from the figures given to me that the difference between the cost of concrete and cut stone window sills would be about £20,000.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann hereby approves of the Summer Time Order, 1950, made by the Minister for Justice under the Summer Time Act, 1925 (No. 8 of 1925).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Order is to extend the date of the termination of summer time this year from 8th October to 22nd October, so as to make our period of summer time coincide with the period fixed for Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  Deputies will recollect that similar Orders have been made in recent years to synchronise our period of summer time with the period fixed for Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  Prior to the war, the need for such Orders did not arise, as the same period of summer time was fixed on a permanent basis here and in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Since the beginning of the war, the British have fixed different summer <Col N="27" /> time periods from time to time and generally we have made corresponding changes.  Whether this Order is approved or not, the Summer Time Act, 1925 will continue to operate and we will have summer time here from 16th April.  The only question at issue is the date on which summer time should end.  If the Order is not approved, it will end on 8th October, in accordance with the Summer Time Order of 1926; if the Order is approved, summer time will continue until 22nd October and end on the same date as in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am sure that every Deputy will appreciate that a difference of time as between here and Great Britain and Northern Ireland for a period of a fortnight would cause considerable inconvenience for transport undertakings and post offices, and I hope for that reason the House will approve the Order.  I appreciate that there are some Deputies who object to the summer time system, but that question is not in issue now.  As I have explained, whether this Order is approved or not, summer time will operate this year, and all I am asking the House to do is to approve an extension of 14 days in the period of its operation, that is, 14 days at the end of the period.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), page 4, to delete paragraph (f) and substitute the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(f)  the determination whether a tenant or proprietor would be or would not be entitled to require the Land Commission to acquire the whole of his lands and provide him with a new holding and the determination of the new holding to be provided for a tenant or proprietor whose land is resumed or acquired by the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(o)  The determination of all matters decided at public sittings.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It has been the practice of the Land Commission, as far as I know, to decide many matters other than excepted matters, at sittings of the commission. Obviously, these decisions dealt with matters which were regarded as of more than ordinary importance.  If it has been the practice of the commissioners sitting in court to decide certain important matters which are not ordinarily excepted matters, I would like that procedure to continue.  There may be certain matters with which the Minister could not be fully informed or which could not be fully inquired into and which would require discussion and debate in a court before there could be a real decision.</P>
      <P>I want to press nothing new on the Minister.  If it has been the practice, as I believe it has been, for the Land Commission in court to decide certain matters other than those specifically excepted in the 1933 Act, I want that practice to continue.</P>

      <P>It seems that in the drafting of Section 6 of the 1933 Act it was sought to clarify the powers of the commissioners and the Minister, in other words, to separate them.  I believe the Minister and the Dáil at the time, all with the exception of the late Deputy Roddy, believed it would do so; but practice down through the years has proved that there is a certain amount of doubt or, at least, want of clarification, between the two.  The commissioners did determine certain matters that they were to hear at public sittings.  I want to make it clear that I want this House to clarify the position and to determine what the commissioners shall decide and what they shall not.  In other words, I want to clarify the power between the Minister and the commissioners.  I am doing my best in this Bill to do so and I suppose it remains to be seen whether the Bill will achieve that object or not. The Deputy will admit that this amendment would only lead to confusion and, probably, to disagreement amongst the commissioners themselves.</P>
      <P>I want the House to set down what shall be the commissioners' functions and what shall be the Minister's functions and so clear the air once and for all.  The Deputy is well aware that that was not clear up to this.  This amendment will not do it because it is quite possible that some commissioners would be in favour of deciding that the matter of fixing a pump in Donegal or Wexford would be a matter to be heard at a public sitting, while other commissioners would go against that.  This amendment will not get us anywhere and, possibly, would lead to further confusion instead of clearing the air.</P>

      <P>I would not want to hold up the work of the Land Commission by dealing with minor works of that sort, no matter what any commissioners would say, but I would wish the Minister to inquire if there have been certain important matters which came up for judicial consideration before the courts and on which decisions were made and, where that has been done, I would ask that the precedent would be followed.  I quite realise that it would be very wrong to <Col N="31" /> make the position of the Minister and the Land Commission indecisive.  It should be something clear-cut.  Possibly the Minister does not cover everything in the added powers he is giving to the Land Commissioners.  I wish the Minister would inquire into the matter and see if there are any precedents of court decisions.  Even though they have not been included in the actual excepted matters of the 1933 Act, it would be wise to follow them, I think.</P>

      <P>Section 3 of this Bill merely repeats a section that is included in most of the Land Acts, that is, that rules and regulations are made by the Minister and by certain other persons with whom he is in consultation. I understand that the matters to be heard at public sittings are decided under these rules and regulations because it would be most undesirable to have the Minister determining what matters would be heard at public sittings.  It would be equally undesirable to have the commissioners determining what would be heard at public sittings. The rules and regulations to be made under Section 3 of this Bill are made in consultation with the Incorporated Law Society and several others who are better qualified than the average lay person to have a say in these matters.  It is under these rules and regulations that the matters to be heard at public sittings are decided, not by the Minister alone.</P>

      <P>The whole structure of this particular section is out of line with what was attempted to be done in the 1933 Act, because the Minister is taking back powers from the Land Commission which it was thought proper to leave to the Land Commission with a judicial tenure of office. Surely, if the Minister wants to have certain matters not subject to a decision in open court by the commissioners, that can be arranged.  The whole point is that, if the Land Commissioners meet and decide a matter at a public sitting, it should not afterwards be reversed by the Minister's decision in private.  All the parties involved <Col N="32" /> have a right to state their case at the public hearing; the Land Commissioners give the decision; and I think it is only right that the matter should be left there and should not be reversible by the Minister in private.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is now going on to another leg and is claiming that the Minister cannot, in fact, reverse a decision which has been arrived at by the commissioners in public sitting, then he should accept this amendment.  The 1933 Act gave broad indications as to what were to be excepted matters.  We know that in practice, ever since 1933 up to 1948, there were other matters which were not specifically set out in detail that were treated as excepted matters as between the Minister and the Land Commissioners.  The Minister did not interfere and all we are asking the Minister to do in future is not to interfere, that when the Land Commissioners have had a public sitting and have heard all the evidence on both sides in public, he should not afterwards reverse that decision in private.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There is no danger of that.  The Minister cannot, unless this House gives him power under this Bill to do so.  That power is not sought here and, therefore, the House will not be giving it.  There is no possibility whatever of the Minister reversing any decision come to by the commissioners.  While the Minister has not the determining of matters that the commissioners shall hear in public sittings, I think it is equally undesirable that the court themselves should have the determining of what they would hear.  Even the civil courts, I understand, are governed in the same way, both in regard to procedure and the matters that come before them. They have not the determination of it. This amendment, in my opinion, seeks to establish a new departure and a new line of action that is not granted even to the Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), after paragraph (n), to add a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(o) the sanction of all improvement expenditure exceeding £50 in any case.</P>
      <P>There is a vast expenditure on improvements. Sometimes it has reached the amount of £750,000 in a year, and it has never been less than £250,000.  It is very desirable that there should be a definite check on such huge expenditure.  It may be, of course, just as desirable in the matter of making spot decisions that an inspector should have authority to spend a certain amount.  It seems to me that in any case a sum of about £50 should be quite sufficient for an inspector to have at his disposal to arrange or rearrange any particular matter in dispute between allottees or between, shall I say, congests.  If it is desirable that the fixing of the price of land should be in the hands of the Land Commission, if we accept paragraph (h), sub-section (1) of Section 10, it is also desirable that we should have a definite check on this huge expenditure of improvement money.  I do not want to go back on what has been done before, but it does seem to me that (e) of sub-section (1) and (h) of sub-section (1) are definitely contradictory. The Land Commission have the determination of a standard annuity and on the other hand the Minister can fix the price of lands.  I think it is wholly undesirable that the Minister should fix the price of lands, and I think it most desirable to have a definite check on improvement expenditure which reaches £750,000 in some years and has never been less than £250,000.  I am not tied to £50, but I think that the Minister should accept a definite sum as the maximum which is allowed freely to be spent by an inspector of the Land Commission if necessary in making immediate agreements between congests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am safe in saying that a line of procedure has developed in the Land Commission which has not produced very good results through the years, that is, that men up to the higher executive officer rank have not been given any responsibility, good, bad or indifferent, all through their lifetime.  I believe that has had serious repercussions on the volume of work done by the Land Commission, and in no other Government Department does that practice obtain.  I understand what the Deputy is at.  Fifty pounds, I take it, is his shot in the dark, but that would be most undesirable.  While officers in other Departments have very wide powers you have never heard of a single instance of their abusing those powers.  On the contrary, every Deputy on the Government and on the opposite side during the period of this Government and of the last blames officials for being niggardly rather than generous with public money.  In the case of inspectors who will get a certain amount of freedom in improvement expenditure I have no doubt that the officials of the Land Commission are as honest and as trustworthy as the officials of any other Department. Take the other limb of the Department of Lands, the Department of Forestry, where you have acquisition officers agreeing to prices.  In the case of very big acreages of plantable lands with buildings in good repair and with standing woods, forests coming to maturity, they have the fixing of pretty huge sums.  I blame them for chiselling over pence and halfpence, and, in my opinion, they often let good offers slip through their fingers.  They miss the bus for the sake of a few pence, and miss good bargains too. There is no danger.  This amendment says in effect that the Land Commission officers are not worthy of being trusted, that it would be dangerous to trust them, and I do not hold with that.  As time goes on you will find that they will be too niggardly and <Col N="35" /> slow to do things simply because of a few shillings.</P>

I doubt very much if the Minister is right in saying that the higher executive officers do not get responsibility.  I would be very much surprised at that.

The Minister might treat it in a military fashion.  In a war we do not count the cost but we look for success and it has been said from the Government side of the House that certain activities of the Government should be handled from a military point of view.  I do not think that the results of such a proposal would be commensurate with the expense.  I think that there should be a very definite curb on expenditure.  Up to now of course the commissioners were in control of the moneys to be spent for land and they finally decided.</P>

I am not questioning the honesty of the Minister or the high honour and integrity of the civil servants at all.  I am questioning the generosity of the Minister and his desire for a successful solution of congestion. In his desire for a solution for congestion he may on the spur of a generous moment spend any amount of public money, which is not desirable. There must be a check.  Why not get money in the ordinary way and if there are spot decisions to be made give the inspector £100 or increase whatever he was getting?

We have all experience of that.  Criticism of the Minister after the work is done is little use in this House.  That is my experience. In all reason, to have a check is good financial procedure.  There should be a check on money spent, not a year afterwards by the Public Accounts Committee, but when the money is being spent by an official of the Civil Service.  When an official spends money on the solution of congestion under the instructions of the Minister, surely the Minister can defend any action he then takes before <Col N="37" /> the House with a majority behind him. In fairness and justice, why not agree to a definite amount of money being placed at the disposal of the inspector to enable him to deal with any immediate problem that arises?  As I said, there will not be big problems. They will consist of minor adjustments of three, four or five acres as between one tenant and another.  The sum involved in that would not be a very large one.</P>

      <P>The point is not whether or not the inspector should not have £50 or £80.  The point is whether the Minister or the Land Commission should decide where an improvement costs more than £50 or £80.  Is it the Minister who should decide that public money should be spent in that way or is it the Land Commissioners who should so decide?  In this particular Bill, the Minister is taking power from the Land Commissioners.  I do not think this is a power the Minister should have.  The question of deciding whether or not a sum over £50 should be spent on improvement should be one for decision by the Land Commissioners and not by the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister would be well advised to give some indication to the House as to the general type of expenditure which will be involved in these cases.  As Deputy Moylan has pointed out, the control of this House over expenditure is exercised through the annual Estimates. That is the only way in which Dáil <Col N="38" /> Éireann or the taxpayer has any real control.  It is not, of course, a real check, except to the extent that, if some very scandalous malpractice of extravagance occurs, it may come under the notice subsequently of the Public Accounts Committee.  Surely the Minister will admit that it is very important, even from the point of view of the reputation of the Minister for Lands and of the Land Commission itself, that there should be some regulation as to the amount of expenditure to be allotted in these rearrangement schemes.  The amount is very substantial. Deputies representing constituencies in which these moneys are spent are only too anxious to have as much money as possible made available. Nobody objects to the money being made available if it is profitably spent in the solution of the problem of congestion and if it gives a good return to the country as a whole.  I think there ought to be some check.  Whether or not the Minister accepts this particular amendment, he should give the House some indication of the type of expenditure involved in these rearrangement schemes.  Something in the region of £200,000 is expended annually in the western counties mainly on this type of rearrangement work.  If the Minister agrees to some regulation controlling the amount of expenditure on particular schemes, I think he will save himself in the end. The figure of £80 may have been there in the past, but circumstances have altered and it may well be that that amount will have to be increased.  The Minister is taking advantage of the fact that he has a majority in this House.  He refuses to be cribbed, cabined or confined in any way as to the discretion he will have.  We all believe that he should have a legitimate discretion.  From his own point of view, I think he is unwise in refusing to accept any suggestion of limitation on expenditure in particular cases.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy may have had that experience himself. I never had it.  Neither would I like to have it.  This amendment seems to have been motivated by the mistaken idea that this refers to the rearrangement schemes, and that the Minister will have complete control over expenditure in such schemes.  On the Second Reading, I clearly pointed out to the House that where rearrangement schemes are concerned the commissioners would, as at present, first fix the general outline of each scheme by sanctioning the money to be spent on improvement works, and by determining the total purchase money to be charged for individual holdings.  I think that should clear the air sufficiently.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. Amendment No. 17 purports to substitute in sub-section (1) of Section 10 after paragraph (n) thereof, a further exception; in effect, that is a further reservation of powers to the Land Commission as distinct from the Minister. <Col N="40" /> Unless that reservation is put in the sanction of all improvement expenditure, it will be vested in the Minister. It is immaterial that it may be concomitantly or concurrently a power exercisable by the Land Commission. There are a number of Deputies who think that it would be wiser, from the point of view of the Minister and from the point of view of the public, for the Minister to preclude himself from certain powers, both from the public point of view and from the Minister's own point of view by way of protection for himself.  All that has been dealt with already and I do not propose to elaborate it at this stage.  From both these points of view it is desirable that the Minister not only should not take the powers, but should preclude himself from taking them.  In this particular case, we are pressing an amendment which would have the effect of precluding the Minister from having the power to sanction, save in a case where the expenditure is under £50.</P>
      <P>As I stated on other amendments, I am not taking it upon myself to judge the expediency or the merits of this particular matter.  I was merely prompted to get up and make this reference because of the Minister's final remarks before he sat down.  It appears to me that, as the section stands, the Minister would have these unrestricted powers in regard to improvement expenditure if this amendment is not adopted.  I am not dealing with the merits, but if the Minister can show us&mdash;and I would ask him this&mdash;in any other part of the code which I have not examined, or for any other reason, that those powers are not, in fact, available to him at the moment or will not come into his hands under this particular section, we would be glad to hear him, and I may say that it would help very considerably to hasten this discussion.  Otherwise, restricting myself severely to merely the face of this Bill, I am inclined to think&mdash;in fact, I put it to the Minister &mdash;that if this amendment is not adopted, whether he likes it or not, willy-nilly, he will have complete power, it may be concurrently, with the Land Commission over such expenditure.</P>

      <P>I think the best reply I can make in regard to this amendment is to quote a particular case.  I do not believe that it is known to many Deputies but it is known to a few at least.  In the month of February, 1942, a gale or something of that kind blew a breach in an embankment in a place called Calinafercy, County Kerry.  At the time the local inspector was limited to an expenditure of £80 under a regulation by the Minister.  I am told that about £120&mdash; I am not very sure of the figure but it was either £120 or £220&mdash;would have been sufficient to repair that breach the next day or a few days immediately following the occurrence.  The matter was duly reported and Deputies of all Parties interested themselves in it. The breach occurred in February, 1942, but nothing was done to repair it then. As time went on, whereas in the beginning there was only one breach let us say of ten or 12 yards wide which a couple of hundred pounds would have set right, the matter was allowed to get worse until shortly after the present Government came into office. Deputy J. Flynn, Deputy Palmer and, I am sure, Deputy Kissane probably know all about this matter.  To cut a long story short, last year the estimate &mdash;which was sanctioned&mdash;for the repair of the damage was £7,700.  I would point out that six years elapsed since the breach occurred before sanction was given for its repair.  If the inspector in question had had power to sanction the couple of hundred pounds which were required to repair the breach in the first instance the taxpayers of this country would not have had to bear the cost of all that £7,700.</P>
      <P>In Clare, a short time ago, there was a similar occurrence and, by a superhuman effort, steps were taken inside a week or ten days of the making of the breach in the embankment.  That is only one instance I am quoting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that that is really a case on the merits&mdash;that that is really a case on whether it should or should not be so.  I may have taken the Minister up wrongly and if I did I shall be obliged if he will put me right.  I understood him, at the end of his remarks some <Col N="42" /> minutes ago, to imply that the Minister would not have power to sanction improvement expenditure of himself and that it would not be exercisable by him.  That is a quotation from the Minister himself.  Did I take that up wrong?</P>

      <P>I appreciate that. That is what the Minister would want to have done.  My point is that, alongside the powers of the Land Commission in this matter, the Minister will have under this section complete power to deal with it in his purely ministerial capacity.  In other words, he can short circuit all the machinery. He can deal with improvement expenditure and everything else off his own bat, so to speak, if he wants it.  My point is that he will have that power, and some Deputies think that it would be desirable to limit that power by way of a reservation.</P>

      <P>It would be throwing a spanner in the works in so far as the aims of this Bill are concerned.  I think that every Deputy who knows anything about congested areas and about what congestion means realises that there is a certain moment in a certain day in a certain week when a lot can be done if the official is there. It may be that after a fortnight, because of delay in the Land Commission, the whole scheme is upset.  If we were to take into consideration the amount of travelling expenses paid to officials to go into the congested areas to try to bring about resettlement&mdash; and resettlement that could have been <Col N="44" /> brought about while they were there&mdash; and, because people had time to change their minds afterwards, the whole thing was upset, we would not stint any official to £50.  Deputy Moylan seems to be afraid that money will be thrown about here, there and everywhere, and that officials of the Land Commission who look after rearrangement and resettlement schemes will be rather flush with the taxpayers' money.  There is also the Committee of Public Accounts.  We have the Comptroller and Auditor-General to look into things like that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the amount of money mentioned in the amendment by Deputy Moylan is merely a nominal figure but, in my opinion, there should definitely be some limited amount mentioned. From our knowledge of inspectors, we know that they are merely human beings and that they are capable of making mistakes.  We all know of a number of instances where they made mistakes in carrying out improvement works.  Take the case of a young man coming out of the university with degrees who is sent to supervise one of these works.  He might have the best intentions in the world but he would lack practical experience in the type of working he was carrying out.  He would carry out a scheme and be done with it but at a later stage it might be found that he had gone quite in the wrong direction.  There would be nothing to stop him while the work was in progress.  Even the inspector in charge might not like to let him down, knowing that he had plenty of money to spend and that there was no check on him.  I think that this is a very sensible amendment.  The amount of money set out by Deputy Moylan may be too small but, at the same time, there should be some amount fixed now so that if there is any extra amount required the attention of the <Col N="45" /> Land Commission would be drawn to the matter.  While it is left in this unlimited way, there is a danger that some unjustified expenditure will be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely to goodness Deputy Beegan, as a Deputy who has always interested himself in the relief and resettlement of congests, knows that an inspector who goes to any locality to rearrange holdings will closely inspect any scheme before it is allowed to proceed?  Deputy Beegan should know that if there is any tendency to reckless expenditure, if, say, £200 is suggested for some work that in the opinion of the chief inspector for the area is unnecessary, or if the amount suggested is too much, the chief inspector is not such a fool as to let that pass.  It is all right to say that we have young inspectors coming out of the universities with plenty of qualifications but lacking in experience.  So far as my area is concerned there would be very little done if it were not for the assistance we got from these young officials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says he has full confidence in the Land Commission and their officials.  What we are trying to do in this amendment is to leave a matter which the Minister says was in the hands of the Land Commissioners still in the hands of the commissioners&mdash;power to fix the sum that should be allocated for improvements. The Minister in the quotation he read out there stated that even in these rearrangement schemes the first thing that would happen would be that the Land Commissioners would fix the amount of expense on improvements, and he used the phrase &ldquo;as at present.&rdquo;  We are not asking him to put any limit on the sum of money the Land Commissioners may at their discretion spend upon improvement works in any scheme.  There is no limit of £50 on the Land Commission, so that this amendment would not operate to cut down the Land Commission's discretion to works costing £50.  It would operate to cut down the Minister's discretion directly.  I think that if the Minister nominates an official directly to do a certain piece of work, £50 is enough to put at the sole discretion of the Minister.  If the amount is over £50, it should be a matter for the Land Commission.  We have in this whole land legislation taken great powers over the property of individuals.  The State has no such right over people who have other forms of property.  It is only right that such extraordinary powers should be exercised only by people who have no political axe to grind in arriving at a decision, and the taxpayers will be anxious if a Minister, subject to all the pressure to which a public man is subject, has a discretion to spend an unlimited amount of money on improvement works.  We believe that it is only right in the interests of the taxpayers, as well as in the interests of people who have land, and who are going to let land, that the decision in regard to improvement works on which it is proposed to spend more than £50, should be taken by the ordinary Land Commissioners rather than by a politician in office for the time being.</P>

      <P>It now emerges that <Col N="47" /> the apprehension of the Opposition is that there is some sinister political significance in the Minister's seeking this power.  I want to say to the Minister that if this power will get rid of the hiatus that is caused by officials going back and forth, the shuttle-cock period of the time when communications are passing between the Land Commissioners and the inspectors in charge, by all means let the Minister have this power.  I think that Deputy Beegan, whom I rate as an extremely honest person, even though he is sometimes a bit confused, has possibly defeated, by his arguments, what would be his own genuine conception of how to solve this problem.  We are inclined to impute a degree of recklessness in these matters which no Comptroller and Auditor-General could overlook, a degree of recklessness which no senior official could possibly overlook to the junior inspectors whom the Minister may send down.</P>

      <P>I always know that Deputy Collins thinks the best of me. My motive in putting down the amendment was to try to improve the Bill, and I think it will be an improvement. I am in entire agreement with Deputy Commons that there should be a certain amount of money that could be used loosely&mdash;if I may use that term&mdash;for the immediate settlement of disagreements and small problems.  But Deputy Commons did not make up a list that would amount even to £50.  Surely, in the lay-out of a rearrangement scheme, there should be some arrangement for the provision of water, even if that meant the sinking of pumps.  It might be necessary that a pump should be sunk 50 feet further than was originally intended on account of the depth of the water level.  In that case, I would be anxious that there should be in the hands of the inspector £50 or whatever such sum as might meet a problem of that sort.  I am not bound to £50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Commons did make some sort of case, but the Minister made no case.  There was a bridge over the Brown Flesk at Dick's Grove in County Kerry, one of the busiest creamery districts in all Kerry.  A flood swept the bridge away, and it took four years before it was replaced by the Kerry County Council.  So it is not merely in the Land Commission that these things happen.  Whatever <Col N="49" /> the bridge was like at Calinafercy that was washed away&mdash;as the Minister told us&mdash;we have had, every day in the House for some years, during the régime of the present Government and certainly for five or six years of the last Government, questions raised about the repair of embankments at Calinafercy.</P>
    <P>I could match the Minister's statement in regard to the sweeping away of the bridge at Calinafercy, the original estimate of the repair and the final cost of doing the work.  I know that near Cork City, on the Lee, certain portions of an embankment were swept away and two farms were destroyed.  The original estimate of repair work when the breakage occurred was £300.  The Land Commission refused to carry out the repair work.  This Bill contains no section that might tend towards making the Land Commission decide as to whether or not they would take over the repair of embankments.  In regard to the Calinafercy bridge, the Land Commission took up the same attitude as they are taking up with reference to embankments everywhere.  They claim that they are not their responsibility, but by the force of public opinion they have to take over repair or improvement work now and again which they claim is not their responsibility. What the Minister talked about&mdash;the repair of the bridge at Calinafercy or the rebuilding of a bridge there&mdash;has nothing to do with improvement work; there is not the shadow of an analogy.</P>

      <P>What the money is wanted for in rearrangement schemes is something like this.  It may be necessary to go beyond the agreement made with the congests in order to add a room to one man's house; it may be necessary to dig a well deeper than was intended; it may be necessary to provide a portion of a road not originally estimated for.  There is not a shadow of reason why the inspector, in order to do these things, should not have at his disposal some money to deal with them on the spot.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>All this is concerned with is a spot decision.  If there is a difficulty between two congests that can be settled by the expenditure of a certain amount of money on the authority of the inspector, whether it is the building of a room to a house, the making of a small portion of road, the digging of a well or the making of a fence, I agree that the inspector should have a fairly wide discretion.  I am not tying myself to £50.  I think the commissioners should have the control of the original estimate.  The money needed for the general carrying out of the work should be controlled by the commissioners.  If there is money needed for a spot decision, put that money at the disposal of the inspector. Let us know what the amount he needs is.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister should agree to accept this proposal.  There is no other motive in moving the amendment than what I have outlined, no attempt to curb the Minister's success with this measure.  I am as anxious as he is to have a solution for congestion.  Even though the Minister suggested Deputy Derrig was wrong in what he said, I submit that Deputy Derrig was not wrong.  The Minister is adamant against any suggestions.  He told us a few weeks ago that he did not care a snap of his fingers for the Opposition.</P>

      <P>I want to put it to Deputy Collins that the study of the law gives so much ability for driving a coach and four through the law that very often a good lawyer is not a good legislator.  Nevertheless, I would accept the viewpoint of Deputy Collins as a good lawyer.  This legislation is going to be the law and it may come before the courts for a decision as to what it means.  On what will the judges in court base their interpretation?  On the words of the Act.  They will read the Act and will not come to the Library in Leinster House to read in any particular volume of the Dáil <Col N="51" /> debates what promises the Minister may have made.  The judges, in deciding the law, would regard that as so much rubbish.  I suggest to the Minister that he should have a little bit of common-sense, that there should be a little bit of give and take on his part, a little bit of reason.  We are not confined to the £50 in this amendment.  Let the Minister take as much money as he wants to for spot decisions and for no other purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the significance of the point that is put forward in support of the amendment.  It still maintains very considerable control over public expenditure.  Any case made for the control and the use of public funds must receive very serious attention; but, on the other hand, the Minister resists the amendment on the grounds that, if it were carried, it would hamstring him in the administration of this Bill when it becomes an Act.  We are asked to make up our minds from a practical point of view as to which is the better way of dealing with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that this principle of the control of public funds has been allowed to run amok for a great number of years, and that there gradually has grown up the practice whereby nothing can be done by anybody within a reasonable time.  When the matter of expenditure arises, plans have to be prepared and submitted.  They are then sent along to some person, we will say in this case to the Land Commissioners, with a recommendation from the man on the spot.  That man is on the spot because he has been found to be a competent and capable official; he is generally a man of many years' experience; he has reached the position he is in after long years of experience and because of his ability and competency.  My experience, and I think the experience of quite a number of Deputies, has been that when such a report is received in the section of the Department dealing with it, it is, in the first instance, examined probably by a very junior official.  He finds some snag in it, something that is contrary to some instruction or precedent, and that is <Col N="52" /> recorded by this particular official.  A letter is then sent to the senior official on the spot asking for his observations. When he sends them along some official, a little higher up than the first official, will examine them, and will find some other ground for objection. The report goes back again to the official on the spot for further observations from him.  That procedure, which has grown up over the years, is enough to tear the heart out of any conscientious official who is trying to do his work down the country.  I am sure that Deputy Moylan, and other Deputies who have spoken, must know that to be a hamstringing procedure, and that if we can get rid of it and so help to speed up the doing of work, that then we will have done something useful.</P>
    <P>We are passing this Land Bill not for the purpose of having it a plaything for officials but rather for the purpose of abolishing, in so far as we can and in as quick a time as we can, the evil of congestion.  If, after our experience of a quarter of a century's administration, we can help to speed up matters, then I think we would be doing a good day's work.  I believe that, if you have a competent, capable official, he should have considerable discretion, and that if he has, and is encouraged in the exercise of it, work will be done. But if we are passing a Bill now which will have no other object than to prevent officials doing anything, then we are not going to help in the abolition of congestion.  I think that, in the long run, it would be better not to accept the amendment.  It may be that some official may be injudicious or that he may be reckless.  That is in the ordinary way of human nature.  We may run across that type of inspector, but I do not think we shall do so very often. If, however, that sort of official appeared, I think ways and means would be found for dealing with him. There are ways and means of replacing him and putting a competent official into the position to do the job.  For that reason, I support the Minister, Deputy Commons and Deputy Collins in resisting this amendment and ask Deputy Moylan, now that he has made every conceivable case that he can possibly make in favour of the amendment, <Col N="53" /> to withdraw it and let us get the Bill passed and get down to the work of dealing with this problem of congestion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>My opinion is that, while rearrangement of those rundale holdings is of the greatest importance, the problem of congestion cannot be solved without securing large tracts of land outside the congested districts to which people from these congested areas will be transferred, thus making more land available in order to strengthen our economy generally and, apart from that, making more land available for the particular idea of better rearrangement.  Deputy Moylan has explained, I think, quite clearly that there is no objection on this side of the House to spending whatever amount may be required to secure that proper rearrangement schemes are brought about.  Once the Dáil passes the improvement expenditure in the annual Vote for the Land Commission, they have no control over the matter after that.</P>
      <P>It is ludicrous to pretend that the Comptroller and Auditor-General, the Committee of Public Accounts, or any other machinery that exists can satisfy the House that such expenditure is carried out in the most advantageous, economical and efficient way.  That has to be left to the Administration to decide.  All that the officers responsible for checking the expenditure are allowed to satisfy themselves upon is that the money has been expended in accordance with the intentions of the Oireachtas.  Once it is so expended, either with or without the sanction of the Department of Finance, according as that may or may not be necessary, in fact these bodies and the Comptroller and Auditor-General have very little power, except perhaps to call attention to the size or the unusual character of some transactions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are spending these large sums in the western counties; we have been spending them for many years past. Deputy Commons says that he has not seen any good resulting until these young officers or inspectors came into those areas.  I think the officers who were trained&mdash;there are very few of them left&mdash;under the Congested Districts <Col N="54" /> Board or the inspectors who were trained by these in turn ought to have a better understanding and experience of this problem than young men who have even greater abilities or capacity, but who have not got that experience.  I think the House will recognise that it is very unusual, as well as this power of determining the nature of a rearrangement scheme, to delegate to the local officer, whatever his experience may be&mdash;whether he is a senior inspector of long experience or the type of man that Deputy Commons speaks of, who comes into an area full of enthusiasm and anxious to work hard and give of his best in the service which he represents&mdash;the actual allocation of expenditure without, so far as we know, any control whatever or any limitation upon the discretion of the inspector.  I presume that, as in the past, if the Minister is going to regulate these matters, he will have to issue instructions of some kind, he will have to issue some headlines.  He may even have to issue definite instructions as to the lines upon which these inspectors are to carry out those duties. What is the objection, therefore, to informing the House, if the Minister is not in a position to accept the amendment, what are the lines upon which he proposes to go and what is the type of control which will be exercised over the inspectors?  It has been admitted, even by those who think the amendment is going too far, that they may not be men who have long experience and that they may very well make mistakes.</P>
    <P>The Minister emphasised very strongly that these rearrangement schemes were the schemes of the tenant.  In reply to objections from this side of the House, he was very emphatic and repeated more than once that the scheme has to be agreed upon by the tenants, that they have to give their consent.  It seems to me that, if the inspector is dealing with these tenants of the Land Commission and trying to secure their consent, knowing that he must get their signature to the scheme in order to make it operative or otherwise all his trouble and his many visits to the area will have gone for nought, he may be possibly <Col N="55" /> inclined&mdash;it is not outside the bounds of reason&mdash;to go further than he should go.  If the tenants know that he has complete discretion in this matter as the Minister's representative, that there is no control, no limit to the amount of expenditure he may make in improving the hereditaments of the rundale holders or otherwise spending money to try to improve matters for them, it is surely not going to help the solution of this problem if they feel that all they have to do is to prolong the agitation, refuse their consent, and demand better terms.</P>
    <P>When I was in the Land Commission, one of the reasons, I was told, why more progress was not made in this matter of dealing with congested tenants was that under the old Congested Districts Board the rundale tenants knew that they had to deal with the inspector and that he was their friend.  They did not always recognise that.  But, in the long run, I think due to the efficacy of their work and their knowledge and experience and the bonds that grew up between them and the people, these inspectors were able to persuade the tenants very often to take the necessary jump and put their signatures to these schemes. According to the information given to me by one of these inspectors when leaving the service&mdash;I did not ask him for this information; he gave it&mdash;when an Irish Government came in they thought that by going to the T.D. over the inspector's head they would do better.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;after a long period of time during which they have been trying to go to the T.D.s over the inspector's head to try to do better than they thought the inspector was doing for them, they have recognised that the inspector is as good a friend of theirs as anybody else, that he is trying to do his best for them, and I think they are reaching the position that they recognise that the inspector ought to be allowed to do what he considers right and just without having any political pressure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, once the Minister comes into all these matters of rearrangement, <Col N="56" /> in spite of the assurance he has given that there will be no change, with the adjustments he has made in the matter of the powers of rearrangement he is going to have, I cannot reconcile his statements with a complete exclusion of the Minister from matters of expenditure.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe, as I have already said, that he would be saving himself a great deal of trouble, if, whether he can accept the amendment or not, he would give the House some indication of the lines on which he proposes to work and some more substantial assurance than he seems prepared to give that there will be effective control in this matter, and that local officers will not be subjected to a species of undue pressure in order to make them inclined to accept very unreasonable demands.</P>

      <P>I think it might help the passage of the Bill if the Minister were to adopt the course which I now suggest.  While I do not subscribe to some of the arguments advanced by Deputy Moylan, I feel that there may be something which needs investigation with regard to what the ultimate administrative difficulties are in relation to the section, and I suggest to the Minister that, without accepting the amendment, he should get his Department's view on it between now and the Report Stage&mdash;a course which, I am sure, the Opposition will accept&mdash; and if it were found necessary, with a view to making the Bill better, to make any changes, he could make these changes on Report and so cut short this shadow-boxing and elongated type of discussion which is leading us nowhere.  Deputy Moylan has said that the £50 is a notional figure, so far as he is concerned, and if the Minister feels that there is any foundation for Deputy Moylan's views, I suggest that he can have the matter examined between now and Report and allow us to get on with the Bill. Whether there is any merit in the case made by Deputy Moylan and his colleagues or not, it may be worthy of a certain amount of reinvestigation, and I suggest that the Minister gives it <Col N="57" /> that examination between now and Report, and we can then have the matter out again on Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>A little reason coming from the Government Benches is strange and, as a stranger, I give it welcome.  If the Minister will examine the matter and bring in his own proposals on Report Stage, I have no doubt he will be able to go a long way towards satisfying me.  Again, I say that my motive in putting down this amendment is to make the Bill more workable.  Deputy Cowan, a well-known lawyer and a very fine debater on most subjects, seems to be completely astray in regard to this problem.  Will the House try to accept this point of view, that we are not dealing with the question of the arrangement of land, but with human nature, acquisitive human nature?  It seems to me that most of the people who talk about cutting red tape and speeding up matters have never lived in rural Ireland and know nothing of the problems of rural Ireland or the mentality of the people there. They have been completely ossified in their suburban life.</P>
      <P>I want to make a complete distinction in relation to expenditure between the estimate for the work to be done and any deviations from that estimate which will necessarily arise.  It is not with the estimate for the cost of the work we are dealing.  What we are dealing with are the deviations from that estimate.  Wherever expenditure has to be made which needs to be made swiftly, we must give the inspector as wide powers as are necessary for him.  Is there anything unreasonable in that?  I can see that, instead of speeding up a solution of this problem, it will delay it, because, human nature being as it is, acquisitive, and particularly so when people are in very poor circumstances, we must not bring our judgment to bear on their methods at all but on their needs, and people who are in dire need will struggle to get out of that condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is known that, in relation to any congested farm which needs rearrangement, the inspector has unlimited power to spend money, that there is no statutory check on his expenditure, <Col N="58" /> pressure will constantly be brought to bear on him by people whose needs are greater than their&mdash;I will not use the word &ldquo;honesty&rdquo; as it is a word I do not like in this context.  We must take their needs more into consideration than their methods and their method will be to try to bring all the pressure they can to bear on the inspector. They know the inspector wants to solve the problem and they can put so many kinks in the procedure that they can hold him up to ransom time and again.  They will do it and I do not blame them; but if it were made manifest to them that the inspector had at his disposal for his free expenditure only a certain amount, an amount with a limit on it, it would tend towards speed rather than delay.  I am not confined to £50&mdash;I really do not want to curb the inspector in any fashion which might delay the work he has to do.  Give him sufficient but put a limit on it.  Again, I want to emphasise that I am not discussing the general estimate of expenditure in relation to any rearrangement scheme, but the deviations from that estimate which will cause the trouble.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>I would, perhaps, agree with Deputy Moylan if we could have a situation in which a rearrangement scheme in Mayo or Galway was held up because of the main estimate for the work being too little by £300 or £400, and the local inspector could then apply to the inspector for the area who would get in touch, by phone or by post, with the commissioners and secure a guarantee that the extra money would be sent down within a week or a fortnight.  If we could get that agreement, I have no doubt that, if such a scheme were presented to the commissioners, they would not stop good work because of a few hundred pounds.  But did we ever get that? We never got it since the days of the old Congested Districts Board.</P>

      <P>Three-quarters of a million pounds were spent in one particular year and maybe in many years.  The expenditure was never less than £250,000 any year.  If it is known amongst these people that inspectors have at their discretion the expenditure <Col N="59" /> of improvement money without control, whether it is £250,000 or £1,000,000, it will slow up all progress. Deputies living in congested areas, and knowing the mentality of these people and knowing their needs, can very well visualise the methods they will utilise to cure their condition.</P>

      <P>When a crowd of workmen under the supervision of a local ganger, and he in turn under the supervision of the Land Commission inspector, are in an area doing good work to bring about a resettlement of a land problem, I want to make sure that before the workmen and the ganger leave the area the amount of work to be done will be done.  We know it has happened time and again that a divisional inspector gets in a &ldquo;tear&rdquo; with the Department.  We know what the Land Commission officials are and, in fairness to them, it would be impossible for the officials of the Land Commission to deal with 200 or 300 similar applications with similar amounts that would come in within the same week.  I dare say the porter carrying the files around would take something like two or three days to locate the exact office in the Department to go to with them, let alone putting the signature to them&mdash;a signature for something that could very well be done on the spot, or at least in the locality, the division or the county in which the work was being carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="60" /> I agree with Deputy Moylan that it is the nature and the habits of the people you have to understand more than anything else, and that on many occasions one inspector in an area can bring about a much better resettlement scheme with a much lesser amount of money than another because he understands the people; but how much more successful would he be if he could finish the work on the spot, rather than have to wait over and maybe see the whole thing broken up because there were a few hundred pounds short.</P>
    <P>In fairness to Deputy Moylan, he should understand the Land Commission and if any Minister spends long in the Land Commission he gets affected by the type of procedure that is used over there.  That is what is beginning to worry me, and I am very anxious to keep on the heels of the present Minister in case the rot should set in with him as it has with others. There were several Ministers for Lands on the Fianna Fáil side.  There was one ex-Minister in particular, a Deputy from my own county, Deputy Ruttledge.

    <P>Amendment negatived.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 18:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), after paragraph (n), to add a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(o) the determination of all applications for sub-division or sub-letting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rearrangement is the chief headache of the Land Commission.  The consolidation into economic holdings of a number of unrelated plots and sub-division, to my mind, tend to recreate a problem for which a solution has been found at great expense and great trouble.  The sub-division of farms, to the national detriment, is, to my mind, a very evil thing and a very urgent <Col N="63" /> thing and should not be permitted without very grave consideration of all the surrounding facts.  Sub-division for the applicant is always desirable, always urgent.  He has always very good reasons to advance as to why the Land Commission should agree to his proposals.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister would be well advised to make this an excepted matter so that, if it merely is dealt with by his Department in the ordinary way or from his own office, he will, as a result of transferring it to the Land Commissioners, be relieved from the always urgent pressure that is brought to bear in matters of this sort.</P>
    <P>I have a particular reason for desiring that there should be clarity in regard to this particular matter.  There have been statements made here that unjustifiable sub-division was put through in the Department of Lands as a result of ministerial submission to political influence.  That statement has been made here time and again.  I am not accusing the Minister.  I have been accused, as a matter of fact, and other Ministers have been accused, of agreeing to sub-division of certain holdings as a result of political pressure.  Certain sub-divisions that went through the Land Commission are wholly undesirable. It is to prevent happenings of that sort again that I would like that the commissioners should have complete control.  There are several cases in which sub-division was agreed to during recent years which, to my mind, should never have been agreed to.  They did not come to the Minister's office.  They did not require ministerial sanction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>And if they had, perhaps, they would not be granted?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good, and the same thing applies to me.  They would not be granted by me, either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know, if the Minister does not accept this amendment&mdash;I hope he does&mdash;what the procedure is so that, when Deputies come <Col N="64" /> into this House and make protests against a particular case that they regard as undesirable, we shall have full information as to how that sub-division was made.  I have never been able to find out who was responsible for these particular sub-divisions against which my own face was set.  It would be far better for the Minister and for the Department if the question of sub-division was made more difficult even though it would cause inconvenience to a number of people because the whole question of agreement to sub-division is in complete conflict with rearrangement.  You are trying to create economic holdings on the one hand and you are permitting uneconomic holdings to be created on the other.  I think that if that were made an excepted matter it would be wholly desirable and a really good method of dealing with this particular problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy be agreeable that things like the sub-letting of part of a holding for a specific purpose or giving a rood or two for the building of a house should be capable of being dealt with by the Administration as distinct from the lay commissioners?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have no objection to providing enough ground for a house to be built on, but the sub-division of small farms is recreating the system of rundale that all this debate is about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say straight to the Minister that I feel that the case made by Deputy Moylan, who is leading for the Opposition on this Bill, was made on a two-fold basis, interest in the improvement of the land code and an attempt to be helpful to the Minister.  I feel that the Minister may have a problem that he wants to deal with rapidly on an administrative basis, a problem such as I have envisaged in the question I put to Deputy Moylan. I do feel&mdash;and I am saying this quite openly in this House&mdash;that unless we can come to an understanding and try to improve the Bill in a genuine way, we will not get this Bill through in anything like a reasonable length of time.  I would suggest to the Minister <Col N="65" /> that he should outline to the House in a specific way the type of problem which he feels should not be an excepted matter and the reasons why.  When the House had heard all that, I think it would be a question of compromise or reconsideration on the part of the Department to frame a section which would not curtail these powers regarding the sub-letting of part of a small farm near a village for the building of a house.  We would then have an Act with specific exceptions in the interests of all concerned with which the Administration should deal leaving other problems in the hands of the lay commissioners with residual powers left to the Minister to prevent this nauseating system continuing whereby unwarrantable sub-division allows the creation of rural slums and uneconomic farms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why Deputy Moylan hit on sub-letting.  I presume he is referring to the sub-letting of land&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy refers to the user of land in the occupation of the Land Commission pending allotment.  Is that right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am concerned completely with sub-division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy is not too particular about sub-letting. That is more or less automatic and is done by an auctioneer in most cases, except in very congested areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister referring to conacre letting?  This is sub-letting which can only be done by the tenant.  Conacre is completely different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of sub-division opens a particularly big field. While I am quite well aware that sub-divisions were granted by the commissioners in the past, which I would not have granted and which, I am sure, <Col N="66" /> Deputy Moylan would not have granted, it has never been defined up to this.  Sub-division was never an excepted matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It became the function of the commissioners because the Minister had not the power of performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal thing I am interested in with regard to sub-division is that I do not want to see sub-division recreating uneconomic holdings or what Deputy Collins described as rural slums.  Also, I think that sub-division will enter very largely into the forestry programme.  I do not think it is wise to give the commissioners power of veto, because if they were so minded I am afraid that they could destroy the whole forestry programme, because they could refuse sub-division, and most of the land which the Forestry Department will be asking for is commonage or poor land attached to a holding requiring sub-division. If Deputy Moylan will accept it, I will have the whole case reexamined between now and Report Stage to see whether we can arrive at a solution and eliminate the danger of recreating congestion on the one hand and safeguard the forestry programme on the other.</P>
      <P>There is a problem which most solicitors have found from time to time where application is made for building sites which, if it were granted, would not materially reduce the size of the farm or make it uneconomic.  Nine out of ten applications, apart from forestry, are for building.  The question of giving half an English rood, a statute acre or sometimes a couple of acres for use as a building site should be left in the hands of the local inspector.  He should be allowed to say &ldquo;Yes, that is all right.&rdquo;  I will have the whole thing examined between now and the Report Stage to see whether anything can be done along the lines I have suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>By some inadvertence, I did not include in the amendment <Col N="67" /> everything I desired to have in it.  If the Minister in examining the question in order to deal with sub-division&mdash;and I have no desire to curb the Forestry Department in getting their 25,000 acres per annum.  I would love to see them doing it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;would the Minister examine the question of men who got allotments of land and who for one reason or another were given permission to sell?  This proposal is quite allied to the amendment.  I am not at all satisfied that the method whereby permission is secured by those who get holdings from the Land Commission and are subsequently permitted to sell these in the open market is controlled as effectively as it ought to be controlled.  I have in mind a number of cases.  Have I permission to pursue this matter?  I think it is related to the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid it is a very distant relation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it is a distant relation, but I am thankful to the Chair because this is a very important matter and I omitted it through inadvertence. A good deal of trouble has been caused by the giving of allotments to men who were subsequently permitted to sell those allotments within a few years.  In effect, those men were given the equivalent of a £1,000 gift from the public purse and I think that is indefensible.  If there is acceptance in the future of a right to sell, I think that should be examined to the nth degree.  I think the Minister would be wise in making it an excepted matter in the hands of the Land Commission. If he is prepared to do that, I shall be more than grateful to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make just one remark in reply to that?  I am afraid that making it an excepted matter will not achieve the end Deputy Moylan and I would like to achieve.  We shall <Col N="68" /> have to twist our brains a little bit more in an effort to find some other method of making it watertight.  It was as good as an excepted matter in the past by virtue of the fact that the Minister could not agree to sub-division and, because of the Minister's lack of power, it became a matter for the commissioners.  In practical effect, that made it an excepted matter.  It must be admitted that things with which we did not agree and which were in direct conflict with governmental policy did happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  May I suggest that the difficulties can be solved?  The Minister has suggested that it may require more mental effort to reach a solution, but something readily presents itself to my mind, and perhaps Deputy Moylan would consider my suggestion in the non-contentious atmosphere we now have.  A possible way of circumventing the difficulty would be to specify a certain period during which an allottee will not be permitted to resell his farm.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one aspect which has not been adverted to by any speaker.  Sub-division can do the greatest damage in those areas where we are most anxious to relieve congestion. There is a type of person coming in here and buying sites in remote rural areas for the purpose of constructing residences on them.  An application for sub-division where the area involved is only a couple of acres is almost invariably refused.  What happens then is that the individual who wants to buy the site finances the redemption of the entire annuity.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I move this amendment as a last and final appeal and in the hope that the Minister may see reason and may see the wisdom of maintaining in the hands of the Land Commission the determination of the selection of allottees and the price at which land is to be sold to them.  While he has argued that he is dealing merely with rearrangement schemes, all these <Col N="73" /> schemes involve the dealing with quite a good deal of land other than the particular rundale farm.  In the manner in which the section is framed it gives the Minister, as far as I can see, complete power over all land.  One of the things the Minister said was that none of these schemes is really framed by the Minister or by the Land Commission; the framers are the allottees&mdash; and, I suppose, they are pretty good at it&mdash;but this, it seems to me, is hardly sustainable.  No matter how good a framer you are in framing schemes inside a rundale farm, you must have framed a good deal of land outside of it whereby you will, by some method of framing or other, get out one of the migrants or allottees to make room for the others.  Therefore, if the Minister were merely dealing with rundale farms as such and with no outside land, there might be some reason in it.</P>
    <P>Rearrangement is one of the most difficult problems handled by the Land Commission.  All of us know that now, having had this discussion.  It is encumbered with private jealousies and local intolerance and suspicion. Deputy Cowan, or the suburban satellites here in the Dáil, have no conception as to what the conditions are in congested areas.  They know nothing of rural Ireland.  It is quite clear from the eloquence of Deputy Cowan&mdash;his beautiful method of solving all the problems of the Land Commission with a wave of the hand&mdash;that he has not any conception of the mentality of the people with whom the Minister is dealing.  Of course, because the Minister's mentality is so allied to that of the people with whom he is dealing, he is so close to the trees that he cannot see the wood.  We who stand slightly outside, and with a judicial outlook, realise that there is a good deal of unwisdom in this &ldquo;with&rdquo; or &ldquo;without&rdquo;&mdash;particularly the &ldquo;without&rdquo;. The whole purpose of this is to try to retain the merits of (b) (1) of Section 10&mdash;the determination of the actual lands to be acquired or resumed&mdash;as an excepted matter and that the Minister or any of his officials shall not create a position whereby that particular part <Col N="74" /> of (1) of Section 10 is to be destroyed. That really is the point at issue.  I think the Minister is most unwise.  I think it is a bad thing that he should do it.</P>

      <P>I was urging on the Minister the complete undesirability of his intrusion on work that has heretofore been in the complete control of the Land Commission.  While I feel that dealing with rundale farms directly, and not through the Land Commission is undesirable, I feel that his dealing with other lands is a contradiction to the terms of paragraph (b), of sub-section (1) of Section 10. If one stands, the other falls and, therefore, I think that the Minister ought to agree either to mend his hand here or completely delete the words I suggest.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out that I think the Minister's leaving in these words does not make any sense seeing that we have accepted amendment No. 20 and cut out the words &ldquo;framed or&rdquo;.  I was one of the Deputies who, like Deputy Commons, felt that the Minister was taking power to speed up the rearrangement of holdings and that, with the elimination of these words, &ldquo;framed or&rdquo;, the Minister has left himself the power to approve.  He has told us that the scheme is to be a scheme really drawn up by the tenants of these intermixed holdings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out that, in my view, the removal of the words &ldquo;framed or&rdquo; leaves no alternative to the Minister but the acceptance of the amendment proposed by Deputy Moylan in amendment No. 21.  I wish to make the point to the Minister that, having himself suggested the removal of the words to which I have referred, Deputy Commons and myself believed that the Minister was taking power to do something in relation to the matter of speeding up rearrangements, but now he leaves himself with the approval of work done by somebody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="76" />&ldquo;whether with or without the distribution of other lands to facilitate the said rearrangement.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I take it that it is agreed on all sides that the difficulty in relation to the rearrangement of intermixed holdings is not nearly so great as the difficulty these tenants would have if they had to rearrange their own holdings in conjunction with other lands.  I think that would be quite impossible altogether. I am one of those who, while objecting to the Minister's taking power to name the allottees, would much more readily give him the right to do something positive in the creation of acceptable rearrangement schemes but I take it that he has already shed that power and, therefore, he is putting an impossible task on the people who own these intermixed holdings if he asks them not alone to rearrange their intermixed holdings but to do that in conjunction with the division of other lands.  I do not see how it is possible to get people to draw up a scheme which takes in lands other than those they already hold.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It was never intended that the Minister should have the allotting of new holdings, even where they would be taken out of congested holdings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give us a better explanation of the amendment he proposes to bring in, in order to clarify this matter because after all there is no great point in trying to have a rearrangement scheme carried out, if it is to be mixed up with outside lands?  Undoubtedly rearrangement would be a matter for the people themselves to agree upon but this question of outside lands certainly gives the Minister power over all lands, no matter what they are taken for, because you can relate a rearrangement scheme anywhere to untenanted land that has been taken over, no matter in what part of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to emphasise the point of view that we do not wish to curb the authority of the Minister over the Department in any fashion other than in relation to excepted matters.  While, on the one hand, the Minister agrees that such matters should be outside the domain of everyday politics, on the other hand he proceeds to amend the terms in which the excepted matters are set out under paragraphs (d) and (e) of sub-section (1) of Section 10.  In the final paragraph of the section he arrogates to himself the power to nominate the allottees and to control the distribution of all land.  That is a complete reversal of all precedents.  It is entirely unwise.  We feel it is an authority that should be denied to any Minister.  Sub-section (2) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Any power or duty for the time being vested by law (including this Act) in the Land Commission or the lay commissioners may, save in relation to excepted matters, be exercised or performed by&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the Minister, or...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="82" /> If the excepted matters were left stand there would be no difficulty.  What we find fault with is where the Minister makes an exception to the exceptions. We find fault particularly with paragraph (b):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any officer of the Minister or the Land Commission for the time being exercised, whether specifically or by reference to a class of such officers, in that behalf by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That seems to me to read that even the rawest typist in the Minister's office, so long as she is an accredited civil servant, may be given authority to deal with all these vital matters in the Bill.  The Minister should really take it upon himself to make that provision much more narrow.  As it stands, I think it is entirely unwise. The safety of all those who hold land, or who are seeking to have land allotted to them, should lie and does lie at the moment in the hands of the judicial authority.  We completely disagree with the Minister because he is making these exceptions and is taking authority from the commissioners, the judicial body, and is claiming to hand it over to any particular servant, no matter of what rank.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;why does he put in this section &ldquo;any officer of the Minister or the Land Commission for the time being authorised&rdquo;?  In view of this amendment, to which Deputy Collins has drawn my attention, there is definitely need for an amendment to this section to bring it into line with the other.  I disagree entirely with the Minister's taking authority unto himself from the Land Commission in regard to what should be excepted matters.  It is making bad worse.  I suggest to Deputy Collins that a judge, in interpreting the law, will weigh one section of an Act against another and decide which particular section applies to a particular case.  There will be no certainty in the law if that is the position. No matter how bad the law is, as it will be, it is wholly desirable that it should have the virtue of certainty.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;any officer of the Minister or the Land Commission for the time being authorised, whether specifically or by reference to a class of such officers, in that behalf by the Minister&rdquo;,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>may be very wide.  I would ask the Minister to indicate to the House whether he is limiting the rank of officer below which he could not conceive this power being exercised.  I suggest to him that he could amend this to the extent of limiting his powers of delegation within the actual Land Commission itself to certain officers.  It seems to me that the Minister's amendment No. 30 presupposes the rank of the officer to whom he <Col N="84" /> would be prepared to give the power in connection with rearrangement, anyway. I suggest that it might be at least of some statutory value and consequence in the subsequent interpretation of the Act and it might also meet the Opposition's wishes if he did lay down what was the rank below which he would not allow the power to be exercised.</P>

      <P>If the Minister would give us some information about the powers and the duties in regard to matters, other than the excepted matters, which the commissioners are performing at present without reference to the Minister, we would have a better idea of what we are discussing. One of these matters was adverted to earlier to-day, the question of sub-division. The Minister admitted himself that the commissioners were carrying out sub-division because the Minister had not power to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless he amends on Report the portion of the section already passed, under this sub-section we are dealing with now the Minister will have the full powers of sub-division in the future.  It is not an excepted matter.  That is the object of this sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The object is to give the Minister powers in connection with sub-division. That is one item.  There are many others over which the Minister is taking power from the commissioners which they are exercising at present. According to the sub-section, it is quite plain that the commissioners in future will only be responsible for exercising powers in excepted matters.  I am wondering if the Minister is wise in taking unto himself power with regard to several matters that could be mentioned. Several functions that the commissioners are performing at present the Minister proposes to perform in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be apparent to Deputies that one of the principal purposes <Col N="85" /> of this Bill is the reorganisation of the Land Commission in order to clear up a lot of doubts and misgivings which existed heretofore.  Although attempts were made in the 1933 Act and in the 1939 Act to clarify the powers of the Minister and the commissioners, both of these attempts failed. Unfortunately, I can give no guarantee that this Bill may not also fail in attaining that objective.  I am, however, making an attempt and I think it will succeed where the other two attempts failed.  Only time and the working of it can prove whether it will or not.  I believe it will clear up once and for all the question of the powers of the commissioners and of the Minister. Deputy Moylan, Deputy Derrig, Deputy Aiken and all those who were Ministers for Lands during the last 18 years know quite well that neither the commissioners nor the Ministers knew where their powers ended and the powers of the others began.  That is not as it should be.  In introducing the 1933 Act, Deputy Aiken gave an assurance to the House that Section 6 of that Act was going to do what I am proposing to do under this section, and which, by the way, these amendments tabled by Deputy Moylan and others would throw back into the same old hazy fog so that nobody would know where he was or what he was doing.</P>
      <P>The result of the previous legislation was that the whole work of the Land Commission fell on the commissioners. That is not as it should be. That is why the excepted matters in this Bill are more than doubled, as I am trying to set out exactly what the commissioners are to do and what the Minister is to do, or at least the ordinary staff is to do.  The commissioners have a very important position. I do not think the commissioners should have their time taken up by small matters costing a few shillings.  Commissioners in any other departments are not paid for that kind of thing.  These small matters are utterly beneath their station, and they should not have been burdened with them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Aiken, in introducing the 1933 Act, said, at column 2381, Volume 48, of the Official Debates:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;One of the principal objects for <Col N="86" /> which Fianna Fáil was founded was to establish on the land as many families as practicable.  This was also one of the fundamental objects of the old Sinn Féin Movement and of the First Dáil.  The Bill is designed to meet the needs of the present situation, and to rearrange the administration of the Land Commission so that the object which the Government have in view may be achieved with the shortest possible delay.  The Land Commission was set up here when the people had very little contact with their governors, and when the Ministers in London had neither the desire nor the opportunity to supervise in detail its administration in the interests of the Irish people.  Before the setting up of the Free State, there were a number of other departments operating on the same basis; notably the Intermediate Education Commissioners, the Commissioners of Education, the Department of Agriculture, the Forestry Commissioners and the Local Government Department.  Since 1922 the six departments I have mentioned, and seven others, have been reorganised to conform to the new situation.  The Bill proposes to bring the Land Commission into line with all the other Government Departments....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That shows clearly that Deputy Aiken set out then to reorganise the Land Commission, a very laudable objective, but any of the ex-Ministers will agree that that has not been achieved.  Why, I do not know&mdash;perhaps it is the draftsman's fault.  It is impossible to say with whom the fault lies.  I should say, however, that Deputy Roddy pointed out at the time that, because of the wording of Section 6, the object which Deputy Aiken, the acting Minister for Lands, said it would achieve would not be achieved.  He pointed out that it would not do anything like that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>You are not amending Section 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, definitely.  Deputy Roddy said at column 49, Volume 49, of the Official Debates:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Before I pass from Section 6, I just want to make this comment.  I <Col N="87" /> do not know who drafted this Bill but whoever it was, I cannot compliment the draftsman on his work.  It is a very badly drafted Bill and particularly bad in some of its parts.  There are sections complementary and explanatory of each other which are not related at all.  There are other sections very badly and loosely drafted, but I submit this section is vitiated in the sense that the Minister cannot assume these extraordinary powers he is seeking without repealing certain relevant sections in the Act of 1881 and without amending in certain respects and repealing certain sections of the Land Law (Ireland) Acts and subsequent Acts.  I submit only then would this Section 6 be legally watertight; as it is worded at the moment and if it is not amended, it will afford plenty of employment for lawyers in interpreting its real scope and intention.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What Section 6 of the 1933 Act set out to achieve and failed to achieve is quite obvious.  I am trying to do it now, and that is why the number of excepted matters in this Bill is increased. While I have no objection whatever to increasing indefinitely the number of excepted matters, if it would have the effect of clearing the air, I want the House to set out clearly what duties the commissioners will have and what duties the Minister will have.  At present, neither the commissioners nor I know where our duties are, and Deputy Moylan must agree with me in that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>If he does not he is completely at variance with his colleagues and it is tantamount to saying that Deputy Aiken was not speaking truthfully when he made the statement I have quoted.  This is relevant because I am repealing Section 6 of the 1933 Act and substituting my Section 10 which I claim will definitely, once and for all, clear the air and let the Minister and the commissioners know exactly where their duties begin and end.  At present, as I say, neither the commissioners nor I know where we stand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of rearrangement schemes, it is proposed to give the sanctioning of such schemes to a divisional inspector.  For the benefit of Deputies who may not be aware of it, the inspectorate is graded in this way: a chief inspector at the top, with four divisional inspectors, each in charge of four fairly large areas&mdash;in charge sometimes of counties, sometimes an area larger than counties and sometimes half a county, according to the amount of congestion or Land Commission work in the area. These inspectors are rated grade 1 and under these are grade 2 and grade 3 inspectors, the whole inspectorial staff running up to something between 126 and 130.  It is proposed to give the approving of rearrangement schemes to the divisional inspectors, of whom there are only four in the service.</P>
      <P>As regards the other matters with which sub-section (2) of Section 10 deals, these will be given to the staff in the ordinary way.  As Deputy Moylan mentioned typing, it will be given to typists.  The vesting or resale of lands will be given to the appropriate director and his staff, the collection of annuities to the director of the Collection Branch and his staff, and so on.  At present none of us knows who is responsible for a particular job and who should carry it out, or give instructions to have it carried out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>My principal objection, and, I think, Deputy Moylan's, to this sub-section is that we had to read it in conjunction with the powers which the Minister has got the Dáil to give him in sub-section (1).  Were it not for the fact that the Minister is taking on himself the exercise of functions in relation to matters which we think should be left in the hands of the Land Commission for the exercise of a judicial judgment, I could see no great objection to this sub-section (2).  The Minister is making a great fuss about what he is doing in this section and about how he is amending Section 6 of the 1933 Act in order to reorganise as he calls it the Land Commission; <Col N="89" /> but actually sub-sections (3) and (4) are taken word for word from Section 6 of the 1933 Act, with a few small amendments which have relation to the new powers the Minister is assuming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite right, and some of the excepted matters are word for word taken from Section 6 of the 1933 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister need not try to sell this sub-section to us with the idea that he is doing anything new to reorganise the Land Commission and bring it up to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Why all the bother about it then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the Minister is taking back in sub-section (1) powers which, for a very good reason, were left to the Land Commission.  If it were not for these powers which the Minister now takes back to himself, there would be no grave objection to the section or any clause in it; but Deputy Moylan had to read this, when he put down the amendment to delete the section, in relation to sub-clauses (d) and (e) of sub-section (10), and it is because we object to the Minister's taking these powers to fix the price of rearrangement holdings and so on that we object to the Minister nominating some perhaps junior official of the Land Commission to do the job and then to fix the seal of the lay commissioners to it as if it were a decision of the lay commissioners.  That is why we object, and for no other reason.  If the commissioners had left Section 6, the division of the powers and functions as between the commissioners and himself, as it was in the 1933 Act, no one would bother about the words of this particular clause; but because he has (d) and (e) of sub-section (1) we object to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the 1933 Act failed to define the separate powers of the commissioners and the Minister.  That is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  These excepted matters definitely gave <Col N="90" /> specific powers to the commissioners and took them out of the Minister's hand.  The Minister divested himself of these particular powers.  What does the Minister do?  He quotes Deputy Roddy, who said that Section 6 was badly drafted.  If it was badly drafted, does the inclusion of exceptions to exceptions make it a better drafting? That is a surprising way of amending the powers.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that he is reorganising the Land Commission organisation because he feels that all the work devolves on the commissioners.  In spite of that, he is, in another section, reducing the number of commissioners. It seems to me that he is completely incorrect in saying that all the work fell on the Land Commissioners.  All the work of the Land Commission was carried out by the officers of the Department, and the two commissioners acted in a judicial capacity.  It is most essential that the public should be protected by an authority that has judicial powers.  Sometimes it has been said here that the courts of justice would be the right place to decide all these cases.  I entirely disagree, since it would be impossible to have the Land Commission cases heard there, in view of the tremendous amount of work the courts of justice have to get through.  It is highly desirable for a judicial authority to be fully conversant with the matters on which they are giving decisions.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Aiken said, we would not object to this section so much if the Minister had not taken from the Land Commissioners the authority he is taking from them in (d) and (e) of sub-section (1) of Section 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will create a lack of confidence in the authority of the Land Commission.  The Minister has taken up sub-section (3) of Section 10.  As Deputy Aiken pointed out, that is entirely <Col N="91" /> a transcript of (3) and (4) of the Land Act of 1933, with the significant addition: &ldquo;or done by any officer in the exercise or performance by virtue of sub-section (2) of this section of any power or duty&rdquo;.  In other words, the Minister builds up the camouflage of two sections already passed into law in the 1933 Act, in order to cover up the final significant phrase which gives the power to any officer of the Minister or the Land Commission &ldquo;for the time being authorised, whether specifically or by reference to a class of such officers, in that behalf by the Minister&rdquo;. The authority that is specifically given to the commissioners in (3) and (4) of Section 6 are taken from the commissioners by this insignificant yet very significant phrase which tails off this particular sub-section.</P>

      <P>While we are on this subject of commissioners, it would be remarkable if I let it pass without saying something about the slowness of the Land Commission generally.  Everyone knows that the real delay in the Land Commission and in this resettlement is due to the delay in providing sufficient land to relieve congestion and in giving decisions which should be given in a short space of time.  That is the real cause of all the trouble.</P>
      <P>The Minister, fortunately, has not taken to himself the powers the Opposition claim he has.  I would be very happy if he did take unto himself the power to determine the person from whom land is to be acquired or resumed and to determine the actual land to be acquired or resumed.  He is not doing that or even nominating senior officials of his Department to do it.  He is nominating senior officials to carry out the work detailed in paragraphs (d) and (e), which does not point in any way to the determination of the persons or of the land.  I do not see why all this row occurs over the powers the Minister is handing over to officials, now that he has assured us that they will not be below the rank of senior inspector or divisional inspector, whichever it may be.  These men have a thorough knowledge of what is required, especially rearrangement and resettlement.</P>
      <P>As I have said many times before, is it not the schemes submitted by senior inspectors, local and divisional inspectors that finally get sanction from the commissioners?  It would be very interesting if some Minister for Lands&mdash;perhaps the present Minister would do it&mdash;would delve into the files and find out for this House how many times schemes submitted by those inspectors have been altered by the commissioners?</P>

      <P>I think the issue is knit between us quite simply on this matter.  There are no new powers at all here except powers that are consequent on the change that was made by the Minister in regard to rearrangement schemes in connection with rundale and intermixed plots.  There is no deviation at all under this section save what is necessary to bring it into line with what is contemplated in sub-section (1) of Section 10.  The two particular sub-sections to which the Opposition take exception were argued at full length on Section 10 sub-section (1).  Sub-section (2) and the following sub-sections are bringing the land code into line with the changes made.  Again the issue between the Government and the Opposition is as to whether the Minister was doing right in taking certain powers to himself. I would suggest that there is no departure in any of these sub-sections other than to bring the Bill into line with that power which the Minister is taking.  We argued fully here whether he should or should not take that power.  The House arrived at a decision and, at this stage, I suggest, with respect to you, a Chinn Chomhairle, and to Deputy Moylan, that all we are doing now is arguing on a change consequential on a change that the House has already accepted, that the matter should be approached in that light and put to the House for determination on that basis rather than have a prolonged discussion again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we can agree that there is hardly any change in this matter.  It is quite true that, as well as being a judicial body, the Land Commission is an administrative body.  It was to strengthen the hands <Col N="94" /> of the Minister and to place him, <i>vis-á-vis</i> the commissioners and the administration of their offices, as far as was possible, in the same relation as Ministers in other Departments <i>vis-á-vis</i> the administrative officers of those Departments that Section 6 of the 1933 Act was passed.  In this case the Minister is, in the first place, putting forward the illogical and, as Deputy Moylan pointed out, inconsistent argument that the section has not operated satisfactorily while at the same time he is taking the section and putting it into the new Bill.  If there is any lawyer present who could show in what particular the Minister's hands will be strengthened by the new drafting, I hope we will hear from him before the discussion closes.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the Minister is simply taking the existing sections, represented in sub-sections (3) and (4) here, from the 1933 Act and carrying them on.  He is taking, it is true, the additional power of delegation to his officers and, in so far as the Minister can make a case for that, I suppose, if the House agrees that the Minister should have the same power over the administration as other Ministers have in their respective spheres, this delegation of authority to individual officers should, perhaps, naturally follow.</P>
      <P>The difficulty that arises is that the Land Commission is a judicial body. While the House will, no doubt, be anxious to strengthen the Minister, in so far as he can make a case that there is any doubt as to his having that power that we would wish over the administration, the courts take a very jealous view of the judicial functions of the commission and, if it were to be suggested that the Minister or an officer of the Minister were to interfere or to purport to be authorised by the Oireachtas to carry out functions that appropriately belong to the commissioners in their judicial capacity, I have no doubt that the matter would be taken into the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Commons, perhaps, does not understand that from the point of view of our laws and Constitution the Land Commission is a judicial body which is entrusted with the transfer of property from the citizens to the State and from <Col N="95" /> them, in due course, to other citizens and that, therefore, the functions of the Land Commission have to be regarded as judicial functions.  Whatever the House may do about this matter, the decisions of the Land Commission in that matter can always be tested and have been tested in the courts.  If this House were to adopt the position of appearing to confer arbitrary powers upon inspectors or other persons that trespass upon these judicial functions, the persons aggrieved, of course, would have their remedy.  That is one of the reasons why, as the pool of land grew smaller and the compulsory powers of the commission had to be increased to enable it to get on with the work of trying to solve congestion, more and more resistance made itself felt in the courts and in this House.</P>

      <P>I do not know that I read the whole of it.  I probably read some part of it.  In any case, we cannot get away from the position of the Land Commission that I have described. If it is suggested that the Minister is to have the power of delegation, if it were the case that it could be challenged as an interference or an attempt in some way to interfere with the prerogatives of the Land Commission as a judicial body, of course, it would simply mean that the whole work of the Land Commission would be held up again as in the past. Therefore, while we ought to be wholeheartedly in favour of strengthening the Minister's position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the administration, we have to be careful, in the interests of the policy and the purpose he has in mind, not to go too far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (5) the Minister is taking power, where he or an officer exercises or performs by virtue of sub-section (2) of this section any power or duty, he may exercise or perform the <Col N="96" /> power or duty (a) in his own name or (b) in the name of the Land Commission or the lay commissioners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>What is wrong about that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister ought to act in his own name as far as possible and, if there is a case for acting in the name of the Land Commission or the lay commissioners, the House ought to be acquainted with it. I think that the lay commissioners and the Land Commission should be responsible for their own sins and get credit for their acts.  They should not be put in the position as a judicial body that the public and the Oireachtas do not know exactly what their responsibilities are.  If, in the long run, it is the Minister who is to make the decision in the name of the Land Commission or the commissioners and if he may come to a decision by delegating power to an officer, it is surely infringing, to put it very mildly, upon the sphere of the lay commissioners as a judicial body.  There may be no other way of solving this difficulty, as no matter what we do there will be administrative and judicial functions which will be related and even in these excepted matters it will be very hard with any phraseology to exclude what is administrative from what is judicial.  Here the Minister is taking power not only on his own behalf but through an officer appointed by him to act in the name of the Land Commission or the commissioners.  I do not know why that should be.  If a legal question is involved there is also a public question and the Land Commission and the commissioners should know where they stand.  They should not be placed in the position where in the case of something with which they disagree&mdash;because for all we know they may have given a contrary recommendation&mdash;they are not going to be heard and the Minister will take power on his own shoulders to speak on their behalf.  I do not know how the commissioners could be expected to carry out their duties satisfactorily if that condition is going to obtain.  I do not know how anybody is going to know where the functions of the commissioners <Col N="97" /> and the functions of the Minister begin and end.</P>
      <P>In sub-section (6) he takes sub-section (3) of the 1933 Act and applies this determination that the powers and duties which should properly belong to the Minister should belong not only to him but to an officer who may be appointed by him:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The exercise or performance of the power or duties and anything done in such exercise or performance, shall be as valid and effectual as if the exercise or performance of the power or duty or the doing of the thing were by...the Land Commission, the lay commissioners or, where the power or duty may be exercised or performed or the thing may be done by a particular number of lay commissioners (including one lay commissioner acting alone), by that number of lay commissioners, and, in particular, shall not be open to challenge or question by objection, appeal or otherwise on the ground of absence of concurrence in, consent to or cognisance of the exercise or performance of the power or duty, or the doing of the thing, whether on the part of the Land Commission, the lay commissioners or any of them or of any other person.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We suggested, and the Minister seemed to agree, that these powers which guaranteed to him the necessary control over the operations of the Land Commission so that it should discharge its administrative work properly and so that the work should be shared out between the lay commissioners seemed to have been fairly satisfactorily arranged in the 1933 Act. The Minister is going further with the question of delegation.  The delegated officer is not alone in the position of the Minister himself but there may be no challenge or appeal against any act of the said officer in the discharge of his duties.  The servant, like the Minister, will be permitted to act in the name of the Land Commission or the lay commissioners and no qualification is laid down.  Later on in sub-section (8) we are told that where an officer is to be entrusted with rearrangement he shall be an officer not below the rank of senior inspector.  That is <Col N="98" /> in regard to rundale or intermixed plots.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Collins pointed out, however, in regard to the general functions which the Minister proposes to delegate we are not told the degree of seniority and, what is more important, we have no safeguard as to the experience, knowledge or qualifications of officers in determining these matters. While we must admit that a senior inspector who has been dealing with rearrangements and has experience is capable of fulfilling these functions, his manner of doing so may be a different matter.  If the Minister proposes to confer on administrative officers in the Land Commission power to determine these questions down the country a situation might arise where an officer with very little practical experience in dealing with this particular type of problem might be called upon to come to a decision.</P>

      <P>Deputy Collins rightly says that this discussion is consequential. The reason for carrying it on is, of course, justifiable in so far as we are trying to salvage something from the wreckage.  It is a feature of democracy that a politician shall be subject to influence and it is not in any way wrong that it should be so as otherwise we would have a dictatorship. The Minister, being a politician, is subject to influence.  He must, where he is dealing in his ministerial capacity in justice between one man and another, protect himself by having these matters submitted to a judicial body.  A lot of the argument in support of the Minister's position is that this Bill will tend to substitute for complete failure on the part of the Land Commission complete success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Success is never an even progress <Col N="99" /> along a clearly defined path.  It is the overcoming of obstacles, the committing of errors, the learning from the errors committed and above all, it is a refusal to admit failure.  I do not admit failure on the part of the Land Commission. There are many things the Land Commission have not been able to do but what we are emphasising here is not the success of the Land Commission but the relatively minor failures in comparison with its success.</P>
    <P>What I seek to do is to preserve public confidence in the working of the Land Commission.  May I point out again that a politician is subject to influence? The Minister is a politician and he must protect himself.  Here he is doing things which are not justifiable. One of the greatest evils ever inflicted upon this country was the civil war. The civil war was brought about by pretence, by people pretending to do certain things they did not do and to stand for certain things for which they did not stand.  I object to pretence in legislation because pretence is always an evil thing.</P>
    <P>Here is a White Paper which talks about Section 10.  Section 10 defines and enlarges the number of excepted matters which are to be within the <Col N="100" /> commissioners' exclusive jurisdiction. It also confirms the control of the Minister for Lands over the Land Commission in non-excepted matters. Now the commissioners' exclusive jurisdiction is eaten into by the creation of exceptions to exceptions. The Minister is taking certain powers in (d) and (e) of sub-section (1) of Section 10 which completely destroy the effect of Section 6 of the Land Act, 1933.  The Minister said that Section 6 of the 1933 Act was badly drafted.  Yet, his method of correcting that draft is by the addition of certain words which completely eliminate the power he purports to give to the Land Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Our whole purpose, and again I wish to emphasise it, is to preserve a judicial authority in which the people will have confidence because no politician out of office can have confidence in a politician in office.  Perhaps the Minister will not always be where he is now.  Perhaps he will have an opportunity of showing his lack of confidence in the Minister who is there when he operates, as he unfortunately must, for a while at any rate, these unfortunate sections of this Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister has an amendment of his own here which talks about an officer of the Land Commission not below the rank of senior inspector.  Why not have his opposite number on the indoor staff, if so needed?  Why give a clerical officer, a junior executive officer, a higher executive officer, a typist&mdash;any officer &mdash;the authorisation?  The Minister suggested any officer.  I am merely asking that he shall put this in the hands of a responsible officer not below the rank of director which, I think, represents the grade of senior inspector on the outdoor staff.  Surely the Minister can accept that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I could not accept it.  As the Deputy knows very well, <Col N="104" /> the directors in the Land Commission are in charge of particular sections&mdash; Acquisition and Resale: Purchase; Collection, and so forth.  I think there are five directors in the Land Commission. It is not proposed to give the sanctioning of a rearrangement scheme to these men.  They are not on the inspectorial staff.  They might not know the first thing about rural conditions or congested conditions.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (2) proposes to give the indoor staff their correct share of the work and to give them a certain part of the responsibilities. Again, amendment No. 30, proposes to give the outdoor staff or a senior officer of that staff, the senior divisional inspector, his responsibility in his own sphere.  What is wrong about that? The Deputy has put down an amendment that is neither fish, flesh nor good red herring.</P>

      <P>The Minister is quite good on the red herring end of it.  In this sub-section you have: &ldquo;(a) the Minister or (b) any officer of the Minister&rdquo;. If the work is of sufficient importance <Col N="105" /> to be dealt with by the Minister, why should he take work he has arrogated to himself and hand it over to a typist?  That is what (b) means. One expects a responsible officer and an experienced officer to deal with certain work.  I think the Minister ought to accept the amendment.  When he has gone the distance in the other amendment of suggesting that certain outdoor work should not be done by anyone below the rank of chief inspector, what is wrong in my most humble proposal?</P>

      <P>In sub-section (3) to delete all words after the word &ldquo;matter&rdquo; in line 54 to the end of the sub-section.</P>
      <P>This is practically the same thing. Here we have a rehash in sub-section (3) of two sub-sections direct from the 1933 Act.  There is no difference.  The two sections are amalgamated into one section with the significant addition: &ldquo;by any officer in the exercise or performance by virtue of sub-section (2) of this section, of any power or duty&rdquo;.  I wonder if one of the messengers of the Land Commission is an officer of the Land Commission or at what particular grade in the service is the Minister going to draw the line? Will he draw a line of any kind for us? We want to be assured that the Bill gives authority only to responsible and experienced officers, not to &ldquo;any officer&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Is it not the position that the Minister is proposing to delegate all the powers, which the Oireachtas may entrust to him under this Bill or other Bills, to any officer without any reference to grading or without reference to any experience or qualifications of any kind, except that the Minister may select him?  What is the case the Minister makes for having complete and unfettered discretion in this matter?  Is the House not entitled to know that, at any rate, there will be some safeguard in the determination of the persons who will exercise these powers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that, unconsciously, Deputy Derrig is completely in error.  I hope that he does not deliberately put himself in that position.  I think the point he is missing is that no matter how the powers of delegation may be worded, and no matter what Department is concerned, there are different grades and types of work to be done.  There may be such things as even the taking out of a seal and the actual stamping of that seal on a document.  That is hardly work that you would expect some senior officer to do.  He may subsequently have to endorse it by way of his initials or by signing it.  You do not expect the director to do the job of a typist or the typist to do the job of a director.  The Department grades its own different types of responsibility.  Even if Deputy Moylan's amendment were carried and certain work was to be confined to the director, I think Deputy Moylan would probably agree that the director himself would have the power of delegation within his own section.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The responsibility must ultimately rest, as it does in any other Department, with the responsible sectional head of the Department. Take even a Party such as that of which Deputy Moylan is a member. They will grade their responsibilities <Col N="107" /> and they will grade the responsibility to be attached to statements made by members of the Party according to their position and rank within the Party.  You will find that in any organisation. I think that the well-intentioned effort of Deputy Moylan to salvage something of the wreck of the decision, as he describes it, on paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) has led him away from an appreciation of what the situation in the ordinary administration of the Department is.  In a way, the Minister's amendment, which comes along subsequently, to deal with rearrangement schemes in connection with rundale and intermixed plots, is an assurance to the House that in that limited category where a very difficult and personal problem arises as regards congests, the persons appointed to carry out that work will have sufficient experience and competence to deal with it.  That is a specialised task.  If the Minister had not the amendment down, I would be opposing the section on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not correct to state that it is not laid down in any statute the class of persons who may exercise certain functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister challenged a few moments ago that there was no power in any Act specifying the class of persons to perform any function, or <Col N="108" /> people who could not perform certain functions below certain ranks.  The first thing that comes to my mind is the case of a shot-gun licence.  It is laid down by law that nobody below the rank of superintendent can revoke or withdraw it.  In the case of a hackney licence nobody below the rank of a chief superintendent can refuse or withdraw it.</P>
      <P>All Deputy Moylan is attempting to do is to specify the class of persons in the Land Commission not below a certain rank who will exercise these powers delegated to them by the Minister. There are many powers taken here by the Minister that were not taken before.  The Minister's amendment deals with the question of rearrangement. There might be a good case to be made for a chief inspector of the Land Commission to approve of a rearrangement scheme.  There are many other powers being given and the Minister may delegate anybody to exercise them.</P>
      <P>This section, without these words, was taken from a previous Act, but these words were not in any of the previous Land Acts and all Deputy Moylan is attempting to do is to adopt the practice of the House and specify certain officers not below a certain rank to exercise certain functions.  It would meet the wishes of Deputies if the Minister agrees to accept the amendment or to submit a similar one.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be something objectionable in this sub-section.  If an officer authorised by the Minister carries out any particular duty, I think it is only reasonable to expect that it should be done in the name of the Minister and not in the name of the Land Commission.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>This particular sub-section is necessary.  It may seem strange that, when an officer of the Department of Lands does something, say, in the case of sanctioning a rearrangement scheme, he is dealing with property that is not the Minister's. It is the Land Commissioners' property. That is what I was about to explain when the Deputy took me short.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister tell us if that is the sole idea behind this sub-section?  It says that where the Minister or an officer exercises or performs any power or duty he may do so &ldquo;(a) in his own name or, (b) in the name of the Land Commission or the lay commissioners.&rdquo;  What material difference would it make if paragraph (a) were left out?  Would its omission create any difficulties?  Is there any other purpose behind the sub-section than that given by the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that I do not quite understand why this sub-section is in this particular form if that <Col N="112" /> is the only purpose behind it.  What would be wrong with it if paragraph (a) were omitted?  Why is it necessary to include the Minister and also to bring in &ldquo;the name of the Land Commission or the lay commissioners&rdquo;? Even though the Land Commissioners are in many cases dealing with land which they have acquired and paid for, I still do not see why it should be necessary to have this sub-section in this particular way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary to have it in that particular way because otherwise many legal difficulties would arise. In other words, many things which the senior inspector would do could be challenged as being of doubtful legality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister should agree to this amendment.  If the Minister thinks it right to take powers over land which he says belongs to the Land Commissioners and to decide directly himself, or through his officer, as to the allocation of that land or the price to be paid for it, then he should take public responsibility for it. It is bad enough to decide, as the Dáil has decided, to give the Minister these powers to deal with land which he says belongs to the Land Commission, but it is worse that he should be given power to deal with them and to disguise the fact that it is he who is dealing with them, to pretend that it is the lay commissioners or the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>How can it be disguised when it is stated here definitely, or will be in the Statute which I hope will pass, that, let us say, a senior inspector will sanction a rearrangement scheme?  That, I hope, will be established by this Bill and the official seal of the Land Commission goes on that. What is concealed there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We know where we are with regard to the rearrangement of holdings, that it is the Minister's responsibility. That is quite definite. With regard to sub-division, we will not know whether the Minister, in fact, was exercising the powers which he has to allocate some smaller or larger amounts for improvements or whether <Col N="113" /> he himself, through his officer, has decided to allow a sub-division.  It has been said that power without responsibility is tyrannical.  This particular Bill, so far as we have gone, is giving the Minister certain powers and this section proposes to give him powers without imposing upon him the onus of taking responsibility for the exercise of those powers.  People affected by the operations of the Land Commission should know whether it is the Minister or whether it is the lay commissioners.</P>

The whole object of Fianna Fáil Deputies is to try to preserve the confidence of the people in the judicial authority.

When a decision cannot be given for two or three years, is it not time that somebody else should be given an opportunity of going ahead?  As Deputy McQuillan says, there is a lot of talk about politics but no talk about the relief of congestion, and that is what the Bill sets out to do.  We should agree to let the Bill go through and give the Minister a chance to do something. I do not believe we will work miracles, but it is worth a trial to see what can be done.  It cannot be any worse than what was there before.</P>

      <P>The danger in this section is that it will not meet the wishes expressed by Deputy Commons or Deputy McQuillan.  Some of these sections, in our view, simply tend to make confusion worse confounded and it is with the idea of trying to clarify the position that these amendments have been put down.  What I should like to know from the Minister is what particular functions the lay commissioners are intended to carry out under sub-section (2) because this refers back to sub-section (2) which is the delegating section.  In that sub-section, the Minister takes power to delegate certain powers.  Presumably, the intention is, from reading sub-section (5), <Col N="116" /> that he may delegate some of these powers to the lay commissioners.  What are the particular functions he has in mind which will be performed in the names of the lay commissioners which were not formerly performed in their names and what will be done in the name of the Land Commission which was not formerly done in the name of the Land Commission?  What Deputy Moylan is endeavouring to do is to put the particular duties of the Land Commission under their proper label. If the Minister is taking power, well and good, but in sub-section (2) to which this relates back he takes power to delegate functions to different officers of the Land Commission.  What is going to be delegated to the lay commissioners?  I cannot see why the lay commissioners should be brought in under this sub-section at all.</P>

The Dáil has given him the right to stamp the name of the Land Commissioners on it and say that it was they did the work, but it is not right that the matter should be left there.

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  If the Deputy brings in an amendment on the Report Stage, turning over all the land that will be dealt with in a particular rearrangement scheme to the Minister, then there will be no need for this; but, outside of that, I do not see what is wrong in safeguarding ourselves, as the commissioners are safeguarded in a similar way word for word.  Where a senior inspector sanctions or improves a rearrangement scheme, he is sanctioning the disposal or the dispersal of land that does not belong to him or to the Minister but belongs to the Land Commissioners. Every unvested holding in the country legally belongs to the commissioners. It is absolutely necessary to make that legally watertight and for that reason we are proposing this particular safeguard in sub-section (5).  If it is a crime to safeguard ourselves and make it legally watertight for the security of the tenants, it is the tenants who would really be the sufferers and not the Minister if anything went wrong.  I do not think that is a great crime.</P>

      <P>The wording is very <Col N="122" /> plain and clear.  The purport is to make legal any of the things that are done or accomplished by the Minister or the commissioners.  The commissioners themselves are safeguarded in a similar way.  Why should not the Minister be safeguarded?</P>

      <P>This is a section that safeguards everybody, holus-bolus, referring back to sub-section (2).  If I understand the section correctly, a power or duty exercised or performed by virtue of Section 2 is any power or duty for the time being vested by law (including this Act) in the Land Commission or the lay commissioners.  This means, in effect, that in respect of anything at all the Land Commission may do, or the Minister in the Land Commission's name, or the lay commissioners in the name of the Minister, whether it be in accordance with procedure, legal or otherwise, they are safeguarded under this particular section. Does the Minister not see the implications of this sub-section?</P>

      <P>I will give the Minister an example.  Take, for instance, that certain lands have to be acquired in a certain way and that they are being acquired under some of these powers already vested in the Land Commission or that certain acts of the Land Commission are to be done in a certain judicial way that is already laid down. No matter how the Land Commission do it or no matter how they purport to do it under this particular section, whoever is the victim would have no redress whatever.  This is the effect of sub-section (6) of this section.  Surely the Minister does not ask the House to swallow this section hook, line and sinker, to protect completely every single minion of the Land Commission from top to bottom irrespective of whether they act illegally or otherwise. This section, if it goes through in its present form, is, in my view at all events, unconstitutional.  I would ask the Minister to re-examine the position from that point of view.</P>

The Minister would not tell the House.  He told us there was some particular reason behind that sub-section, dealing with certain lands that may be in the hands of the Land Commission.  I want to point out that sub-section (2) deals with many other matters outside the simple question of rearrangement schemes.  It deals with various powers of the Land Commission and this sub-section, if we let it through, gives complete protection to the Land Commission in connection with every matter that could arise under sub-section (2), whether it was something that was done by the lay commissioners, by the Minister or by the Land Commission.  It rides roughshod over all the laws already passed in connection with the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>If we were to agree with Deputy Hickey, I think the wise thing would be to abolish the Land Commission and make it an ordinary Department of State.  That is the logical conclusion from Deputy Hickey's words.  I think that would be fatal.  What is contained in this section, in so far as it relates to the judicial authority of the commissioners, is perfectly right.  People acting in a judicial capacity need the widest type of protection but, in this case, the Minister is taking authority unto himself to do certain things personally or by his agent.  The Minister said this was <Col N="125" /> a very simple sub-section.  I have ordinary intelligence and it is not by any means so simple to me.  It is rather an involved section but what makes it appear sinister to me is the care that is taken to protect the Minister or his agent:&mdash;</P>

      <P>(8)  The Minister shall not authorise pursuant to this section an officer to approve any scheme for the rearrangement of lands held in rundale or intermixed plots whether with or without the distribution of other lands to facilitate the said rearrangement unless such officer is an officer of the Land Commission and not below the rank of senior inspector.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that no official below the rank of senior or divisional inspector shall approve of a rearrangement scheme.  I am sure that this amendment will meet with the approval of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">

      <P>A qualified approval. The fact that the Minister has decided that he shall have an officer of the rank of senior or divisional inspector to deal with this matter is certainly an improvement on his original proposal that any officer of the Land Commission would be authorised to do certain things with the Minister's consent and authority.  Any officer could apply equally well to a typist, or any rank below that.  Again, I wish to register objection, not for the purpose of obstructing but because I feel so strongly on the matter that at every opportunity I feel it incumbent on me to register my protest against the unsurping by the personal authority of the Minister and his agent of the judicial authority of the Land Commission.</P>

In the case of allotting new holdings on a particular farm, on which holdings new houses and out-offices have been built, it would be most undesirable to have the allotting of these holdings in the hands of the Minister or the officials.  In order to clear up any doubt in paragraph (f) of sub-section (1) I propose to make it quite watertight now.  It was suggested that the Minister could allot holdings in the eastern counties to migrants from the north or south or west for the purpose of rearrangement.  It was possible to read that meaning into the sub-section as it stood.  In case an attempt might ever be made to do that, I introduce an amendment now to make it as watertight as possible.  I do not know exactly where the amendment will fit in.  That is a matter for the draftsman.  I hope that it is now clear to the House what the intention is.</P>

      <P>Before sub-section (9) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(9)  Where the Minister approves any scheme for the rearrangement of lands held in rundale or intermixed plots he shall publish notice of his approval of such scheme in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> within a month after approval is given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister referred to the method by which it would be brought under notice that these rearrangements had in fact been approved and I put down this amendment to give the Minister an opportunity of stating how, in fact, the approval will be made known.  I take <Col N="131" /> it that he appreciates that, in the new arrangements that he has made under Section 10, it would be advisable that all rearrangement schemes should be officially published.  I think that is a very modest request and that they should be so announced in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> within a month after approval is given.  That refers to amendment No. 32.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 34 reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Before sub-section (10) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(10)  Where under sub-section (9) of this section a document is sealed by the Minister or his officer and such document has reference to the framing or approval by the Minister or his officer of any scheme for the rearrangement of lands held in rundale or intermixed plots, a notice that such document has been so sealed (and giving the name and description of the scheme) shall be published by the Minister in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> within one month.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure the Deputy that no useful purpose would be served by these two amendments. Take, say, the case of any particular rearrangement scheme in any county of the Twenty-Six Counties.  I do not see what useful purpose can be served. As a matter of fact, <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> is practically given over completely and entirely to the Land Commission in vesting notices, notices of resumption, acquisition, certificates and so forth. The Deputy has not pointed out in any clear fashion what useful purpose it would serve.  I have no objection to it but it will make no difference.  The Minister will always be answerable to this House for anything that takes place.  In connection with a rearrangement scheme on the one hand, and under amendment No. 34 which refers to any document, I want to assure the <Col N="132" /> Deputy that I cannot see any useful purpose served by them.  I am afraid it would be merely so much work or so much of a formula that would have to be gone through in each case that it would only mean cluttering up <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> with a flood of rearrangement schemes in the springtime and then with smaller ones in the summertime when the crops would be on the land and no schemes would be going through.  I ask the Deputy to withdraw both amendments.  I take it that the House will be sitting all the year round and, as I have said, the Minister is answerable to the House. Any information of that kind can always be elicited by way of parliamentary question.</P>

      <P>I do not know how the information can be elicited by a parliamentary question.  If Ministers get special powers, as the Minister is getting in this case, to deal with rearrangement, there ought to be, surely, some other way of dealing with the matter.  If my proposal is not feasible or, perhaps, not sufficiently practical, more space ought to be given to the matter in the annual report of the Land Commission.  If the only way in which what the Minister does in connection with these schemes is brought under official notice is by putting down questions, I should think that that is one of the most troublesome and expensive ways of dealing with the matter.  I do not mind, but I thought the Minister had rather an objection to so much time being taken up by parliamentary questions dealing with the Land Commission.  Those of us who do not represent congested areas may not have the information readily at our disposal.  I think that, on general grounds, we would be entitled to know how this matter is proceeding. However, I dare say that we can rely on those of our colleagues who represent the congested areas to have the matter elicited so I do not wish to proceed further with the amendment.</P>

      <P>It is quite obvious what these two amendments mean.  They are inter-related, that is, a formal type of safeguard of whatever particular Minister may be exercising these powers which the Minister is taking in connection with rearrangement schemes.  Take, for instance, a particular rearrangement scheme carried out in a particular area.  If rearrangement has been carried out and land allotted to the allottees under that rearrangement, there may be very definite objections to it.  The only method that would be left to Deputies would be to try and put down a series of questions.  For instance, if you were dealing with an estate where 25 or 30 people would be included in a rearrangement scheme, the position would be impossible.  That is the reason why I think the most sensible part of this amendment is from the point of view of a check.  Under the first amendment, where a rearrangement scheme has been completed, notice of the scheme would be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and, for instance, a copy of the completed scheme at a prescribed fee would be available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Otherwise there is no way.  The Minister and the House must realise that under this Bill the Minister, under sub-section (2) to which we are referring, is taking certain powers and will, presumably, exercise certain powers particularly in relation to rearrangement matters. The House will not be in a position to know what type of rearrangement is gone through in any particular area and will have no way of finding out&mdash; that I know of&mdash;except to ask in this House.  I would point out that in connection with one scheme alone, it would be necessary to ask about each allottee, how much he got, how he got it, how much land was rearranged and <Col N="134" /> what portion of the Land Commission land was given to him in order to get him into the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that no Land Commission inspector in charge in an area will deny any Deputy or any interested person full details of a rearrangement scheme.  If the tenants themselves are satisfied there is generally nobody else to be taken into account.  All the whole area, before the rearrangement can go through, becomes the property of the commissioners. The tenants are on it.  The rearrangement takes place with their consent.  Actually, in 99 cases out of 100, until they are all agreed, the scheme cannot go through.  I could not imagine any reason why in Galway, Castlerea, Castlebar, Ballina, Letterkenny, Sligo, Manorhamilton or any place where there is a Land Commission office, the whole public should not see a rearrangement map.  I intend to hang one, with which the Deputy is familiar, in the hall of Leinster House to show what can be done and the crying need there is for rearrangement. No information will be denied.  We will be only too proud of every rearrangement scheme that goes through. We will give it to the whole wide world.</P>

      <P>Might I interrupt the Deputy to say that the commissioners are not obliged to give reasons for what they do?  However, in the case of a rearrangement scheme, the Minister is responsible to this House for his actions.  The commissioners, if they wish to be rude enough, could tell the Minister, when he is seeking information for a parliamentary reply, that it is none of the Minister's business or of anybody else's business, because of the peculiar way they are set up.</P>

      <P>That is why I suggest that it is doubly necessary to have some check.  It is all right for the Minister to say that on a rearrangement scheme everybody must agree. He knows, as well as I do, that in many cases a rearrangement scheme can be forced by the gentleman dealing with it.  It has often been done.  In some cases, people have been left out altogether. They have been told: &ldquo;If you do not want to accept what you are getting, you will never get anything again from the Land Commission.  We will go ahead with the rest of the scheme and refuse to do anything for you.&rdquo;  I am sure that the Minister has had as much experience of that as I have had.  What I am suggesting to the Minister, as a safeguard in this matter, is that we should accept the first amendment.  If, on the other hand, the Minister is prepared to say that immediately a scheme is executed or signed, Deputies will be entitled to get a copy of it, I am prepared to accept that.</P>

      <P>I would be inclined to agree with the amendment, because naturally every Deputy would like to find out what the final solution of any scheme would be.  I think, however, it would be pretty difficult to have the detailed explanation of the actual layout.</P>

      <P>It would be practically impossible.  We know that if a question is put down asking about a certain rearrangement scheme, the Minister must have at his disposal a certain amount of supplementary information which, if he is pressed, he would have to give to the House.  He will have to give at least enough to satisfy the Deputy concerned, otherwise the matter can be thrashed out in the adjournment and in that way a <Col N="136" /> great waste of time would be caused. I think if there was some arrangement by which the details could be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, it would be a way out. On the other hand, this method has its draw-backs.  As the Minister has now said that he is assuming for himself and his officials a certain amount of responsibility in regard to rearrangement schemes, if he could devise some scheme whereby the information would be made available to the Deputies concerned on visiting the offices of the Land Commission where they could have a look at a map or find out the details of the scheme, I think that would satisfy them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 35:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(12)  The Land Commission shall not be required to inform the Minister in relation to matters excepted under this section.</P>
      <P>The point I am seeking to achieve by this amendment is somewhat similar to that mentioned by other Deputies here to-night.  We all know that the unfortunate Minister has been inundated with questions in regard to such matters as land acquisition and distribution. I do not think that is desirable for a variety of reasons.  In the first place, in this particular section we have excepted a certain number of matters from the Minister's control. Notwithstanding whatever whittling down there may have been in this section so far, there will still remain quite a number of very important functions reserved to the Land Commission. Those functions are reserved to the Land Commission for very definite reasons, namely, that if there was power to vest in the Minister, all security of ownership of land would in a short time disappear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having put those matters outside the Minister's control, the question arises <Col N="139" /> as to why the Minister should be questioned in regard to the operations of the Land Commission.  I do not see why the Minister should be questioned in regard to decisions of the Land Commission any more than the Minister for Justice should be questioned about decisions of the Supreme Court. I am asking, therefore, that this inquisition into the actions of the Land Commission, which is a daily feature of this House, should be discontinued. I cannot see any useful purpose being served.  If the Land Commission is to be an independent body, immune from ministerial pressure, there is no reason why the Land Commission and its officials should, day after day, be called upon to dig up information in regard to their activities.  I think the problem of supervision of the Land Commission, in so far as it is required, could be carried out by other means.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, there is another principle involved, and that is that whenever a question is asked with regard to the acquisition of a particular holding, particularly in a case where the owner of the holding is an ordinary farmer&mdash;perhaps a small farmer, not a very large farmer, anyhow&mdash;there is a certain slur cast on that man by reason of the publicity given to that matter in the Dáil.  It is not just or right that a slur should be cast upon a particular citizen who has done no wrong.  If a Deputy bears ill-will towards a certain farmer who, possibly, has canvassed or worked or voted against him, he can put down a question asking if it is the intention of the Land Commission to acquire that farmer's holding.  The Minister may reply that the Land Commission have no proceedings for its acquisition but, nevertheless, that man's neighbours will begin to talk. They will say that they have read in the papers where so-and-so's farm has been discussed in the Dáil and the Land Commission were thinking of acquiring it.  If there could be some means found to protect citizens from that type of injustice it would be very well worth while.  I am not sure whether my amendment covers the point, but I trust the Minister will give it consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>If these two amendments were passed into law it would mean placing the Land Commission in a position superior to this House, and I am sure no Deputy would stand for that.  The commissioners are there to implement legislation in their particular department&mdash;that is, in relation to the whole land resettlement question. I think I know what the Deputy has in mind.  He takes exception to a particular type of question here.  What I have gathered from his statement is that he does not want a question put down about a particular farmer who is living in peace and amity with his neighbours.  He says that when publication is given to that question it creates a chilly atmosphere between that farmer and his neighbours, people who were formerly good friends, and the next thing is a movement to acquire his land.  That is not a desirable thing to happen, but, if the Deputy wants to achieve what he has in view, I think the Committee on Procedure and Privileges would be the proper place to take that up.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will not press the amendment.  If it were passed it would be a very dangerous precedent to establish&mdash;where the Minister in charge of a Department could not question his commissioners to see what is going on.  The Deputy has drawn a parallel between this Department and the Department of the Minister for Justice.  The Minister for Justice is quite well aware of how the judges, even the Supreme Court judges, administer the laws, and he would not be worthy of the post of Minister for Justice if he did not take an active and a keen interest in it.  There is a provision so that the Minister for Justice is informed constantly&mdash;and they keep his information up to date&mdash;as regards this question; otherwise justice would go to pieces, or there is a possibility that it would in a short space of time.  I assure the Deputy that the way the amendments are worded would not achieve the object he has in mind and would be nothing short of disastrous from the point of view of administration if they were passed into law.</P>

      <P>I do not know what <Col N="141" /> type of farmer Deputy Cogan is interested in, but I think I have put down more questions about the acquisition and resumption of land than any other Deputy in the House and I can assure Deputy Cogan that no question ever went down about acquiring or resuming land from an individual who was residing on his holding and working it.  I have no intention of stopping, and will not be stopped by anybody, when it comes to the question of acquiring land from some man who is not living on it, who is letting it go to waste while there is land hunger and poverty all around it.  On the other hand, I would be glad not to have to put down these questions, because they usually cause a hubbub in the locality.  Everyone there sets out to read his own meaning into what the question is about and there is a buzz of excitement in that locality. All the people who imagine they would benefit by this land are up on their heels, tearing and chasing here and there, annoying somebody in order to see what they are going to get.</P>
      <P>It should not be the duty of a Deputy to raise land questions here at all. If the Land Commission was doing its duty it should put its officials working so as to put themselves in the possession of knowledge immediately after a farm would become available for acquisition.  The Land Commission inspector should be in a position to inform his chief inspector about such and such a piece of land where it was available and could be taken over for the relief of congestion.  We should not be errand boys for the officials of the Land Commission&mdash;and that is what we are.  Deputies are raising questions to bring to the Minister's notice certain lands which should be taken over. That is not our duty, but the officials of the Land Commission are not doing it, or will not do it; they are sitting down on their job so far as that is concerned.</P>
      <P>What should be done annually is there should be a survey of all the land in a county suitable for the relief of congestion.</P>

      <P>I will say this much with regard to the amendments.  I will oppose them because they are absolutely unnecessary.  There is no use in putting a Government Department, whether it has judicial power or not, into the position that what it has done or has not done cannot be questioned here.  Our first responsibility is to the people who sent us here, and if some things are not done which the people are anxious to see done, surely it is our duty to make inquiries about them.  I do not see how we can support these amendments.  I am in agreement with Deputy Cogan to the extent that many of the questions that have to be raised here could be got over if there was an alternative system in the working of the Land Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to press the amendment if it would seriously hamper the work of the Land Commission or of the Minister.  I do think, however, that there is a problem here which the Minister might give his attention to between this and the Report Stage.  He made a comparison between the Land Commission and the judiciary, and said that the Minister for Justice is kept informed of the actions of the courts.  Well, I have never known a Deputy to put down a question asking why a judge had convicted a certain person of a certain offence, or why judges had given any particular decisions in the courts; but we have questions raised here from day to day as to why the Land Commission gives certain decisions or asking what <Col N="143" /> decisions it is likely to give.  That seems to me to be an anomaly which ought to be removed.  If the Land Commission is to be regarded as having judicial powers, then it ought not to be interfered with in the exercise of them.  If we find that the Land Commission is not capable of doing the work it is supposed to do under the law, then I suppose it would be better to dissolve it; but as long as it is there and has certain matters reserved to it which have been taken out of the hands of the Minister, it ought not, I think, to be questioned in the way that it is questioned in this House.</P>
      <P>The Minister did suggest that this matter could be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. As a matter of fact, I think it was, but as well as I recollect the committe did not take any action in the matter.  I was anxious to see if it could be adjusted some way by legislation. Perhaps, before the Report Stage of the Bill is taken, the Minister might avail of the opportunity of trying to find some means of protecting people who, as he has rightly stated, do suffer from an injustice by reason of the publicity that is given in connection with the acquisition of their holdings, particularly in cases where there is no intention on the part of the Land Commission to acquire the holdings.  As Deputy Commons has pointed out, most holdings are acquired because of some default on the part of the owner, either because he is not residing on it or is not working it.  Therefore, when a question is asked in regard to a holding there is the inference that the owner is not working the land or has defaulted in some way in his duty as a citizen.  In view of that, I suggest to the Minister that he should be able to find some words which would protect citizens from this form of injustice.</P>

      <P>I do not see that there is any necessity for these amendments now any more than there was at any other time.  Over a considerable time it has been the practice to put down questions.  I do not see why the Minister for Lands, any more than any other Minister, should be rendered immune from answering questions regarding <Col N="144" /> the activities of the Land Commission. Deputy Cogan has said that the fact that publicity is given here in connection with a person's land by way of question, even though it is not the intention of the Land Commission immediately to acquire it, immediately directs the attention of the Land Commission to it.  He has also stated that the Land Commission is an independent body.  If it is, and if it acts independently, it does not matter what questions are put down here.  A question is not going to alter its views on any particular matter.  It very often happens, too, that a question may be put down&mdash;Deputy Cogan himself may do it&mdash;in the interests of the owner concerned.  The Land Commission starts off by publishing what is known as a provisional list.  A couple of other lists are published subsequently, and a long period may elapse before the final list is published.  Even when the final list is published, and when the price is stated, in default of agreement, a considerable time may elapse before steps are taken by the Land Commission for acquisition.  I think that, when the Land Commission publishes the provisional list, the owner of land is in a greater state of suspense even than the people who require the land.  It is only fair, I think&mdash;it is as much in the interests of the individual owner as of the local congests, especially where a lengthy period elapses before the land is acquired&mdash;that a question should be put down for answer about it.</P>
      <P>We have heard a good deal about the undue delay of the Land Commission in coming to decisions.  Well, if there is undue delay after the provisional list is published and if, as sometimes happens, an owner is finally left with the land by the Land Commission, he might get pretty careless in the working of it.  Deputy Cogan has stated that the Land Commission is an independent body.  I do not believe it will be so independent now in view of certain things which are in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see that there is any greater injustice in putting down a question to the Land Commission than there is in putting down a question about an old age pension or a national health insurance benefit, not to speak at all <Col N="145" /> of questions concerning the courts which deal with criminal and civil actions.  If questions are put down about land, it is true to say that in almost every case the question relates to some individual who holds a considerable amount of land.  We should all like to see this land question settled as speedily as possible.  It is a national question.  I would not agree at all that Deputies should have their rights and privileges curtailed in regard to putting down questions about the acquisition of land.</P>

      <P>This is a rather peculiar sub-section. It provides that:&mdash;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="146" />&ldquo;where a decision is made or given by a majority of the lay commissioners concerned therein, the dissenting minority of such lay commissioners shall be deemed, for the purposes of the foregoing sub-sections of this section to concur in such decision, and the words &lsquo;concur&rsquo; and &lsquo;concurrence&rsquo; shall in those sub-sections of this section be construed accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course, there may be a precedent for this power, but it seems to me that it is imposing very much upon the lay commissioners.  The position would appear to be that the minority having failed and resigned themselves to that fact, it is the majority decision that will hold.  I move to report progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state the present average cost of building a 50-foot fishing vessel adequately diesel-engined and also the additional cost of equipping such a vessel for (1) herring fishing; (2) mackerel fishing; (3) seining or ring nets; (4) long lining, and (5) trawling, and, further, if he will state the cost pre-war and to-day of herring nets, mackerel nets, coils of 120-fathom rope and the various types of ring nets and trawls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The price of a 50-foot fishing vessel depends, in present-day circumstances, not only on the materials and the equipment of a particular boat but also on the location of the yard in which it is built, conditions of wages, availability of materials, etc.  Consequently, it is not feasible to quote a figure of cost which can be regarded as average, but so far as the experience to date of the Sea Fisheries Association is concerned, prices of 50-foot boats adequately powered range between £4,300 and £4,800.</P>
      <P>The complement of gear and the type of nets used by a 50-foot vessel depend upon local conditions and the cost of equipping it for the various kinds of fishing is not, accordingly, uniform. The cost can, however, be ascertained from the particulars given below of the present-day prices of the various types of nets and fishing gear when the equipment required in a particular case is known.</P>
      <P>The prices charged by the manufacturers before the outbreak of war in 1939 and at present for the types of fishing gear mentioned by the Deputy are as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will state (1) the number of houses built for letting by public utility societies and private persons, which were commenced after 1st March, 1948, and finished by 1st March, 1950, and which were eligible for grants from the State, and (2) the highest weekly rent, inclusive of rates, which he has sanctioned in respect of these houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>During the period from 1st March, 1948, to March, 1950, grants were approved under Section 19 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948, in respect of 226 houses erected for letting by private persons.  The rent of such houses is not subject to my sanction. In the same period grants were approved under Section 20 of the Act of 1948 in respect of 44 houses erected for letting by one public utility society. The maximum weekly rent approved in the latter case was 28/- together with rates.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will state (1) the number of houses built with State assistance by private persons and by public utility societies for their members which were commenced after March 1st, 1948, and completed by March 1st, 1950, and (2) the total <Col N="25" /> amount in grants paid, or to be paid, by the State in respect of such houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of houses in respect of which grants were fully paid during the period was 2,577, involving a total payment of £633,210.</P>
      <P>It may be taken, therefore, that at least 2,577 houses were completed by private persons and public utility societies within the period in question, but the Deputy will appreciate that this figure does not necessarily coincide with the total number of completions during the period.  For the purposes of departmental records, houses qualifying for State grants are recorded as completed only when final payments of the grants have been made.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question, the total amount of the grants for these houses may be taken to be approximately the sum of £633,210 paid.  While there are a number of houses on which the grants have not yet been fully paid and which have not been included, the figures I have given include some houses completed before March, 1948.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will state, in respect of local authority houses (1) the number which were commenced after 1st March, 1948, and which were completed and ready for occupation by 1st March, 1950; (2) the aggregate contribution by the State to the cost of those houses and the approximate percentage of the total cost which this sum represents; (3) an approximate percentage of the total cost falling on the rates, and (4) an approximate percentage of the total cost estimated to be recouped from the rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of houses commenced by local authorities after 1st March, 1948, and completed during the two-year period up to 1st March, 1950, was approximately 5,200, namely, 2,800 in rural areas and 2,400 in urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ratio of State aid to the total cost is not fixed but depends on a number of factors such as area, the services provided, the type of persons <Col N="26" /> for whom the houses are provided and the cost of the house.  Furthermore, the amount of the claims for annual subsidy is generally not known until after the end of each financial year.  It is not, therefore, yet possible to give the figures required in the remaining portions of the Deputy's question.  A general statistical investigation of all aspects of housing charges is at present being made.</P>
