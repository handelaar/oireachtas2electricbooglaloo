    <Speaker pid="JohnTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he will give sympathetic consideration to the proposal that third-class fares of applicants for posts filled by the Local Appointments Commission should be paid to the centre at which the interviews are being held, a practice which has been adopted in many other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The practice of requiring candidates for public appointments to pay out of their own pockets any travelling or other expenses they may incur applies to competitions conducted by both the Civil Service and the Local Appointments Commissioners. It would not be defensible to make the concession suggested by the Deputy in the case of competitions for local appointments without extending it also to competitions for Civil Service appointments, in which large numbers of candidates are young persons entirely dependent on parents who are often of very limited means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of local appointments, the expense of giving effect to the Deputy's suggestion would have to be met by the several county and county borough councils, which are required to refund to the Exchequer the net expenditure of the Local Appointments Commission in excess of any receipts such as fees.  In the case of Civil Service appointments, the expenses would have to be met out of State funds.  It would, in my opinion, be unreasonable to impose on the general body of ratepayers or taxpayers the <Col N="2060" /> burden of expenses which are incurred by the candidates in their own personal interests.</P>
    <P>A further consideration is that the payment of candidates' expenses, wholly or partly, out of public moneys would tend to encourage frivolous candidature by persons who did not themselves feel that they had any real prospect of success.  Besides adding considerably to the expense of conducting competitions, this would throw a burden of fruitless work on the staffs of the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissions and would lead to further delay in the making of public appointments.</P>
    <P>I should like to say, however, that the Local Appointments Commissioners do everything in their power to ensure that the expenses of candidates are kept to a minimum.  For example, arrangements are made for one board to interview candidates for a number of appointments of the same type whenever this is feasible, and, in this way, candidates are relieved, so far as practicable, of the need to make frequent journeys for the purpose of attendance for interview.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he is prepared to recommend to the Local Appointments Commission that a system of short-listing should be established in order to obviate the necessity for professional men of making unnecessarily long journeys for interview.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Local Appointments Commissioners that they have at various times considered the possibility of adopting a system of &ldquo;short-listing&rdquo; but that, after careful consideration, they have come to the conclusion that such a system would not be practicable or desirable.  Apart from serious administrative difficulties which would be involved, it would seem invidious to deny to any candidate claiming to possess the required qualifications the opportunity of proving before an interview board the value of his qualifications and experience having regard to those of other candidates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady" hpid="Mr. S. Brady Mr. S. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state in reference to (1) County Dublin, and (2) the whole country (a) the total number of stone masons, and (b) the number at present employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The exact information required by the Deputy is not available but as bearing generally on the subject of his inquiry the following information is supplied.  The number of masons, stone-cutters and stone-layers insured on 2nd October, 1949, under the Insurance (Intermittent Unemployment) Act, 1942 (i.e., manual <Col N="2062" /> workers in the building trade) was 1,347 of whom 103 were recorded at local offices of the Department of Social Welfare situated in County Dublin.  On the 10th June, 1950, the number of persons in these occupations registered as unemployed was 45 of whom eight were registered at local offices situated in County Dublin.  These statistics do not include (i) monumental masons who are not insured under the Wet Time Act, or (ii) masons working on own account, employers or assisting relatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he has considered the desirability of establishing an educational film unit for the making of educational films suitable for exhibition in our schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="Minister for Education (General Mulcahy) Richard (General) Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Industry and Commerce and my Department had under consideration a scheme submitted in August, 1948, for the establishment of a full-time educational film unit in this country.</P>
      <P>Both Departments were satisfied that the advantages which would flow from the establishment of the unit, as proposed, would not be commensurate with the capital and annual recurring expenditure which would fall on the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that there are facilities now available within close proximity to the city for the production of short films, and does he not think, where there is a private enterprise of that nature, that arrangements might be <Col N="2064" /> made to produce such short films as might be educationally or otherwise found necessary by Government Departments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>At the present moment a grant of £1,000 a year is made to the National Film Institute, which is developing an interest in that particular class of work.  They have a fairly substantial library of about 800 films and they are doing a considerable amount of renting.  Very few schools are equipped with projection apparatus and no State grant is made to any schools to enable them to provide themselves with such.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the necessary technical equipment is available within a short distance from the city and with that equipment a short film has been made with the sub-titles dubbed in Irish?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be glad to get in touch with any developments of that kind.  I do not know whether the National Film Institute is connected with it, or is observing what is going on.  So far as it is possible to meet a developing demand in the schools for a service of this kind, I will undertake to keep the situation closely under review and help in any way I can.  On the question of dubbing in Irish, that is a matter that is being considered. The use of Irish in films generally is a matter that is engaging our attention at the present time, but I do not see any immediate solution of some of the difficulties there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister get a report from the institute as to their position and what attitude they are adopting towards the development of the industry?  Is the Minister aware that cinemas in the city have refused to show news-reels dubbed in the Irish language, and what action does he propose to take in this connection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>It was stated here in the course of a recent debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Department of Education was engaged in making a start with the dubbing of short films in Irish, and that half a dozen had been completed before he entered into office?  In view of the fact that the Government's attitude towards the spending of money has changed, surely he might review the matter and see whether the Government could not afford a few thousand pounds for the dubbing of films in Irish now that they can give over £80,000,000 for general expenditure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind Deputies that we are now getting into general matters.  In reply to the definite <Col N="2066" /> question that was asked, I have indicated that the matter was examined in August, 1948.  It was then found that the expenditure that would have to be incurred to establish it straight away would be £27,000.  That would be for the setting up of the equipment alone, apart altogether from the building in which it would be set up.  It would also involve an expenditure of something like £15,000 a year.  This would be a recurring expenditure.  These were the circumstances in which both the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Education were satisfied that what would result therefrom would not be worth the sum of money involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the position is changed and that the building and processing plant is here, which means that the expenses would be a lot less than the Minister has indicated, is he prepared to give a guarantee that he will have the matter reconsidered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The question before me is whether I would consider the desirability of establishing an educational film unit here.  If it has been established here, I suppose that represents a certain amount of progress along the road, and creates a different situation from the situation envisaged in the question.  I can assure the Deputy that the matter will be kept fully under review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether the Land Commission are aware that tenants on the Churcher estate at Currabaun, Cloonabricka and Cornanantymore, County Galway, have now cut away their bog, and since they have no turbary convenient, whether he will ask the Land Commission to acquire portion of the adjoining bog on the Mahon, Cloonbrock estate for division amongst these tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick) Joseph Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no proceedings in respect of the bog mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware, as I have stated in the question, of the fact that a number of tenants in this <Col N="2067" /> locality have cut away all the turbary that they have?  The result is that they are now forced to go a distance of four miles to get turbary while this huge area of bog&mdash;hundreds of acres of it&mdash; is within less than half a mile of them. In view of that, will the Minister not take steps to acquire and purchase it and so help those people who, at the moment, are compelled to go long distances for their turbary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission are always anxious to acquire bogs where the existing plots for local farmers and householders are running out.  Our information is that there is no serious hardship yet.  As soon as there is I have no doubt that the Land Commission will acquire a portion or all of the bog to which the Deputy has referred to meet the situation.  The information to hand so far is that all the households are fairly well supplied, though it may be true that in the case of a few their plots are running out.  The situation is not such as to demand that the Land Commission should acquire a bog for that particular purpose yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that a number of applications are in his Department for pieces of turbary on this particular bog?  Is he also not aware of this huge area of bog and that the people there have to travel miles to get their supplies?  It is most inconvenient for them to have to travel these long distances for turbary.  There are at least seven or eight people cut out at the moment and others are being cut out week after week.  The turbary that is there is completely finished.  There are just little bits here and there.  I suggest to the Minister that steps should be taken at once by the Land Commission with a view to meeting the present position and seeing that provision is made to meet the requirements of those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there are applications in, but we are not satisfied that the household plots of all the applicants are cut away.  I can assure the Deputy that the situation is not such as to require the Land Commission <Col N="2068" /> to acquire the bog yet for that particular area.  If a situation should arise in which there is a scarcity, then the Land Commission will acquire the bog to meet it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>

      <P>As I indicated in a reply given by me to a question on the 15th March last, the work involved in the countrywide reorganisation of rural postal services is a very big task and I am, therefore, unable to state at <Col N="2070" /> present when the postal facilities at Freemount village are likely to be reviewed. The existing services there are, however, reasonably satisfactory.</P>

      <P>I made it clear in 1948 that, rather than have to reimpose the excess corporation profits tax retrospectively, I would prefer to see a movement towards breaking prices. In reply to a question on the 23rd March last the Taoiseach mentioned a number of commodities the prices of which had been reduced as a result of the Government's activities.  Neither the extent nor the range of the reductions made is regarded as satisfactory and the position is kept constantly under review.  If the Deputy has any particular instances in mind in which excessive profits are being taken I shall be glad if he will bring them under notice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">

      <P>I am aware that certain Army personnel occupying married quarters at Fort Camden, Crosshaven, County Cork, and attached to units stationed at Collins Barracks, Cork, must travel at their own expense to and from their duty at the barracks mentioned.  It is not the practice to provide transport for, or to grant an allowance towards travelling expenses to, soldiers living outside barracks to facilitate them in travelling to or from their duty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>These 20 men have to travel a distance of roughly 32 miles per day.  Would it not be possible to provide transport by lorry, or some other means, since there is no possibility of their obtaining housing accommodation in Cork City?  Would the Minister also consider the fact that the weekly bus fare is roughly 16/- per week to and from Crosshaven?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>If it was proposed to pay travelling allowances to soldiers living 20 miles from barracks, one <Col N="2077" /> would have to provide travelling allowances for soldiers living 15, 12, eight or five miles from barracks.  A whole new incidence of expenditure would grow up.  The fact of the matter is that it is the soldiers' own choice that their families are living out there and they would not live out there were it not that it is very much cheaper to live there than to live nearer the city.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that the area in question has been canvassed and the network designed and costed.  In the case of the portion of the area at Cloughran, the proximity of the Dublin Airport requires that special measures be taken to avoid the danger to aircraft of high tension electricity lines near the airport.  Progress is being made in the matter of the examination of the position by the Electricity Supply Board in an endeavour to arrive at a method of giving electricity supply in the immediate vicinity of the airport without unduly heavy capital cost. Until this examination is completed, it will not be possible to arrive at final figures for the area as a whole.</P>

It is understood from the local authority that at present the overdraft on the Housing Capital Account is £125,240.</P>
    <P>The annual charges on these borrowings, segregated between interest and repayment of capital in each of the years 1944-45 to 1949-50 were, it is understood, as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Chinn Chomhairle, to take Questions Nos. 43 and 44 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed by the health authority that the remuneration of the <Col N="2087" /> maids employed at Crooksling Sanatorium has been the subject of discussion with their trade union and I, accordingly, assume that the Deputy's questions relate to maids only.</P>
    <P>At 31st December, 1949, the rate of remuneration, including temporary bonus, payable to non-resident maids, was £2 4s. 6d. per week with free meals while on duty.  The same scale of remuneration applied at 1st May, 1950.  The health authority submitted to my Department a fortnight ago a proposal to grant an increase of 3/- per week to these maids, with effect from 1st October, 1949, and the matter is under consideration.  A decision will be conveyed to the health authority in the near future.</P>
    <P>At 31st December, 1949, the scale of remuneration of the maids who reside at the sanatorium was £60 per annum, proceeding by annual increments of £2 10s. 0d. to £65 per annum and thence by annual increments of £4 10s. 0d. to £74 per annum.  This scale was replaced, with effect from 1st April, 1949, by one of £70 per annum, proceeding by annual increments of £4 10s. 0d. to £79 per annum.  These maids are provided with full board and they are paid cost-of-living bonus at the rate of 7/6 per week.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he is aware that owing to the unfair and quite unusual conditions of contract issued to building contractors tendering for the Manorhamilton Hospital, County Leitrim, very few contractors would tender, and so maximum competition was not effected; and what steps he intends taking to remedy the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to ask this question.  Is the Minister aware that a builder was importuned to put in a tender after the closing date&mdash;I take it in view of the paucity of entrants for the contract?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that any builder was importuned to put in a tender.  I am aware that the Federation of Builders invited their members not to tender, and that possibly as a result of the activities of the Federation of Builders in the matter, some of their members did not tender. I should point out to the Deputy that the contents of the articles of agreement and conditions of contract in cases of this kind are primarily ones to be determined by the local authority. In this case I want to make quite clear that the conditions of contract were approved by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make it quite clear to the Minister that it was only as a result of the very unusual and extremely unfair conditions of contract that the Federation of Builders recommended to their members that they should not tender for this contract.  The result has been that the ratepayers of Leitrim and the citizens of Ireland generally have not got the benefit they should have got. If the Minister takes into account the fact that these general conditions of contract have been approved for other hospitals by his own Department, I think it will be agreed that it seems a rather extraordinary step and one that, on the face of it, looks as if it should be inquired into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that some, at least, of the conditions to which exception was taken by the Federation of Builders had been incorporated in some other contracts.  I think it is unfortunate that the Federation of Builders sought to induce their members not to tender.  There was, I think, a very short lapse of time between the <Col N="2090" /> lodgment of the complaint by the Federation of Builders to the local authority and the issue of the request to the members of the builders' federation not to tender.  I think it was unfortunate that further time was not allowed to permit of the matter being discussed.</P>

      <P>I assume that the first hospital referred to in the Deputy's question is Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin. The planning of this hospital has not been the subject of detailed examination in my Department except in the early stages.  I understand, however, from inquiries that stone will be used only in the provision of columns at some entrances and that the quantity of stone will be comparatively negligible, having regard to the size of the contract.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the use of a limited amount of stone at Ballyowen Sanatorium will be confined almost exclusively to the main entrance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>

I should be glad if the Minister would consider that in the future.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply and referring to a reply given by the Minister for Health in regard to Galway Hospital, wherein <Col N="2091" /> the Minister for Health indicated that window-sills would not be made of stone, I would ask the Minister to consider as a matter of national importance and as a matter related to the employment of our stone workers that as much stone as possible be used in these hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise entirely with the point of view put forward both by Deputy Brady and by Deputy Cowan. The difficulty is the additional cost involved.  I think the difficulty of the Department of Health in these matters is to try and utilise the money to the best advantage, in such a way that they can provide the maximum degree of accommodation possible.  In the case of the Galway Regional Sanatorium for example, to which Deputy Cowan referred, the additional cost involved in using stone sills would have been £20,000&mdash;that would represent an additional £20,000 to the cost of this hospital.  It is obvious that that would reduce the capacity of the Department to make additional rooms available or to provide additional accommodation in other ways.  While I sympathise entirely with the viewpoint expressed on the matter I think the position is that you have to try to provide the best accommodation possible at the lowest price possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising further out of the Minister's reply, is the Minister aware that one reason why the native dressed stone is so costly at present is that a number of these quarry men have been so reduced in business that they are not in a position to equip themselves with modern up-to-date machinery for the dressing of this stone?  If they got any kind of encouragement through big contracts they would be in a position to produce stone at a much cheaper rate.  At present, the industry is rapidly declining. It is so serious that there is danger that young stone-cutters will not be employed at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the real problem as far as the stone-cutters and contracts of this kind are concerned is the development of pre-cast concrete sills and pillars.  The stone <Col N="2092" /> work can only compete where it is utilised for decorative purposes rather than utilised for utilitarian purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I indicated briefly that my reason for referring this motion back is because I disagree entirely not with the Minister on matters of detail but with his whole <Col N="2093" /> concept of agricultural policy.  I believe the Minister's policy is fundamentally wrong.  He regards agriculture not from the point of view of the farmer but from the point of view of a shopkeeper. He has sought to maintain a precarious agricultural industry dependent almost entirely on imported raw materials, on the one hand, and dependent upon external markets for our surplus produce, on the other hand.  I conceive an agricultural policy that is in the main based upon Ireland and that is self-supporting to the largest possible extent, depending in the main upon the industry and energy of our own people and their ability to utilise the land to the fullest possible extent to provide food for our people and feeding stuffs for our live stock.</P>
      <P>I indicated that the Minister's two main failures over the past two years have been, first, his failure to provide fair prices and secure markets, and, secondly, his failure to provide a reasonable amount of capital for the development of the agricultural industry.  Under those two headings the Minister has failed ignominiously, and that failure has resulted in a low total income from agriculture, in a low level of employment, and in a low average income for each person engaged in the industry.</P>
      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to a statement made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce yesterday in Geneva.  Addressing the International Labour Conference there, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is just as important to protect the farmer as those who work for him.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I wonder does the Minister for Agriculture accept that view, or will he repudiate it as he repudiated the policy of the Minister for Defence when he sought to protect the Irish oats grower from exploitation and ruin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night I indicated a number of branches of the agricultural industry which have been unfairly and unjustly treated.  I showed how the simple and gentle women of Ireland who are <Col N="2094" /> engaged in the poultry industry have had their incomes cut by one-third.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy debated that at length yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to debate it again.  I would also point out that the farmers' wives and daughters have had their incomes cut by 50 per cent. so far as the production of farmers' butter is concerned.  I assume the Minister will not deny that the income of the farming community is low.  The Minister has said that his own salary is utterly inadequate.  If the Minister finds a salary of £2,125 is inadequate, how can he assert that the average income of the farmer, which is £3 5s. 0d. a week, constitutes a substantial income?</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister is serious when he suggests that his salary is inadequate.  I will believe that, perhaps, when I see him parading up and down outside the Department of Agriculture carrying a placard with the words &ldquo;Strike on Here&rdquo;.  I think he will agree that the income he has prescribed for the ordinary farmer is altogether too low.</P>
      <P>I have dealt with a considerable number of products connected with the agricultural industry and I do not intend to dwell on them further.  I will deal with one other commodity produced by the farmer, in regard to which the Minister has taken up a very strong line.  As we know, there is not a very large section of our people, though it is a very industrious section, engaged in the production of tomatoes.  Many of those people are in my constituency of Wicklow.  Those people have put into that industry a very large amount of capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Deputy not discuss that yesterday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Those people who grow tomatoes have put into the construction of glasshouses and the provision of other equipment over £1,500,000.  They produce a very substantial amount of tomatoes every year and these are sold to Irish consumers. Each year in the glut period, in July, <Col N="2095" /> August, September and October, they are forced to compete in this market with dumped continental tomatoes. Each year, over the past three years, the imports of tomatoes have steadily increased during those four months, and I think it was a modest request on the part of the people engaged in the industry to ask the Minister to consider the desirability of introducing some restriction upon these imports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware there is a tariff of 2d. per lb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware there is a tariff, but it has been so ineffective that it has not restricted these imports; in fact, they have tended to increase over the past three years.  I am equally aware that our Irish tomatoes are superior to those imported from the Continent.  I think the Minister's attitude to tomato producers is similar to his attitude towards potato and oats producers.  It is an attitude of intolerance.  That was very noticeable when a deputation that waited on the Minister was simply sent about its business.  Subsequently a report was published in the morning papers, apparently supplied from official sources, misrepresenting the position of these people and suggesting that they had a profit of 1/- to 1/0½d. when, as a matter of fact, that was the price they were actually receiving, not a profit.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister should take note of what has been done in Great Britain. Over there they have placed certain restrictions on the importation of tomatoes.  They have decided for one month to exclude imports completely. If the British can do that, where they have a much larger consuming population, there is no reason why some protection should not be given here to this particular branch of the agricultural industry.  We know that imports into Great Britain are completely prohibited for a period of six weeks.  That gives the home producer the opportunity of securing a market for his produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, I think, when speaking <Col N="2096" /> on this matter in the Dáil made the point that he was fighting to secure cheap tomatoes for the poor.  If he adopts that argument it can be used in regard to almost every Irish product. If we were to adopt that argument, we must remove all manner of protection from every industry and every branch of industry.  I think the Minister ought to see the justice of the claim that is being put up by this important industry.  If he does he will see that, perhaps, in the long run he is serving not only the industry itself but serving the consuming public as well.  If the Irish tomato industry is wiped out, we have no guarantee that foreigners will cater for our home consumers either adequately or reasonably.</P>
    <P>I have stated that there are two main headings under which the Minister has failed.  I have dealt with the Minister's failure with regard to prices generally. I have dealt, too, with his failure in regard to a variety of farm and garden products.  I have stated that, in addition to his failure to secure decent markets and prices for the farmers, he has also failed to provide the capital that is so urgently needed for the expansion of the agricultural industry.  I did not deal with this matter yesterday, because I was waiting to have the Minister present to hear the case which I had to make in regard to this very urgent need.  No industry can be developed or expanded without capital.  I think the Minister will agree that, even if you want to establish only a small workshop or a small undertaking of any kind, you have got to invest capital in it.  If the agricultural industry is to be expanded so as to increase production in the way in which the Minister has sometimes suggested&mdash;that is by 50 per cent.&mdash;well, you have got to put more capital into it.  Would the Minister suggest for a moment that any established manufacturing industry could increase its output by 50 per cent. without the investment of more capital in it?</P>
    <P>Dr. Henry Kennedy went into this matter in detail some years ago.  I should think that his figures are now a little out of date, and that the requirements <Col N="2097" /> which he suggested might now be a little bit more expensive.  But, at that time, he indicated in the report of the Commission on Post-War Agricultural Policy that, for the improvement of the land generally by the use of fertilisers, lime and so on, a sum of £58,000,000 would be required. He suggested that, for the improvement of housing and farms, a sum of £98,000,000 would be required, for equipment generally on the farm that a sum of £23,000,000 would be necessary, and that for the general improvement of stock a sum of £22,000,000 would be necessary.  Of course, when he mentioned the improvement of stock I take it that he was not referring to increasing the number of stock on the land, but rather to the elimination of inferior, unhealthy or unprofitable stock and their replacement by animals that would be fully productive.</P>
    <P>These are the headings for which capital is required.  They are all essential, and at the present time there is no source from which the capital necessary can be obtained.  We know that during the past couple of years the banks have restricted still further all credit for agriculture and for other development.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation, according to the figures published in reply to a question asked here, received 1,762 applications for loans in 1949 and out of that number they granted 694.  In other words, they rejected two-thirds of the applications which they received.</P>

      <P>These figures go to prove that the Agricultural Credit Corporation is inadequate to serve the purpose for which it was constituted. It was set up to provide credit for agriculture.  Those applications for loans came exclusively from farmers.  If the provision of credit is outside the function of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, and if the banks, as we know, are not prepared to finance agricultural expansion, then there is no source to which the farmer can turn to-day if he wants to correct <Col N="2098" /> the acidity of the soil or the infertility of the soil, or if he wants to improve his live stock or his buildings, or if he wants in any other way to develop his farm and make it productive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As against all this restriction of credit for the ordinary purposes of agriculture, we have the position in which the Minister himself has undertaken to provide credit on a very substantial scale for the drainage of waterlogged lands and for the reclamation of land that requires to be cleared of scrub, rocks or boulders.  The farmer who has 20 acres of wet land can secure a loan of £12 per acre. That is to say, he can secure a loan of £240 to drain that land and so improve his farm, but as regards the remainder of his land which urgently requires capital for its development, he cannot secure any loan whatever.  That is an extraordinary position.  The expenditure of £12 by the farmer on his bog, plus three times that amount by the Department of Agriculture, would probably make it somewhat more productive than it is at present.  But the expenditure of one-fourth or one-fifth of that amount on the farmer's better land would make it ten times more productive.  The Minister said that 80 per cent.  of the land is unproductive at present because of lack of lime and fertiliser.  Yet, he is not prepared to do anything to relieve that situation. In reply to a question which I raised on this matter, the Minister said that there is a very vital difference between providing loans for improving the better land and loans for the improvement of bog.  He suggested that the loan for the improvement of the bog brings about a permanent improvement whereas the other may not.  I emphatically contest that assertion.  The rehabilitation of bog land under the scheme cannot be said to be absolutely permanent. Even if the field drainage is perfect and the watercourses are properly cleared, maintenance will be required every four or five years and, perhaps, even oftener.  In addition to that fertilisers provided under the scheme are not of a permanent nature, and will need to be replaced from year to year. The possibility is that, if a farmer avails of the grants and loans for the <Col N="2099" /> improvement of his bog, and subsequently neglects that improved bog land, the position will be little better than it was; it may even become worse if the land is afterwards completely neglected.</P>
    <P>I think if the Minister would approach the matter in a realistic way he would see that the improvement of our impoverished land by the provision of adequate supplies of phosphate and lime would be just as permanent as, if not more permanent, the improvement of the bog lands.  I could show the Minister hundreds of acres of land carrying very little stock which, if ploughed, would produce a very light yield per acre.  I think I could convince him that if that land was improved by the addition of phosphates and lime that improvement would be very long lasting, even if no more manures were added, because once the land is brought into a condition where it will carry heavy stock, that stock will manure the land and fertility will be thereby preserved to a considerable extent.</P>
    <P>I do not think any case can be made for providing long-term loans for bogs on the security of the reclaimed land while refusing to provide the same type of loan on the same type of security where the better land is concerned.  I think the case I have made is unanswerable. Indeed, up to the present the Minister has made no attempt to answer it.</P>
    <P>We know what can be done if sufficient capital is put into agriculture. The Minister has denounced the low-yielding cow, the cow that produces less than 400 gallons per year.  When introducing his Estimate, he stressed the necessity for eliminating diseased stock.  Diseased stock will have to be replaced.  On a number of occasions the Minister has stressed the need for using more modern equipment on the farm.  He has even gone so far in that direction as to exclude the horse completely from agricultural work.  We know what it costs to mechanise an ordinary farm of 30, 40, or 50 acres. It would be difficult to mechanise any farm over 30 acres for much less than £1,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course not.  The point I am making is that the credit available for the purchase of such machinery is not adequate.  Even if the farmer were to buy on the hire-purchase system, he can only get a short-term loan from the Agricultural Credit Corporation on which he must pay 4½ per cent. interest. I do not think that the ordinary farmer should be compelled to repay a loan of that kind at 4½ per cent.  I think that is altogether excessive and the period of repayment should be not less than 10 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because I think the average small farmer, or medium-sized farmer, purchasing a tractor would care it sufficiently well to keep it in good condition for ten years.  I know of tractors which have been working on hire for 15 years and I think ten years is not an excessive period to allow for the repayment of a loan for the purchase of a tractor.  In the same way I would suggest that loans for the replacement of the fertility of the soil could be extended over a period of ten, 15 or 20 years.  Where the fertility of the soil is very low, once it is replaced the task of maintaining it is not one of excessive difficulty.  The profit from year to year from the farm would probably repay for the replacement of the manurial content extracted from the farm.  The Minister has a habit of interrupting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Once you replace the soil deficiency, and put the soil into healthy condition, then you can expect reasonable crops from year to year that will repay on an annuity basis the original cost of putting that soil into healthy condition.  That is why I suggest long-term loans for the improvement of soil that is becoming infertile.  The Minister recommends long-term loans for the fertilising and draining of boglands.  That is a perfectly reasonable proposition.  The same applies, even to a great extent, in regard to housing.  There again long-term loans are desirable.  The two great difficulties and obstacles in regard to credit are, firstly, that neither the banks nor the Agricultural Credit Corporation, to a great extent, will accept land as security for a loan, but the Minister is quite prepared to accept land as security for a loan for the rehabilitation of water-logged land.  Why should not the Agricultural Credit Corporation also be prepared to accept land as a security? If land that has been reclaimed is good security for a loan, why should not good sound land be even a better security for a loan?  If the Minister only thought over this problem, he would have no difficulty in seeing that there is no answer to that question; credit must be provided if there is to be any expansion in agricultural production.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years the Minister has found that all his efforts have only resulted in an increase in the volume of production of 2 per cent. over 1938.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did include the bogs because fertilisers are included where there is a rehabilitation scheme for bogs.  Does the Minister realise that in 1949 we imported and produced in this country for use on the land 312,000 tons of fertilisers which, divided over the agricultural land of this country, would give a distribution of less than four stones per acre?  I do not know how you would apply four stones of fertilisers to an acre of land except you had a pepper canister.  Having regard to the low distribution of fertilisers, it is essential that something very drastic should be done to ensure that greater quantities of fertilisers will be used throughout the country, not only on tillage land, but also on our pastures. The trouble, of course, with the majority of farmers is that it is difficult to find the necessary capital to purchase these additional manures.  I think that viewed from every aspect the Minister will see how essential it is to provide better credit facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He will see also the urgent need for reducing the cost of credit for agriculture. Agriculture is not in the same category as industry or as commerce. Most of the charges on loans are based upon what people in commerce and in industry can pay.  The agricultural income, as I have pointed out, is exceedingly low.  Being low, it does not provide the income to repay loans at the high rate of interest that is at present demanded.  I am indebted to Sir John Esmonde for a statement which he made recently emphasising this particular point.  He stressed the fact that the interest charges on loans are an unbearable impost on various spheres of agriculture.  He took a typical example of a credit transaction. A man who had a 50-acre farm borrowed £700, his farm and industry being the security.  The bank interest was 5 per cent.  Before he provided for any other outgoing, the farmer's annual contribution was 14/- per acre or £7 in respect of a 10-acre field.  That is a typical example of how the high rate of interest cripples agricultural development.  The Minister ought to do something about it. <Col N="2105" /> He has been asked by the Fine Gael Party; by the Clann na Poblachta Party, I think; by the Clann na Talmhan Party, and most emphatically by the Labour Party, to do something about this problem.  So far, he has resisted all the demands.  I do not know what particular financial interest he is serving by that refusal. Certainly he is not serving the interests of agriculture or those of increased employment and production on the land.  I do not think I need emphasise this matter any further beyond saying again that it is one of urgent importance.  What we can achieve with increased capital in the agricultural industry is almost unlimited. Certainly, we can easily reach the figure of a 50 per cent. increase, which was mentioned by the Minister, but it will require sustained effort and the application of this additional capital properly invested in the agricultural industry and accompanied by the most modern technical advice and assistance which can be given to those engaged in agriculture.</P>
    <P>These are the two main points on which I think the Minister has fallen down completely.  He has failed to provide a secure market at fair prices for the farming community; he has failed to provide the capital to develop the industry.  In the face of that failure he expects miracles to be worked by the farming community. The farming community is composed of honest, industrious, hard-working people but they cannot work miracles. If the Minister does his part he will find that the farmers and the farm workers will do theirs.</P>
    <P>I come now to the land rehabilitation project.  I have had under observation work that is being carried out under this particular scheme.  I should like to give the Minister one word of advice&mdash;to concentrate as far as possible on securing the services of the best contractors that are available for the carrying out of this work.  I have seen work which was carried out directly by the Minister's Department and work which was carried out by a contractor.  While the work in both cases appears to me to have been efficient&mdash;I do not think I dare suggest <Col N="2106" /> anything to the contrary, because I am not sufficiently informed to be able to judge otherwise&mdash;the amount of time for the carrying out of the work by the Department exceeds enormously the amount of time required by the contractor. I have seen work carried out in County Wicklow: two small fields in which, I suppose, there is nearly £15,000 worth of machinery concentrated over the past four months.  If that machinery were not there at all, the men who are there to assist with the machinery should be able to do the work with spades and shovels.  On the other hand, I have seen a contractor going on a farm and almost completing as much work in a few days.  I could not but notice the difference between the speed with which the work was carried out under the different systems. In a matter of this kind the small contractor with his unit of machinery, and supervising the work himself, can do the work much more efficiently than a Government Department.  I think I should mention that the Minister observed, in introducing his Estimate, that he was favouring the contractors in regard to supplies.  It may be that where the work was carried out directly by his Department there was a hold-up for supplies from time to time.  Apart from that, however, I think the energy and anxiety to get to work shown by the contractor far exceeds that of the Department.</P>
    <P>I was deeply interested in the Minister's statement, in introducing this Estimate, that he proposes to establish cheese factories in areas which are finding it difficult to dispose of the farmers' butter which is available.  He mentioned County Wexford in connection with this particular matter.  Apart from County Wexford, there are other districts scattered all over Leinster&mdash; Carlow, Laoighis, portions of Wicklow and other areas in the province&mdash;where people have to depend to a certain extent for their income during the summer months on the sale of surplus farmers' butter.  That butter is now retailing at 1/9 a lb. which is equivalent to 7d. a gallon and that certainly is an inadequate income.  I think the suggestion of cheese factories will be welcomed.  Would the Minister give us a little more information?  We should <Col N="2107" /> like to know who is going to erect these factories.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;One more sow, one more cow and one more acre under the plough.&rdquo;  This nursery rhyme was introduced about 21 years ago. <Col N="2110" /> Almost immediately after it was introduced the produce of the cow, milk, dropped to 2½d a gallon; the progeny of the sow became unsaleable and the produce of the land also became unsaleable.  Now, after 21 years, the Minister has revived this nursery rhyme.  Does he realise that it was the frequent reiteration of this rhyme that drove the farmers of Ireland <i>en masse</i> into the open arms of Fianna Fáil?</P>
      <P>I do not know why the Minister should be so stupid as to think that that type of slogan has any appeal for the farmers.  They realise how dishonest and how futile it is.  One more acre under the plough is a good slogan if you are prepared to ensure that the farmers who put one acre under the plough will get a fair price for their produce.  If you are prepared to permit the unlimited importation of cheap feeding stuffs and swamp the produce of the plough, then you are simply trying to deceive the farmer, to delude him, and you are not being honest or fair with him.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister should change that slogan.  He should realise that you cannot reconcile the free importation of feeding stuffs with the promotion of increased tillage.  I am sure the Minister realises that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>For the simple reason that if you permit unlimited imports of feeding stuffs at a lower price than the farmer can produce them, he will be driven out of producing them, and will be made dependent upon the imported article.  Surely, the Minister realises that if a farmer requires 20 tons of cereals for his poultry or pigs or cows, and if he can purchase it in a local shop for less than he can produce it on his farm, then he will so purchase it and nothing will stop him. The farmer is a business man as well as everybody else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>He could increase the production of his live stock by grazing <Col N="2111" /> more land and growing more cereals. I see the Minister nodding his head so that is his view of what our agricultural policy should be.  The Minister's view of agricultural policy apparently is that we should graze our own land and import feeding stuffs and re-export the finished product to Great Britain or elsewhere.</P>

I would not permit, in any circumstances, imported feeding stuffs to oust the home produced product. I would not permit imported grain to grind the farmer out of tillage and out of producing cereals on his own land.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am answering the Mini ster's question, and I am saying that the level should be sufficient to allow the farmer to get a decent price for his barley or oats or whatever other crop he sows.  I was taunted by people some time ago, particularly those in the poultry industry, for fighting for a decent price for oats.  But now the poultry keepers are demanding that a <Col N="2112" /> price of 28/- should be fixed for oats. There is nothing to be gained by a policy of depressing tillage production. That policy resulted in leaving the poultry keepers without any supplies of feeding stuffs.  They have now come around to my view that it is desirable to give the farmer a reasonable guarantee so as to enable him to maintain maximum cereal production.</P>
      <P>Perhaps there is nothing that will afford the Minister better advice than his own humiliating experience over the past year when he had to go around to the garbage dumps in five continents looking for supplies.  Sugar had to be got from Formosa, barley and oats from Iraq and potatoes from Amsterdam, onions from Egypt and wheat from some part of the Pacific coast.  Surely the tragic experience the Minister had should convince him of how desirable it is to maintain a reasonable system of crop rotation in the country which will provide the basis of our needs for agricultural production, with food for the human population in the form of sugar and flour, and feeding stuffs for our live stock.  Let us have maximum production of cereals on our own land.  We can allow in a quantity of feeding stuffs to supplement it, but these imports must not be allowed to disrupt our crop programme and drive our farmers out of production.  The Minister ought to learn something from his experience over the past two years.</P>
      <P>I now come to the question of the parish plan.  The Minister did not give very much information about it when introducing the Estimate.  While the Minister may claim that his salary is inadequate, his protestations in that respect have been taken up by the newly appointed parish agents who think that they are entitled to something more than they are getting.  I think that the Minister was absolutely wrong, whatever may be the merits of this dispute, to state publicly that those people were wrecking the parish plan.  I think it was very injudicious of him to say that.  In a matter of this kind, it would be better to try and be reasonable, to meet people in a reasonable way.  There is nothing to be gained by insulting people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2113" /> As regards the plan itself, I have a severe criticism to make of the Minister as to the manner in which it was introduced.  The Minister announced he was introducing it in four counties because it had received unqualified support from the county committees of agriculture in those counties.  I think that, in distributing benefits of this kind, if they are benefits, it will be agreed that there should be no favouritism and that the political views of the various county committees of agriculture should not be taken into consideration.  The views expressed by those committees in regard to Government policy should not be allowed to cloud the Minister's mind or prejudice him against other counties.  The county committee of which I am a member agreed to accept the plan.  We made certain constructive suggestions. We did not, for instance, like the word parish agent.  We thought that these men should be known as instructors. The word &ldquo;agent&rdquo; in a country town connotes someone who is trying to sell something that is not of sufficient merit to be sold in the ordinary business establishments.  Years ago we had the &ldquo;tea men&rdquo; going through the country.  Now we have insurance agents and other types of agents trying to sell different classes of goods. I think that the word &ldquo;agent&rdquo; would be less acceptable to the farming community than the word &ldquo;instructor.&rdquo; This was one of the matters on which the committee expressed its disagreement with the Minister.</P>
    <P>We made certain submissions to the Minister in the hope that they would be accepted.  The answer was a refusal to put the scheme into operation in our county.  That was a childish attitude for the Minister to take up and was altogether wrong in principle. I think the Minister ought to reconsider the matter.  If it is not possible to appoint all these agents at the one time, then I think the Minister should allocate a certain number to each county and in that way distribute the benefits of the scheme far and wide over the tax-paying community instead of showing favouritism to particular counties.  If that principle of favouritism were to gain acceptance, we might in time have it applied to county <Col N="2114" /> councils in regard to the distribution of grants.  If such a thing as that should occur, it would be very detrimental to the Government of this country.</P>
    <P>There is only one other small matter to which I wish to refer.  In the reorganisation of our county agricultural services what will be the position of the present county agricultural instructors?  We know that the present system has not been an improvement on the old system.  These qualified and trained instructors are appointed for the purpose of visiting the farmers, giving them advice and carrying out experiments.  But to a great extent a large percentage of the time of these instructors is occupied in carrying out office work or supervising such work. Where they have to do such work they cannot carry out the primary duties for which they were appointed.  Either one aspect or other of their work has to be neglected.  I think it would be better to revert to the old system of having secretaries to the county committees purely for the purpose of carrying out the ordinary office work and leave those who are qualified to do the practical work in a position to do it.  I might point out, too, that the clerical officers working for these committees are under-remunerated.  That may be a small matter but it is an important one since it is directly concerned with the efficient carrying out of the work of the Minister's own Department.  It is through these county units that the Department proves effective in discharging its functions.</P>
    <P>I regret I cannot approve of the way in which the Minister has discharged the duties of his office during the past two years.  I know that the House took a chance in appointing him, but there was some justification for taking that chance since it was assumed that the Minister, who had spent so much of his time talking folly in regard to agricultural policy, would, on his appointment as Minister, turn his back upon all the irresponsible pronouncements in which he had indulged prior to shouldering the responsibility of office.  In the past he denounced certain crops and certain methods of <Col N="2115" /> husbandry which time has proved now to be desirable.  If the Minister is now prepared to meet the House in a reasonable way, I think the House will be prepared to allow his Estimate to go through.  If, however, he proves as unreasonable in reply this year as he was last year and the year before, I do not think the House will be prepared to give him yet another chance.</P>

      <P>It is much too important to be debated from a purely political point of view.  It is a sad commentary that, having had our own native Government from 1920 until to-day, this industry and the workers in this industry are still the hewers of wood and the drawers of water for the rest of the community.  It is sad that a skilled agricultural worker to-day is paid £2 per week less than an unskilled labourer digging the foundations of a cottage.  If I could see any hope of all Parties uniting to bring agriculture out of the rut in which it is and to put the farmers in a position where they could at least pay the same wages that are paid to unskilled labourers elsewhere, I would think then that we might arrive at the stage where our principal industry could go ahead.  What hope is there for it?  What hope is there for an industry where a farmer can only afford to pay a wage lesser by something over 50 per cent. than what a man may earn anywhere else?  That is the position of the industry.  What future is there for it?  It cannot produce more under such circumstances. Can any Deputy deny that in the past two years 47,000 farm labourers, be they farmers' sons or ordinary labourers, have left this land of ours?</P>

      <P>You are not.  If the Deputy was comfortable here he would not be looking for a Minister for Agriculture who was 15 years waiting for the job.  My first task here to-day is a pleasant one.  I want to thank the Minister for Agriculture for having brought the water scheme into the farm dwellings.  It is a good scheme and one of which any Minister should be very proud.  I want to thank him also for having extended that scheme to labourers who have purchased their cottages.  I think it was a most generous gesture on his part and I want to take this opportunity of thanking him for it.  I may state quite frankly that I consider that the major portion of our agricultural industry to-day, except for a very small acreage, is used in the growing of beet, and I think it is a pity that the past record of the present Minister for Agriculture, in this House and outside of it, is one that cannot have the confidence of beet growers in this country. I refer to an issue of <i>The Beet Grower</i> of June, 1950, in which the following appears:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Why should we pay the natives of Cuba £5,000,000 which should ordinarily be spent at home?  How many acres of grass would be needed to provide <Col N="2118" /> as much wealth as an acre of beet?  Why should farmers be urged to prefer crops without a guaranteed market and without a guaranteed price to those which give security? Why begrudge the farmer, who has worked hard with his hands and brain to produce beet, his reward and damage the industry which guarantees his price and market?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I quote that for the benefit of the present Minister for Agriculture.  I do not intend going back to the wilder days of the Minister in this House in which he said the best thing to do would be to blow up the beet factories. I do not intend going back as far as that at the moment, but I am going to quote what he said in the Parliamentary Debates, Volume 101, columns 1512 and 1513, June 6th, 1946.  The present Minister for Agriculture was then an ordinary Deputy in this House.  On the debate on agriculture he then said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Do Deputies realise what the beet sugar is costing this country? The present price of beet sugar consumed by the consumer in Ireland without any customs and excise duty of any kind is 5d. per lb. and that price is based on the present rate paid for beet.  Does any Deputy anticipate that the price for beet is going to be materially reduced in future or does he not agree with me that if the cultivation of the beet crop is to be maintained in this country the price must be raised, if not at least maintained at the present figure?  Do I exaggerate when I say, that prior to the war, the price of cane sugar refined delivered on the quay free Dublin was about 1½d. per lb. and that post-war we may anticipate when things have settled down it will fluctuate around 2d. per lb?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was in 1946 and the Minister expected that in this year of 1950 we would be getting sugar at 2d. per lb. The Minister went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The cost of the beet scheme in this country is 3d. per lb. of sugar; call it £30 per ton; £30 per ton on 100,000 tons is £3,000,000 of money per annum.  Give me that money and to-morrow morning we can increase <Col N="2119" /> the family allowance going into every house from 2/6 to 7/- per child.  Is there any Deputy who would argue with me that our community is getting better value in the maintenance of that daft scheme at a cost of £3,000,000 per annum than it would get if we were in a position to raise the family allowance in every poor house from 2/6 to 7/-?  Every farmer in this country who had four children in his house would receive for the benefit of these children 14/- per week in lieu of the 5/- he is now getting; 14/- per week every week in every year until the children had passed the age of 16 with the money we propose to squander on maintaining the sugar beet crop.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the present Minister for Agriculture but he was interrupted by the late Deputy Hughes, God rest his soul, for whom the Minister proposes to be speaking to-day and whose position he is now in.  Deputy Hughes said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But the poor old British are maintaining about 40 beet factories of their own.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: There are lunatics in Great Britain and the United States of America.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not going to go further with this because if I did so it would take me at least an hour to read all the Minister said about beet on that occasion.  However, in 1947, the last year in which the Minister was a private Deputy in this House, the Minister had something more to say about beet.  Speaking on the debate on agriculture on June 18th, 1947, the Minister said in Parliamentary Debates, Volume 106, column 2041:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Some day, and in the not far distant time, our people will have to ask themselves whether it is in the best interests of the community as a whole to continue in the production of sugar for beet in this country at an annual cost to the community of £3,000,000 sterling.  That is what it costs in normal times to keep the beet industry going in this country.  If, instead of growing beet and converting it into sugar, we import refined sugar <Col N="2120" /> into this country there will be £3,000,000 sterling more for the national Exchequer and that £3,000,000 sterling can be used to increase children's allowances in every home in Ireland from 2/6 per child to 5/- per child and the land vacated by that crop can be used for the production of profitable agricultural produce which will help to finance essential imports and to enrich the farmers who live upon the land.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the viewpoint of the Deputy whom the Coalition or inter-Party Government have selected to put in charge of that agricultural industry in this country.  That was his outlook on the four sugar factories and on the beet industry in this country.  Is it any wonder that despite all the efforts&mdash;and they were intense efforts, hard working efforts&mdash;of both the beet growers' association and the sugar company combined, in the first year this Minister took over, the acreage of beet fell by over 6,000 acres?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>All round, in every area. I shall deal with Tuam in a moment. I have a special brief here on Tuam if you would like to hear it.  We did our best.  I can say here, speaking as one who was chairman of the beet growers' association at that time, that nothing that we could do was left undone.  We set a precedent in this country, a precedent of which I am specially proud, namely, we succeeded in collecting there around the table representatives of the sugar company on the one hand, and representatives of the beet growers on the other, with a neutral chairman, Professor Murphy of University College, Cork, and we went into the question of the cost of production of beet.  We handed over to Professor Murphy the costings of some 300 farms in every portion of the Twenty-Six Counties.  There was 12 months' hard work involved and the committee brought in a report in 1948.  A recommendation was made to this Government that the prices for the following year's crop should be increased by something like 4/6 a ton.  That was turned down; it would not be listened <Col N="2121" /> to.  Then came the drop of some 6,000 odd acres in beet.  As I stated, everything that could be done was done.</P>
      <P>The present general manager of the sugar company went abroad looking for the manures that could not be got in this country or imported into this country for a number of years.  He went to Spain.  He found there he could not buy manures for money.  He could not buy potash, but he was able to buy it for something else.  He bought it for potatoes.  He brought out the potatoes in bags and brought back manures in them, and that resulted in the farmers of this country getting heavier yields and better crops.</P>
      <P>During the past month, we had another meeting of that costings committee. I have here Professor Murphy's report, dated 30/5/50, and it shows that the increased cost of production per ton of beet since the end of the costings period in 1948 was over 4/6 per ton.  It also shows that if our Social Security Bill becomes law you can add 2/5 per ton more to that.</P>
      <P>You may wonder, Sir, why I am taking up so much time on this issue.  I shall first take the statement made by the Minister for Agriculture, that&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;post-war we may anticipate that, when things settle down, the price of sugar will fluctuate about 2d per lb.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In a report published in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> on the 3rd February, 1950, the following statement appears:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A sugar shortage in this country, unless Irish farmers grow more sugar beet, was forecast by Major General M.J. Costello, general manager of the Irish Sugar Company, at a Press conference in Dublin yesterday.  The company, he said, was able to sell sugar well below the world price. The average selling value of Irish sugar was about £50 a ton; the cheapest world delivered price was £62.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is £12 a ton more than the price of the home-produced article.  He told us that he would want 36,000 tons of sugar.</P>

      <P>This dark sugar costs £12 per ton more and it was paid out in Formosa to the foreigner for what the Irish people should be producing here at home.  I think that the fact that that condition of affairs exists in this country justifies any action of mine in calling attention to it.  Twelve pounds a ton more for this dark sugar! It is more than the Irish farmer and the Irish labourer get for the production of the white sugar in this container. There are the samples and that <Col N="2123" /> is the position which, as far as I can see, was deliberately brought about here.  Blow up the beet factories!  In that respect I will quote again from a statement made in this House by the present Minister for Agriculture&mdash; Deputy Dillon, as he was then&mdash;on the 6th June, 1946, Volume 101 of the Official Report, column 1514:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We are to bestow on those who grow the beet an agricultural wage approximately 50 per cent. of what the labourer is getting for growing cane sugar in Hawaii.  Do not argue with me about that.  I have seen them growing it; I have watched them at work; I have asked them their pay.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>To-day, when the Minister goes over to Formosa he finds that he has to pay £12 a ton more to the Negro for that dark sugar than what he paid the Irish farmer and the Irish labourer for this white sugar.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>For this dark sugar!  It Deputy Davin has any doubt about it, Major-General Costello sold one cargo of that dark sugar on the way home and made £18,000 profit on it.  That will show you what the world price is and it will show you the value of this fine white sugar which Deputy Davin finds on his table every morning.  Is Deputy Davin aware of this?  Is he aware that on the price paid for that article this Government could pay £6 per ton for beet and still have sugar as cheap as they got it from Formosa &mdash;and that same Government refused an increase of 4/6 a ton, which left them at present having to go to Formosa for 36,000 tons of it?  What would be the result of blowing up the beet factories?  What would be the result of this daft scheme of producing sugar in this country, according to the present Minister for Agriculture?  I will tell you.  I am again going to quote from <i>The Beet Grower</i> of January, 1950:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Some things you may not know about it.  The four sugar factories are prepared to contract for a total of 80,000 acres of beet.  At this year's estimated average yield, the <Col N="2124" /> produce would be 840,000 tons of beet.  At an average sugar content of 17 per cent., this would be worth £4,063,500 at the factory.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the old price, before we fixed the new costings.  It will be 7/- a ton more now.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There would also be produced 75,600 tons of dried pulp, equal to 63,000 tons of imported maize costing about £1,575,000.</P>
    <P>The total sugar produced would be about 120,000 tons, which would cost in Cuba 15,650,000 dollars and would cost when expenses of importation and distribution were added £7,200,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That would be the difference if we blew up the beet factories.  We would pay £3,000,000 more for our sugar this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>And borrow the dollars, if we could get them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The production and processing of such a beet crop would give 600,000 weeks' work on the land, and the transport of 1,300,000 tons of beet, coal, coke, limestone, sugar, beet pulp, sacks and other material would be required.  The total tonnage of goods carried by Córas Iompair Éireann in 1948 was 2,204,000 tons. £500,000 would be paid in factory wages and salaries, 100,000 tons of Irish coal and 25,000 tons of limestone.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Therefore, if Deputy Davin were chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann and the Minister for Agriculture succeeded in blowing up the beet factories Deputy Davin would be short 1,300,000 tons of freightage.  It would leave him with only 1,004,000 tons of freightage altogether to carry.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2125" /> Apart from the work on the land, 2,500,000 Irish bags would be bought by the factory and 800 tons of beet seed would be required from Irish farmers, and they pay £300,000 in taxation, on top of that.</P>

      <P>The general manager, last year, in the face of that condition of affairs, appealed to the beet growers' association for assistance so as to endeavour by one means or another to get increased acreage.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture said, &ldquo;I will take charge of Tuam,&rdquo; and he published a few articles appealing to the farmers to carry on what he described as lunacy in 1947.  I would like publicly to thank the members of the beet growers' association who went through the highways and the byways and succeeded, despite everything, in stopping the reduction in the acreage and in getting an increased acreage everywhere only where the Minister went&mdash;Tuam.  There was a reduction there.  Everybody went out on the war-path to endeavour to get the acreage increased, facing that condition of affairs and facing the fact that £1,250,000 of our money, in dollars, would be sent out.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Failure to grow beet is bad national economy, says the Archbishop of Tuam, the Most Rev. Dr. Walsh, when he presided at a meeting in the Christian Brothers' Schools, Tuam, on Sunday evening last, called to consider the problem of the decrease in the sugar beet acreage in the West and the danger of the province losing its major industry.&rdquo;  I am quoting from the <i>Tuam Herald</i> of Saturday, April 8th, 1950.  I am not going to inflict all this on the House, but there are a few titbits in it.  Wait till I come to them.</P>

There is no use in talking about exporting butter to people who do not want it, to people who are <Col N="2128" /> not prepared to pay for it, to people who never were prepared to pay for anything they ever got.  The Minister speaks here of clearing the land and getting rid of the wasteful production of beet.  What would he produce instead of it?  I hope to come back to this item again.</P>
    <P>The next thing I would like to discuss is barley.  When the late Government came into office in 1932, the price of barley at the malt-houses and the breweries was 13/- a barrel, or 6/6 per cwt.  I well remember bringing Deputy de Valera over to the malt-house at Ballinacurra to see over 200 farmers, with their carts loaded with barley, being turned away from the door and told &ldquo;go and feed it to the pigs; we do not want it&rdquo;.  That was the condition of affairs as regards malting barley in 1932-33 when the late Government took over.</P>
    <P>The beet growers' association when they started their operations took over, amongst other things, negotiations in regard to barley, and year by year they succeeded in driving up the price step by step until in 1938-39 we had this position, that the price of barley was tied to the price of wheat, and you got the same amount of money for a ton of barley as you got for a ton of wheat.  I know that the Government of the day did not like that, but it was our job and we succeeded in doing that.  Then we had the condition of affairs that prevailed during the war years when bread had to be found for the people of this country.  We went to work and we found it.  The land that previously grew barley had to go over to the growing of wheat, and the price of barley had to be artificially lowered.  Why?  Because 40 per cent. of the wheat in this country from 1938 to 1947 was grown by farmers outside the quota and, but for that, the people here would have starved during those years.  That was the position.</P>
    <P>We, in our small way, bridged that difficulty.  I even made suggestions to the then Minister for Agriculture that, for every acre of wheat which the farmer grew outside of the quota, he should be allowed to grow three acres of barley at the uncontrolled price. <Col N="2129" /> The Minister would not consent to that.  I can quite understand the position taken up by a Minister for Agriculture who was responsible for finding bread for the people of this country in endeavouring to safeguard the bread life-line.  I can quite realise, too, the attitude of Deputies who were endeavouring during that period to put us in the position in which we would have to go for that bread to others, and pay for it with the life blood of our people.  I can quite understand that position.</P>
    <P>The year 1947 came and the war was then over.  One guarantee that we had got from Deputy Smith, who was then Minister for Agriculture, was that, as soon as the war position rendered the control of barley unnecessary, control would come off.  When Deputy James Dillon became Minister for Agriculture we had a crop growing.  He came into this House and he attacked the members of this Party, saying that they had taken £2,000,000 out of the farmers' pockets and put it into the pockets of Messrs.  Arthur Guinness and Son.  At that time the controlled price of barley was 45/- per barrel.  As I have said, the war was over, and so there was nothing to prevent a Minister who held that conviction saying: &ldquo;Well, you were robbed long enough; I will give you a chance of getting some of it back now&rdquo;&mdash;by taking the control off and allowing the harvest of 1948 to find its own level.</P>
    <P>Did the Minister do that?  When I heard the Minister make that statement I put down a question asking if he was going to remove control from the barley.  I waited a fortnight for the answer.  The Minister waited too; he waited until the day before the beet growers' association were to meet Messrs. Guinness, and on that Wednesday morning he made a statement here fixing the price at 50/- per barrel.  He did not remove the control, but fixed that price as a headline. We, as the representatives of the farmers of this country, had to meet Messrs. Guinness the following morning with that rope around our necks&mdash;50/- per barrel for barley fixed by the Minister on the Wednesday. The beet growers' association met <Col N="2130" /> Messrs.  Guinness on Thursday to fix a price.  We were told that we could not touch that crop, that the Minister still maintained control and a fixed price&mdash;this Minister who had said that the Fianna Fáil Party had robbed the farmers of £2,000,000.  We met Messrs. Guinness on the following day and hammered out an agreement with them, an agreement for a sum of 57/6 a barrel for the barley for which the Minister had fixed a sum of 50/- the day before.  The Minister for Agriculture is supposed to look after the interests of the agricultural community. He is paid £2,500 to do that.  What is the result?  I met the Minister the following morning, after a debate on the adjournment the evening before, and the Minister said that if he removed the control everybody would grow barley the following year, there would be a glut, and barley would be unsaleable.  We succeeded in doing two other things besides fixing the price.  We fixed the price under contract and we fixed the price on a sliding scale, a sliding scale that I recommend to any Minister for Agriculture. That sliding scale was that the price shall not be less than 2/6 a barrel more than the price fixed for English malting barley by Messrs. Guinness. Take the 2/- for eggs in England and the 4/10 across the Border and compare them with that.  I went to the Minister the following morning.  I appealed to him.  I told him: &ldquo;Sir, the danger that you say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated, I appealed to the Minister the following morning. I pointed out to him that under the contract system the farmers would know exactly where they were.  I asked him to remove the control on that year's barley and to give the farmers an opportunity of getting 7/6 a barrel more.  &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have done quite well for the farmers; they have got 50/- where they were only getting 45/-; I have done quite well for them and I will do no more.&rdquo;  But he did something else.  If he had stopped at that we would have been satisfied. He also stated that he was opposed to the contract system.  Of course, that news got out.  When I went down to Cork and went to the brewers and distillers there to get them to agree to the same terms as Messrs. Guinness had agreed to I was told: &ldquo;We will pay the price all right, but there will be no contract&rdquo;. Then the Minister immediately started to do something else. According to a reply that I received here, in the months following up to last June there were brought into this country by that Minister for Agriculture 360,000 barrels of foreign malting barley, piled into the stores of the brewers, lying by waiting there for the farmers to bring in their crop; and, when the farmers brought in their crop, Messrs. Beamish stayed open for 11 days and then closed down because they had not room for any more; the Cork Distillers Company opened for 11 or 12 days; then they had a brain-wave and they closed down for three days, saying they had not room for any more.  They reopened at 50/- and it took an action in the Circuit Court and in the High Court to extract from them the £3,000 of which they tried to rob the farmers.  That was the condition of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year we met Messrs. Guinness to fix the price again.  We fixed a price of 53/6 a barrel.  I felt rather proud of our work to-day when I got the <i>Farmers' Gazette</i> of Saturday, <Col N="2132" /> June 17th, 1950.  Here is what I found in it:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Following an agreement between the Scottish National Farmers' Union and the Scottish brewers, distillers and maltsters, the Scottish farmers should have a ready market for their best barley at top prices. The distillers declare that their intention is to encourage the production of first-class barley.  Their intention is to buy as much as possible of the 1950 crop at attractive prices to growers and they will pay 96/- per quarter of 4 cwts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is there any reason why we of the beet growers' association should now feel proud&mdash;53/6 a barrel for Irish barley and 48/- to the Englishman and Scotchman?  Let the Minister for Agriculture go over and do that with the bacon and the eggs and we will regard him as the best Minister for Agriculture that has ever lived.</P>
    <P>We turned the wheel the way it should be turned.  But I am not finished with the position as regards barley.  We had a further condition of affairs with regard to it.  I gave a description here of the farmers who did succeed in getting the 57/6.  In that respect I would like to pay tribute to Messrs. Guinness; every barrel of barley they contracted for, they took.  There were others that did not do that.  As a result of final negotiations I found myself in the position of having Major Hallinan of the Cork Milling Company telling me that if he could pay 40/- a barrel here he would try and export barley.  That was last November.  What happened the barley in the country since?  The Minister for Agriculture this year advised the farmers to grow Ymer barley.  He waited until the barley was set as he waited until the agreement was made in connection with the malting barley. Then, lo and behold, we had a letter from the merchants telling us that they had already got a few cargoes of Iraqian barley.  Again, the stores were to be filled in readiness for the poor old farmer when he harvests his crop and brings it in.  He will be told then, as he was told before: &ldquo;Come in here and I will show you the condition of my <Col N="2133" /> store; look at it; it is three-quarters full; you will have to deliver this week at whatever price I tell you and, if you do not deliver this week, I will not take your barley.&rdquo;  And the farmers, with a vivid remembrance of the ricks of oats and the bags of oats for which there was no market in 1948 and which were eaten by the rats, would rush in and sell them for what they are able to get.  Some time ago I showed the House this barley.  I wonder whether the Deputies would like to see the comparison between Irish barley and the muck for which £320,000 was paid.  I have no objection to showing it to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have it here for anyone to see it and I invite farmer Deputies to come and look at it.  It is a mixture of bad black oats, bad white oats and a few grains of rotten barley.  If that sample was offered to any merchant in this country by an Irish farmer he would throw him out and the sample after him.  The Minister for Agriculture went to Mesopotamia and paid £320,000 of the Irish people's money for that stuff and when he was challenged in this House on that matter on May 10th, 1950, by Deputy Lahiffe and myself he told us that Grain Importers (Eire) Limited had bought from Iraq a total of 16,000 tons at an average price of £18 per ton c.i.f.  This was to be sold at £23 per ton carriage paid to the nearest railhead.  Twenty-three pounds a ton for this stuff and Irish barley at 40/- a barrel or £20 a ton.  The Minister stated that this mixture was not going to be used in that condition at all.  It was going to be put into the hammer mill and he gave a description of how it would be treated and said in his reply at column 2218, Dáil Debates, May 10th, 1950:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;When I listened to Deputy Corry I could not but think of my friend the cannibal queen in a South Sea island who determined to ape the manners and customs of sophisticated ladies.  She was told, amongst other things, that sophisticated ladies took afternoon tea so she ordered a pound <Col N="2134" /> of Lipton's best tea.  One day her entourage were surprised to observe that she appeared in some embarrassment. They inquired from the queen why she was so embarrassed and they discovered she was eating tea.  The lady was not accustomed to it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This stuff, we have been told by the Minister, is going to be put through a hammer mill and mixed with Argentine oats.  I showed some of this stuff to my colleague, Deputy Hickey, and it frightened the life out of him.  He said that it was the stuff that comes out in the blast.  That is the stuff that is not strong enough to go into the bags and that the wind blows away.  This is the Dillon admixture scheme and he mixes these two things with decent, respectable Irish pollard and refuses to give that pollard to Irish farmers. This is the Minister for Agriculture who delighted so much in the fact that he stood by the side at the birth of the admixture scheme and wept, and who boasted that he polished his silk hat and took part in the funeral after its death as happily as if he were attending a wedding.  After all that, this same Minister for Agriculture makes up a mixture scheme of his own; and it was not decent Irish oats or respectable Irish barley that was put into it but a mixture of Argentinian chaff and Mesopotamian muck, and now he informs us, in his opening speech, that he is changing all that and is going to give pollard to the farmers because he has got some dirty wheat from the Pacific.  I did my best to get some of that mixture in Dublin but I failed to get it.  They told me it had not arrived from the Pacific.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now solely with the barley side of the question.  That is the condition of affairs in regard to barley, that this muck is being brought in for the sole purpose of depressing the Irish farmers' market.  If the exposure that I have made here results in stopping any more of it from coming in, I shall be a happy man for I shall have done what I am here to do, namely, to endeavour to protect the Irish farmer from this kind of blackguardism&mdash;and I cannot describe it as anything else but blackguardism&mdash;on the part of the Minister who, after all, <Col N="2135" /> has a duty, if ever a man had a duty&mdash; a duty that he is well paid for&mdash;to look after the farmer and to protect the agricultural industry in this country.</P>

      <P>The best proof of anything is to let people see it but if there is an objection, I might have to use some of these again in demonstrating other things that have happened.  I should like to bring Deputies' minds back to the statement made by the Minister for Agriculture in this House on the new policy of the new Government, when he was starting operations here:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The more oats the farmer grows, the greater will be his service to the nation.  If any farmer finds himself with a surplus, and communicates with the Department of Agriculture, arrangements will be made to put him in contact at once with a purchaser who will take his surplus at a satisfactory price.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies have heard some of that before. That was a statement made by the Minister when he took over and when he invited farmers to grow oats. They grew oats and I was one of a deputation, together with Deputy P. D. Lehane and other Deputies, who waited on the Minister the harvest following to endeavour to get that Minister to find some trace of this guaranteed market which the Department was going to find for the farmers. <Col N="2136" /> What did the Minister tell us?  He said he had no market, that he had no intention of finding a market and, when he was pressed in the finish, he cracked his two fingers over his head and said: &ldquo;I do not give a fiddle-de-dee if they never got a £1 for it.&rdquo;  That was the Minister's attitude to the farmers who had grown this crop at his request. About 40 per cent. of that crop either rotted in the haggard or was eaten by the rats.  Every yard you went, you saw rats rambling around the country. They were like young dogs, every fellow the length of your shoe, rambling over every highway and byway, fattened off the oats that the Irish farmer was asked to produce. Luckily enough, somebody succeeded in inducing the Minister to go to America and he went.  Whilst he was away saner members of the Cabinet put their heads together and succeeded&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am very grateful to Deputy Cowan because he gave me an opportunity of finding quotations from speeches by Deputy Davin.  In the Official Report of the 18th November, 1948, column 273, Mr. Davin is reported as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I found myself last week-end confronted with this position in an area in my constituency where there are only small farmers.  They still have oats on their hands because it will not be bought at any price.  I know that a limited amount of oats was purchased in a certain portion of my constituency at 27/- a barrel, but the average price would not exceed 22/- for those who are obliged to sell their oat crop simply because they grew it as a cash crop and had no storage capacity.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the condition of affairs at that time in Deputy Davin's constituency. That is one thing to which I am more than anxious the Minister <Col N="2139" /> for Agriculture would attend and give heed.  He should give some security to the farmers.  He should fix some guaranteed price for the farmer's crop &mdash;and then let us see how far we can get.  Where is the use in having 50 per cent. of the crop eaten by the rats one year&mdash;after the Minister's praying the people to grow it&mdash;and the following year having a condition of affairs in which that muck had to be bought in the Argentine at 46/- a barrel and imported into this country?</P>

      <P>I want some guarantee, some stability in our agricultural policy.  We are entitled to that, anyway. The same position exists as regards the potatoes.  We had an appeal from the Minister in connection with potatoes in that year.  &ldquo;There is a guaranteed market for 50,000 tons of ware potatoes in Great Britain at £10 13s. 6d. a ton.&rdquo;  I want Deputy Davin to mark that statement very carefully.  It was made by the Minister when he was moving his Estimate in June, 1948.  &ldquo;A guaranteed market at £10 13s. 6d. a ton.&rdquo;  What became of Deputy Davin's potatoes?

      <P>Ah, steady up.  Speaking in this House on the 18th November, 1948.  Deputy Davin asked the House:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;What have the responsible Ministers done to control the middlemen, who undoubtedly have been profiteering at the expense of both the producer and the consumer? What has been done in an official way to bring middlemen to their senses as regards the price charged for potatoes?  In parts of my constituency potatoes have been sold at £5 a ton....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister guaranteed us a price of £10 13s. 6d. a ton and Deputy Davin allowed his unfortunate constituents to be robbed to the extent of £5 13s. 6d. a ton for their potatoes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position. What happened afterwards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farmers are not going to be robbed a second time.  This year the Minister went abroad again and, no doubt, he was thinking the old fool of a farmer was going to grow them once more and he would have them at the £5 a ton for export to John Bull at whatever price he fixed this year.  He sold some of them all right, but for the most part he found the farmers had not grown them, that the acreage of potatoes had gone down, that the old farmer was no longer a fool.  We had a famine in potatoes for the past three months, due to the fact that potatoes were exported that should not be exported <Col N="2141" /> and that were needed for our people.  We had a position in which our Minister for Agriculture went to Amsterdam, from that to Canada, from that to America and from that to the Sandwich Islands, I think it was&mdash;he went to some islands, anyway&mdash;buying potatoes, not for the people here, but for Bull.  It was a most suitable job for the present Minister.  Is that condition of affairs going to continue?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Ask the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Will we have that happening each year, or are we going to have some stabilisation in agriculture? If the policy is as it was exemplified by the samples I have shown here, then carry on with it, but do not say you have an agricultural policy.  The policy of bringing in those bags of muck and mixing them up and feeding them to pigs and cattle can be carried out in a backyard.  You want no land for that at all.  Why not tell the farmers decently: &ldquo;It is my intention as soon as you produce the crop to see that if I can I will import stuff to the price you mark it&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture loses sight of one most important matter, namely, that there are different methods of farming in practically every constituency, different policies in regard to farming and different lines of agriculture.  In certain belts grain is produced for sale.  In other belts that grain is required for feeding and would be bought for feeding, if we had a Minister who would put any effort into it.  There is no use in telling a farmer growing ten, 15 or 20 acres of barley and oats for sale to walk it off the land. He will not do it.  That is his market; that is what he has to pay his merchants' bills and everything else for the year&mdash;that crop.  The idea of an artificial depression of that market, a vicious depression, by the importation of muck is an outrage and it should be stopped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am prepared to be reasonable with anybody, but the sooner Deputies realise that there must be an agricultural policy, that some security must be given to the farmer who ploughs his land and grows grain or other crops that he is entitled, before he sets the <Col N="2142" /> crop, to know the price he will get for the article when it is produced, the better for all concerned.  That is not too much to ask for.  It is something on which we could get general agreement. Can we get agreement with the Minister?  When I asked him last February would he fix a guaranteed price for feeding barley, he refused.  If he had fixed a guaranteed price then he need not bring in 16,000 tons of Mesopotamian muck during the past month and he need not be paying £320,000 of apparently loaned dollars for it.  That is the policy I wish to get rid of.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about bacon, and the Minister told us we should have pigs and more pigs.  For whom do we want them?  Is it our agricultural policy to pay dollars for Iraq barley, Argentine oats and Pacific wheat, bring them here and mix them and then use them for fattening pigs? It would require a lot of that stuff to fatten an old pig.  When the pig is fattened, who will get him?  I am going to quote from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Thursday, 1st June, 1950.  This is not a wild Fianna Fáil journal; this is the dyed-in-the-wool article, the real McCoy.</P>

      <P>If the Chair would prefer that I should speak it, I will speak it.  The Minister then informed Deputy Smith, in reply to a question in the Dáil, that from January 1st of this <Col N="2143" /> year to Thursday last, 2,282 tons of bacon were sent abroad and that, of this quantity, 98 per cent. of it went to Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite in order in that.  I thought the Deputy was going to read the leading article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the funny thing, that this is the leading article.  It says that the price paid by the British Ministry of Food was 217/- per cwt. f.o.b. for Wiltshire sides, with a corresponding price for the other classes.  The amount of the subsidy paid on the export to Britain was £17,901, while the average price per cwt. charged to wholesalers here varied from 236/- to 245/-.  I ask Deputies to mark that, that we are to bring in these feeding stuffs and pay dollars for them.  We are then to fatten pigs on the Dillon admixture of Argentine oats and Iraqian barley.  When you have fed them on that, you have to put 8/- a cwt. on their backs and send them over to Bull.  What this leads to is that already £17,901 of Irish money has been paid by way of subsidy on over 2,000 tons of bacon sent over to England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that policy were carried out by, say, Deputy Dr. James Ryan, this Minister for Agriculture would say that it was a daft policy.  If we had a position in this country under which we had a guaranteed price, and if feeding stuffs were grown here by our own farmers who were paid the cost of production plus a fair profit for producing them&mdash;if we had the cost of production of, say, one cwt. of bacon that was made up and sent off&mdash;then we would be able to do something.  The Minister, apparently, is mighty anxious that all the bacon possible would be exported. He told us the other day that the late Count McCormack and himself were very found of pig's cheek for dinner. He said it should be eaten by the Irish people.  I want to make a suggestion to the Minister since he is now publicising pig's cheek.  I would ask him to go a step further and take his cannibal queen he was talking of when dealing with Iraqian barley and entertain her to tea, and say that she was <Col N="2144" /> very fond of pig's knuckles and crubeens.  If he does that, he can get out another dish that will be known as &ldquo;Dillon's Delight&rdquo;.  There will then be more Wiltshire sides available to be sent over to Bull.  The Irish can eat the pig's cheek and the crubeens.</P>

In 1932, when we took over office, 50 per cent, if not more, of the bread that was consumed in this country came in here.  It did not even come in as wheat. It came in as flour.

I am of the opinion that we should grow here sufficient wheat to supply the bulk of <Col N="2146" /> our own needs, even if it is according to the description given by the present Minister for Agriculture on 18th June, 1947, at column 2050 of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...in the spring of this year when our people were no longer able to get Canadian wheat for the first time since the emergency, we had the enthralling, stimulating and surprising experience of eating bread made out of Irish wheat.  Before you ate it you had to hold it out in your hands, squeeze the water out of it, then tease it out and make up your mind whether it was a handful of boot polish or a handful of bread. If it was boot polish you put it on your boots or shoes and if it was bread you tried to masticate it if you were fit.&rdquo;</P>

I would suggest that the Minister should read very carefully Mr. Liam Barry's articles in the <i>Irish Press.</i>  It would be well worth while getting them into the Official Report, but I do not want to take up time reading them now. They are good articles.  They are skilled articles.  They are sound articles.  They deal with the position of the dairying industry in a way in which it has never been dealt with before.  The articles expose everything to the full light of day.  They tell us why we have the 200-gallon cow about which the Minister has talked so much.

      <P>He should try them out. There was a Minister for Agriculture here for a number of years for whom I had a great respect.  I was politically opposed to him, but he called a spade a spade and there was no nonsense about him.  That was the late Deputy Patrick Hogan.  I remember him when he came over to this side of the House.  The first year he was here Deputy Dr. James Ryan was Minister for Agriculture.  This was the advice <Col N="2148" /> that the then Deputy Patrick Hogan tendered to his successor:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If you carry on the live-stock breeding policy as it has been carried on by me during the past six years you may have very fine looking cattle in this country; you may have fine looking bullocks, but it will be physically impossible to get a decent milch cow.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, that is what has happened.  The Minister is working the old game.  He is starting again the old game of trying to produce meat and milk off the one animal, and all that is left is the uneconomic cow.  The only sane people are the people with the Pekinese breeds at which he sneers</P>

They handed over the job to Professor Michael Murphy of University College, Cork.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the price of summer milk?  It was 8.1 pence according to Professor Murphy's calculations.  That was the figure he gave as the cost of producing a gallon of summer milk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be possible with the Minister's 200-gallon cow, all right. But what I want this House to know and what I want the Minister to tell this House is what steps he has taken to increase that price in line with the increased cost of production of milk since 1946-47.  That is what I am <Col N="2150" /> anxious to hear the Minister on.  The Minister tried a big bluff and the Minister's bluff was called.  I am glad that Deputy Lehane called his bluff by a very simple question when he wanted to know what was the butter production in this country last year and how much butter would be required for the ration.  Let the Minister get that question and answer and tot them together and see how many thousands of tons of this butter he has for sale now. According to the reply given in this House, he has none at all.  Does the Minister still think that 13.35 pence per gallon for the production of milk is not right?  Has the Minister given any consideration to what has happened since?  Since that figure was given by Professor Murphy, we have had increases in agricultural wages, increases in insurance, holidays with pay, increased taxation and other increased costs.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is a fairly smart, intelligent young man.  He went to school and college and passed his examination, and let him figure it out for himself.  He should be smarter than the ordinary farmer.  If it costs 4d. a gallon more now, and if a Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture operating on that position of affairs gave 1/2 a gallon in the summer and 1/4 in the winter months to farmers delivering milk to the creameries, the Minister for Agriculture of to-day would be loud in his denunciation of that policy. The Minister is one of those who announced in this House and to the public at large the glorious policy in previous years that when eggs got plentiful the price fell.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That will not happen any more. I can assure you, as Minister for eggs, that the more eggs you produce the higher the price will be.&rdquo;</P>

He is working the same game as he worked in the case of oats when <Col N="2152" /> he sent out to the Argentine for that dirt.  He is working the same game as he worked in the case of &ldquo;spuds&rdquo; when he sent out to Amsterdam, to Canada, to America and to the Sandwich Islands looking for &ldquo;spuds&rdquo; for John Bull.  He is working the same game with regard to the dairy cow.  Unfortunately we cannot change over from the dairy cow in 12 months. We cannot say on the 1st March, as we can say in the case of crops: &ldquo;I will switch over and I will grow ten acres less oats, three acres less &ldquo;spuds&rdquo;, and grow something else, because last year, when I took the Minister's advice and grew oats, he left it to me to feed the rats&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Minister considers he has the unfortunate farmer caught, that the farmer has now been driven into a position by him in which he will produce more and get less.  By reducing the price every year, he considers that he will get the beggar to work harder. That is the Minister's policy, but the Minister's policy cannot be and will not be carried out.  In 12 months' time, if the Minister pursues that policy, he will have no bother in selling butter, because he will be rationing us at 2 ozs. per person.  I shall probably be here in two years' time and I hope the Minister is here also, whatever side of the House he is on.  If he survives the general election, I shall remind him of what he did for the farmers of this country.

Instead of acting the playboy, as he has been doing with regard to everything he lays his hands on, let him come along boldly and in this famous farm he has bought &mdash;I forget the price&mdash;and set up a little costings board&mdash;he was very anxious about costings when he was in opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Apparently the Minister thought the best means of defence is attack and he worked that very successfully and very cutely.  He said to the farmers: &ldquo;The position abroad is very bad.  All those glorious markets I was going to get for you are all gone.  I find, when I go to them, that I am under-sold.&rdquo;  If I went with the butter I would get only a price at which I would not sell it, because my cows are 200-gallon cows.  The fellows competing against me have 700- and 800-gallon cows because they have the Pekinese breeds that the Minister was sneering at and they get 700 or 800 gallons per cow.  The farmer here has a breed not moulded by himself&mdash;a breed which was moulded by the Government and moulded by all Governments we have had for the past 25 or 30 years since the Livestock Breeding Act was put into operation.

      <P>It is my right in Committee to speak again on the Estimate. If the Minister wishes to look it up, he will find I established a precedent for it a few years before he arrived in this establishment.  I will make him a present of that.</P>
      <P>What I want the Minister to do is to come out with some definite stabilised policy.  I explained a while ago, before the Minister came in, that farming policy in various belts through the country is entirely different.  You have areas where they grow grain for sale and you have the other poorer areas, like Mayo, portion of Galway, West Cork and Kerry, where they use the grain that is produced.  I am wondering whether, with that knowledge, it would not be far better for the Minister definitely to fix a price&mdash;the cost of production, plus a fair profit&mdash;for the growers of grain.</P>
      <P>I asked him to fix a guaranteed price when the farmers were setting barley. If he did so, the farmers would know where they were.  Surely the Minister will agree that it is far better to grow those things at home.  At least it would save the millions he is sending abroad. The first duty of the land of this country is to produce food for our people.  If there is a surplus, let it travel, but we should not go on paying in dollars for foreign muck to feed our stock and, after feeding the animals here, you have to put upon their backs 8/- a cwt. of a subsidy to send them to a foreign market.</P>

      <P>That is what has happened the Minister.  I have results enough here in the leading article of the <i>Irish Independent,</i> which refers to the 2,000 cwt. of Wiltshire sides that the Minister sent down at 217/- and that were sold to our wholesalers at 245/-, and he sent out along with them £17,900 of the Irish people's money as a subsidy for John Bull, so that he could have something to eat.  That is enough for me, considering that the same Minister has to send out to Mesopotamia or somewhere else, possibly to Formosa, and pay another £1,000,000. They went to Mesopotamia for that muck, to Iraq for the barley and to the Argentine for more muck.</P>

      <P>You are a nice jewel yourself, my boy, jewel enough for anyone. I would like to conclude on this note.  Would it not be far better for the Minister to leave all other considerations out of it and say to himself: &ldquo;Now I am going to do something for Irish agriculture; I am going to do something which, if it will not bring back the 47,000 young men I drove off the land since I came into office, will at least keep on the land those who are left&rdquo;?  Let the Minister start off in the morning and draw up a decent plan of campaign under which the skilled agricultural labourer will get at least the wage that is paid to the unskilled builder's labourer to-day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows from those costings that, in the case of beet, the cost of production has increased since he came into office by 4/6 a ton. Here is a fair and an honest challenge to the Minister.  Will he give that 4/6 to the farmer this year?  We are entitled to it.  Will the Minister go to the Minister for Finance, who refused to honour the Sugar Company's recommendation last year to give that 4/6? His refusal resulted in £1,250,000 being sent out of the country for this muck that I have here before me.  It will be my judgment of the Minister's honesty of purpose as to whether or not he is prepared to recommend that that 4/6 a ton will be given to the farmer this year for his beet.  The farmer is entitled to it.  Let the Minister get the costs of production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Let the Minister build up on that and bring the beet costings up to date and then say &ldquo;calf and all&rdquo;.  I ask him to bring the costings up to date on the basis of a minimum wage of £5 a week for the agricultural labourer.  Surely the Minister will agree with me that if I have a lad working for me on my farm who has to milk cows on Sundays as well as Mondays, and if he has a brother who walks off the farm to take up work as a builder's labourer, digging foundations for labourers' cottages, for which he is being paid £5 a week, that he should have something more than £3 10s. 0d. a week.  He surely is entitled to as much as his brother, who has £5 a week as a builder's labourer.</P>

I ask the Minister to forget that kind of meanness, because the Minister had the opportunity of giving the old farmer about £500,000 out of the £2,000,000 which, he said, the farmer had been robbed of. Instead of giving that £500,000 to the farmer, he threw it into the coffers of Arthur Guinness and Son.</P>

Let us have a decent basis for agriculture here which will put it above politics.  I am speaking as a farmer and as one who makes his living out of the land.  I am asking the Minister for Agriculture to fix the basis that I suggest.  He was shocked that I should mention £5 a week for agricultural labourers.</P>

      <P>I say that that £250,000 is the property of the beet growers and that it should be given to them to enable them to meet the costs of production. With regard to smaller industries, I would ask the Minister to buckle down to this fact: that in one year it might be a profitable thing to bring in something from abroad, but that on the day he kills an Irish industry, let it be tomato-growing, pea-growing or beet-growing, on that day that industry is finished.  Therefore, he will not have that industry there when the times change, as happened with the sugar.</P>
      <P>With regard to the growing of peas in Offaly, Leix and Kildare, does the Minister mean to tell me that a man growing them to-day can do so at 5/- per cwt. less than he grew them in 1947?  Does the Minister mean to tell me that?  Is that the law the Minister has laid down for them?  Is that the position at the present time in regard to peas?  The Minister knows that it is.  He dare not deny it because I have met respectable, decent, hardworking farmers from East Cork who were up on a deputation to the Minister and who know what the Minister's attitude is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sat here throughout the entire speech made by <Col N="2165" /> the ex-Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Smith.  I have listened to practically the entire speech of Deputy Corry to-day.  With all due respect to both of these Deputies, I believe that most of us who have listened to their speeches will have our time in purgatory considerably shortened.  Undoubtedly, this is a most important Estimate. Having listened carefully to the ex-Minister's speech for five hours and 50 minutes, and having subsequently read his speech, I have come to the conclusion that what he said could have been said in at least half that time.  I presume that other speakers on the Opposition Benches will follow on the same lines on beet, potatoes, oats, barley, Mesopotamia and everything else.  I would suggest that a record should be made now of Deputy Corry's speech to-day, and it could do duty for the rest of the Fianna Fáil Party in this debate.</P>
      <P>I found myself in agreement with certain of the criticisms offered by Deputy Smith.  I was disappointed that he did not offer, or even attempt to offer, any solution to the problems he mentioned.  I think it is the duty of every Deputy, and especially the duty of a Deputy who, even for a short time, occupied the position of Minister for Agriculture, to offer some constructive criticisms and solutions to the grave problems with which the man who succeeded him is faced.  This debate should not be a matter of one political Party scoring political points over opponents.  As Deputy Corry said, this debate should be above politics.  Any Deputy who has points to raise should raise them, if he thinks they may be useful in the formation of agricultural policy as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like, first of all, to deal with exports in general and our policy in relation to them.  Is it admitted to-day that British policy is, as it has always been, to buy the commodities she requires, be they agricultural or otherwise, in the cheapest market in which she can secure them?  Is it admitted that it is also her policy to sell her manufactured goods in the dearest market she can obtain?  I think it is time we got away from the idea of even suggesting that the British regard us as favoured friends.  We shall get the same treatment from <Col N="2166" /> Britain as any other country that has the same commodities to sell as we have.  We will have to sell in competition with Belgium, Denmark, the Argentine, America, and all the other countries from which Britain buys the goods she needs.  If we admit that, then we should stop throwing stones at present Ministers or ex-Ministers in relation to the agreements they have made with Britain.  Every Minister who goes out to make an agreement does the best he can.  Unless he has the goods to offer and can offer them at a price that will compare with prices in other countries, he can do very little.</P>
    <P>We had an example here recently of our offer to Britain of bacon.  I understand that Britain is in a position to get bacon around 217/- a cwt. from European sources, and the lowest we can offer it is 240/- a cwt.; that Britain is able to secure butter at 2/6 a lb. elsewhere and the cheapest we can offer it is around 3/6 per lb.  How can any Minister be blamed then if he fails to make an agreement with Britain on these particular products of our land? I think we will have to look a little further for the reason why our products cost so much and why we are not able to sell them in competition with other countries.  I would say for a start that, in connection with butter and bacon, if things were right in this country at the present time we would not be able to export an ounce of butter or bacon for many years to come because if our population was the size that it should be we would be able to absorb far more bacon, butter and eggs produced at home than we are absorbing at the present time.  The fact is that our population is dwindling in this country especially in the rural areas.  If we look to that as the main problem facing us &mdash; that we are not absorbing enough of our own agricultural products at home, that if we were producing three or four times the amount we are now producing that we should be able to sell them if we had reached the stage where the population was what it should be.  When that stage is reached it will be quite time enough to start talking about exports of our products.</P>
    <P>Last year I congratulated the Minister <Col N="2167" /> on a statement he made concerning the 11-months' system of letting land when he spoke in, I think it was, Mullingar.</P>

I am afraid that in spite of the thunder and fire threatened by the Minister at the time that he has achieved very little in that matter so far.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are going to get this increased production which the Minister is so anxious to have, the lands must be properly used.  I understand that they are not being so utilised and that we have a state of affairs in this country where large tracts of lands are being let out on the 11-months' system. I can give the Minister an example in his own county of Roscommon where two individuals have 2,000 acres of land between them on the 11-months' system.  They are not poor farmers with ten or 15 acres who get the land sublet to them.  These individuals have taken the lands on the 11-months' system and in doing so they are depriving small farmers or congested holders of five or six acres of conacre on which they have for years past grown oats and barley.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Deputy pass from that <Col N="2169" /> matter because I cannot allow this angle to be opened up.  If I do, we will have everybody dealing with the distribution of land in his area and that is not within the province of the Department of Agriculture, but a matter for the Department of Lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go further into the matter except to say to the Minister that large areas of the land of this country at the moment are not being properly used for productive purposes and that in spite of the statement he made in Meath last year there has been very little change in that position.</P>
      <P>There are a few other specific points to which I would like to refer in connection with agriculture.  The first is in connection with the setting up of demonstration farms in the different counties.  These have already been referred to by Deputy Cogan.  At the present time the lectures given by the Department of Agriculture experts in the schools and parish halls are proving very useful as also are the pamphlets issued by the Department.  But I submit that even these things do not get home to the majority of farmers the value of good methods of husbandry in a way that it would be got home to them by the setting up of demonstration farms.  On these farms the methods of cropping could be shown.  On the larger ones you could have soil testing and analysis and the value of mechanisation on the farm on a co-operative basis could be demonstrated more fully to the small farmer of 30 or 40 acres.  I think that a demonstration farm situated in that locality should have agricultural machinery available for hiring out to the farmer at a nominal cost.  That would be a solution for Deputy Cogan's problem and there should be no need in the world for credit to enable the farmer to buy tractors and reapers for himself. I do not think that there is any reason why a small farmer should have to purchase for himself these modern aids to agriculture when they can be made available to him on a basis of hiring from the local machinery station. I hope the Minister will consider that aspect of the matter in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2170" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Or one farmer could buy the machinery and hire it to his neighbour when necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to that.  That happens in quite a number of farms but I do not agree that it is necessary that each individual farmer should buy this machinery for his own use only, unless he has a big farm and can afford it.  I feel somewhat hesitant at times in dealing with matters agricultural because people will say: &ldquo;You are not a practical farmer.&rdquo;  I know that comes easily from the mouths of people like Deputy Killilea who, parrot-like, repeat to-morrow what was said yesterday by Deputy Smith.  However, I was reared on a farm and it is for that reason that I take my courage in my hands in speaking in this debate.</P>
      <P>There is an angle of the agricultural industry that I do not feel is getting very close consideration at the moment and that is the question of industries that are based or should be based on agriculture.  In other words, agricultural products are the raw materials on which these industries could be built. I shall take what is, to my mind, a very important example, Irish whiskey. I think that Deputy Corry mentioned it here some time ago.  We have the raw materials for the production of whiskey and we have the technicians. We produce the best whiskey in the world and yet we have not even cornered 1 per cent. of the world market.  I think it is a tragic state of affairs when other countries outside Ireland are able to corner almost the entire market for the whiskey supplies of the world.  It is admitted and acknowledged that Irish whiskey is the best in the world and it should be one of our principal sources of earning dollars.  I believe that around the beginning of this century we had 20 distilleries in this country; we have now only six.  I suggest to the Minister that if the people who run these distilleries do not utilise them in the best interests of the country the State should step in and nationalise them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not forget that whiskey must be more than five years old before it can be marketed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2171" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that but it is a pity this was not done years ago.  It would be no harm to do it now so that when the whiskey is matured, in ten or 15 years' time, we can find a market for it because nobody can deny that the market is always there.  There is a perfect cycle in this industry.  Barley is a first-class cash crop for the farmer.  The work gives first-class employment and the grain residue is useful for feeding cattle while we could earn much needed dollars by the export of whiskey.  I think that is a very sound suggestion and it is one to which I urge the Minister to give careful consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely ask the Minister to take steps to be able to satisfy the House that the people in charge of that important industry are conducting the affairs of the industry for the national welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I leave that interesting problem to pass on to one that has been mentioned here very often, namely our bacon industry.  I have not very much to say on that except that I believe that there is a mess-up in the bacon situation.  I do not like to hear Deputies on the opposite side of the House, however, blaming the present Minister for the mess that exists in regard to bacon.  The difference between the administration that exists now and the Fianna Fáil administration is that there is bacon now that was not there when Fianna Fáil were in office.  That is the big difference.  I believe that the position of the bacon factories must be closely examined.  We had a sudden increase in the price of bacon recently.  The Minister went very thoroughly into the question last week and described the beauties of pig's cheek in comparison with the best slices of back rasher.  I do not dispute that at all but I have here with me <Col N="2172" /> two price lists from a factory.  One is dated 9th January, 1950 and I shall give an example of the increase in prices that occurred since.  Wiltshire sides, the leanest, were quoted at 236/- per cwt. on 9th January.  The same product on 29th May was quoted at 260/- a cwt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Which is certainly too dear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The hard cured long clear variety was quoted at 236/- on 9th January; on 29th May the same long clear was 264/-.  With regard to pigs' heads, on 9th January pigs' heads were quoted at 58/- per cwt. and on 29th May at 94/- a cwt.  In January, as far as I could gather, these people in bacon factories were supposed to be doing very well.  They were not supposed to be dying of starvation and the directors were not supposed to be obliged to pay the wages of their men out of their own pockets.  Yet between 9th January and 29th May we had an increase of 30 per cent. in some cases and a little more in others in the price of bacon.  Now we are told this month that that particular factory, the Claremorris Bacon Company, and another one in Cork are about to close down.</P>

      <P>If the Minister is not satisfied with the conditions that exist in the bacon factories why does he not examine the possibilities &mdash; he has already suggested that he had it in his mind &mdash; of taking over control of these factories himself?  Why not consider setting up one of these factories on a co-operative basis and let the shareholders <Col N="2173" /> in the factory be the people who produce the pigs?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from the Minister's reply that if he does not succeed in getting the reduction in price, he is prepared to consider something on the lines I have suggested to him here.  Another item I should like to mention on this Estimate is the question of fertilisers.  I think it is time that the question of soil testing should be examined so that a proper system of manuring could be introduced on our farms.  In the debate on the Vote for Industry and Commerce and also in some other debate various Deputies raised the question of starting the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia here.  I think it was on the debate for the Department of Industry and Commerce, and also on other debates, that various speakers spoke of starting a sulphate of ammonia industry here. The Minister should give very careful consideration to that.  We have the gypsum deposits in Cavan and Monaghan and we could produce the sulphuric acid, both of which provide the raw material from which the sulphate of ammonia is made.  It is more useful for fertilisers and it is very necessary.  I think Deputy de Valera, Junior, is the man who is very keen on the question of defence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  I find that the present Minister for Agriculture, although I may disagree with him at times on aspects of his policy, is prepared to look ahead and consider new ideas.  At least he has the courage to go ahead and try and so long as a man tries to do his best, even though he may make mistakes in his <Col N="2174" /> endeavour, I shall not be the first to criticise him.  It is much better to make mistakes than to sit back &mdash; as his predecessor sat back and failed to make up his mind for the period during which he was in office.</P>
      <P>I do not think that the production of ice-cream has been mentioned.  The Minister is seeking alternative markets for our surplus milk and I can think of no more suitable way of utilising it than for ice-cream.  There are plenty of people in this country who produce a quality of ice-cream that would not reach even the minimum standards required in the United States of America.  It is admitted that ice-cream is no longer a luxury if it is produced at the required standard.  It is of the highest nutritional value not alone for children but for grown-ups also.  I understand that in 1935 steps were to be taken to fix a standard for ice-cream. Fifteen years have elapsed and these steps were never taken.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The first time I spoke on this Estimate I said, speaking on behalf of our Party, that we would not for a moment tolerate a position here, as members of this Government, where there would be a reversion to what was the policy at one time &mdash; the rancher and his dog. The Minister has repeatedly asked farmers to produce more food at home &mdash; more potatoes, oats, barley and so forth.  I thoroughly agree with that but I am afraid that, in spite of the Minister's wish, it is not being fulfilled.  If a Minister for Agriculture in this country implores our farmers to grow more potatoes, oats, barley and so forth and if, at the same time, we allow large quantities of foreign maize meal into the country, we are doing a disservice to our farmers. I understand that granaries are being built in this country where adequate supplies of grain can be <Col N="2175" /> stored.  I must say that I am delighted about that because it is one solution of the problem.  It should be one means of stabilising the market for the farmer.</P>
    <P>It is all very fine to say that this year the farmers are asked to produce oats and potatoes if, all of a sudden, foreign meal is made available at a cheaper price, in spite of the fact that through the use of that foreign meal we are able to feed pigs and so forth. We are doing harm to our industry and we are not stabilising it when we take advantage of our farmers and buy foreign meal at a cheaper price.  We should plan on a long-term basis.  It is criminal and national folly on the part of the Department of Agriculture to buy foreign grain while we can produce the grain and the foodstuffs at home.  As far as our Party is concerned, we want to see as much as possible in the line of foodstuffs and crops in general produced on the land and we do not want to see this importation of foreign meal taking place while our farmers are in a position to supply us.</P>

      <P>Suppose you can consume all we can produce from our own land?  Is there anything wrong, after we have processed that, in bringing in further raw materials and adding to our total production?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but we have not reached that stage yet in this country. It is not so long ago when we had surplus quantities of oats and potatoes. I do not want to go into that matter in detail at all, but I do not think we have reached the stage yet that we are able to absorb all we can produce at home, or anything like it.  When our farmers are exhorted to grow more of this crop or of that crop there is no point in making a declaration the next day or the next week or the next month as follows: &ldquo;I am glad to be able to inform the farmers of this country that maize meal&rdquo;&mdash; or something else &mdash;&ldquo;will be available in quantities from abroad at such-and-such a price.&rdquo;  If that happens the farmers down the country will not grow these crops. <Col N="2176" /> They will go to the shops and buy the imported produce.  That is natural. The less hope the farmer has of getting that produce from abroad the more he will be inclined to grow it himself.  I would be inclined to take a different view from that of the Minister and I would almost say to the farmers this year: &ldquo;We are not going to be in a position to import one ounce of foreign foodstuffs.  You had better start producing them at home.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will give serious consideration to that particular angle.  I feel uneasy at times about the production of sufficient foodstuffs for our own use at home when I hear of the importation of foreign foodstuffs &mdash; especially when, as the Minister says, we could absorb at least twice the amount we actually produce at home.  If that is so, as he himself says it is, I see no reason why any foreign meal should be allowed into this country until we are satisfied that the land of Ireland it not able to produce any more.</P>

      <P>I think it is time somebody in this House dispelled the lachrymose atmosphere endeavoured to be created by the antics of an ex-Minister for Agriculture and the jocose semi-shopkeeper's act produced by Deputy Corry.  The sooner the Opposition realise one fundamental fact, the better for themselves.  The farming community are infinitely better off than they were under their régime, and they know it.  You can try to blind yourself, fool yourself, cajole yourself and cod yourself, but the blunt fact remains that never before was there so much genuine prosperity in the over-all position of Irish agriculture.  You can take it or lump it, it is a fact.</P>
      <P>I intend to take much the same line as Deputy McQuillan.  There are one or two problems in relation to which I can offer, I hope, some practical advice to the Minister.  I offer it in no spirit of criticism.  At least it can be said of this Minister, that he has the courage to try, and I have great respect for a trier, whether it is a man or a horse.</P>

      <Col N="2177" /> We have heard denunciations of certain foreign purchases made during last year, but it is time Fianna Fáil realised that every constructive effort made by the Minister to encourage the growth of cereals was sabotaged by them.  My memory is not so short as to forget the East Donegal by-election when the yowl and howl went through the country about oats and some of the farmers who adhered to the advice of that strutting little Deputy from East Donegal, and listened to the loud-voiced condemnations of Deputy Davern, were very glad to get back their oats at an increased price.</P>

      <P>It is time it was realised that an attempt is now being made &mdash; and I think a very creditable attempt &mdash; by the present occupant of the Ministry of Agriculture to give the farmers some kind of an agricultural policy and some kind of a planned basis of price.  I heard an appeal going out in this House from Deputy Martin Corry that agriculture should be placed above politics.  All that sounds very well, coming particularly on the heel of a long argument about beet, when we know perfectly well &mdash; and Deputy Allen, Deputy Corry's colleague, could have told him &mdash; that it would have been infinitely better, far less political and far less like Party politics to have a beet factory in Wexford, where they could supply it; but they put one in Tuam, for obvious reasons.</P>
      <P>Deputy Killilea made many interjections here during the afternoon.  I hope he will stand up before the debate concludes and justify how Fianna Fáil nurtured the white elephant of the Carlow beet factory into the monstrosity of a politically-placed beet factory in Tuam.</P>

      <P>I represent a very large milk-producing constituency and I do not agree with Deputy Corry's interpretation of Professor Murphy's costings.  I do not accept, nor will any farmer accept, that in those costings a calf is worth only £1, because the farmers realise that Fianna Fáil's day is done.  I remember a time when a calf was worth nothing at all.  Of course, that was a time when we were going to find so many other markets. Unfortunately for the farmers, so far from finding those markets, the farmers were left in such an impoverished state that they could not and did not meet, as they could otherwise have met, the impact of a war situation, not only to be in a position adequately to feed this country, but to have a surplus that would have been of amazing value to this country during the emergency period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It sounds rather hypocritical, to put it mildly, to have to listen to advocates amongst the Opposition talk, as Deputy Smith did, about the colossal failures of the present Minister for Agriculture in view of the fact that the full period of their office was <Col N="2179" /> decorated, year after year and month after month, with the grossest of blunders which reduced the proud independent farming stock of this country to a state of near penury and beggary and that left our farmers without the right to think for themselves or to manage the husbandry of their farms in their own way.  These people come into this House and, at wearisome length, just talk rubbish.</P>
    <P>There are a few problems in which I am interested, not in that jealous, violent and vituperative way that Deputy Smith is interested in them. I am interested in the flax problem. I do not subscribe to the view that the Minister tried to bluff the Northern spinners.  I think he tried to play a man's part and to do a manly job in an Irish way.  I do not approve of the hat-in-hand, the bowing of the knee, tactics to anybody.  I do say it is within the right of the Minister to urge on his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, if flax is a commercial proposition and a good crop for this country, the establishment of a linen industry in the Twenty-Six Counties which should be able to compete with the Northern spinners and beat them at their own game.  My belief is that flax-growing will die out inevitably if some basis is not found for the consumption of the crop at home, because I know perfectly well that, if the opportunity presents itself to the Northern spinners to get their requirements anywhere else at less cost, they will forget all about any flax that is grown in the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
    <P>I think, despite what Deputy Smith suggested, that it is necessary to retain our flax inspectors.  There is going to be a considerable amount of flax grown in my constituency.  The spinners down there have heard what the Minister had to say and the growers there know what his attitude is.  If those people want to go outside the advice of the Minister, they are perfectly at liberty to do so.  If the crop pays them they are entitled to grow it, but I do not think it is fair or right, or that it is a bit becoming that, in his vituperative hate through loss of office, an ex-Minister should try to discredit <Col N="2180" /> his successor because his successor took what we in this House believe to have been an honest man's stand in a dispute.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith suggested that when the bluff was called, as he liked to put it, the Minister should have turned around and said, &ldquo;please, what will you give me?&rdquo;  God forbid that the present Minister for Agriculture, James Dillon, is going to change his nature to that extent.  I am urging on the Minister that he should use his judgment and his known powers of persuasion to see that flax, if we are to continue to grow it in this country, will have its own source of user, and that, if the Department is going to urge a continuance of the growing of flax, arrangements be made to have in the Twenty-Six Counties the necessary plant and factory to consume and use Irish flax.  I suggest that is a matter that deserves careful inquiry.  I am urging on the Minister that he should deal with flax on that basis.  I think it would be very bad, nationally, if we were ever to see a mendicant farmer begging at the door of any vested interest in the North of Ireland for a price for his crop.</P>
    <P>On the general question of cereal growing, I would say to the Minister that there is a very great need to have the country emblazoned again from end to end with the slogan immortalised by the late Paddy Hogan: &ldquo;One more cow, one more sow and one more acre under the plough.&rdquo;  I know that he has met, as was inevitable, the cross of an irritable and displaced Opposition, with all possible types of sabotage. Despite that I urge on the Minister that he should continue to urge on the Irish farmer to grow more and more cereals to feed his own live stock, so that ultimately our produce can compete, on merit alone, with that to be found in any market in any part of the world.</P>
    <P>I heard in this House a tremendous amount of criticism of the Minister's milk policy.  Nobody on the Opposition, however, has paused for a moment to consider that, for the first time in the history of this country, the present Minister for Agriculture has asked the primary producers to have a <Col N="2181" /> talk with him as to what they will do. There are no directions now and there are no threats of persecution or of invoking the mighty arm of the law as happened when Deputy Smith was in office.  Instead, there is now an invitation to the primary producers to discuss the matter with the Minister, in the light of the knowledge available to the Department, as to what is best for the future of the industry.  The Opposition were disgusted when the price of milk was not reduced overnight. It was blazoned throughout the country &mdash; it was the lying rumour which they are so competent in spreading&mdash;that a reduction was coming overnight, but it did not happen.  Instead, the creameries and the farmers' representatives were asked to come and discuss the problem with the Minister. They were told that there would be no reduction in the price of milk unless the farmer himself agreed to it.</P>

I am glad to be able to say that the Minister was able to reopen a market for violets in my constituency. That aroused a sort of a smirk in this House when mentioned on the first occasion.  I am glad to be able to tell the Minister that we hope in the near future to have at Glandore and Union Hall the thriving violet business that we had there before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one thing that I will always say in the Minister's favour.  I have said it in my constituency and I will say it in the Dáil: at least he has given the farmer back his self respect.  He is letting the farmer become once more captain of his own ship.  He is letting him decide his own economy.  It is true, as Deputy McQuillan pointed out, that bacon is becoming a problem.  For a change, it is the presence of bacon that is becoming a problem.  As the Minister succeeded in breaking the cartels and rings that controlled other live agricultural commodities, he will bring the bacon curer to heel.  Of course any difficulties that might arise would look <Col N="2182" /> good to Deputy Killilea because he would be sure to find down in his own constituency some people prepared to listen open-mouthed to his stupid pronouncements.</P>

      <P>The amazing thing with regard to bacon is that the Minister was able to fulfil his promise too quickly.  Expansion came too quickly. The tremendous quantity of bacon coming into existence created its own problem and there were certain people who were anxious to corner the market and make more than a legitimate profit out of it.  Knowing that the Minister successfully ferreted out the illegal curer in the cellar and the people who were charging excessive prices for poultry, I have every confidence that in the very near future the Minister will right the bacon situation.  It is a grand thing to see the pigs around again.  Pigs are something stable and something real in Irish agricultural economy.  The people realise that and they are glad to see them around again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I conclude, I want to offer a word of solace to the people of Wicklow whose representative here painted a most gloomy picture with the aid of figures of all kinds that only he could unearth for his own particular purposes. The poor Deputy does not seem to realise the very outstanding fact that, if he walks around his own constituency, he does not see the lachrymose, woeful expression that he wears here on the faces of the farmers in his constituency.  He will be glad to know that the farmers of Wicklow are now able to enjoy the frugal fruits of a little van or a small motor car.  That, of course, is done, I take it, according to the Deputy, on the colossal losses and the amazing increases in the cost of production which leave no profit on the figures Deputy Cogan so lachrymosely and long-windedly expounded here.  The position is that the farmer is rapidly proceeding from good to better.  Good luck to the Minister. <Col N="2183" /> May we be quickly spared any more of the long-winded, cribbing, semi-melodramatic, play-acting of the ex-Minister for Agriculture and the pseudo-disappointment that characterised the speech of a certain Deputy who possibly feels that he might make an excellent occupant of the post of Minister for Agriculture and whom we feel we are very fortunate in not having in that post.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to Deputy Collins and Deputy McQuillan.  Both were inclined to criticise the Minister a little.  I am sure that if they were behind closed doors down the country with their own supporters they would not have been quite so restrained in their criticisms as they have been. Deputy Collins was inclined to be cross with the people over here.  He accused them of obstructing and sabotaging the schemes put forward by the Minister. Where the interests of the Irish nation are concerned, Fianna Fáil has never obstructed or sabotaged any effort. When agreements are made with foreign countries, and with Britain in particular, it cannot be said that there are any fifth columnists amongst the Fianna Fáil Party or their supporters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody who has spoken has stressed the fact that agriculture is our chief industry, that discussion on it should take place in a calm atmosphere and that criticism should be reasoned. In my opinion, every Minister of State should be both cautious and restrained in making statements.  He should err on the side of caution rather than recklessness. I have a charge to make against the present Minister in the latter respect.  He came in here with the Estimate for his Department in 1948. He told us that it had been prepared by his predecessor.  He asked that a certain sum of money be granted to defray the costs of his Department. He said: &ldquo;I am not going to deal with the sub-heads, but if any Deputy wishes to ask me any questions relating to them I will be quite pleased to reply to them when I am replying.&rdquo; He said that he was very impatient to get on and outline the headings, in so far as they related to agriculture, of an agreement that had just been completed <Col N="2184" /> in Britain.  After some little discussion with the Chair as to the lines the statement should follow, the Minister was permitted to proceed.  He certainly was impatient.  Anybody could see that.  He was so anxious to get going that he reminded one of a frog on an ant hill.  He started off by telling us of all the wonderful things he accomplished and the wonderful things that there would be in store for the Irish farmers, at home and in Britain, if they would only do the things he expected and requested them to do.  In Volume 111, column 2596 of the Dáil Debates, 9th July, 1948, the Minister made the following statement:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Oats I need not speak of because their value is too well known. `Grow,' I say to the farmers, `all the oats your land will produce and you will sell them profitably either in bag or on hoof during the winter and the spring of next year.' &rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says &ldquo;hear, hear,&rdquo; but in the same column he says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is a guaranteed market for 50,000 tons of ware potatoes in Great Britain at £10 13s. 6d. per ton delivered f.o.b. at a port in Ireland between November and February and £11 8s. 6d. per ton delivered at the same port between February and May.  None of us will grow rich on that and if the British want any increased supplies of potatoes from this country they will want to straighten themselves and pay a bit more but there is no obligation on them.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These were statements made by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a good sound principle to advise farmers to grow more and to have it sold off the farm on hoof but there are thousands of farmers in this country who are not in a position to do that and are not in a position to put in sufficient stock to use the produce of their own soil.  There are lands in this country, particularly in the West of Ireland, where they must till it even in spite of themselves <Col N="2185" /> and if they have to lay it down they must leave it in grass for periods of not more than three years.  If they do not despite all the scientific researches of the Department and others their cattle will die from poisonous weeds.  They have to till the land and produce the grain.  1948 was a good year.  There was a large acreage and a bountiful crop but how were they to get it away. They could not get it away in the normal way in which they did in other years and they were in the position that they had to sell at £1 per barrel and in many instances it was not even taken at that price.  Their case was put up to the Minister on several occasions and the only answer he gave them was: &ldquo;Let them feed it to their live stock and take it off the farm on hoof.&rdquo;  That was all right for the people who could afford to do that but there were many who were not in a position to do it.  At the time the Minister went to the United States and the Minister for Defence acted as his substitute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the period the Minister was away and on the eve of the by-election in East Donegal the price was fixed at 28/- per barrel.  That looked grand and the farmers were delighted. They rushed in to the grain merchants who were in the habit of buying their seed but the grain merchants already had their stores full and said they could not take any more for the time being but they presumed that the farmers would not have long to wait until they could take it.  I heard Deputy Cogan speaking here last night say that that was an excellent scheme. It certainly was and at the time it was a welcome guest if they had been able to operate it properly.  In order to operate it it was stated that agents were to be appointed.  They were appointed but in a way that did not help the situation.  In the second largest county in Ireland &mdash; Galway &mdash; one merchant was appointed.  I have no animus against the man who is a decent man but he had only been in the grain purchasing business for four or five years previously and the people in Ballinasloe, Athenry, Loughrea and Galway were left dependent on him to buy their grain at that period of the year.  He received <Col N="2186" /> telegrams, letters and phone calls but the man had no storage accommodation. I am sure if he had he would have taken all that was offered and he would have been in a position to pay for it all although it would have amounted to a very considerable sum of money but the fact of the matter was that he was not able to take any of the grain.  All the other merchants all over the county in the various towns and villages who had been in the business for years got on to him and asked him what he could do and he could do nothing.  What then was the position? The people with oats left on their hands could not get rid of them nor was it taken from them and a great deal of it went to waste.  That was at the end of 1948, and the beginning of 1949. The same thing happened with the potatoes.  I am not criticising the Minister for what happened because as I said it was a bountiful harvest and there was a big surplus.  However, what I am criticising him for was that he told the farmers that that surplus could be sold profitably.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I had as much money as would establish a business as big as the Minister's I certainly could have done well but when I have not that money and can only have a business that would fit in one room of a labourer's cottage, I cannot do so well and the same applies in selling the potatoes on hoof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister had come in here and told this House and the country what the agreement was, and what it meant, and had been much more careful in the statements he made, he would not have the criticisms levelled at him that have been levelled.  He showed how reckless he was in making such statements. Then he tried to make the excuse that the statements made by Deputy Blaney and Deputy Davern were the cause of the scarcity of oats and potatoes the following year.  The cause of the scarcity in oats and potatoes in 1949 was twofold.  The principal cause was that owing to the way the Minister misled the farmers the previous year, the farmers did not go in for growing the same acreage of tillage as in the <Col N="2187" /> previous year.  The second cause was the weather conditions.  As was pointed out by Deputy Smith, last year was an ideal year for growing wheat.  Everybody who grew wheat in 1949 grew it profitably because there was a big return and the year suited it but, for some reason or other, the year did not suit oats or potatoes nearly so well and consequently there was a diminished yield.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a diminished acreage and there was a diminished yield per acre also.  The Minister is not going to put me off the track because although I sport no red bouquet in my coat in this House or elsewhere, I have just as good an idea of practical farming as some of the people who have the neck to stand up and speak about it in this House.  These were some of the things that were to flow from this trade agreement but there were other things too about which we were told.  In column 264, Volume 111, the Minister is reported as saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I foresee with the improvement of grass land, with the improvement in the quality of feeding that we shall have for our cows in the course of the next two or three years, a great future for the butter industry, the cheese industry, the cream industry, the chocolate crumb industry, the condensed milk, the dried milk and baby food industry.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then he said, as reported in col. 2607, and I ask Deputies to note these words:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For the first time in history, I am in a position to say to the farmers of this country that there is an unlimited market at remunerative prices for cattle, sheep, pigs, poultry, butter, cream, cheese, bacon and potatoes, barley and oats, and the more they produce the better we hope the prices to be.  There is no reservation and no qualification about it.  I do not think that any Minister for Agriculture in this country has ever been in a position to say that before.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2188" /> Very well, he comes along now, and what can he boast of that he is getting a fine price for?  He boasts of live stock &mdash; cattle and sheep &mdash; on the British market.  These are the only things he can rely on that are being sold without restriction on the British market, that are being sold without subsidy on that market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Of course, a few months after the Minister making that statement the price came down.  You would imagine, after the nice way he talked to them over in Britain, and how well they got on, that the price would not fall by 6d. a dozen inside four or five months after he had been over there.  It is difficult to listen to the Minister claiming credit for the good price we are getting for live stock on the British market now.  That is a statement which I could not listen to without protest from even a Fianna Fáil Minister, because I would not tolerate bluff of that kind.  We got a good price for our live stock, cattle, sheep and pigs in this country, as good as we are getting to-day, in the years 1918 to 1921.  It is very strange that they did pay us such a good price then.  What was the position from 1918 to 1921?  The Minister remembers 1918.  I hope he is not remembering it too well.  I hope that it is not because of something that happened that year that he is being so bitterly hostile to the policy of self-sufficiency which means the self-preservation of this country.  We got that price at a time when the British Army of occupation were here, when the &ldquo;Auxies&rdquo; and the Black and Tans were here, when every inch of the ground was being contested against them, both actively and passively, by the people of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know what happened in 1921 and the farmers know what happened.  The farmers of this country during that period were in a position to keep a type of locomotion that was very fashionable at the time &mdash; a very fine, nice trap that was well turned out by the local coachbuilder, but, mind you, after a few years of all that great boom, a lot of the traps were left in the car house in the yard until the <Col N="2189" /> tyres fell off the wheels of any of them that could not be sold by auction to meet the debts that were contracted in order to purchase cattle to supply Britain in that boom period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>History has a knack of repeating itself.  As I said, I would not stand up here to criticise the Minister, if the Minister had approached his responsibility properly.  I would certainly point out the defects in his policy.  Nobody can claim to be infallible although the present occupant of the Ministry of Agriculture goes nearer to that than anybody else.  That is what has left our country in the position in which it is to-day.  In addition to telling us about the great market he had for our surplus produce, of course he told us we were to get in foreign feeding stuffs at such a price as would enable us to sell our produce, particularly our live stock, far more profitably on the British market.  I am not going to dwell on that at any length because we have all had experience of what happened.  That is a development which others have mentioned and in regard to which the Minister cannot answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold that the primary function of any Minister for Agriculture is to set about the task of encouraging the farmers of this country to supply our full requirements.  Does the Minister think he has done that?  Does he want to make us believe he has done that? I will give a very short quotation.  If anybody thinks the farming community, particularly the tillage farmers, could have confidence in a Minister who makes pronouncements such as those which this Minister makes, well, it would be nothing short of a miracle. In Volume 106, column 2038, speaking <Col N="2190" /> on the debate on agriculture, the Minister &mdash; Deputy Dillon as he was then &mdash; said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Some day I am convinced that beet will go up the spout after peat and wheat.  God speed that day.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder if that is the policy of self-sufficiency that was expounded by the founders of Sinn Féin and operated in this country by Fianna Fáil?  Is that what they hoped for and wished to see in their time?  Now the Minister comes along with his supporters and tells us that he is giving all the encouragement possible to the farmers of this country to grow the requirements of the people of this country.  He knows that that is not a fact, because, as I said, he has undermined the confidence of the farmers in following up a policy by the statements he has made.  Even if it should cost more money, even if the cost were greater than that of either the imported foreign wheat or the imported foreign maize, I think it would be most profitable and most economic to ensure that we would produce a full supply of wheat; beet, barley, oats and all the other crops which are better than any we can import for our own people.</P>

      <P>The farmers of this country should be encouraged.  That is the primary duty of the Minister and it should be the fundamental aim of any Minister for Agriculture in this country.  I hold that the Minister is not doing that.  We are in a rather serious position, I think, if what we read in the papers is true.  The world situation is anything but good and there is a pretty bleak outlook for humanity.  What steps have been taken here to ensure that we would have the <Col N="2191" /> necessary requirements of the staple food of our people in this country? What steps has the Minister taken? The steps he has taken are, of course, to tell the people to work harder and produce more.  There has to be an incentive other than that.  Produce more for a lesser return in cash: that is not going to work with the farming community any more than with any other section of the community.  The Minister knows well that if any improvements have been made by the present Government in regard to remuneration or conditions of other sections of the community, nothing has been done for the farmers that can be claimed by him to be an act of the present Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in this House, and very often outside it, told us of the great fight the farmers made to establish title and ownership of their lands.  That is quite true.  They did make that fight and they succeeded but, if they did succeed, the very great help they got from the people of the towns and cities of this country must be remembered &mdash; from the tradesmen, the artisans and from the small business people.  As far as the produce of this country is concerned, next to the farmers themselves, the people of the towns and cities have first claim upon it.  It is their interest that should be catered for rather than all the time to be talking about the great and glowing British market.  Exports!  Nobody should decry exports when there is a surplus.  By all means, in these circumstances, try and find a market. Nobody on this side of the House is attempting to blame the Minister if he fails to get a greater price than that which is being offered to him, or if he fails to extract a greater price so long as he is doing his best.  But the Minister often gave us to understand in this House that all the Ministers here had to do was to go over &mdash; or that they should have gone over &mdash; and meet the British Ministers face to face.  He has gone over on a few occasions in recent times.  After all, with all his great eloquence, he does not seem to have been able to hypnotise the British Ministers one bit more than his predecessors did.</P>
      <P>I read in an evening paper &mdash; the <i>Herald</i>&mdash; where the price of Australian eggs, according to the Australian radio, is going to be increased in Britain, over last year's price.  The Minister has not come back to tell us that the price of eggs here is going to go above last year's price or the present price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the producer getting in Australia?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, I am sure, has more time to delve into statistics of foreign countries than I have.  In fact, it is his duty and his responsibility, while he occupies his present <Col N="2193" /> position, to scan and scrutinise figures of that kind.  I hope that, in the course of his reply, he will tell us how much better we are faring here in this year with the price we are getting for our eggs and that we are to get for our eggs, than the Australian people now. He tells us about this 3/6 and he read us a lecture, when introducing his Estimate, in regard to poultry keeping. It all sounds grand here about availing of the services of the poultry instructresses, but it does not sound so grand to people down the country. They have not all the fancy arrangements or equipment in connection with poultry houses.  I think the day has not arrived when the Minister would be in a position to produce an automatic hen, the hen that would, when you press a button, ease off for seven or eight months of the year and increase her production of eggs for the remaining five months.</P>
      <P>He should be more matter of fact in things of this kind and the Minister should have less bombast about it.  If he did he would probably get on better, and even his own supporters down the country would be far less critical of him than they are.  The principles in relation to foreign wheat, maize and sugar are far from being in accord with the principles that we learned and are far away from the policy operated by Fianna Fáil during its 16 years of office. No one starved in this country during the very critical years of the war.  Were it not for the fact that we had two adverse seasons in 1946 and 1947, I believe that there would be no need to ration flour after the war.  But that has been done and it is being continued.  I do not know whether that is in the Minister's bailiwick, but if it is there does not seem to be much reason for it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am putting this up to the Labour Party.  Do they stand for this policy? They cannot be blind to the fact that it will leave the people whom they represent, the working people, at the mercy of the foreign exporter.  This is the question they have to ask themselves. Are they satisfied that the Coalition Government, of which they are members, are following a proper line of national security as a result of <Col N="2194" /> the agricultural policy that is being pursued by the Minister for Agriculture? Labour should wake up and they should ask themselves that question. I am sure their supporters in the towns and cities are already asking that question.  Their vote on this occasion will show whether or not they are interested in the people in the towns and cities, whether or not they are interested in their future preservation.</P>
    <P>I imagine that on this occasion, anyhow, they should at least redeem one of their pre-election promises.  Of course, it is a nice thing to see the incentive that is being offered and the advice that is being given.  We find the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach and to the Minister for Industry and Commerce advising farmers to grow wheat in the month of June.  It is a pity that advice was not offered earlier and it is a pity there was not something done which would induce the farmers to grow the wheat and the beet and the other crops.  The only inducement that has been held out to them is to work harder, to produce more and show greater efficiency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister contends, I suppose, that the farmers' costs have not increased and that the price that was good enough in 1948 is still good enough.  I hold it is not and I believe he would be doing a very good service to this country if he guaranteed to the farmers for this year's crop and the coming year's crop £3 10s. 0d. per barrel.  It would be better policy than going out to the Pacific coast for wheat supplies and it would be a much greater incentive.  If he does not wish to do it in that way, let him do it in another way.  If he does not give them <Col N="2195" /> the price directly, let him do it in another way.  He talks a lot about the requirements of lime, phosphates and potash so far as the land is concerned. He was one of those Deputies who criticised the fertilizer voucher scheme of previous Ministers.  That was no good at all, that was a blind.  Why not give them what they used to get?  The farmers should get back their vouchers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be, I am sure. I am speaking in a general way.  I know that when Fine Gael and the other Parties were on this side, they did criticise it roundly.  I know, and the Minister knows, that the fertiliser vouchers that went out to the farmers were very useful and they gave them a very great incentive to put all the manure they possibly could get on their lands.  I suppose, because this was something initiated by Dr. Ryan when he was Minister for Agriculture, it is no good now and the Minister would not dream of bringing it back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You can blame Deputy Smith for stopping that; it was Deputy Smith as Minister who stopped it. Perhaps I will be allowed to make this inquiry, as Deputy Smith and myself are sitting here.  May I direct Deputy Beegan's attention to the fact that the actions and the virtues of Deputy Smith are not properly attributable to me?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming the Minister is right, what is wrong in my suggesting the reintroduction of this scheme?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope, then, the Minister will give it every consideration.  I understand our requirements of wheat would be in the neighbourhood of 640,000 tons.  If the Minister would give a fertiliser voucher at the rate of 5/- on every barrel of wheat of a <Col N="2196" /> standard quality delivered at the mills, I can tell him that would be a great encouragement for the growing of wheat and other crops, too, crops that would provide a great amount of offals which would be useful for the feeding of live stock.</P>
      <P>If he would go a bit further and give 5/- per ton of a fertiliser voucher on every ton of washed beet delivered at the factory, he would be doing something that would be more helpful to agriculture and to the tillage farmers than many of the things that he has been offering them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not that, in fact, being done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  When the Minister is replying let him, if he can, give a statement to that effect and prove it.  What I have suggested to the Minister would cost something in the neighbourhood of £1,500,000 in the year.  The Minister may say that is a terrible amount of money, but after all, he boasts of the £40,000,000 for the land rehabilitation scheme.  This would amount, over a period of five years, to £7,500,000, and I think that our tillage farmers are well entitled to that sum out of the £40,000,000 of Marshall Aid money.  I think there is nothing wrong at all about that.</P>
      <P>I come now to the land rehabilitation scheme.  I am not going to say very much on it.  In principle, I hold that it is a good scheme, but, as I said when the Bill was going through the Dáil, it is only catering for one-third of our farmers, or one-third of the land of the country.  There is nothing being done for the other two-thirds.  Why not do something for them on the lines that I have suggested?  Perhaps the Minister has some better way of doing it.  He has his experts in the Department to advise him.  If he feels there is a better way of doing justice to the two-thirds of the farmers who are being deprived of any benefit out of the Marshall Aid money, let him come along with his scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no objection whatever to the rehabilitation scheme.  As I have said, it is a sound scheme in principle.  If I had a farm of 30 acres and suppose 15 acres were really good land and the <Col N="2197" /> other 15 acres of mediocre quality, I could only avail of the Minister's rehabilitation scheme in regard to the latter 15 acres.  I can get nothing in respect of the 15 acres of good land. The type of economy that I was taught, as far as farming and agriculture are concerned, by pretty thrifty farmers was: &ldquo;always till your good land, make use of it by getting the best possible crops, nourish it with plenty of manure so that you will be able to make a certain profit out of it whereby you can gradually reclaim and improve your mediocre land.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is not what is being done under this £40,000,000 scheme, because, as I have said, farmers with the good land are getting nothing.  I hold that they should be taken into consideration and should be given their due proportion out of this money to enable them to bring it up to its maximum fertility.</P>
    <P>The Minister had a parish plan.  He wrote to the various county committees of agriculture in connection with it. Last year he availed of the privileges of this House to insult the members of the Galway County Committee of Agriculture. He also told what was a gross untruth.  He took up a paper and gave quotations from it.  When I put down a question, he held that, when he sent down his reply, it was not even acknowledged. The minutes are there, the copy of the reply is there, and the copy of the reply that came from his own private secretary acknowledging the reply that was sent is there.  I am sure they are all on the files in his Department. He tried to make it appear, of course, that they were all Fianna Fáil supporters on the Galway committee who treated him with this contempt, whereas, one of the members who used the expression &ldquo;let him go to so and so, we will mind our own business&rdquo;, is chairman of a branch of one of the Parties that is supporting the Government.</P>
    <P>Now, when any gentleman can go out of his way to use a matter of that kind in order to try and besmirch, as he thinks, his political opponent, it is not very easy to give all the co-operation that we hear so much about, or that we are being asked to give.  If the Minister would approach this in a proper way <Col N="2198" /> he is going to get co-operation.  I am not going to repeat what I said at the outset, but I want to assure him that, as far as any help we can give to the farming community or to any other section of the people is concerned, if a proper approach is made by the Minister, then he is going to get every assistance and every co-operation.</P>
    <P>Now, we are told about advantages that would accrue from the parish scheme.  I am quite well aware that extra instructors in any county are a decided advantage.  I have always held that.  I incurred a certain amount of unpopularity on a few occasions at meetings of the county committee of agriculture by opposing subsidies for shows and asking that the money proposed to be expended in that way should be used instead for the appointment of extra agricultural instructors.</P>

In nine cases out of ten he will say to me, &ldquo;well, there is not much use in putting on phosphates or manures of that kind unless you put lime on your land, and unless you use either burned lime or ground limestone.&rdquo; When I ask him where I am to get it, he will tell me it is in such and such a place.  In County Galway, we cannot get ground limestone any nearer than in some part of Sligo, or perhaps in Lanesboro, and if we were to take that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister has not said anything about ground limestone plants in South Galway.  He has them in North Cork, Monaghan, Clare, Sligo and Leitrim.  What is he doing about County Galway?  There is a very strong young farmers' organisation there.  I believe they have put it up to his Department on a few occasions and I hope that he is considering the matter sympathetically.  As far as Ballinasloe is concerned, we have very fine types of limestone there.  It must be very excellent indeed when a man like Messrs.  Sisk of Cork would purchase <Col N="2200" /> the quarry, utilise the stone, dress it and send it all over the country. Of course, it is a very different matter for a man like Messrs.  Sisk and Son to go into the ground limestone business.  For the ordinary man it is another story.  I understand the plant is pretty costly.  Possibly a man like Messrs.  Sisk would go into it but the ordinary man could not unless he is assured of assistance.  Of course, I have only got this on hearsay.  I have never met Mr. Sisk.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to hear that.  Meat meal is one thing. Ground limestone is another.  I am not making a case for Ballinasloe any more than any other area in Galway. Galway is a pretty big county.  There is plenty of limestone in it and I hope some assistance will be given by way of loan or grant to enable an individual, or a group of individuals, to set a ground limestone industry going.  It is no use telling people to go to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  That is all right in its own way but the interest and the principal repayments are pretty high.  I know the people in Portumna had something in mind in that respect but, when they learned what the charges would be, they were very hesitant to proceed.</P>
      <P>With regard to manure, the Minister at one time vehemently criticised his predecessors because of the way in which they allowed that business to be carried on.  He went so far as to say that if he were in charge then the manure ring would be smashed.  I have not seen very much signs so far of its being smashed.  Manure has not come down very much in price.  I think some types have increased in price.</P>

Deputy McQuillan mentioned a sulphate of ammonia plant.  Other Deputies mentioned it as well when the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce was going through.  Possibly the Minister for Agriculture has nothing to do with it but, at the same time, a word to his colleague might not do any harm.</P>

      <P>It is not the opinion of the general bulk of the people.  The price of manure is almost prohibitive. Farmers cannot use it on a large scale because of the high cost.  Another factor which prevents the farmer utilising manure plentifully is the difficulty of its distribution.  I think the Minister should do something to provide manure distributors, either by importing them or by having them manufactured here.</P>

I have heard the Minister talk about cow-testing and the advantages of cow-testing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that. The Minister has advised farmers to do cow-testing.  I think that is a good idea in the milk producing areas but I cannot see what useful purpose it would serve in an area like mine where the people go in largely for the production of the store calf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You know that from Gort to the Clare border they have gone into dairying now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be delighted if it succeeds.  I wish the people every success and I hope it will prove useful and expand to its fullest extent.  I want to talk about this bogey of cow-testing now.  In a sheep producing and store cattle producing county, cow-testing is useless.  It is a waste of time and money.  We in County Galway were demanding the right to pay premiums on Hereford and Poll Angus bulls.  That is not an innovation since the Minister came into office, for that agitation has been there all the time. We cannot go beyond a certain breed, but the fact is that the people in my part of the country are all out for the Hereford.  People with Shorthorns and Friesians find them suitable for their purposes and they go all out for them.  I think therefore that it is unfair that we should not have freedom in this matter of giving premiums and a free choice as to the type of bull to which we would give the premiums &mdash; bulls suitable to the particular area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the black bull not suitable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume it would be suitable in certain parts but I know that in the south and east of Galway areas and parts of north Galway also the people are all out for the Hereford <Col N="2203" /> bull.  When the premium is not given in their case as well as in the case of Shorthorns there is a tendency that the bull owner will not go in for the best type of bull at the Dublin show or elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The only other matter on which I wish to say anything is that I am very disappointed with the Minister's policy. When a person can go out and make misleading statements, particularly a person who knows the true position, it is not good for anybody or for the country.  That is what the Minister has done in many matters concerning agriculture. I am also disappointed and dissatisfied with the Minister's general policy which, I hold, is a complete reversal of the policy of self-sufficiency adopted by Sinn Féin and a complete reversal of the policy which helped to tide the country over the difficult years between 1940 and 1945.  I would appeal in all seriousness to the Minister to return to that policy of self-sufficiency which has served the country so well. He should bury his pride and adopt that policy in the interests of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>One would believe, from the speeches made so far in the course of this debate, that the people of this country were complete strangers to each other.  Is it not a fact that we are all neighbours of each other and that any policy which pleases one should suit all of us?  This debate should have been on a higher level, but the ex-Minister for Agriculture is responsible for the mean, low tone to which it has decended.  He devoted most of his time to heaping ridicule and venom on his successor in office, finding nothing good in anything he has done or said.  The faked and false pessimism of Deputies Smith, Cogan and Corry was sickening for any man to have to listen to.  Their speeches were filled with nothing more than abuse and ranting without regard to what was the true position.  The fact is that the country is in very good trim. Our farmers are doing well and they have something to sell for which there is a demand and for which they get a good return.  There is, in fact, very little wrong with the whole situation. <Col N="2204" /> The fact of the matter is that there is plenty of work for all the people. Every man and woman able and willing to work can do so in this country and they will get in return reasonable wages.  There is the scheme for drainage going ahead successfully throughout the whole country and every man who is idle can be suitably employed on this great scheme if he has the will to work.  Is not that sound national policy?  I say that it is and that that work has brought us to the position where things are now being done for the country for which we have waited 30 years in the hope that somebody would start them off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have, on the other hand, fixed markets and freedom of operation for the farmers.  What more could the farmers want than fair prices, fixed markets and freedom to carry out their own destiny in their own way?  Is not that freedom a big factor with the farmers who for the last eight or ten years had compulsion piled on them in every aspect of their work?  Thank God the farmers have left those days of compulsion far behind them and we hope never to see their return.  We have heard all the whining and groaning about wheat, the international situation and purchases from abroad. Why have we no wheat at home?  I ask the Deputies on the Opposition Benches why the farmers are not growing wheat.  We have to-day the best prices that were ever paid for wheat in this country.  We have also the best types of seed wheat available and which the country could get; we have plenty of manures and fertilisers and there is no reason in the wide world why the farmers of the country cannot grow plenty of wheat and make a very good profit on it.  The Deputies opposite apparently want the Minister to force the farmers to grow wheat but that is not necessary since the inducement is already there if the farmers wish to avail of it and provided always that their land is suitable.  This is a free country and surely the farmers are as much entitled to their freedom as anyone else.  They are to-day free to grow wheat if they so desire and if their land is suitable and they can make good profit out of it.  I have grown plenty of wheat myself and I <Col N="2205" /> have found that it paid.  I would rather have wheat on my lands any time than have them stocked with white-headed bullocks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would not agree with you on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>If you give the farmers freedom to work their own lands as best suits them without regulations and inspections and give them the necessary seeds and fertilisers then we in this country will have all the wheat we need.  Compulsion has been tried and has failed not alone in this country but in Germany, Russia, Italy and several other countries.  The farmer is a practical individual and should have full freedom to use his own methods in his own way.  He has that freedom to-day and he is quite happy with the position and is making a good job of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one thing which made me very happy in the course of this debate and that was the vile, malicious, and mean attacks which have been levelled against the Minister for Agriculture throughout the discussion.  If he was doing a very bad job and if things were rotten in the country and daily going from bad to worse under his guidance the members of the Opposition would have been praising him for all their worth with a view to getting him to run into a muddle up to his neck and then be thrown out of power.  Instead, because he is doing a good job of work for the country, they are attacking him at every stage.  All I can say is more power to the Minister and more strength to continue on his line of policy which is putting the country on the right road and winning the day for the people of Ireland.  We heard a lot of talk about policies and the work of the Government.  The good farmer knows his job and if left to it he can get on with it.  He knows what crops suit his land and grows them accordingly, treating the land in such a way that in a matter of only a few months he can change over to whatever crop or system of farming suits the needs of the occasion.  That is the essence of good husbandry and it is because there are thousands of men of this type in the country that there are so many <Col N="2206" /> homesteads standing for hundreds of years which have passed from father to son and are managed and controlled by men who were bred in the soil.  That is what one calls sound economy.  It is because that is a situation to-day that I am satisfied that there is no need for compulsion and that a price inducement is sufficient to get the farmers to produce the things the country needs at the right time.  All the Minister should have to do in the promotion of agriculture is to try and find good markets for the farmers' produce where he can and put them before the farmer, leaving him to run his land and to adapt it to the needs of the markets available.  That is what our Minister has done and I, for one, can see nothing wrong with that.  I am satisfied that he is a man of dynamic personality, strength of character, and great ability and that he is doing a good job of work efficiently and with the interests of the farmer and the country foremost in his mind.  With a man of that type holding the destinies of the Irish farmer the future is assured.  He is the type of man for whom the farmers of the country have been waiting to lead them for many years.</P>
    <P>We have seen over the last two years an upward trend in everything &mdash; cattle, sheep, poultry, eggs, butter and other products.  Everything in the farmer's line is on the upward grade and the farmers know that right well.  All they have got to do is to consult the monthly figures for confirmation of that.  I would ask the ex-Minister for Agriculture to be man enough and to be big enough to forget he was Minister at one time, to be big enough to admit that he made plenty of mistakes and that the line he was taking was a false line &mdash; the line of using compulsion against the farmers and trying to shove down their necks that his policy was right.  The change in policy has brought new life to the farmers. Listening to the ex-Minister, one would think he had spent all his life behind the plough and attending to his farm. I do not know why that class of nonsense should be tried on here.  I do not live very far from the ex-Minister and I want to tell him that he did not care two hoots about the sow or the plough, that he spent most of his time <Col N="2207" /> at fairs, &ldquo;tangling&rdquo; a few cattle. Deputy Smith was, what we call in the country, a jobber.  No one could blame him if he found that was more profitable than working on the farm but I want him to cut out all this nonsense about his being a practical farmer.  We know well that he was trying to make money in the quickest and handiest way he could and he found that was the handiest way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all satisfied that agriculture is our life line and that we must try to formulate the best long term policy for it.  If we can keep agriculture on a stable line, I am satisfied that we can carry this country through any emergency and our farmers will be able to supply the nation's need in times of crisis.  There need never be compulsion in agricultural matters in this country unless in times of crisis.  Then, of course, it would be quite in order.  If the nation thinks that compulsion is needed in times of crisis, then the Government can bring it in and the farmers will accept it as men.  What we do not want in this country is sudden changes in agricultural policy.</P>
      <P>There should be a fixed policy for agriculture which would suit Fianna Fáil as well as every other Party in the country.  If there is a fixed policy, the farmers can operate that for themselves if they are left alone.  They will do on their land what they think best for themselves and their families. What is best for the farmer on his land is, in the long run, best for the country and he should be left alone to pursue his own ideas.  I believe the Minister is on right lines in putting all the expert advice he can at the disposal of the farmers and then leaving them alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that all this whining to the effect that the farmers are down and out is mean, low and un-Irish.  Our farmers are not down and out.  They were never down and out, even in the midst of the economic war.  It is true that they were up to their necks in trouble but they stuck it out and, when <Col N="2208" /> times improved, they rehabilitated themselves.  They are now in the happy position that they have emerged from the many wrongs inflicted on them in these years.  The farmer who has a fairly good holding can always stick it out&mdash;I mean the real farmer.  I do not mean the &ldquo;fly-by-night&rdquo; who wants to come in on the good things and who, when the tide turns, gets out and leaves some other poor devil to bear the burden.  I am talking of balanced farmers.  I agree that the methods of husbandry practised by some small far mers require to be put on a proper basis.  These farmers are too small and uneconomic to have a balanced type of agriculture.  I would ask the Minister to do everything possible to put into operation a co-operative system whereby five or six small farmers, who have very little hope of being anything but uneconomic if left to their own devices, could get together under the auspices of Muintir na Tíre or some other organisation of that kind, and obtain up-to-date machinery under the hire purchase system or under loans obtained on long term conditions. I think in that way we could almost double production on these farms.  If we could double production&mdash;I admit it would be hard to attain it&mdash;we could solve almost all the ills confronting this country.  We would be able to carry on our backs the old, the aged, the infirm, the blind and the destitute.  The trouble at present is that we have not got the production of which our land is capable.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to hear the Minister state that he proposes to start a scheme of national granaries which will be available for the storage of supplies for times of emergency.  These granaries should have been erected 20 or 25 years ago because the nation that does not provide such granaries for lean times is not making proper provision for emergencies.  I hope that the Minister will see that there is sufficient of these granaries to provide storage space for a reserve of grain for this country for at least 12 or 18 months.  If we have such a reserve we shall be in a position to stand up almost to any emergency.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter which I <Col N="2209" /> wish to mention but I am not sure whether it comes under the Vote for Agriculture.  That is, the National Stud.  Perhaps the Chair would be able to guide me on that matter.</P>

      <P>In my county there is a number of progressive horse breeders who have been for generations engaged in this business and who have done splendid work in giving employment and in producing some fine types of racehorses and other types of horses.  There is grave uneasiness amongst these people at the action of the Government in entering into competition with them.  There is a horse at that stud at the moment called Royal Charger, which cost £52,000, and these people hold that that horse should be held for cheap service for the people of this country.  Instead of that, he is allowed to go into open competition with the horses of these breeders and they are being squeezed out.  That is using the taxpayers' money to beat down the small horse breeders and it is most unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On top of that, I think it is a shame that we, the Irish people, who have produced some of the best horses and also some of the best horsemen in the world have had to take a foreigner <Col N="2210" /> into our National Stud.  Now that we have the management of our own affairs, I think that the men in charge of the National Stud should be Irishmen, that it should be worked in the interests of Ireland and that we should not use the taxpayers' money to oust the small horse breeders in this country.  I hope that the Minister will take note of that.  It is a matter that is a burning question in the Midlands, especially in my county, where there has been a splendid tradition of horse breeding and where there is a fine type of horse breeder who has laid the foundation of racing and hunting in this country.  I move to report progress.</P>
