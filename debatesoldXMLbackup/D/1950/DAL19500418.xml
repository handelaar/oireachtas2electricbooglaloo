      <P>Particulars of the value of home production of clay sewerage goods are not available.  The only information available bearing on the subject of the Deputy's inquiry relates to pipes and connections of fireclay, the value of home production of which amounted to £47,161 in 1948. The corresponding figure for 1949 is not yet available.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will state whether the Commission on Emigration is still meeting, when he expects to receive a report from it, and whether such report will be made available to Deputies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the commission that it is still meeting regularly. As to when its report will be received I have nothing to add to the reply given by me to a question by Deputy Lemass on 15th February, 1950.  While no decision has yet been made with regard to the availability of the report, I presume that the usual practice in such matters will be followed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that it is almost two years since the commission was set up, would the Minister consider asking the commission for an interim report, or would that be practicable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put this consideration to the Deputy: I and every member of the commission are most anxious that its deliberations should be brought to a conclusion at the earliest possible opportunity.  The commission is engaged in examining some problems which have never previously been examined, namely, the problem of population and the question of the formulation of a solution for the emigration problem.  The question of emigration is being examined in detail and as to the way in which it is related to other problems.  The commission is a commission of distinguished citizens of high attainments in their respective spheres.  They are working for the nation and are giving their services to the commission without fee or reward.  Every one of them who attends meetings of the commission is making considerable personal sacrifices.  I feel, therefore, that the investigation aspect of the matter is in very competent hands, and I am satisfied from discussions with the chairman of the commission that each member of the commission is anxious to conclude its investigations as soon as <Col N="477" /> possible and to furnish me with a report as expeditiously as it is possible to do so.  I have had discussions with the chairman of the commission in recent weeks and I am satisfied that he is endeavouring to finish the deliberation aspects of the commission's work within the next month or two and that then the commission will proceed to complete its report.  Some portions of it have been already written. I think in view of these considerations that it would probably be unwise and, in the long run, it would be fruitless to ask at this stage for an interim report, seeing that, by all accounts, we are not very far from getting a complete report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his attention has been drawn to advertisements appearing in the Irish daily newspapers specially drawn up for the purpose of encouraging the emigration of young Irish girls to Britain as student nurses; and whether, in view of the dishonest nature of many of these advertisements, he will cause the Government to take such steps are are necessary to prohibit their continued publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen in Irish newspapers advertisements inviting Irish girls to enter the nursing profession in British hospitals but I have no information that these advertisements, or any of them, are of a dishonest nature.  As the Deputy is, no doubt, aware, there is no power enabling the Government to authorise or provide for the control and censorship of newspapers. I do not propose to recommend that such power be sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of the 30th March last there appears an advertisement under the heading &ldquo;More Student Nurses Wanted&rdquo;; that from the text of the matter it is obviously intended only for this country, that it is specifically addressed to Irish girls and that it contains the admonition at the bottom of the advertisement in heavy type &ldquo;address <Col N="478" /> your application to the nearest labour exchange&rdquo;?  In view of the fact that the positions which are offered to these girls over there are merely those of probationary nurses, from which they are dismissed after a period of two years, and in view of the fact that they are not real openings for these girls, would the Minister not consider taking some steps to put an end to the practice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say to the Deputy is, firstly, that I have no power nor has the Government any power, to exercise the censorship over newspapers which he apparently desires, nor do I think it desirable that either I or the Government should have power in that matter.  So far as the recruitment of staff in Britain is concerned, there are no restrictions at present on women going to Britain to take up employment, nor do I think that the circumstances, so far as they have been revealed by the Deputy's question, would justify the taking of any such special powers to prevent such persons taking up employment in Britain.  I do not want at this stage to give approbation to or to engage in any condemnation of the advertisement which appeared in the paper.  People of intelligence can sift these advertisements and ascertain for themselves what the conditions of employment are, and make up their minds whether it is worth while taking up this employment.  I understand that many of those who go over are trained as nurses without fee, without premium, and with remuneration from the outset, and I think that the way in which this problem can be best combated is for some of our Irish institutions to advertise similar employment under similar conditions, and so keep our young people at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister has taken the point I put to him.  Is he aware that the advertisement carries at its foot an admonition to apply to the nearest labour exchange?  Are we to understand from the Minister's reply that our labour exchanges are being used as recruiting agencies for the British nursing services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="479" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Our labour exchanges are not being and will not be used as recruiting agencies for persons desiring to go to Great Britain.  I see no objection to our labour exchanges being used for the purpose of making sure that any persons who want to go to Great Britain to take up employment there will go with their eyes wide open.  Our labour exchanges will be utilised to make sure that the employment given them will be of a kind which our labour exchanges, having sifted the evidence, can recommend to them.  If they go to the employment exchanges it is because it is desired to make sure that they have whatever benefits and protection the exchanges can provide for them in seeking employment elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether he is aware that tidal waters have burst the river banks at Rossmanagher, Sixmilebridge, leaving many holdings permanently under water; and if he will indicate what steps he proposes taking to have the breach repaired.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission are not liable for the repair or maintenance of the river embankments at Rossmanagher, but in view of the extent of the flooding, they are considering the question of repairing the breach.  However, the tenants appear to be reluctant to shoulder their responsibilities and until agreement can be reached as to the contribution the tenants are prepared to make, the Land Commission cannot decide on the matter.  Steps have already been taken to have materials available so that the <Col N="494" /> work can be put in hands without delay if agreement is reached and if the Land Commission decide to repair the breach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that of the three trustees who had been appointed to administer the funds, two have died, leaving only one?  In view of that, will the Minister take steps to see that the vacancies are filled so as to have proper care taken of these funds?  Is the Minister further aware that last year the sum of £70 from these funds was made available to the Land Commission, that an officer of the Department inspected the banks and decided that they were sound enough?  No steps were taken, with the result that this breach has now occurred which will cost approximately £5,000 to repair, a burden which the tenants cannot undertake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The appointment of the two trustees will be taken up without delay, and the two vacancies filled.  It is quite true that there was an inspection of the breach that occurred.  I am informed that it was due to exceedingly rough weather and to high tides&mdash;that that was the cause of it. The Land Commission have already taken certain steps in case they should decide to do repairs if the tenants whose lands are being flooded will make a contribution.  I understand that the contribution which is being asked of them is a reasonable one.  The tenants themselves are reluctant to shoulder the responsibility. I think the Deputy would be doing a good job of work if he were to induce the tenants to meet the Land Commission without delay before the breach gets any worse, which is likely to happen if we have storms and high tides in the future.</P>

      <P>I cannot agree that the broadcasting of the news in Irish in three dialects is equivalent to recognition of dialects in the sense of a preference for extreme dialectal differences. The news in Irish is intended primarily for Gaeltacht listeners and it must, therefore, be given in one or other of the three main dialects. Listeners in other areas would have reasonable cause for complaint if the broadcasts were always made in the dialect of a particular Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>The very complex question of the standardisation of Irish is not one proper to my Department.  I might say, however, that no exaggeration of dialects is practised in the Irish news and the people who prepare the bulletins do their best to achieve some measure of standardisation in terminology.</P>

      <P>The financial return to the Exchequer from capital expenditure may accrue either directly, when the projects are themselves of a profit-earning character, or indirectly, when they increase the national income and so augment the yield of taxation. Capital expenditure, such as that on schools and other State buildings, which adds to the national property and saves current outlay on rent, may properly be regarded as remunerative.

A further justification for regarding these items as <Col N="502" /> proper to be met from borrowing is that the present scale of expenditure is abnormal owing to the slowing up of building during the emergency.  The charging of these items to borrowing is intended to secure a more even distribution of the cost.

      <P>I would remind the Deputy that the income-tax allowance to a widower in respect of a female relative or other female person resident with him for the purpose of looking after his children was increased last year from £45 to £100.  There is no allowance to a widower in respect of a female relative acting as his housekeeper and not having the charge and care of children.  Any change in allowances under the income-tax code would, of course, call for Finance Bill legislation.  All relevant matters will be considered in connection with the Bill, but the Deputy will understand that I cannot indicate at this stage what provisions it may or may not contain.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that, in the usual cases of transfer of lands from father to son where an annuity with the usual rights of residence and support are reserved to the father, the Revenue Commissioners, under the provisions of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947, capitalise the annuity at 12 years' purchase and charge duty at 5 per cent. on such capitalised sum, and whether he will introduce proposals for legislation so to amend the law that the rate in such cases will be reduced to 1 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first part of the question, the Deputy appears to be under a misapprehension.</P>
      <P>Where land is transferred from father to son and an annuity is reserved to the father, the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;subject to what I shall say in a moment&mdash;treat the instrument as a voluntary disposition coming within sub-section (6) (b), of Section 13 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947, and so falling outside the scope of the £5 per cent. rate.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners deal with the instrument in this manner unless they are of opinion that, by reason of the adequacy of the consideration, the transfer does not confer what the law calls a &ldquo;substantial benefit&rdquo; on the son.</P>
      <P>In arriving at the consideration, regard must be had to Section 56 (3) of the Stamp Act, 1891.  Section 56 (3) of the Stamp Act, 1891, provides broadly that, where the consideration for a conveyance consists wholly or partly of money payable periodically during any life or lives, the consideration is to be computed by reference to the amount of money which may be payable during the 12 years next after the date of the instrument.</P>
      <P>If no substantial disparity exists between the value of the land on the one hand and, on the other, the consideration passing, the Revenue Commissioners naturally cannot accept that the transfer is in the nature of a voluntary disposition, and so the higher rate of duty must apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="517" /> In view of what I have stated, the second part of the question does not arise.</P>

    <P>I should point out, however, that these figures are not strictly comparable, for the reason that in 1938-39 there was no expenditure on bog development schemes (for emergency production) or on the rural improvements scheme.  In 1938-39, virtually the whole of the expenditure was on minor employment schemes.  The expenditure on road works under minor employment schemes in 1947-48 was £81,000; 1948-49&mdash;£74,000; and in 1949-50&mdash;£78,000.</P>

      <P>These figures do not include men engaged on the farm improvements scheme, as works under that scheme are executed by the farmers themselves or by their own employees.</P>
      <P>The significant decline in the numbers employed is due to three main causes:&mdash;</P>

      <P>(ii)  wages and the cost of materials have been more than doubled in the intervening period;</P>

      <P>The Finian river is not shown on the ordnance sheets, but apparently the proposal referred to is for the cleaning of portion of a stream which flows from near Coolderry crossroads to near Kilcolman Cross.  An application for the reconditioning of this section of stream was considered under the rural improvements scheme in 1948, when the applicants were informed that, owing to the danger of flooding downstream, the work could not be undertaken unless the landholders along a further section from Millbrook Bridge to Whiteford Mill would join in the application.  No reply was received to this suggestion, but if the landholders concerned wish to reopen the matter by submitting a fresh application under the rural improvements scheme, covering the whole stream from Millbrook Bridge to Coolderry crossroads, it will receive consideration.</P>

      <P>Apart from cases of a special kind, I have no responsibility for the provision or improvement of minor marine works, but I am prepared to allocate a limited number of grants from the Employment and Emergency Schemes Vote for approved works which form suitable subjects for the relief of unemployment.</P>
      <P>For many years past, the conditions attached to grants for this purpose have been as follows: (1) that the expenditure is justified by the unemployment position in the area; (2) that the execution of the work is certified as necessary or desirable by the Department concerned with fishery and agricultural requirements; (3) that the council of the county concerned contribute 25 per cent. of the cost of the works and undertake to maintain them on completion.</P>
      <P>In February, 1950, the Kerry County Council notified my office that in future they would accept no liability for piers or slipways which are not alrealy their property.  This decision limits considerably the number of marine works in the county eligible for consideration as schemes for the relief of unemployment.</P>

      <P>It is obvious that it would not be in the public interest to have unrestricted building development in close proximity to Dublin Airport. It would be unsatisfactory to allow building of a nature or extent that would create undue hazards for aircraft landing and taking off from the airport in bad weather.</P>
      <P>Arrangements were, accordingly, made by my Department with the local authority concerned some years ago that any applications received by the town planning officer for permission to build in any place within two and a half miles of Collinstown would be referred to the Department for observations from the aeronautical point of view.</P>
      <P>Any proposals that are made for the erection of buildings within the two and a half miles radius are considered as sympathetically as possible, having due regard to the aeronautical considerations involved; much depends on the nature of the building proposed, its height and its precise location in relation to the runways of the airport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Cosgrave)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of the Bill is to confirm an Order made by the Government on the 23rd August, 1949, increasing the minimum rates of duty on wallpaper with effect from the 26th August, 1949. The duties in operation prior to the latter date were introduced in 1939 following a review by the Prices Commission and were as follows: full, 20 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> or 1½d. per linear yard; preferential, 10 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> or 1d. the linear yard, whichever was the greater in each particular case.  In common with all other commodities, the prices of wallpapers have risen steeply since 1939 and the minimum rates, which in this particular duty are the operative rates, had lost most of their protective value with the result that the home industry was suffering severe competition from imports. It was, accordingly, decided to increase the minimum rates of duties per linear yard from 1½d. (full) and 1d. (preferential&mdash;United Kingdom and Canada) to 3¾d. and 2½d. respectively. There is a separate revenue duty of 5 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> on wallpaper which is, of course, additional to the protective duties I have already mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="537" /> The manufacture of wallpaper is carried on at present in Kildare and Bray and gives rise to appreciable direct employment in these two areas. In addition, the manufacture of wallpaper provides a market for paper produced by the Irish paper-making industry. Wall and ceiling papers are items for which there will always be a steady demand and I think that Deputies will agree that it is in the national interest that production of these items should be encouraged as much as possible.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Act, 1932, the Order covered by the Bill expires on the 22nd April, 1950, unless previously confirmed by Act of the Oireachtas.  I should say that the delay in bringing in this measure is due to negotiations which took place with other parties.  Those negotiations took a considerable time and consequently it was not possible to introduce the Bill before the Recess, and I would be glad if the Dáil would agree to deal with the matter as one of urgency.</P>

      <P>In connection with the imposition of these duties there are two matters which I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to clear up. <Col N="538" /> I understand that following on the increase in the duty the manufacturers of wallpapers here laid down certain conditions regarding supplies. These conditions had the result of securing certain average prices in relation to the numbers of orders that might be made and the manufacturers were not prepared to make supplies available to retailers if the average prices fell below a certain figure.  One of the results would be of course practically to eliminate the small retailers.</P>

      <P>With regard to the importation of wallpaper, would the Parliamentary Secretary say that his Department is satisfied that there is no evasion of the protective value of the imposition of duties as far as Irish manufacturers are concerned by reason of secret rebates and commissions? This matter has been drawn to the attention of the Department before.  This is a very serious matter insofar as by means of these various arrangements it is possible to import wallpaper and evade the full effect of the duty, and this has a very detrimental effect with regard to the manufacturers of Irish wallpapers.  Is he satisfied that that is being covered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any complaints such as the Deputy mentioned. As the Deputy is aware, this is a complicated duty in so far as there are very great varieties in wallpapers and it is difficult to operate so as to give adequate protection.  We have no information of secret rebates, and I imagine it would be very difficult to get information.  It is the experience recently that the quality and variety have improved considerably and the home manufacturers produced recently new books which show a considerable improvement in comparison with anything produced before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the difficulties is that the paper base which the manufacturers purchase is dearer than the base which their competitors purchase in England and that is an initial disadvantage.  If the Deputy has any particulars which would enable these matters to be investigated <Col N="539" /> we would be very glad to have them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the adjournment of the debate on this Bill when it was last before the House for consideration I was dealing with the suggestion made by Deputy MacEntee that the Clann na Poblachta and Labour Party Deputies were open to a charge of illogicality in supporting this Bill, inasmuch as they had some two or three years ago publicly approved of the Most Rev. Dr. Dignan's proposals for raising and extending the level and scope of the existing benefits available to the sick, aged, unemployed, blind, widows and orphans, and other necessitous sections of the community.  The approval that was expressed was an approval of the proposals to raise, extend and amplify existing benefits or confer additional benefits.  That approval was not concerned with what one might call the machinery of administration, but with the good intent to which the Most Rev. Dr. Dignan so nobly and in such a public-spirited way gave expression. It is because this measure is a necessary preliminary to the giving of effect to that good intention that we support the Second Reading of the Bill.  If it is not proposed in the White Paper to provide national health and other social services on as widespread a scale as was envisaged by the Most Rev. Dr. Dignan, that is a matter which we in Clann na Poblachta regret.  But at least we recognise that the White Paper proposals, for the implementation of which this Bill is the necessary preliminary, are a substantial step in the right direction, and I think to accuse us of illogicality <Col N="540" /> because we support the Bill is in itself so demonstrably illogical as scarcely to need refutation.</P>
      <P>After reading and listening to Deputy MacEntee over what is now quite a considerable period, I have discovered that the ideal method of answer to the Deputy is simply to requote him in quiet, sober and restraint tones and let the lack of restraint which Deputy MacEntee evinces and the irresponsible immoderation which he displays in his language refute themselves.  A Deputy who was capable of making the statement made by Deputy MacEntee in a speech in this House on the 29th March last&mdash;I quote from the Official Report, Volume 120, column 248&mdash; requires, in my submission, no answer. He said of this Bill:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If this Bill represents anything it represents a slap in the face, if one might so describe it, to a member of the Hierarchy who had almost been elected as a patron saint by the members of the political Parties now forming the Government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Ignoring completely the impropriety and the gross discourtesy implicit in the scandalous suggestion that a member of the Hierarchy would permit himself, in the elegant phrase so typical of this particular Deputy, to be elected as a patron saint by any political Party, is it not obvious that the man who brings that immoderate mental temper to bear on any question is unworthy of being answered by reasoned criticism?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not surprised, but I always believe in hoping for the best and my hopes have always been dashed to the ground.  Questions were posed by, I think, Deputy Derrig, Deputy Dr. Ryan and Deputy Lynch which, in my submission, do not present any insuperable difficulty in answering.  These points merit, at any rate, an answer and reasoned consideration because they were reasonably and sanely put.  But whatever degree of reasonableness there was in Deputy MacEntee's contribution to this debate was completely vitiated by the irresponsible <Col N="541" /> attitude of unbridled vituperativeness in which his observations were set.  I do not want to weary the House with quotations from what he said, but before coming to the House I did waste an hour this morning rereading Deputy MacEntee and I should like to refer the House to one or two particular gems of Deputy MacEntee at his best or at his worst, according to the point of view.  Again, as reported in column 248, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Bill is an interesting example of the unprincipled political somersaults to which the various Parties in the Coalition have made us accustomed.  Public life under them has degenerated to the level of the circus arena.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Coming from the &ldquo;white elephantine&rdquo; Deputy MacEntee, that is particularly rich.</P>
      <P>Again, as reported in column 249, he inferred that the Most Rev. Dr. Dignan had allowed himself to be used&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;as a political weapon in order to try to damage the Government of the day&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;a pretty type of statement to come from the principal red herring heresy-hunter in the benches opposite. Further on, as reported in column 252, he overlooked the fact that the Tánaiste's memory is a little longer, or at least as long, as his own, and accused the Tánaiste, who is in charge of the Bill, of having voted against the setting up of the Department of Social Welfare in the first instance, a statement which he had to withdraw on the following day.  Later on&mdash;I quote from column 357&mdash;he said that the reason for the Bill was that the Government was nearly bankrupt.  Further, as reported in column 364, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Bill is an instance of a Government Department which goes and robs the National Health Insurance Fund.  Why all the urgency for the Bill except to conceal that fact?  The Government is so hard driven to meet its commitments that it rushes in this Bill in this form.  This is what you might describe as a smash-and-grab raid.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="542" /> That is reasoned, constructive and sensible criticism from a gentleman who for many years had ministerial responsibility.  Again, at column 365, Deputy MacEntee is warming to his subject and he&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;doubts seriously if the Bill is not repugnant to the Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In passing, I do not think I can be blamed if I make the comment that there are some of the much-maligned lawyer Deputies on this side of the House who taught the Deputy and some of his colleagues a little bit about Bills which were repugnant to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I do not want to multiply these examples, but I have a particular reason for quoting them and refreshing the memory of the House on them.  I am not going to go through the whole gamut from his statement where he dragged in Satan and Beelzebub by the hair or the horns of the head down to the final discovery that the Bill was&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the thin end of the wedge being inserted in a general all-out drive by the Government to confiscate all private property.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>The interesting thing about these statements is that they were made by Deputy MacEntee, a colleague of Deputy Dr. Ryan, who summed up his attitude to this Bill by saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I think everybody in the House will approve of the Bill in principle, but there are certain aspects of it on which we must at least get more information.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely we on this side of the House are entitled to ask, which is the authentic voice of the Party opposite?  Deputies opposite considered that this Bill gave them an opportunity of orchestrating a new movement in the Store Street symphony.  I do not blame them for that.  They are perfectly entitled to do that.  Following on that, however, we are told that Fianna Fáil had a plan to spend something in the region of £11,500,000 on office accommodation for the Civil Service and that, until <Col N="543" /> such time as that plan is restored to its priority pigeon-hole, no alteration should be made in the office accommodation for the Department of Social Welfare.  That is the effect of the arguments advanced by the Opposition. I do not know what particular spurs that particular gamecock is supposed to wear, but it is a gamecock that will not fight.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera interjected some observation, the exact wording of which I have not got at the moment, with reference to this proposed expenditure on Government offices.  Let me say to Deputy de Valera that we are not one bit ashamed on the Government Benches of having given priority to housing the people in the slums and to the provision of proper accommodation for them over and above the provision of sumptuous offices for Civil Service departments. Many of the arguments to which we were treated, particularly those coming from Deputy MacEntee and some of his colleagues, were trotted out with a very definite purpose in view. The idea was to confuse the issue, and make this Bill appear to be something other than what it really is.  I suggest that the Minister correctly described this Bill when he said it was a Bill to clear the way for the implementation of the wider social security scheme. The Bill proposes to achieve that purpose by absorbing into the Department of Social Welfare the staff of the present National Health Insurance Society.  Under the provisions of the Bill the machinery and personnel which heretofore administered national health schemes will be brought under the direct control of the Minister for Social Welfare.  To my mind that is the only principle in issue.  One either subscribes to the view that it is both wise and desirable that control should be so unified or one takes the contrary view, and is thereupon entitled to oppose the Bill on that particular ground.</P>
    <P>Some of the criticisms advanced on Section 7, Section 20 and Section 21 appear to me to have some degree of validity.  Be they as well founded as one would wish, however, they yet give no excuse for opposing the Bill <Col N="544" /> since all such criticisms relate to matters that can more easily and properly be dealt with on the Committee Stage.  It might be no harm at this stage, however, to take time by the forelock and give the Minister some idea of matters with which he may find it necessary to deal on the Committee Stage of this measure.  It seems to me that sub-section (2) of Section 20 requires some greater degree of justification than has so far been vouchsafed to the House.  It appears to me to go exceptionally far, and I do not think that the safeguard in the succeeding sub-section is as adequate as it might be.  If the Minister wishes to retain sub-section (2) he will have to make a more special case for it than he has made up to this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a well beaten track.  Sub-section (2) of Section 20 is a well beaten track over which this House has walked for more than 25 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be dogmatic because I cannot give the exact reference, but I have the impression that the Minister did direct the attention of the House when he was in opposition to the dangers of that track.  I do not want to be unduly critical, but I think he will have to advance fairly cogent and forceful reasons to the House for the retention of this sub-section.  I do not agree that the safeguard in sub-section (3) is a real safeguard.  Theoretically it may appear to be so, but for all practical purposes it is useless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to Section 21, I think the House is entitled to some explanation of sub-section (8).  If negotiations have taken place in connection with the acquisition of the Store Street premises, or any other premises, and if a preliminary contract has been entered into or a preliminary agreement initiated I think that both the <Col N="545" /> Government and the Minister should have been more open with the House. I do not want the Minister to take this as barbed or pointed criticism.  I think it is no harm that these things should be said.  Any anticipation there has been of the approval of this House in the case of the Store Street premises would not trouble me <i>per se</i>, but I think it is a bad headline to rely on the insertion of what appears to be superficially an innocuous little sub-section like sub-section (8) in order to achieve what it is hoped it will achieve. I submit, however, that the Minister should not come to the House for <i>ex post facto</i> approval of a decision taken on a matter which, rightly or wrongly, has occasioned considerable political controversy and widespread public interest.  That is by way of general observation.  I do not think the Minister will take the observation amiss since I am dealing only with the general principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that it has not the meaning the Deputy has given to it?  Sub-section (8) can more properly be read in connection with sub-section (7).  However, I shall deal with it on the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only deal with it as I find it, and there is nothing in the sub-section at the moment which relates it merely to sub-section (7).  It refers to the whole of Section 21.  Possibly it is a matter of draftsmanship, but I think it would be unfair to the Minister if I did not indicate to him that some of us have considerable difficulty with Section 7 in so far as it falls short of giving to those hitherto employed in the National Health Insurance Society that statutory protection to which they are entitled.  I understand that the Minister has given his personal assurance that so far as he is concerned he will see to it that the position of the employees in relation to remuneration and superannuation will not be worsened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the employees accept that assurance in the spirit in which it was given.  However, they feel, and I can sympathise with their view, that they are entitled to have statutory force given to the Minister's assurance and that Section 7 should be amended so <Col N="546" /> that their rights could be written into the section.  I would ask the Minister to be particularly patient and tolerant of this criticism.  I think it is an important matter and one deserving of very full consideration by him.  There is far more involved in this than the interests of the officials concerned. That is one aspect of it, and no doubt it is a very important aspect of it, but there is a more urgent reason than that why the Minister should solve the problems which Section 7 in its present form raises.  I would suggest to the Minister that the reason I adduce is an urgent one.  The success or failure of the social welfare scheme, particularly in its initial stages, will be influenced to a very great extent by the smoothness with which the administrative machine works, by the judgment and the discretion and the tact displayed by those responsible for its operation, and by the confidence which they will be able to awaken both in workers and in employers.  My submission is that if we are to have that smoothness of administration, if we are to have that tact and sensibility and judgment displayed by the staff in dealing with the public&mdash;by the administrative personnel in their administration of the scheme&mdash;then what I ask for is essential to the proper working of the scheme.  Does the Minister believe that if he has a discontented staff or if even a section of his staff is disgruntled, feeling that they have been badly treated, feeling that they have a grievance about salary, status or conditions of employment, it will augur well for the future of the scheme?  After all, if any substantial number of these people are labouring under that sense of grievance it will be impossible to achieve with this, for us, new and novel departure the things we want to achieve.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting for a minute that the problem facing the Minister in respect of Section 7 is an easy one. I do not think it is.  However, I do not think it is a problem that will defeat his ingenuity.  The Minister can always display considerable ingenuity when ingenuity is necessary.  I would suggest to him that Section 7 should contain a guarantee to the staff which is to be transferred to or absorbed in <Col N="547" /> the Department of Social Welfare that the situations offered to them will be offered to them in grades of the Civil Service at least as favourable, having regard to status and salary, as the grades which they held in the service of the National Health Insurance Society.  I do not believe that that should present an insuperable difficulty to the Minister.  I do not conceive it to be part of my function to suggest to him what the comparable grades are. He is in a better position to know that than I am.  From some inquiries which I have made, it would appear that the grades in the National Health Insurance Society have their corresponding grades in the general body of the Civil Service.  I understand that the junior clerical grade in the society corresponds almost exactly, in so far as salary and conditions are concerned, with the writing assistant grade in the general service.  I understand that what is described as the clerical grade in the society corresponds with the clerical grade on the married scale, scale B, in the general service.  I understand that the supervisory clerical grade corresponds with the general service minor staff officer grade.</P>
    <P>Again, I think that comparison must be made between the male supervisory clerical officer in the society and the married minor staff officer, scale B, in the Civil Service.  I understand that the deputy staff officer grade corresponds roughly with the junior executive officer grade in the Civil Service and that the staff officer of the society is on almost comparable salary terms with the higher executive officer in the general service.  I do not think any real problem is presented to the Minister in that aspect.  I would suggest either that he accept an amendment, or bring in an amendment himself, to Section 7, making it possible to correlate these grades&mdash;guaranteeing to officers and employees of the society a grade at least as favourable, having regard to status and salary, as that which the officer held in the society's service, taking into account years of service and so forth.</P>
    <P>The big problem, under Section 7, which the Minister will have to face is that created by the outdoor agents. <Col N="548" /> Inasmuch as they are the least well paid of all the employees in the service of the society, I would urge very strongly on the Minister that in dealing with them he will ensure that at any rate their conditions are not worsened either as to status or salary.  I think the House would be anxious to see, certainly Deputies who have any idea of the salaries which are paid to many of these men&mdash;I speak of the established men&mdash;not alone that we had an assurance that their conditions would not be worsened but that their salaries would be improved.  In many instances the salaries received by them are not sufficient to enable married men to maintain a wife and family.  If the Minister realises that there is more at stake in Section 7 and in the observations which I have made concerning it &mdash;and which I think were made by other Deputies, for instance, Deputy Lynch&mdash;than purely the employees' end of it, if he realises that there are other considerations involved, for instance, the smooth working of this scheme, he will agree that it is necessary to bring in some amendment which will give statutory effect to the assurances which he has given to these employees and which will ensure that this Bill will provide efficient machinery which will enable the social welfare scheme to be effectively, properly and smoothly administered.</P>

I must say that I see an amount of justification for the criticism that Deputy MacEntee levelled at this Bill in connection with the transfer of the fund. It is a very serious thing, in my opinion, to interfere with the funds of any company and especially to do anything with such funds which may not be in accordance with the wishes or the anticipations of the contributors to the fund.</P>

      <P>I am sure that if the contributors to this fund were consulted they would not be in favour of the purchase of the Store Street building for the Department of Social Welfare.  I imagine that the money for the purchase of that building should be got out of the Exchequer and that there should be no interference with the fund in question.  I think it is a matter of principle to try, so far as possible, to give effect to the wishes of the contributors to any fund of the kind.</P>

It is problematical, in fact I would say it is hardly likely, whether those who contributed to this fund will derive any benefit from the investment of portion of the fund in the building I have referred to, or that the Minister is justified in doing it, especially having regard to the circumstances surrounding the taking over of the building.</P>

      <P>The question is, in spite of the transfer that is going to take place, what will be the benefit in <Col N="550" /> the long run to the contributors to the scheme?  Are national health benefits going to be raised for those who are taking part in the scheme?  I think that is a question with which people down the country would be more concerned than anything else.  Are they going to get any additional benefits from this measure when it is passed into law?  The Minister has not told us.  The Minister has not told us even what the present state of the fund is, so far as I know.  I think at this stage it would be helpful if he would give the House that information.  The Minister, under this measure, is taking over the duties and functions of the National Health Insurance Society&mdash; Cumann an Árachais Náisiúnta ar Shláinte.  I think it is appropriate at this stage to say that the gratitude of the House and the country should be extended to those who carried on the work for a number of years without fee or reward, as far as I know.  I think it must be said they have done their work well as the National Health Insurance Society.  No doubt, they had many difficulties to grapple with, and they have left a very solvent concern behind them for the Minister to take over.</P>

As I said, they did it without any compensation or reward whatsoever, and they have, I repeat, left a solvent concern behind them.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made by Deputy C. Lehane to the outdoor agents.

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill in a general way has my support.  I believe it is an essential, a necessary step <Col N="553" /> towards the comprehensive social security scheme.  I have some difficulty in following the lines of criticism of this Bill by some Deputies.  I think it must be clear to every person who has studied the social security scheme White Paper, the statements made in regard to it, and the intentions expressed when the Department of Social Welfare was established, that this Bill would be introduced as a necessary part of the general scheme.</P>
      <P>References have been made to certain sections and sub-sections of this Bill, and I do not want to be guilty of repetition.  On other measures I have expressed my objection to the modification of statutes by ministerial Orders.  On general principles I am opposed to that.  I am opposed to it in this Bill, just as I have been opposed to it in other Bills to which I have taken exception.</P>
      <P>The principal matter that should concern Deputies in regard to this measure is protection for the staff, when they become part of the civil service.  I appreciate that in bringing the staff within the Civil Service in the way the Minister is doing here the intention is to improve the conditions of the staff.  I think every member of the staff is satisfied that so far as the Minister personally is concerned the operation of this Bill will not lead to any worsening of conditions.  The staff have much to be thankful for to the Minister.  When he assumed responsibility for the Department one of his first duties was to solve&mdash;and with satisfaction to the staff&mdash;a strike that was then in operation.  There is among the staff a consensus of opinion that the Minister's intentions are that the staff will not lose by the operation of this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there are difficulties in the way and there are matters which the staff feel ought to be clarified.  When this Bill receives the support of this House and the Seanad, and when its machinery is put into operation, making the staff civil servants, difficulties will undoubtedly be encountered in regard to grading.  I think the Minister will appreciate this, that when that step is to be taken the Department of Finance will have a <Col N="554" /> considerable say.  It is for the purpose of removing difficulties that may be put in the way of the Minister by the Department of Finance that the suggestion has been advanced that within this Bill there ought to be prescribed and set out very clearly and fully the grade in the Civil Service to which each particular type in the present staff will be appointed.  I think the Tánaiste and every Deputy in the House knows that no matter how well intentioned a person may be, he or she can never provide against all the points and difficulties that can be raised by the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>What we are all concerned about is that when this measure becomes law there will be no trouble whatsoever; the staff will know exactly to what grade in the Civil Service they will be appointed, and they will be appointed to that grade with the protection that is, in fact, in the Bill at the moment and the rights of promotion that would naturally apply to civil servants in those categories.  I would, therefore, suggest to the Minister that on the Committee Stage he ought to introduce an amendment setting out clearly and specifically the grades in the Civil Service to which the present members of the staff will be appointed.  That will give the staff an opportunity of considering the matter, of seeing where exactly they stand, whether their conditions will be improved, whether they will be left as they are or whether they will be disimproved by the Bill.</P>
    <P>I, personally, over a period of 25 years have had experience of the interpretation of laws and of the interpretation of financial regulations by the Department of Finance, and with that experience, I do not like to leave to their tender mercies any appointment such as we find within the scope of this measure.  I think the Minister himself would be satisfied, if what I suggest were done, and if it receives the support of the House, that he had done everything he humanly could do to carry out his guarantees to the staff.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="555" /> I do not know what period of time will elapse for the operation of this transfer, whether it will just happen on the appointed day or whether there will be a period during which the operation of transfer will take effect; but whether it is to operate on a particular day or over a period, I would request the Minister to introduce the type of amendment that I suggest.  I have some doubt as to whether an amendment on those lines, introduced by a private Deputy, would be accepted, since it may be contended that it involves a charge on public funds and is not admissible.  That is all the more reason why I suggest the Minister himself should introduce that particular amendment.  If an amendment were set down by a Deputy, or a number of Deputies, which endeavoured to give effect in a statutory way to the guarantees of the Minister and it was held to involve a charge on public funds, I think that does establish the point that has been made, that, unless there is that particular statutory provision, the Department of Finance may succeed in providing worse conditions for the staff than the Minister himself intended.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to say anything further in regard to the measure.  There are matters in it to which, and in respect of which I propose to put down amendments for the Committee Stage. Naturally, as the Minister will appreciate, I cannot be taken as accepting the provision in this Bill whereby the funds of the society will be utilised for the purpose of purchasing a building which ought to be used as a bus station and not as an office for the Department of Social Welfare.  I am giving notice to the Minister that an amendment on those lines will be put down for the Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the members on the Front Opposition Bench on this Bill, it was rather difficult to know what was their attitude towards it.  It was difficult, listening to Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Dr. Ryan and comparing their speeches, to know whether Fianna Fáil is accepting or opposing this Bill.  Personally, I must <Col N="556" /> say that I view this Bill with very considerable apprehension.  I think we are passing hurriedly along in a direction which leads inevitably to a completely socialised society, with centralised control of that society, with everyone eating out of the Government's hands and the Government with their hand in everybody's pocket.</P>
      <P>I do not think this whole idea of nationalising the National Health Insurance Society has received full and careful consideration by all sections of the House.  We have had over a period of years a process by which a number of approved insurance societies were first wiped out or combined together in a central society. Now we have followed that up to its apparent logical conclusion by taking over the centralised society and putting it under the direct control of the State. The same process was adopted in regard to transport, and apparently, the same process is going to be adopted in regard to every other aspect of our national life.  Was it absolutely necessary to nationalise the National Health Insurance Society?  As far as we can gather, this society was doing quite well; it was paying its way, and there were no complaints that it was being mismanaged or maladministered in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee, with that peculiar, heavy sense of humour which he indulges in in this House, referred to this Bill as a slap in the face to the Most Reverend Dr. Dignan.  Of course, I am sure his Lordship would hardly worry at the present stage about such an insult, having regard to what he received in the past; but I think that this Bill is something more than a slap in the face to any independent churchman.  As far as the administration of insurance is concerned, it definitely excludes such people from real, active and effective control in the administration of this social service to which, I think, they are entitled, by reason of the nature of their training and the exalted position which they hold.  The ex-Minister for Local Government may have given the Bishop a serious rebuff.  He may have excluded him from control of the National Health Insurance Society, but this Bill definitely closes the door <Col N="557" /> for all time against any such exalted and independent person coming in and controlling the administration of such a service.</P>
    <P>From now on, these services will be administered by a very close ring of professional politicians and permanent officials.  I think this is centralisation gone mad and in regard to social welfare and social services generally, we should aim at decentralisation. Instead of bringing this society under the control of a Government Department and making its servants and officials civil servants, we should be seeking to travel in the opposite direction, and to place the control of health insurance and similar social services in the hands of local bodies financed by the contributions paid directly by the members of the society, and in that way reverse the process of complete socialisation and centralisation. However, it seems that, owing to the division in the Opposition Front Bench, there is no effective opposition to this proposal, and while the Store Street building may, as it has been, be described as a white elephant, it looks as if it is likely to become, under this Bill, a pink elephant, and may even deepen its colour as time goes on.</P>

      <P>I hope that, before this type of legislation proceeds further, Deputies will give the matter serious consideration.  There is no reason why everything our people need should be provided by a few higher civil servants. There is no reason why everything they need should be provided for them by the official machine, and by that machine alone, and there is no reason why the tendency to exclude people of independent thought from all effective control should be persisted in. That is the only contribution I desire to make to the Bill.  So far as the provisions of the Bill in regard to carrying out the transfer of the present society to the Minister's Department are concerned, I do not intend to express any opinion at the moment, but I think the general principle is rather dangerous, and one which ought to be given careful consideration before it is persisted in further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the whole, and with the usual exception of the rather egregious Deputy MacEntee, this Bill has had quite a sympathetic reception from the House.  Most of the time spent on the Bill was spent in dealing with matters which perhaps might more appropriately be raised on the Committee Stage, but I appreciate that on a Bill of this character, a Bill which is very largely a machinery Bill, there is always a temptation to Deputies to get into the details to a greater extent than would be the case on a Bill in which more principles were enumerated and less machinery provided.  Perhaps it will simplify the discussion when we come to the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan asked for some clarification of the references in the Bill to the National Health Insurance Act, 1911, and I undertook to supply him with a memorandum which would explain these references.  I will arrange to do that so that the Deputy will have the explanation before the Committee Stage, and may thereby be enabled to adjust his point of view, if he so desires.  The Deputy asked why the Bill was being introduced at this stage.  I should like to explain that the Bill is being introduced at this stage so that, before the comprehensive scheme is in operation, we will have the national health insurance benefit and the associated sickness benefits brought within the scope of the Department of Social Welfare, and so that, before we approach the introduction of the comprehensive scheme of social security, all these different services, covering the general pattern of social welfare, will be within the Department and we can rear on that structure the larger superstructure envisaged by the comprehensive scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Administratively, there is everything to be said in favour of introducing this Bill at this stage, and if I had any doubts on that point, they were removed by Deputy Ryan when he said at column 1341 of the Official Debates of 23rd June last that it would be better to bring the society into the Department before introducing <Col N="559" /> the comprehensive scheme, because it would be easier to start off on an approach to the comprehensive scheme from the new point of having absorbed the society.  Deputy Ryan will realise that, perhaps in a fresher state of mind last year, he took the same point of view as I take this year.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee went completely off the rails about the Bill.  He wanted to know why it was being introduced at all and why it was being introduced now.  I suppose the best thing to do is to let Deputy Ryan answer him, and, in the opinion of Deputy Ryan, who knows something about social welfare, whereas Deputy MacEntee apparently knows nothing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy listened to Deputy MacEntee's exhibition a fortnight ago, but we will come to that exhibition in a few minutes and make a few comments on it.  The answer to Deputy MacEntee's queries is furnished by Deputy Ryan, who says that, in his view, it is much better to introduce this Bill at this stage and much better to absorb the society at this stage, because we can then build on a much safer foundation than we could build on if we had only some of the services within the Department and a very essential service, covering perhaps a larger number of persons, without the Department, not within departmental control or available for departmental management in a manner suited to the comprehensive scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ryan, Deputy Cowan and, I think, Deputy Lehane referred to Section 20, which deals with the modification of enactments and appeared to be worried at the prospect that modifications might be introduced under the section which would have the effect of altering, frustrating or in some occult way defeating the intentions of the Legislature.  This is not a new provision. It has been in our legislation for the past 25 years.  There are similar provisions in the Local Government (Dublin) Act of 1930 and in the County <Col N="560" /> Management Act, 1940.  I am sure that a closer examination of other Acts would produce equally convincing evidence that this is nothing new.</P>
    <P>The main concern in the matter is to do whatever is necessary to make this Act work.  I am not wedded to the provisions of this section or to the nomenclature in it.  I want to get the job done.  This has been the recognised parliamentary way of doing it, but if there is any other democratic way which will not cause delay or impede the administration of the Bill, I will be only too happy to examine the matter sympathetically.  I think we should not push this to the extent of making a doctrinaire objection if, in fact, there is no foundation for the fears and suspicions which, I agree, it is easy to conjure up when wording of this kind is before us.  However, this is a well beaten track and there should be no difficulties about it.  At any rate, I can give the House an assurance that, in my interpretation of the section, I will not seek to do anything that is not being done for the purpose of promoting the aims and objects enshrined in the Bill.  If anyone knows a better method, I will be happy to examine it sympathetically.  I suggest to Deputy Lehane and those who think like him, that they ought not be afraid of the section because it is the first time it has come up.  It has been there in previous Acts and I never heard in this House a complaint that such a section was used to undo what the Dáil desired or to frustrate the intentions of the Dáil in any way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan referred to the transfer to the Department of certain persons who by reason of their conditions of employment in the National Health Insurance Society are obliged to serve in the society a probationary period. He referred in particular to the provisions in the Bill which require the Minister to certify that a person is a suitable person for appointment as a civil servant.  The section in the Bill simply transfers the person to the Department on precisely the same terms and conditions as the person has in the society at present.  A civil servant has to serve a probationary period and before the appointment is confirmed <Col N="561" /> there has to be a certificate from the head of the Department that the probationary period has been satisfactory and before the person can receive an established appointment, that certificate must be forthcoming.  The Bill recognises that whatever rights the person had in the society will be recognised on transfer and the normal procedure of certification will operate for the future as it operates at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan referred to pension rights of the staff of the society and asked that I should compare their pension rights at present with those they will receive on transfer to the Department. This is a matter which may be raised again on the Committee Stage and it may be unwise to deal with it now. However, in the hope that it may provide information for Deputies, which would short-circuit the discussion on the Committee Stage, I prefer to give the information now.  A woman employed in the society at present is entitled to a pension based on a 1/60th for each year of service, with a maximum pension of 40/60ths or, in other words, two-thirds.  If that person dies while she is in the employment of the society, there is a death gratuity of a year's salary where her service is of not less than eight years.  If she retires on marriage, after six years' service, she receives a gratuity at the rate of 6 per cent. of salary for each year of service, up to a maximum of a year's salary.</P>
    <P>At present a woman in the Civil Service receives the same basic rate of pension as a woman in the society, namely, her pension is calculated on the basis of 60ths and the maximum is 40, or two-thirds.  On retirement through marriage, she receives a gratuity, after six years' service, of 1/12th for each year, up to a maximum of a year's salary.</P>
    <P>So far as men are concerned, at present in the society their pension is also based on 60ths, that is, the maximum is 40/60ths.  There is a death gratuity of a year's salary where the service is not less than eight years.  In the Civil Service, however, a man receives a pension based on 80ths; in other words, he can receive a pension of 40/80ths, or half pension, but he also <Col N="562" /> qualifies for a lump sum based on a 30th of his salary for each year of service, subject to the overriding maximum of 45/30ths or one and a half years' salary.  The contrast is roughly this, that the man in the society can receives a pension based on half salary salary, whereas in the Civil Service he receives a pension based on half salary with a lump sum which must not exceed a maximum of one and a half years' salary.  In the case of the man in the Civil Service, who dies while in the service, there is a death gratuity of a year's salary after five years' service, whereas in the case of the society, the gratuity is not payable unless the man has had eight years' service.</P>
    <P>The proposal in the Bill is to give men and women in the society the same superannuation conditions as men have in the Civil Service&mdash;that is, half pension with a lump sum calculated on the basis of 1/30th for each year of service, subject to a maximum of 45/30ths or 1½ years' salary; and to give the women on transfer a marriage gratuity on the same basis as a woman receives in the Civil Service.  When you remember that women in the Civil Service are not yet eligible for the provisions of the Superannuation Acts which apply to men&mdash;although they have agitated for inclusion in the Superannuation Act, the Act of 1909, almost since it was passed&mdash;you can realise that women now employed in the National Health Insurance Society who are being transferred to the Department of Social Welfare are getting a very substantial advantage, inasmuch as they are being given the benefit of opting for the provisions of the Superannuation Act which has not been applied yet to women generally in the Civil Service.  I hope, however, that it is only a matter of time until women in the Civil Service will be given that option.  At all events, nobody will deny that, so far as pension provisions are concerned, the staff of the National Health Insurance Society, which is pensionable to-day, are being transferred to what, on the whole, is a much better superannuation scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan referred to decentralisation and thought that it ought to be possible to push the Department of Social Welfare out into some provincial area where he thought the climate would most conduce to its progressive growth and which he thought would be a contribution to the relief of the various problems which inevitably arise in a large and fast-growing city.  I understand that this matter was discussed some years ago with a view to seeing whether it was possible to push either the whole Department or sections of it out into some provincial area.  I understand that the results were gloomy in the extreme and that nobody found an easy solution of the difficulties which were then thrown up.  There is no difficulty in the world in getting a site in the country for the erection of a building, but you do not solve the problem when you put up a building.  You bring yourself nearer to the kernel of the problem, which is to find houses for all the members of the staff who must work in the building.  Nor do you solve the problem when you have houses for them. Many of these people are married men and women and have sons and daughters in employment in the city. Is it suggested that, merely to satisfy what is, after all, to some extent an ideal to-day, these families should be completely uprooted, that father, mother, school-going children, adolescent boys and girls who are in employment, perhaps serving apprenticeship, are to be taken up and pushed into a house and told: &ldquo;There is a house; it is near your office; cheer up, what complaint have you?&rdquo;  There is a human problem there and it is no use disregarding it.</P>
      <P>If it were possible to implement a scheme of this kind, I would like to see the matter dealt with, not on the basis of men on a draughtboard or pieces on a chessboard, but on the basis of a frank recognition that we are dealing with human material which has to be dealt with in a very sympathetic way.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="564" /> Could you not make up your mind that this is going to be the ultimate location and try to do it step by step, doing the things that were easier first and that would cause least hardship?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

I want to say to Deputy de Valera that he will frankly realise, as I and everybody else will realise, that before you can put a scheme of this kind into operation, it necessarily involves a considerable amount of survey, a considerable amount of weighing up the pros and cons of the situation, a considerable examination of the benefits and the disadvantages that would flow from it.  All that would take a considerable amount of time. Because of that, I do not want to see the Department of Social Welfare selected as the medium for this experiment. We might consider patriarchal Departments like the Land Commission as an appropriate medium for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I want to see a comprehensive scheme of social security operated with the minimum delay and I would be appalled, as the country would be appalled, if it were to be postponed until we got down to deal with the problem of decentralisation.  Many people would say with me that, if you have a bee in your bonnet about decentralisation, you had better start with some other Department, but we are not prepared, having regard to the present inadequate social services, to wait until you survey that wide prairie before a comprehensive social scheme is introduced.  It is because I want to see a comprehensive social security scheme introduced with minimum <Col N="565" /> delay and to build up our social services to a decent level that I have, unfortunately, to be stony-hearted about accepting a suggestion that decentralisation should be tried on a thriving and growing Department like the Department of Social Welfare. There are other more suitable media for the trial of the virtues of decentralisation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davern regretted that we are taking over the National Health Insurance Society.  He said it was a body that was there and he did not like anything that was there to disappear, even though Deputy Davern clearly realises that it was essential to take over the society if we were to have a comprehensive scheme of social security in operation.  At all events, Deputy Dr. Ryan, with his closer appraisal of the situation, said that in his view the taking over of the society was necessary and he saw no alternative to the absorption of the society in the Department.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lynch referred to the outlets for promotion for persons taken over from the society and absorbed in the Department and appeared to have some fears that their opportunities for promotion would not be as great.  I cannot understand Deputy Lynch's fears in that respect, because those who are being transferred are being transferred to a very much larger Department than the organisation in which they work.  It is an expanding Department and is likely to continue to expand according as we build up a more radical approach to our social problems.  I cannot understand why Deputy Lynch should fear that transfer to a bigger Department was likely in any way to curtail opportunities for promotion.  I should rather think that the opportunities for promotion on transfer to the Department of Social Welfare were widened rather than contracted. I do not think there are any grounds whatever for the fears of Deputy Lynch or anyone else in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lynch asked what is going to happen to a person who refuses to transfer from the National Health Insurance Society to the Department of Social Welfare.  Our approach to the problem of the National Health <Col N="566" /> Insurance Society's staff, that is, the entire staff, pensionable and non-pensionable, as indicated in this Bill, is a radical and sympathetic approach.  We say to the staff of the National Health Insurance Society, whether they are indoor or outdoor staff: &ldquo;You are human beings.  We propose to take you over to the Department of Social Welfare and, on transfer to the Department of Social Welfare, your conditions will not be worsened&rdquo;.  We are taking over to the Department of Social Welfare a number of National Health Insurance Society agents whose tenure at present with the society is that their services can be dispensed with at one week's notice.  Every one of these agents will be taken over, provided he elects to be taken over.  Every member of the staff of the National Health Insurance Society will be taken over on terms not less satisfactory than they have at the moment.  If there is any person on the staff who does not want to be absorbed into the Civil Service, who does not want the security he has in the Civil Service, who does not want the improved pension rights he will have in the Civil Service or who does not want the greater opportunities of promotion he will have on transfer to the Civil Service, frankly I cannot plumb his mentality.  If there is such a person it is more the problem of the person who declines the offer than of the person who makes it.  However, I do not imagine that we have simple folk of that kind careering around the country in 1950, and I think that, on reflection, they will be all glad to accept the offer that is being made to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan's approach to the Bill was the approach of a Deputy who was acquainted with the problem.  He knew what the difficulties were and did his best within Party limits to face up to the problems created by the Bill and to what the introduction of the Bill envisaged in a larger field.  His approach was a sensible and realistic one to the problems which must be dealt with.  I rather thought that it was to set a headline for the Fianna Fáil contribution to the discussion on the Bill and in the main I am bound to say that the tone of Deputy Dr. Ryan's <Col N="567" /> speech did set the headline for the Party opposite with one notable exception. Deputy MacEntee came in to show that Deputy Dr. Ryan knew nothing of social welfare, that he was the merest amateur, that he could not read the Bill and could not see the sinister plots that unfolded themselves by the million to Deputy MacEntee's analytical eye. Deputy MacEntee regaled the House for one and a half hours talking, not of what is in the Bill, but of what he thought was in the Bill.  Deputy MacEntee's entry into this Bill was characterised by all the graciousness of an elephant, but without one of the characteristics of an elephant inasmuch as that gentleman is characterised by not forgetting.  He came in with none of the elephant's virtues and succeeded in distinguishing himself inasmuch as he managed to misunderstand and misinterpret every section to which he adverted.  It was a pitiable attempt of a person who at one time had some responsibility for social services.  It was pitiable to see him leaping through section after section, misunderstanding them and seeing conspiracies everywhere which no one on his own bench discovered and which Deputy Dr. Ryan with his greater knowledge of the problem could not discover.  Deputy MacEntee told the House that the Bill was an effort to confiscate private property. The Bishop of Clonfert was brought into the Bill as if his Lordship had anything to do with it.  He brought us for an excursion into Eastern Europe and no less a person than Mr. Stalin was relevant when Deputy MacEntee was talking.  One would have thought that Deputy MacEntee at this stage would have reached maturity.  Whatever influence the Dáil has on the Deputy it is certainly a mesmerising one and he is incapable of using temperate or responsible language when he is asked to deal with serious problems in the House.  I suppose that Deputy MacEntee will continue the rôle over which he now has title deeds, the rôle of irresponsibility.  We must look on the Deputy's contribution to this debate as to every other as the contribution of what is to the Dáil a problem child and I suppose he is a problem child to his own Party as well.  I will <Col N="568" /> try to clear some of his misconceptions on the Bill, not in the hope of convincing him, but in the hope of removing some of the vicious misstatements he has made lest others who do not know him as well as we do should think him in any way wise when he speaks on legislation of this kind.</P>
    <P>He said that this was a smash and grab raid on the funds of the National Health Insurance Society by a bankrupt Government.  Could anybody understand that kind of irresponsible language from an ex-Minister and a Front Bench member of the Opposition? That was one of the delicacies of his speech.  There were other statements which were not couched in such courteous and considerate language. This Bill represents an effort to do two things.  It proposes to clear the way for the absorption of the National Health Insurance Society in the Department for a wider scheme of social welfare and it proposes to acquire a building, for which Córas Iompair Éireann is unable to pay having commissioned architects and workmen to build it, as the headquarters of the Department of Social Welfare and make available for Government or civil use other buildings now occupied by the Department of Social Welfare thus contributing to some extent to the arrest of the growing practice of the occupation of private buildings by Government Departments for office purposes.  We are not doing anything new in purchasing a building with the funds of the National Health Insurance Society.  The present building, Árus Brugha, was purchased with moneys which belonged to the society.  It was a very wise investment at the time and proved to be even wiser with the effluxion of time because the property increased considerably in value.  The building or its value is now an asset in the funds of the society. Here in the Bill there is a proposal to buy another building which is considered to be a suitable headquarters for a large Department such as the Department of Social Welfare.  Money investments will be realised for the purpose of purchasing the premises, a thing which it is perfectly legitimate to do.  The precedent is already there and there is an assurance in the Bill <Col N="569" /> that at least the same amount as the income that money now invested earns will be earned when the money is diverted for the purchase of the building.  It is very likely that we will realise moneys which are at present, and which have been for a very long time, invested in British securities for the purpose of purchasing the Store Street premises.  I think it will be a very good asset from the point of view of the National Health Insurance Society and from the point of view of the society's members.</P>
    <P>I would far sooner see £1,000,000 of Irish money invested in a building in the centre of the city than see it financing a colonial development fund, as it probably is at present, by being invested in British securities.  There is no need for alarm because that has been done.  I think it is a sensible approach to the problem.  There is no loss to insurance funds, there is a repatriation of Irish assets at present invested in Great Britain, or likely will be.  It is much better to have our moneys invested in bricks and mortar in the capital of Ireland than have them spent on our behalf, if you do not mind, subject all the time to devaluation or to depreciation on the stock market, in some place in the Middle East or in South Africa.  Therefore, Deputy MacEntee's attempt to scare the public when we are going to make a prudent investment of this kind is only going to recoil on himself.  Somebody with more influence on him than I have ought to tell him that even from a Party point of view those statements are irresponsible and that they recoil to his own disadvantage.  When made before strangers who do not know him they are rather apt to give the Deputy a reputation much worse than, on reconsideration, he deserves.  That is the complete story about Store Street. It seems to me a story which will stand any test.  I do not think anybody is going to wreck the national nerves by trying to rear a bogeyman story on the simple facts which I have outlined.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee went after the guarantee fund.  The guarantee fund intrigued him so much that, when he intervened in the debate on the second occasion, he brought tomes into the <Col N="570" /> Dáil and quoted sections of the Act of 1911 and said: &ldquo;You are talking about the guarantee fund.  There is no reference to the guarantee fund in the 1911 Act and therefore you are misleading the House.&rdquo;  The fact of the matter is that the section to which the Deputy referred in the 1911 Act did not in fact make any reference to the guarantee fund.  The section in question was a section inserted in the 1911 Act for the purpose of ensuring that officers of societies were to give security for their honesty when administering the affairs of the separate National Health Insurance Societies and a fund was created under the section, called the guarantee fund, to enable that security to be given.  That is the simple story of the guarantee fund, but for nearly half an hour Deputy MacEntee ranted about it and stated we were suggesting that there was a guarantee fund in the 1911 Act when in fact there was no guarantee fund in the Act as framed.  But what he forgot to say was that on many occasions since then, even in regulations administered by the Department of Local Government when he was Minister for Local Government, there was reference to the guarantee fund in the 1911 Act.  He must have known that if he was familiar with the work of his Department, but, notwithstanding the fact that as Minister for Local Government he was administering regulations referring to the guarantee fund in the 1911 Act, he still persisted in saying here on the last occasion on which he spoke that there was no guarantee fund in that Act and that I was endeavouring to mislead the House.  Again, these are the simple facts, and Deputy MacEntee will find it hard to mislead the House.  The only thing he succeeded in doing so far as I am concerned is establishing beyond all doubt that he knows nothing about the construction of the National Health Insurance Act, 1911, or of any Act dealing with national health insurance, because he displayed lamentable incompetence in trying to interpret any of the Acts.</P>
    <P>Then he came to the question of appeals.  He said that at present there is an appeal to the Minister for Social Welfare by an aggrieved person who is a member of the National Health Insurance <Col N="571" /> Society, but if the society is transferred to the Department, the Minister for Social Welfare will be the Minister administering the funds and consequently he will be hearing appeals against decisions of his own officers.  In Deputy MacEntee's view, that meant that the scales were always going to be weighted against an aggrieved person. A moment's reflection would have convinced anybody who had any memory or knowledge that the method of appeal in the case of the National Health Insurance Society's members is unique and has never been repeated in the case of any subsequent legislation. Under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act and, I think, under the Children's Allowances Act, if there is an appeal it is to an independent referee who happens to be a civil servant and who is a statutory officer.  If there is an appeal by an aggrieved person, it goes to that referee and the matter is decided by the referee as a statutory officer without any reference whatever to the Minister.  Every day in the week cases are decided by the referee and I do not even know that the cases are before him.  He is a statutory officer and exercises that function. I think it is very much better that there should be a statutory officer to decide appeals of that kind rather than that the Minister, who has political affiliations, should be called upon to decide these appeals.  At all events, the type of appeal for the continuance of which Deputy MacEntee was pleading is a type of appeal which has not been copied in any subsequent social legislation.</P>
    <P>When the Bill becomes law and the society is transferred to the Department of Social Welfare, I propose to let aggrieved people avail of machinery similar to that in operation under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, namely, to appeal to an independent referee and to keep the appeal away from the Minister altogether.  Although that was contemplated, although it was obvious to anybody reflecting on the matter for a moment that that would be done, Deputy MacEntee saw in that a deep conspiracy to cheat the aggrieved person out of whatever rights he had.  It was, again, a foolish contribution <Col N="572" /> by the Deputy, but, apparently, you cannot stop the Deputy from making contributions of that character.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee talked also about the reserve fund and the central fund and of these being handed over to the Minister for Finance.  As to a reserve fund or a central fund or a guarantee fund or any type of fund, once this society ceases to exist there is no need for these separate funds, and it is proposed therefore to merge them all in one fund and to use that one fund for the benefit of the National Health Insurance Society members.  In accordance with the customary practice, the Minister for Finance, who is the Chancellor of the Exchequer so far as national funds are concerned, will hold these moneys, but he will hold them as a trustee for the persons who have an interest in them, in the same way as he holds and always has held the deposits of persons in the savings bank and every other type of money which is put in trust of the Government.  All we are doing in this matter is merely regularising the procedure by giving to the Minister for Finance to hold in trust the separated funds brought together in one fund.  He will hold these as a national trustee.  They cannot be used in any way for revenue purposes. They cannot be made available for expenditure.  They will be held in the same way and with the same trustee responsibility as every other security held by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan raised a question on Section 6, which is a rather short but complicated section and reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The provisions of or made under the Acts which would, if this part of this Act had not come into operation, apply only to insured persons being members of the society shall apply to all insured persons.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I agree that that is not a model of simplification, but its simple meaning is this.  At present a person must pay contributions under the National Health Insurance Acts because that is the law.  He must, therefore, insure himself by paying contributions under that Act, but he can only get benefit for those contributions if he joins the <Col N="573" /> National Health Insurance Society. Strange as it may appear, there are still some persons who pay contributions under the Act and who are not members of the society and they can never get benefit until they become members of the society.</P>
    <P>Probably that anomaly arises because of the fact that the State imposes an obligation to pay contributions whereas a private, or semi-private, society insists that one must be a member of the society before one can get benefit since only the society pays benefit and not the State.  It is the simple intention of this section that a person who pays national health insurance contributions will be treated in the same way as he is treated to-day for unemployment insurance purposes. If one pays unemployment insurance contributions one must, provided one complies with the contribution conditions, get benefit from the State.  This will put everybody on the same basis as that which operates in the case of unemployment insurance. It is quite obviously an improvement on the present position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan raised a question on Section 7, sub-section (2).  Here, again, the technical phrasing does not perhaps leave itself capable of a facile interpretation.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that the phrase to which he referred is purely a draftsman's phrase.  It merely means that, as the pension fund of the society will be transferred to the Minister for Finance and he will in future be liable for the pensions of the staff of the society, it is desired to count past service on the staff of the society for Civil Service pension purposes.  The section has no other meaning but that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan raised a question on Section 8 as to the transfer of the society's pension fund to the Minister for Finance.  What is happening here is quite obvious and quite simple to explain.  The staff of the society will be taken over by the Department of Social Welfare.  Those who are pensionable will become established and pensionable officers of the Civil Service. The Minister for Finance will in future be responsible for their pensions.  The present pension fund, therefore, will <Col N="574" /> be taken over by the Minister to meet the ultimate liability which will devolve upon him in relation to the pensions of these officers if and when they become entitled to such pensions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan also raised a question on Section 17.  He referred to the unclaimed stamp account of the National Health Insurance Society. The present position is that if there is a sum of money in that fund which exceeds £15,000, the first £15,000 of that sum goes to the Exchequer and the balance to the National Health Insurance Society.  Deputy Dr. Ryan appeared to think that the reverse was the position.  With the dissolution of the society it will not be necessary in future to ascertain the amount of the unclaimed stamp account each year.  It is proposed under this Bill to give the State a fixed contribution of £15,000 per annum.  Only in one year since 1942 did the State fail to receive £15,000 from the unclaimed stamp account fund.  What we propose to do here, therefore, is to stabilise the position in so far as we could ascertain it since 1942.  That position will remain until the comprehensive scheme comes into operation when the matter will be further reviewed.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee concerned himself largely with sub-section (2) of Section 19.  He thought he saw there some scheme to deprive insured persons of the additional sickness benefit provided under the National Health Insurance Acts.  At present a sum of £300,000 may be made available by the Minister for certain additional benefits.  The sum made available is dependent upon the surplus ascertained as a result of a valuation which takes place every five years.  There is no obligation on the Minister to make available the sum that is now made available but, so far as this Bill is concerned, we are guaranteeing the continuance of the additional benefits. We say that the sum cannot be less than £300,000 and it may, in fact, be more. To that extent insured persons now have a statutory guarantee that the amount made available will not be less than £300,000.  Under the position as it stands at present the amount could be substantially less.  There are no <Col N="575" /> grounds, therefore, for the fears expressed by Deputy MacEntee.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Con Lehane raised a question about the date 1st July, 1949, in sub-section (8) of Section 21.  The sub-section reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This section shall be deemed to come into operation on the 1st July, 1949.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the main this sub-section refers to sub-section (7), which immediately precedes it and which gives the Minister certain powers to do certain things in respect of acquisition, construction or reconstruction without the obligation to consult any other Minister for a period which commenced on 1st July, 1949, and runs for five years until 1st July, 1954.  The object is to enable this work to be put in hands with the utmost expedition in order to ensure that nothing will delay the implementation of the scheme envisaged therein. The 1st July, 1949, was taken because it was the date on which we got general Government authority to do this for a period of five years.  I hope it will be possible to do all these things in a much shorter period and I hope that 1954 will have nothing more than an academic significance in the course of the next couple of years. That is the explanation for the 1st July, 1949, and that sub-section must be construed by reference to the previous sub-section and substantially it has no other meaning except in reference to sub-section (7).</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig asked what was the position of the society's pension fund. The position at the moment is that it amounts to about £120,000.  It is not only paying about six existing pensions but it is liable to meet, with the growing produce thereof and such additions as may be made to the fund itself, the pensions of the staff when they retire.  I explained that I use the fund as an asset to meet whatever liabilities subsequently devolve on me in connection with the claims of the present National Health Insurance Society staff when they come to retire.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lehane raised a number of points in connection with Sections 20 and 21.  I have already dealt with the <Col N="576" /> position so far as it relates to Section 20 (2), namely, the modification of the Acts, and I hope I have convinced the Deputy that it is a reasonable provision. Let me say, however, that I keep my mind open.  If the Deputy thinks that something else works equally well or better he will not find me tied as to matters of dogma with regard to Section 20.  I have explained the position to Deputy Lehane in connection with Section 21 (8).</P>
    <P>Now we come to the question of staff. This matter was raised by Deputy Larkin, Deputy Cowan and Deputy Lehane.  I should like to explain my approach.  Before this Bill was introduced I sent for the trade unions catering for the National Health Insurance Society staff, though I have no responsibility for their wages and conditions. I was prepared to meet the union people to discuss this matter with them, to see what problems they were worried about and to see whether any misconceptions and doubts and fears could be removed.  I think none of the unions will deny that I gave them a long and sympathetic hearing.  Their recorded views in writing confirm that.  I decided, instead of dealing with the question of compensation to people who are able to work in their present employment, and work satisfactorily, but who cannot probably find another job if you push them out on small compensation, that this was a human problem and ought to be dealt with in the way human beings ought to regulate their relations one with another.  I decided, therefore, to take over the whole indoor staff of the National Health Insurance Society.  That left me then with the problem of the agents, most of them part-time agents, on the outdoor side. There again you are dealing with human material.  It might be urged and I could make a case myself that I would not need all these people.  However, I did not like the idea of pushing a man out, with short service, if he is 45, 50, 55 or 60 years of age.  I realised the considerable difficulty of men, especially in rural areas, who are agents, getting any other kind of alternative employment and I realised that any compensation they would get would, on the whole, be so microscopic as not to be able to provide for them for the rest <Col N="577" /> of their lives.  Bear in mind that they are not pensionable.  They are not even full-time officers.  I decided, therefore, that I would take over all the agents, about 300 in number; that I would continue for the present the existing method of payment of National Health Insurance benefit, and that I would allow these people to continue in that capacity.</P>
    <P>If wastage occurred by deaths, resignations or retirements in the ordinary way, well and good.  That would be something that would accrue ultimately to the society.  In the meantime, however, I was going to keep these people in employment on at least their existing wage and allow them to remain in the employment which they had been following for many years.  I think nobody will deny that that was a new approach to the problem.  I must say that I thought it was sympathetic.</P>
    <P>I say to all the staff of the National Health Insurance Society, whether indoor or outdoor, that they will be taken over by the Department of Social Welfare.  I do not think they can be given the statutory guarantees for which Deputy Cowan and Deputy Lehane sought and I shall give the House the reason in a few moments. However, I feel the staff ought to feel satisfied that a person who approached the problem as sympathetically as I approached it is not likely to try any tricks on them and to try to cheat them out of any rights which they have and that such a person is not likely to turn an unsympathetic ear to any grievances which they may have.  When these staff organisations came to see me on this matter I was pressed, as Deputy Lehane and Deputy Cowan have done this afternoon, to give them the statutory guarantees that their rights on transfer to the Civil Service would be at least the rights which they had and that if, at any time in the future, ten, 15, 20 or 30 years hence, anything happened during their evolution down the Department which might not have happened had they remained in the society, a tribunal would be set up and that its function would be to hear and adjudicate on their grievances and to permit them to retire with compensation. I felt that that was a perfectly <Col N="578" /> unreasonable proposition.  Bear in mind that these people were not being transferred to any doubtful kind of employment. They were being transferred to the State.  They were to be transferred to secure employment.  They were being converted from private employees into civil servants.  I pointed out that when they come into the Civil Service not only do they get the security of a civil servant but they have to line up with the rest of the civil servants and take what is coming to the class and the grade as a whole. I pointed out to them that where there is in the Civil Service a grade known as the clerical officer grade with, say, 3,000 members in that grade, it would be wholly improper and anomalous that the grade itself had none of the guarantees which a rather relatively small number of national health insurance officials were looking for on assimilation to the clerical officer grade.</P>
    <P>Let us take an example.  Let us assume that the whole indoor staff of the National Health Insurance Society are made clerical officers.  They are then made members of a grade which already numbers 3,000 in all.  The suggestion made to me was that 300 people who are not yet civil servants but are being made civil servants and getting credit for their past service in private employment&mdash;getting Civil Service conditions generally, Civil Service pensions, Civil Service rights and Civil Service prospects&mdash;could come into the Civil Service and get there guarantees and the right of access to a special tribunal which the existing civil servant has not got even though he may have more years of service in the Civil Service than the other person has years of age to his credit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to the Minister that the existing civil servant went in of his own volition. These people have to go in willy-nilly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish we could all go to such good places willy-nilly.  If there is any worry about &ldquo;willy-nilly&rdquo; I shall examine the &ldquo;willy-nilly&rdquo; and see that nobody is pushed in if he does not want to go and see if anything can <Col N="579" /> be done about a separate class, although I do not think that would be good for them.  I think they are playing with fire.  Is it reasonable to expect that you should pick out a small handful of people who are being well-treated and give them special rights, although they belong to the same class as other civil servants, which are not given to the class as a whole?  I think that that is unreasonable and that it shows a kind of playing for one's own hand.  I think it would be much better for those who come in from the National Health Insurance Society, and whom I hope to assimilate in the appropriate Civil Service grade, to recognise for good or for evil&mdash;I hope for good&mdash;that their destiny is cast in that grade for the time being.  It is their job, with that of the rest of the grade and the organisation which caters for them, to make conditions as good as possible for the grade and to prevent any deterioration in conditions in the grade.</P>
      <P>At all events, they must develop from their own point of view and from the trade union point of view a sense of oneness with their colleagues in the grade and they ought not to try to be a special little class within a very much bigger grade.  I think from their own point of view it would be better to get away from the mentality of 2½d. looking down on 2¼., to realise that they are all one, that they have got to swim together and to battle together.  The sooner they can be inculcated with that philosophy, the better it will be for themselves and maybe it would not be a bad thing for the Civil Service grades as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is attributing desires and aims to the officials to be transferred and absorbed that they have not got.  I think the genesis or the basis of the complaint is the lack of guarantee in the Bill itself that their conditions will not be worsened.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Their position on transfer to the Civil Service will be this. In so far as those who will come in and be graded as writing assistants, they will be writing assistants and their <Col N="580" /> hopes will be the hopes of the whole writing assistants' class.  In so far as they come in as clerical officers, their hopes and aspirations will be bound up with the destinies of the clerical officer class.  Bear in mind that when they do come into the Civil Service they will come into a service which now enjoys something which they have not got&mdash; an arbitration board.  If they have grievances of a substantial kind, their grievances can come before the arbitration board but over and above that they have the assurances which I have given them.  I said: &ldquo;Look here, if there is one haunting fear, that you will not be fairly treated, I shall make the Assistant Secretary of the Department who is chairman of the National Health Insurance Society, whom you know well and with whom you negotiated in the past, available to you by easy access; you can go to him and you can discuss the matter with him. He will discuss the matter with the Secretary of the Department and try to adjust whatever difficulties arise. If you are not satisfied that these two officers will do justice to you, I shall intervene myself and hear whatever case you have to make.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We were not all in such good form after the West Donegal election or the West Cork election. What I say to our friends in the National Health Insurance Society is that there is no reason to fear that this Government is going to go out in a short time.  They will be well stabilised in the Civil Service before this Government goes to the country.  I suggest to Deputy Lehane, to Deputy Cowan and to Deputy Larkin to get in touch with these people in the National Health Society and say to them that I offered my explanation that they are being treated very fairly, that there has been a new approach, an almost revolutionary approach to the matter of transfer and that their conditions will be improved on transfer to the Department.  I do not want to worsen their conditions in any way and I think they may rest assured that their conditions will not be worsened in any way. Their salary conditions will not be worsened.  What they have been offered represents a substantial improvement and they should not be crying &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; until at least they see the form of the wolf on the horizon.  However, I cannot give them the statutory guarantees suggested by Deputy Cowan and Deputy Lehane, and I do not think it is fair to ask me, but my assurance will be entered on the records of the House that I do not want to see them unfairly treated and that, so far as I can, I shall do my best to remove any misunderstandings or grievances which may arise, firstly because they deserve it as human beings and, secondly, because I know the successful administration of this Department depends on the merged staffs working together in a spirit of harmony and co-operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not clear that if there is to be decentralisation it has to be done carefully and the best time is when the Department is being set up?  It is at the beginning obviously that steps in this direction should be taken.  You cannot uproot an old organisation. You have to approach it from the beginning if there is to be development in a Department.  I, of course, agree with the Tánaiste with regard to the human element.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say this to the Deputy.  One of the virtues of a comprehensive social security scheme, the weaving of separate schemes into a common whole, is that it enables you to simplify your administration.  You can do it in a variety of ways.  Two of the ways which will be adopted are as follows: in the first place we shall have a common record card which will record all the particulars of a person for social security purposes.  One card will be used for the national health insurance record, for the unemployment insurance record, for widows' and orphans' benefits, for retirement benefits and for every other class of benefit. Clearly you cannot draw away the sections from easy access to the place where the records are kept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter which makes for simplification and efficiency is the adoption of the scheme of one staff instead of two or three staffs as at the moment.  There again there is an obvious advantage.  In a Department, <Col N="583" /> like that of Social Welfare, where a whole lot of separate sections revolve around close and easy access to central records, the difficulty of drawing your staff further away is much greater than in the case of Departments where that closely knitted scheme of organisation is not so necessary and, in fact, in many cases is not present at all.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving the Estimate for the Department of Defence for the coming year I would like, as far as possible, before getting down to the details of the Estimate, to try to clear the air in so far as I can with absolute candour, placing everything before Dáil Éireann, recognising that every Deputy in an Irish Dáil bears on his shoulders the same degree of responsibility as a public representative as I do as Minister for Defence, to face up to this question, not in any heavy political way, arguing like so many petty politicians as to whether the strength of our Army should be 9,000, 8,000 or 8,500, not arguing one with another as to whether we are spending so many thousands in any particular direction or so many thousands plus one extra £1,000, but rather trying to reach something like general agreement <Col N="586" /> around general principles with regard to defence.</P>
    <P>We are, in the world sense, a very young State, scarcely reached the use of reason, and anyone listening in to defence debates for the past three or four years would say that it will be many years before we reach the use of reason.  We are living in a world emerging from a war of mighty combinations, a war of many millions on one side and many millions on the other side.  Ours was a tiny island, detached, divorced, isolated, neutral, in the middle of that world blood bath.  According to many people inside and outside the Dáil, the world is facing another war situation similar to the last.</P>
    <P>The main part of our Army debate has turned in recent years on whether our Army strength will be Deputy Traynor's strength of 9,000 or Deputy O'Higgins's strength of 8,000 odd. Surely with that background the whole thing is silly, futile, unrealistic, nonsensical? I have been asked in previous debates, since I became Minister for Defence, would I take the House into my confidence, would I give the Army plan, would I give the Army scheme, would I give Government policy.  I have been accused of many things, perhaps with a certain amount of justice in the accusation, but one accusation to which I will not plead guilty is lack of candour with Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Since I came over here I introduced clauses to reinstate deserters; I introduced cuts in the Army bill; I introduced reductions in the Army strength; I introduced a number of things that nobody could say were going to be palatable hearing or popular in their reception.  But I gave them out and I have endeavoured since I came over here to take the Dáil fully into my confidence with regard to defence matters, defence difficulties and defence delicacies in this country.  Before entering into the details of this year's Estimate I want to jog the recollections of Deputies, particularly those sitting opposite, with regard to statements made time and again over the past two and a half years since I came over here, and repeated as recently as last <Col N="587" /> February, asking time and again for replies that have been given over and over again on every occasion when it became part of my responsibility to stand up here and discuss Army and defence matters.</P>
    <P>As late as our debate on the Temporary Army Bill on the 28th February last, we had Deputy Traynor, an ex-Minister for Defence, asking, for instance, if we had any policy with regard to other nations in the world which are confronted with similar dangers to ours. He asked: &ldquo;Is there an assurance from some of the people whom he&mdash;that is, myself&mdash;regarded as our protectors? Is there any alliance or what is the reason why we are to-day so complacent?&rdquo; We had that line of argument followed up by other Deputies opposite: the kind of suggestion, the kind of thrown-out suspicion that there was some kind of a secret alliance, some kind of a sinister tying-up of this country with some other country unnamed with regard to our defence position. Emphatically, categorically and in the very clearest way that was possible for a man not having the command of language that others may have, I made our position clear time and again since 1948 in that respect, and still as late as February last we had that question asked.</P>
    <P>The question does not matter, but the effect of the question does matter. The mere fact that an ex-Minister for Defence puts such a question into a speech conveys to a great percentage of our population that there is some reason for the question, and that there is some suspicion with regard to the activities of the Minister or of the Government. The Deputy opposite was a member of the Government that framed the Constitution under which we all live at the present moment.  As a member of that Government and a Deputy of the Dáil, it should be within his knowledge that any such arrangement, any such alliance or any such contract could not be made without it being brought here in the broad light of day for approval or disapproval to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>We had, in the course of that same debate, other Deputies following the lead that was given, asking the same <Col N="588" /> question, asking if we had given bases in this country to any other power, asking if there was not some secret arrangement to give bases either to the American forces or to the British forces.  Surely to goodness in this year of 1950, there should be enough trust in the honesty of our elected public representatives appointed to responsible Government positions to know that, if there was anything of that kind, there is enough contact between the Government and the Deputies in an Irish Dáil to have the thing discussed and to have the information given without this kind of taking the subject matter of one's speech from any sensational journalistic pen either in a home paper or in a foreign paper.</P>
    <P>We, in this country, like a great number of other countries, are living in a very difficult time from a defence point of view.  Things are not just as simple as they were ten or 14 years ago.  The Leader of the Opposition, in the course of that debate, asked what provision we are making with regard to the accumulation of armaments and military supplies as against the next probable or possible world war. In the course of that discussion I did endeavour to give to the Leader of the Opposition, and to the members of his Party, some kind of an insight as to what is the position of this country and of other countries, in this post-war world in which we are living, and of how very, very different it is from the world in which we lived either before the last war or during the last war with regard to the supply of arms and of armaments.</P>
    <P>In the course of that statement by the Leader of the Opposition, he pointed out that, on the eve of the last war, we found ourselves in the position of having ordered our armanents and our military supplies from European countries and of the transport of those arms being interrupted by the war. I only wish to God that we were living in those days now where it was possible even to order arms and armaments from European countries even at the risk of their delivery being interrupted by war.  He talked of massing arms and armaments as against the next war, while Deputy de Valera, junior, has <Col N="589" /> addressed questions to me time and again with regard to the amount of money which we are voting or spending on warlike stores and armaments.</P>
    <P>I think this is the fifth speech I have made in this House, since I became Minister for Defence, in which I have pointed out every time that the whole world situation has changed with regard to the supplies of arms and armaments or with anything that has to do with the equipment of the Army. We are isolated here.  The world is formed up into two mighty combinations with appendages.  We are not either in one combination or the other, and we are not an appendage to one combination or another.  Both of those mighty combinations are busily arming and producing arms for all that are inside of the combination, and, after that, the appendages.  We are not living in a world in which we can order arms as in the past from Czechoslovakia, from France, from Germany, from America, from Britain.  We are not living in a world in which these countries will even accept our orders. Since the end of the last war, we have been getting driblets of supplies from one country, and one country only up to date, that is, Great Britain.  With all our quarrels with her, with all our difficulties and with all the sense of soreness on different points which may exist between Britain and ourselves, it is nevertheless due to her to say that, but for the driblets of supplies we are getting from her, we would not have equipment even for the small Army we are keeping at the moment.</P>
    <P>That is a situation which I want Deputies opposite in particular to face up to meeting with me.  It is not a situation which is the choice of any of us, but it is the situation which exists. We do not produce anything in this country&mdash;not a rifle, not a bullet, not a pop-gun.  The day when armies consisted of marching men and muskets went by 50 years ago.  The smallest part of a modern army is the man&mdash; equipment is the thing that matters. If a modern brigade passed down O'Connell Street nowadays, a brigade equipped in the modern way, it would have passed by and none of us would have seen scarcely one human being. An army equipped nowadays in the <Col N="590" /> modern way is equipped heavily and armoured.  It is the heavy stuff that matters.  I am asked by the Leader of the Opposition to build up military supplies, armaments, against the possibility or the probability of a coming war.  If I could do it, I would not want to be urged, and if the Leader of the Opposition could do it, I would be behind him all the time in doing it. Everything in the way of warlike equipment, protective material, to put into the hands of the defence forces of this country will be bought and will not be stopped for want of money.  If there is a certain figure down in the Estimates, it is there merely because there is honesty and candour in presenting the Estimate and because we place before the Dáil the amounts we hope or expect to get within the financial year.  I could lull into quiescence all the uneasiness of Deputies at different points of the House by multiplying the figure, by putting down ten times as much, but in the end getting only the same quantity.  At the end of the year, would I be honest? A Budget is supposed to be framed on the sound, honest estimate of the expenditure you reckon to incur during the year and the Army Estimate is framed definitely and firmly on the honest reckoning of our expenditure in the year ahead.  I will give the House later on a description of the machinery that exists at the moment&mdash;cumber-some, difficult and delaying machinery &mdash;with regard to supplies of arms and armaments.</P>
    <P>I am asked by Deputies opposite with a note of interrogation in their voices: have we entered into any alliances and is there any secret agreement with any Great Power?  With regard to the national situation, I think it will be conceded by this time that, irrespective of Parties or of places, we have all the same national outlook.  If we had no difficult history behind us, if we had no political difficulties at the moment with regard to neighbouring countries, the natural thing for any Minister for Defence or any Government in a little island such as this, with the potentialities of an adequate ground force without a navy and without the necessary equipment or material for the arming <Col N="591" /> of that Army and for protection from sea and air, would be, living in a world of great combinations, such as that in which we live at the moment, to look for alliance with the country which could provide sea and air protection and the <i>quid pro quo</i> for that sea and air protection would be the food supply that we could give to that country.</P>
    <P>That would be as simple as A.B.C., if it were not for sentimental reasons, for historical difficulties and for the political difficulties that make it impossible at the moment.  We would supply the land and the material to defend the soil of this country and protect the left flank of Great Britain by producing, during war, food for her and she would supply the air and sea element.  As things are, that is utterly outside the realm of practical politics. It would be as impossible to conceive any Irish Government entering such an alliance as it would be to conceive an English Government allying itself with a country which occupied portion of Britain.  As a result of that occupation of part of our country, we are forced, willy-nilly, into a position of neutrality in a war-like world.  Armchair critics sneer at us and say: &ldquo;Do these fools in Ireland think they can defend themselves against the world or against the forces of the world?&rdquo;  We are not fools.  We do not think we can do that, but we know that we have a sacred responsibility or two such responsibilities, if you like: to do our utmost, be that very much or very little, to defend the territory rightfully belonging to our people and not to sell our soul or our heritage by entering into a combination with a country which has grabbed, and continued to hold, portion of our territory.</P>
    <P>The whole position is difficult, delicate and dangerous, but that is no reason why we should shy at it.  All we can do is to adapt ourselves to the circumstances that exist and to face facts.  You will never get rid of facts by pretending that they are not there or by thinking that, by circling around them or turning the blind eye to them, they do not exist.  The facts are that we are here alone, living in a world of danger, <Col N="592" /> with no supplies of our own.  Production, food supply, agricultural and industrial production, are as important to a nation engaged in war, or even living in a world engaged in war, as are armies.  We must aim at having a nation prepared for the worst, without disorganising the life of the nation or interfering with production.  Some day we must arrive at some agreed defence policy.</P>
    <P>I thought, many years ago, on a motion moved to the Defence Forces Bill by the present Leader of the Opposition, that this Dáil of ours had reached something like an agreed defence programme, when we had an Army of approximately 7,000 men, all ranks, and when he, and the man who was subsequently his Minister for Defence, considered that such a Regular Army was beyond the financial capacity of this country to bear and that our defence plan should be based on a small Army, highly trained and expansible, with the maximum number of territorial volunteers outside barrack walls.  The then Minister for Defence welcomed that proposal and agreed to work towards that particular objective.  It would appear to anyone that, on the main principles of our defence scheme, agreement had been reached.</P>
    <P>The Government changed.  The present Leader of the Opposition became Taoiseach; a member of the present Opposition Front Bench became Minister for Defence, and that plan was immediately put into being and a Volunteer force alongside of a tiny Army was the order of the day.  From 1932 up to 1939, the strength of the Army never reached more than 6,000 men, all ranks.  It was 5,823, then 5,763, then 5,582, then 5,799, 5,885, 6,519; and in 1939, the year of the war, it was 7,262.  Outside and above that Army, outside the barracks, a Volunteer force was built up which became the second line of reserve in the event of war.</P>
    <P>Then the war came.  Naturally, during the war years, we had, as every country in the world had, an Army of great strength, immense force in comparison to the population, at immense cost.  Most of the Deputies responsible for the type of speeches to which I have <Col N="593" /> been listening for the last three years had little or no Army experience outside the war years.  Of course, it came as a shock to them when, after the war, the Army contracted to something like its normal strength.  I was an Army man during the war years and I remember thinking after the emergency years, in the twenties, when the Army was reorganised down to peace-time standards, that the Army was a joke, that they might as well liquidate it. After some time I found that it was all right, that it was the central training cadre around which a reserve could be built like flesh on to bone; with the Second Reserve at that time, the &ldquo;B&rdquo; Reserve, added in case of emergency.</P>
    <P>Now we are again in the post-war years and I am presenting to Dáil Éireann a Regular Army very considerably greater than that of a peace-time period.  It is 50 per cent. greater in numbers than ever was held in peace years by either the Fianna Fáil Government or the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  I am presenting also to Dáil Éireann, in this Estimate, for approval, reserves far greater in strength of numbers than this country ever had in peace years heretofore. At the same time, I am asking the Dáil to take the decision that our only life-line and our only hope, from a general defence point of view, in the military sense, is to get the maximum number of the manhood of this country trained in the Volunteer Reserve.  If half the words that are spun here in Dáil Éireann year after year, on Estimates, on Temporary Defence Forces Bills, were used outside in asking at meetings for a half-a-dozen men to join the F.C.A., then I would say that Deputies were contributing something to the country's defence.  You are contributing nothing to it by lambasting the Minister for Defence, whoever he may be, by criticising his Estimates, whatever they may be.  If you are sincere, if you are genuine, if you are really anxious about the defence of this country, you will see about getting our manhood into some kind of an Army-controlled organisation.</P>
    <P>The F.C.A. is not an organisation built up by this Government.  The F.C.A. was designed by my predecessor. <Col N="594" /> I want to give it a chance.  It is only on trial.  It may be a success. It may be a failure.  There is no effort on my part or on the part of the Army that will be spared towards making it a success.  It was a short time attestation service.  The period of attestion falls in this year.  We have devoted the best part of two years to trying to get down to the hard core of what is really there in the event of an emergency.  Numbers on paper are meaningless.  We tried to get down to what is really effective within those great numbers.  We find that there is quite a considerable force, a worthwhile force, a force that, if it were adequately trained, would be a very useful and valuable force.</P>
    <P>We have multiplied the number of regular personnel attached to the F.C.A.  We have multiplied the number of N.C.O.s.  We have practically doubled the number of officers.  If we can get refills of those falling in, if we can get the members to believe to what great extent this country has to look to the manhood of that civilian army as a protective screen in time of emergency, then there will be an injection of enthusiasm into that force that will ensure that a higher percentage would turn up for training than have turned up in previous years.</P>
    <P>The other side of the picture is: you have a force; you have a nominal roll; you have membership.  Of that huge nominal roll you have 10 or 12 per cent. turning up for training.  A little all-out effort would ensure that that 10 or 12 would be 20 or 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>Is it too much to ask Deputies in Dáil Éireann for real co-operation in the direction of trying to make the best of what we have, of trying to make more out of it than has been made out of it up to this?  Is there any useful purpose served by merely standing up and criticising, by merely saying: &ldquo;You have not this&rdquo;&mdash;and I admit we have not it&mdash;&ldquo;you are not getting that&rdquo;&mdash; and I admit we are not getting it. There are difficulties in the way of supplies. There are difficulties in the way of training.  What we have is a loyal, disciplined, highly-trained Army, each man more or less an expert in his own job, officers probably more highly trained in the theory of war than <Col N="595" /> officers in any country in the world, N.C.O.s of long service, well trained, recruits&mdash;privates&mdash;of a good brand. We have, outside of that, these large numbers but not turning up for training in any greater percentage than I have indicated.  Surely co-operation and interest in defence lie along the line of trying to stimulate greater interest and greater enthusiasm in the manhood of the country for equipping themselves towards the responsible task of defence.</P>
    <P>This country won its liberty, its freedom&mdash;the part of the country that is free&mdash;by the voluntary effort of generations, without expert guidance, without the assistance of any central, highly trained, expert, regular army, just by the enthusiasm of the membership, by the stimulation that was given to membership by the public men of the time.  Having secured that liberty and that independence, is it too much to ask that the public men of our time should keep up the enthusiasm for the defence of the liberties already won?</P>
    <P>I must point out, in the first place, to the Dáil that the framework of this Estimate, as regards the strength or numbers of Army personnel, is the peace establishment of the Army, which is substantially the same as that adopted as far back as November, 1946, and consists of 1,356 officers and 11,572 other ranks.  As there seems to be a considerable amount of confusion on this point, it should be remembered that, during the emergency, no details regarding numbers or stores were given to the Dáil, and the whole expenditure on the Forces was given in one total sum under one sub-head.  That method of presenting the Estimate obtained down to the financial year 1945-46.  In that year, the total amount was again actually printed in the Estimates Volume, but at a later stage and before the Estimate was taken in the House, the Department substituted an Estimate under the normal peace-time sub-heads. Regarding numbers, however, as the peace establishment had not been fixed at the time, the numbers of personnel given represented only the estimated average strength over the year.  This also obtained in 1946-47.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="596" /> In 1947-48, the peace establishment again was used as the framework of the Estimate and has continued to be so used ever since.  But the Dáil is not asked to vote or to approve or to provide money for that establishment. The numbers are only given for the information of the Dáil and what the Dáil is asked to vote is money to pay and maintain a proportion of that establishment.  Hence, at the end of each of the relevant sub-heads, after showing what the cost of each establishment would be, a deduction is made in respect of numbers being below strength during the financial year. What those numbers are is not shown in the Estimate but is always indicated by the Minister in his opening statement introducing the Estimate.  Thus, in 1947-48, against an establishment (including the Construction Corps) of 15,330 all ranks, provision was made for only 11,122 all ranks (including 1,482 for the Construction Corps), leaving an Army strength of 9,640.</P>
    <P>Against an establishment of 13,079 we provided in 1948-49 for only 9,358, and in 1949-50 for 8,077 all ranks.  It will be seen, therefore, as regards numbers, that since 1947 the Defence Estimate has always been presented to the Dáil within the same framework of the peace establishment, less deductions.</P>
    <P>The present Estimate for 1950-51 proceeds on the same lines.  Under sub-heads A, E, and P (2), there is shown the peace establishment of 1,356 officers and 11,572 other ranks, but at the foot of each of these sub-heads certain deductions are made in respect of numbers being below strength during the financial year, so that, in effect, the Dáil is asked to approve and to vote the pay and maintenance not of the peace establishment, but of an average of 1,081 officers and 6,750 other ranks.  In addition, provision is made for 13 chaplains, 130 cadets and 98 nurses&mdash; that is a total establishment of 8,072 all ranks and services.  The total gross cost of that force in pay and allowance is £2,661,353, or approximately 64.42 per cent. of the total gross Vote.</P>
    <P>For the Reserve, First Line, there is no establishment, and the Estimate <Col N="597" /> is based on the average anticipated strength during the year with deductions in respect of both officers and men who do not attend for annual training.  The estimated average is 644 officers and 5,337 other ranks.  The total gross cost of that line is £140,319, but, allowing for the fact that the attendance of officers will probably not exceed 90 per cent. and that of men 70 per cent. a deduction has been made of £32,526, leaving the cost of pay, grants and maintenance at £107,793 or 2.61 per cent. of the Estimate.</P>
    <P>For the Reserve, Second Line, which consists mainly of the F.C.A. with the small naval component, there is again no establishment and the Estimate proceeds on the basis of the average estimated strength with deductions in respect both of non-effectivity and of non-attendance at annual training. With a voluntary force such as the F.C.A. it is impossible to forecast with any degree of reasonable accuracy what will be the average effective strength for the year.  For instance, when this Estimate was framed, the effective strength of other ranks was taken as about 30,000, but since then a complete departmental audit of the rolls, etc., of all units during the past two months showed that the units were carrying about 8,540 non-effectives. This makes the effective strength something in the region of 21,500 all ranks, and in estimating the cost we have to consider what proportion of that number will attend for annual training. Here the best line to take is the numbers attending in 1949, and they were 13½ per cent. in the case of other ranks and 27 per cent. in the case of officers. Making due allowance, therefore, for the two factors of non-attendance at annual training and ineffectivity, the gross Estimate of £298,837 for the line has been cut by about 35 per cent. to, approximately, £191,441.  To this must be added £16,000 as Grants-in-Aid to the force, so that the estimated cost of this line will be £207,441 or 5.02 per cent. of the Estimate.</P>
    <P>Finally, as regards personnel, a fourth heavy item of expenditure is that for civilians.  The present Estimate provides for about 2,050, including 520 civil servants engaged in the administration of the Department and <Col N="598" /> about 1,530 others attached in various professional, technical, skilled and unskilled capacities to units throughout the Army.  The cost of this civilian body is £632,226 or 15.30 per cent. of the Vote.  In previous debates some critical references were made to the high numbers of civilians attached to or in attendance on our technical corps, transport corps, air force, etc.  It is a very unsatisfactory position.  Our naval service, air service, transport service and engineering service are all to a very great extent serviced by civilians. Civilians are not mobile in the event of war and it means that if these particular services move away from their base they move away from their service personnel.  That is the position not only in our Army I think at the present moment, but in the British Army.  It was a direct outcrop of a war decision in both armies regarding a readjustment of pay on the star system.  Heretofore technical men were paid especially high rates of pay and they were attested as soldiers.  Since the alteration in the pay system here a man was paid according to the number of stars he had earned joining as a recruit on the lower basis and getting up according to time and standards to a high rate of pay and we have found&mdash;and I believe the same applies across the water&mdash;that you just cannot recruit tradesmen.  That is a position that has to be looked into.</P>
    <P>The pay and maintenance of the personnel thus outlined constitutes, as pay always does, a primary charge in the Vote, and from what has been said it is clear that the first cost of the Army, including reserves and civilians, as covered by this Estimate, is £3,608,813 or 87.35 per cent. of the Vote.</P>
    <P>For general, as distinct from warlike stores, the sum of £323,603 is provided and covers a miscellany of items such as medicines, mechanical transport, petrol and oils, horses, equipment for workshops and for training, tools and plant for engineers, and the maintenance of barracks.  The cost represents 7.83 per cent. of the Vote.</P>
    <P>For warlike stores, there is provided £33,100 under sub-head O and £94,871 under the regular sub-head P&mdash;a total of £127,971, which is £10,000 more than the corresponding figure for 1949-50. <Col N="599" /> This total is, however, only 3.10 per cent. of the Army Vote, and may seem to compare unfavourably with the amount other countries are spending on their armaments.  But here we must face facts.  We are now in a seller's market and we cannot get even the modest items we require and are willing to pay for.  In former years it was possible to arrange for the purchase of equipment direct with the supplier, but now we have to work direct to the Ministry of Supply, who, when they have ascertained what stores are available, distribute them in an order of priority among several nations who are seeking the stores.</P>
    <P>I referred to the fact earlier on that Great Britain, America, France and countries that it is possible or might be possible in the normal way for us to buy from will only sell to us after they have supplied countries that are in alliance with them and countries that are more or less tagged on to such an alliance.  Therefore, with regard to the supply of materials of this kind, we have gone very much back.  Moreover, the procedure is complicated. First we have to send early in the financial year a list&mdash;called a &ldquo;forecast&rdquo;&mdash;of all our requirements, but that forecast binds neither party to the transaction.</P>
    <P>At a later stage the Ministry sends us a list of available stocks, and from this we make what is called a &ldquo;firm demand.&rdquo;  But here again the demand is not a contract, for at a still later stage the Ministry, having decided what quantities of our firm demand will be made available, sends us a &ldquo;sales agreement&rdquo; which, when signed, constitutes a contract, but again gives no guarantee as regards the date of delivery.  A good illustration of the whole procedure and the difficulties inherent therein is afforded by the Estimate for 1949-50.  The forecast for that year totalled £125,788 and provision for that amount was, accordingly, made in the Estimate.  At the &ldquo;firm demand&rdquo; stage this was reduced to £48,890, and after conferences between officials of both Governments in London in December, 1949, &ldquo;sales agreements&rdquo; were promised for mid-January, <Col N="600" /> 1950, but in mid-March, two weeks before the close of the financial year, &ldquo;sales agreements&rdquo; have materialised only to the extent of about £3,800.  In pointing out these difficulties, we are not making any charge of unfair discrimination or bias. We have always been facilitated in every possible manner.  But the fact is that the articles are in short supply, and we must take our place in the queue of 22 other countries seeking to get them.</P>
    <P>As regards the proposed Grant-in-Aid to the Irish Red Cross Society, I should explain that most, if not all, of the sum of £10,000 which is provided will be used to recoup to the society the money which it is expending in caring, at the request of the Government, for the refugees who landed at Cork from Sweden last September. They were accommodated at Rockgrove Military Camp where they have since been looked after with the utmost care by the Cork branch of the society.  A number have already left for Canada and the majority of the remaining refugees have secured <i>visas</i> and will proceed to Canada in the near future. I am happy to have this opportunity of paying tribute to the work done by the Red Cross Society which is in accordance with the high principles of the Red Cross.</P>
    <P>The financial implications of the Defence Vote may, therefore, be summarised under the following general headings:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The Dáil is aware that during the last financial year the pay and allowance scheme for the Army was altered. I take it that Deputies are familiar with the new rates of pay and allowances. I think the only other thing that remains for me to report to the Dáil is the result of the recruiting <Col N="601" /> drive that lasted for approximately three months from January to the end of March.  The number of recruits who presented themselves up to the 31st March, 1950, was 2,109.  The nnmber accepted was 1,104, or approximately one half the number who presented themselves.  That leaves the total strength of the Army, all ranks, according to the latest figures given to me, at 8,113.  Recruiting is still continuing but only in the normal way. Actually, I think since the 31st March 57 others have been accepted.  If there are any other points arising out of the statement, I shall be happy to deal with them.  Most of the figures I have here are merely a repetition of what is in the Book of Estimates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration. In doing so, I want to say that I am not criticising the items contained in the Estimates, but rather am I concerned with its omissions.  The Minister's speech has made it abundantly clear that the old maxim of the poacher turned gamekeeper is very true.  Rarely have I listened to such audacious effrontery as I have listened to from the Minister this evening.  If anyone thinks my language is exaggerated I would refer him to the discussions on the Defence Estimates which took place in this House when I was Minister for Defence.  In those days I had to listen to the abuse hurled at me by the Minister who now appeals to the Deputies in opposition for honesty, for fair and reasonable criticism and so on.  Indeed, I can emphasise the fact by telling the House that a member of one of the Parties, now a Minister in the Coalition group, dissociated himself from the remarks that were made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard Deputies make appeals from time to time to keep the Army clear of politics.  I think I can reasonably say that during my period as Minister for Defence I have no complaint to register in respect of any Deputy endeavouring to link the Army directly with any particular political Party.  But so long as this Estimate must be discussed here, and I know of no other place in which it can be discussed, so long will there appear to be <Col N="602" /> an attempt to link the Army with politics.</P>
    <P>To my mind a most dangerous situation has developed.  It is dangerous to the Army at the present time and dangerous to the future of the Army. I refer to the fact that if, on every occasion there is a change of Government, there is also a change of policy in respect of the Army then there can be no future for the Army.  It cannot develop along any particular line. Suppose, for instance, a Government decided on a particular line of policy and suppose that shortly after that decision a change of Government takes place and that policy changes with the Government, then there can be no future for the Army.  It would be well for us to examine the position that developed before the present Government came into office.  It was a development that was not accepted by the present Minister.  Round about the time of the change one had the impression that the Minister could hardly contain himself and could hardly wait until he occupied the ministerial seat before he would change the policy then in operation.  Probably that was because that particular policy came into being during the period of office of the Fianna Fáil Government.  The position as far as that policy was concerned was that in 1945 I was presented by the Chief of Staff with a scheme to which he asked me to give serious consideration and, if I were satisfied with it, to present it to the Government.  I examined the scheme and in due course I submitted it to the Government.  The Government considered it at a number of meetings over quite a long period.  Having examined it to the extent that laymen could examine it, the Government then decided to set up a sub-committee of the Cabinet with the then Taoiseach as its chairman in order to meet the Army specialists responsible for the scheme and to discuss it with them.  Again a number of meetings took place.</P>
    <P>Again there was considerable discussion. The scheme was examined in detail and a modified form of it was accepted.  It was not exactly what the Army authorities wanted.  It was what the Government thought the State <Col N="603" /> could pay for.  That was the only reason why we did not accept the scheme in its entirety.  We were conscious of the fact that if we brought in the scheme in its original form it would be strenuously opposed in this House on the ground of cost alone.  We believed, and so did the Army authorities, that it would be accepted by the House in its modified form because of the serious situation through which the country had just passed.  The scheme accepted was that of 12,500 men.  The Minister can smile and regard it as a joke.</P>

      <P>This scheme was not a scheme of the Fianna Fáil Government. It was a scheme put up by men who have devoted their lives to service in the Army&mdash;men who have studied military science, who have undergone military courses and who, in addition, have had experience of a condition of affairs in this country that never existed before.  These were the gentlemen who produced this scheme.  They produced it as a result of the experience through which they had gone during <Col N="604" /> the period of the emergency and, trying to foresee the future, they hoped no other General Headquarters Staff would ever have to experience a similar state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who, then, were these officers who conceived and placed this plan before the Fianna Fáil Government?  I think it will be agreed by every Deputy in the House that the officers of the Army have no affiliations with any political Party.  I think that that will be agreed by everybody.  It is true enough to say that they are entitled to think politically if they wish to think politically and to vote.  However, every section of the community is entitled to do that and they are exercising their rights within the Constitution when they do that.  I want, however, to emphasise that during the civil strife each and every one of these gentlemen was on an opposite side to the members of the Government to whom they had submitted the scheme.  That did not affect the judgment of the then Government.  The then Government did not say: &ldquo;Which side were these fellows on in the Civil War?&rdquo;  They knew these men were specialists in their profession and, because they were specialists in their profession, they decided to examine carefully the scheme which was placed before them. Having done so, they, after consultation, produced this modified example of the scheme.  That was the scheme which was then brought in here by me, through the medium of a Defence Estimate, in 1946.  I introduced it then in the hope, as the Army itself had that hope, that the scheme would be acceptable to the House.  Instead of being accepted by the House it was met with the most virulent type of opposition imaginable.  Not only did those Deputies who ordinarily discussed this particular Estimate oppose it but the present Minister for Finance, then Deputy McGilligan, who very rarely participated in debates on the Defence Estimate, was brought in as a special reinforcement.  In a speech, which covered no less than 13 columns of the Official Report, he had this to say&mdash;Volume 100, columns 644-45: &ldquo;If we are to have a real Army to defend this country, it is not £4,500,000 we need but £10,500,000.  Are we going to <Col N="605" /> spend that?&rdquo;  Continuing, he said: &ldquo;Can this country afford the equipment which is necessary to give us what I may describe as a real Army, as opposed to a sham?  If the Deputy wants to argue the question&rdquo;&mdash;he was referring to a speech by a Deputy from the Government side of the House&mdash;&ldquo;as to whether the country could have been occupied in 1939 or 1940, I ask him to think of a couple of things. Knowing well, as he must, the state of the Army at that stage, and could it have kept out anything?&rdquo;  That was what was running through Deputy McGilligan's mind.</P>
    <P>The answer I would be inclined to give to the question which the then Deputy posed as to whether the Army of 1939 and 1940 could have kept out anything is that any army of considerable force attempting to occupy this country in 1939 and 1940 could not have been defeated by the Army which we then had.  However, I should like to add that it certainly would, if the Government had decided that it should defend the nation, have defended the nation with all its might and courage and skill and, when it was defeated, as it probably would be defeated, the people, in the traditional style to which a tribute was paid by the Minister a few minutes ago, would have continued their defence of the nation as all the generations before them had done and the occupation troops would have known very well that the fight had not ended when the Army was defeated.</P>
    <P>The answer to the question posed by the then Deputy as to whether we were to have a real army or a sham army would be somewhat as follows.  I should say, first of all, that the only alternatives I know to a sham army are a real army or no army, and it is dishonest for any Government&mdash;I do not care whether it is a Fianna Fáil Government or the present Government&mdash; to preserve in this country any army that could be regarded as a sham army.  If we are to have an army in this country it must be an army that will be regarded by the nations outside these shores as capable of providing sufficient protection against another outside nation's coming in here and <Col N="606" /> attempting to use our territory as a base for attack on some other nation. Naturally, if a nation cannot be assured that that is the position, it is almost certain that we shall find ourselves occupied in due course.  I say, as I have repeatedly said, that were it not for the troops we had in the field during the emergency this country would have been occupied.  I do not think that at any stage during the emergency&mdash;at one period we had as many as 42,000 Regular Army men in the field&mdash;the Estimate ever reached £10,500,000.  It is quite possible that the same Army to-day would cost much more than it cost from 1940 to 1946. However that may be, the fact of the matter is that, at the time the Deputy was talking, £10,500,000 would have given us an army even greatly in excess of the Army we then had.</P>
    <P>I said a moment ago that it would be wrong for this nation to maintain within its shores an army that could be regarded as a sham army, that it would be deceiving the people in the first instance and that it would be a futile use of valuable money, in the second instance. We, on this side of the House, do not often agree with the Minister for Agriculture but, strange to say, during the course of the emergency Deputy Dillon, as he then was, had these words of wisdom to say in respect of the Defence Forces&mdash;he made the statement on the Supplementary Estimate in February, 1941:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I believe it is the essence of financial wisdom to provide whatever money may be necessary, however and wherever we can, to ensure that the defences of this country will be as adequate as we can make them to meet any contingency that may arise. It would be the height of folly to save money for the invader to collect.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are words of Deputy Dillon which, I am sure, will be remembered long after many other words which he has uttered will be forgotten.  Let us examine this question of the 12,500 Army that so amuses the present Minister for Defence every time it is mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">

      <P>The 12,500 Army would in due course, it was hoped, provide a Reserve which would give to the Army authorities that degree of safety for which they were always looking.  The Minister said he never saw it.  The fact of the matter is that in 1946 we were demobilising the Army, as the Minister knows, as fast as we could demobilise them.  We endeavoured to attract back into the Army all those highly skilled private soldiers and N.C.O.s, as well as quite a number of officers, who had served during the emergency.  We failed to secure as many as we desired. There were other attractions.  The men had been in the Army for a period of six years and they wanted a change. They wanted to get back to civilian life and there were stories of El Dorados across the water.  There were also attractions here at home.</P>
      <P>Large numbers of men in the mechanical transport were able to find very remunerative work here in Ireland.  For these and many other reasons we found it impossible to get these men to continue in the service.</P>
      <P>In mid-December of 1947 we initiated a recruiting campaign.  That campaign was run completely and entirely by the Army authorities.  The Army authorities selected the men whom they regarded as being ideally suited to go round and address meetings at recruiting posts and elsewhere in an effort to induce as many of the young men as possible to come into the Army.  That had gone on for less than two months when the change of Government took place.  Then the Minister endeavours to twit us with the fact that we never got the 12,500 Army.  We never got it for the simple reason that you could not see him for dust rushing to his ministerial office in order to cancel the contracts for that campaign and to bring recruiting, as far as that campaign was concerned, to an end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>You implied that everybody here is tricking you.  The great weakness of the Minister for Defence is that he takes every little criticism of his Department or any criticism of his Estimate as a personal insult, as an attack on his honour, on his character or something like that. We want him to get away from that attitude.  He will develop a hide in due course.  He will have to now, because, as far as we are concerned on this side of the House, we are going to plead for the Army what the specialists of the Army themselves asked us to give them in order that they could provide the security for the people of the nation that they believed the nation should have and was entitled to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="609" /> Let me again develop this point in regard to the 12,500 Army.  We invited men to join the Army for 12 years&mdash;two years in the Regular Forces and ten on the Reserve at the end of the two years.  I should like if the House would listen to this point because I feel that every Deputy is just as anxious as we are on this side to see that the nation's liberty, which was so hardly won, is safeguarded properly.  I want also to emphasise to the House that the plan about which I am talking is the plan of the Army experts, some of them men who had fought against the members of the then Government but that, as I have said, was not allowed to influence the judgment of the Fianna Fáil Government in accepting that plan as being something that the nation was entitled to get.</P>
    <P>With an Army of 12,500 men, we could have, at the end of two years, about 5,000 men going into the Reserve ranks every year.  In five or six years there would be at the back of the Army a Reserve of from 20,000 to 30,000 men.  Can anyone realise the peace of mind it would be to a general officer commanding, who knew that within 72 hours of the start of an emergency, such as that with which the late general headquarters staff had been confronted, he would have behind him an Army of 30,000 men, according to the strength of the Reserve?  In addition to that, he would also have the knowledge that he had the Volunteer force the Minister has been emphasising as so necessary to the nation.</P>
    <P>What that does is this.  In a period of emergency England, or any other nation that is interested, as England would be, in the territory of this country, would feel assured that there was within the four shores of Ireland an Army capable of preventing another nation from coming in here, occupying its territory and using it against herself. That is all we are asking for in making our demands for an Army that will provide these safeguards for the people.</P>
    <P>There is a sum of £78,000 on the Book of Estimates and that goes to do many things, but in respect of the Army it does practically nothing.  So far as that tremendous increase of <Col N="610" /> £12,750,000 is concerned, it does practically nothing with regard to the Army.  The money will be expended in various directions, probably in directions that we would all support, but the words of Deputy Dillon&mdash;as he then was; he is now the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;still remain, that if we have not got an Army here that will provide the protection necessary, an invader will come in, the money will be gone, and your Army will be gone. That is the position we want to insure against.</P>
    <P>I will quote the Minister.  He quoted me, and it is no harm that we should have a throw-back.  The Minister, as recently as last February, had this to say&mdash;he was speaking on the Temporary Provisions Bill and he was reported in Volume 119, column 884:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...as things are, we have to rely on our own strength to hold this island against anybody who may be an aggressor.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I thoroughly agree with these sentiments, and every member on this side of the House thoroughly agrees with them.  These are the things we have been saying all along; these are the things we are prepared to back up.  We are going to support anything the Minister will do to provide an Army that will be prepared to meet any aggressor, whoever it may be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>But you will not support the Army your leader wanted in 1932.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not catch what the Minister said, but I want to tell the House that the present strength of the Army, plus the present strength of the Reserve, is only a few hundred in excess of the figure we are asking for the Regular Army.  The combined strength of the Regular Army to-day, plus that of the Reserve Force, the First Line, is only a few hundred in excess of the 12,500 Army we are appealing to the Minister to bring into being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the critical situation which exists in the world.  Perhaps there was never a more critical situation.  It is even more critical now than the situation which confronted the world in late 1938 and early <Col N="611" /> in 1939.  Already we have lost two valuable years in which we could have been producing from the Regular Army a strong Reserve.  These two years can yet be made up if common-sense is used and if the Minister and the Government will not try to regard this recommendation of the General Headquarters Staff as something that was conceived in the minds of the Fianna Fáil Government. It was not conceived in the minds of the Fianna Fáil Government; it was conceived in the minds of the Army experts.  We, believing in the ability of these men to appreciate the situation, provided them with the minimum&mdash;not the maximum&mdash;of their demands and it is this minimum that we are asking the Minister to give consideration to.</P>
    <P>There is very little use in twitting me about the 9,000 men in the Book of Estimates or laughing at the 12,500 Army that is only mythical as far as the figures go because they were never reached.  They were never reached for the simple reason that the change of Government brought about a change of policy.  I regard that as a very serious state of affairs.  I have said that £78,000,000 will be expended on various services.  Of that vast sum something like £270,000 will be utilised as an additional amount for the Army. When we examine the £270,000 we find that £231,000 will go into additional pay for certain Army personnel, leaving the residue of £39,000 to be utilised under other sub-heads for similar increases in pay for other personnel. In effect it means that no extra provision, good, bad or indifferent, has been made for the Army in this financial year.  That serious state of affairs ought to be altered and I appeal strongly to Deputies on the other side of the House to regard it as their duty to impress on the Minister that he should provide for the nation the safeguards that the Army authorities feel the nation should get.</P>
    <P>I was rather concerned, as I was going through the Book of Estimates, when I found, under one sub-head&mdash;I think it is sub-head A, dealing with the pay of officers, cadets, N.C.O.s and men&mdash;figures indicating the Air Corps flying pay.  There is a decrease there <Col N="612" /> of £1,375.  I take it that when dealing with an Estimate such as this that decrease might be described as infinitesimal. No one is going to worry too much about the smallness of it, but it indicates a decrease.  That is the point that I want to drive home.  Deputies who have regularly participated in the discussion on the Estimate for the Department of Defence will recall that of all the corps and services in the Army, the Air Corps was the one in respect of which appeals were made to me as Minister, year after year, to increase the strength of it.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the decrease may be infinitesimal when compared with the total Estimate.  There may be some reason for it.  It may be due to some readjustment of pay or to a readjustment of one kind or another.  That, however, is not explained in the Book of Estimates.  The ominous thing, as I have said, is that it is a decrease.  I should like if the Minister, when concluding, would give an explanation of what the decrease does in fact mean.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head J&mdash;Mechanical Transport&mdash;there is a reduction of £13,000. Everybody knows that armies to-day do not march on their feet or their stomachs.  They are carried by mechanical transport.  This is the age of speed, and so I regard it as a retrograde step that we should have this reduction of £13,000 in the way of capital expenditure on vehicles.  Under sub-head P &mdash;Warlike Stores&mdash;there is also a slight reduction.  I am well aware of the difficulties to which the Minister has referred.  They are there, and they have got to be overcome.  I know that orders for warlike stores have to be put in by a certain date, and that if they are not in by that date they do not receive consideration and are not put on the list for supplies for the coming year.  I suppose it is not necessary to urge the Minister&mdash; I take it that he is doing his best&mdash;as regards the amount to be spent on the warlike stores that are available.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head P (2)&mdash;Naval service&mdash;there is a monetary increase, but, strange to say, while that is so there is a decrease in the personnel of something like 151.  Now 151 individuals constitute two crews for corvettes.  I am sure Deputies are <Col N="613" /> aware of the fact that the training of a seaman is a very much more difficult task than the training of an ordinary soldier.  Under normal peace-time conditions, you can turn out a soldier inside 12 months.</P>
    <P>The period for a highly trained soldier will perhaps take longer.  It is quite impossible, however, to turn out a seaman, to give him all the experience that is necessary by bringing him to sea and by putting him through the various phases of drill on board ship so as to produce an efficient seaman, in less than three years.  Therefore, it seems to me a pity that this decrease of 151 should be taking place at a critical period such as this.  It means that two crews for two corvettes would not be available if the corvettes were available to-morrow.  We should have, and always did have, plans for crews in excess of the number of vessels which we held.  If what appears in the Estimate is correct, it would appear that we will have two crews less than the number we actually require.  That, to my mind, is a very serious thing.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head P (1)&mdash;Air-Raid Precautions&mdash;there is a very small reduction. In fact, the total sum allotted to this particular sub-head is very small&mdash; something like £1,000.  In this respect we appear to be doing little or nothing. It looks as if we are doing practically nothing.  Again, I would urge on the Minister to ensure that there are skeleton organisations in every large town in the country.  Deputies who take an interest in defence forces will know that in England, at the present time, there is a high-powered campaign of publicity in the case of air-raid defence.  That, again, only goes to show that in England they are preparing for the worst while, no doubt, hoping for the best.  They are doing the logical common-sense thing in preparing for something that they see coming.  I feel that in every large centre, such as Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and the rest we, at least, should have a skeleton organisation of air-raid precautions so that if there is imminent danger the members of these skeleton organisations, like the regular soldiers in the Army, will be there to give the necessary training, as a result <Col N="614" /> of their own experience, to the people who will come in to link up in that particular defence service.</P>
    <P>I was also sorry to see that under sub-head C&mdash;Civilian Employment&mdash; something like 98 individuals are having their services dispensed with.  I have come to the conclusion that these individuals must be some of the Old I.R.A. who were brought in to give service in the various barracks from time to time.  I have come to that conclusion by reason of the fact that the sum of money in question is roughly equivalent to the amount of money which these men received in pay.  If there is to be some curtailment in that service, I think the last people to suffer such an infliction should be those men who, in the main, were responsible for the establishment of this State.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say on the Estimate. I will conclude by making an appeal to the Minister not to take the criticism which comes from this side of the House as personal criticism of himself.  He seems to adopt that attitude on every occasion when he is replying.  He replies as if he, himself, had been attacked, whereas we, on this side, are simply urging him to do something which I, as an ex-Minister for Defence, would have dearly liked Deputies on this side to do when I was Minister&mdash;that is, to support me in my desire to produce an Army, a Reserve force and a Volunteer force that would be capable of giving to the people and to the nation the safeguards that both are entitled to.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to say that the only alternatives to the sham army to which Deputy McGilligan referred are a real army or no army, and I seriously suggest to Deputies that we want a real army.  We cannot do without an army.  We do not want an army merely to act, as the Minister said when in opposition, on ceremonial occasions or as an auxiliary to the police force.  We want an army here in the same position as the army of every nation which exercises its own liberty and its own functions in regard to that liberty&mdash;an army capable of providing the necessary protection for ourselves and the necessary safeguards to other nations that the territory of this <Col N="615" /> nation will not be used for attacks against them.</P>

      <P>The Estimate for Defence is, in its very essence, something to which this House must address itself in a very serious way and I hope, in a spirit that is non-controversial, to try to help the Minister and to inform the House and, through the House, the country, with regard to the extraordinary situation&mdash;in the main, one over which we have no control&mdash;in which this country finds itself.  I am going to say some things during the course of this debate which I feel are going to be deliberately misconstrued and, possibly, deliberately twisted, but I am going to say them because tonight, in a very serious way, on to the records of this House I intend to put a warning which I feel it my duty to issue to this Government and this Dáil and, through the Dáil, to the country.</P>
      <P>We are in a position of jeopardy and there is no use in our seeking to minimise it or arguing about the number of personnel in any army when dealing with the problem.  Defence, as I think even Deputy Traynor will readily agree, while it may be in a limited, basic way related to man-power, has in the modern world drifted to a considerable extent into the realm of higher physics and chemistry, of which Deputy de Valera has more knowledge than I have, and the wars of the future will be wars in relation to which we, as responsible people, will have to face the problem of rapidly and immediately educating, by any method in our power, not alone soldiers but the entire civilian population of the country in regard to a new and completely different type of aggression.  If the next war is to come, none of us can deny that, in the main, whether it be the atom bomb or the hydrogen bomb, it will be a war of unique maniacal destructiveness.  Never more true will Shakespeare's words ring than in the event of another world war because it will be a matter of: Cry havoc, and let loose the science of war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I want to refer to in a very serious way is the responsibility that we may be cloaking ourselves in the matter of our attitude to the partition <Col N="616" /> of this country.  Nobody in the House realises more firmly than I how unjust, how unsustainable and how odious is the occupation of part of this country by a foreign Power and it is true that this Government and this entire united Dáil have voiced their protest against it; but are we allowing ourselves for a moment, in our immediate concern with that situation, to jeopardise, as we may well be jeopardising, the future of the complete country in that game?  The Minister for Defence was right in one thing he said, that in a future world war we shall have to be somewhere&mdash;not in between.  Are we being completely wise in our attitude and would it not be wiser for the Minister, as I propose to urge, to bring into this House some day all the implications of the Atlantic Pact and all the implications of the modern defence schemes which are being conceived in the world and to let the House deliberate upon them in a very serious way, because we may be casting away, in our anxiety to meet an immediate urgent political problem, the whole future of this nation?</P>
    <P>I have said that I feel that what I say will be distorted, but I am going to take that chance because I feel the time has come when some voice in this House should be raised to ask that in a very deliberate way we inquire into the line we are taking, because there is no doubt that even with the best brains and the best intentions of the best soldiers in the world&mdash;and our own Army officers, N.C.O.s and men will rank with those of any Army in any part of the world&mdash;without modern equipment, without the knowledge of modern defence methods and without the knowledge of how to counter potential attacks, these unfortunate men, officers, N.C.O.s and men, are like the civilian population, completely in the dark and in a completely new situation in which all their training is going to be of but little avail.</P>
    <P>I do not want to approach this debate in anything like a controversial spirit.  I want to try to get the whole of Dáil Éireann facing up to what is an immense responsibility not only to ourselves, to our children born already, but to untold generations of this nation, if it is to survive, who may <Col N="617" /> some day be our judges and our taskmasters and who may ask why we, in 1950, facing the gathering world war clouds again, did not examine in a deliberate way as responsible individuals, where we were drifting.  I will offer no criticism of the Minister.  He is in a cleft stick and cannot stir.  I firmly believe that this House would be unanimous in giving him all the money he wanted, if he could get the material and the warlike stores we need, but we have to face this fact, that, outside a certain type of alliance, we are not going to get that material and that equipment, and not going to be in a position to enable this nation to face any future aggression.</P>
    <P>We have to face, once and for all, an issue that I believe is already knit across the breadth of the world.  The next war will be a war of ideologies, the Christian ideology against that of the new, pagan, materialistic Communism. In that particular situation, we cannot stay neutral.  We must realise here and now that no neutrality will be possible.  I am, in an earnest and responsible way, raising my voice to ask the Minister, and through him the Government, to bring into the forum here for discussion the full implication of the present situation, so that in a deliberate way, not clouded by any immediate issue, we, as responsible Deputies who will have to answer for the stewardship of this country for which we are temporarily responsible, may have an opportunity of analysing the situation.</P>
    <P>I know perfectly well that officers from our Army in the course of the last few years and, indeed, in the years when Deputy Traynor was here as Minister for Defence, went into the military schools of foreign armies all over the world and there merited credit for themselves and distinction for their country.  We know they are very good and it ill behoves any of us to criticise them, but they might well find themselves in the position that, good and all as they are, they have only outmoded and outworn tools.  This generation and this Dáil may, in subsequent generations, be indicted and rightfully indicted, for not having had the courage to face this very real issue now. <Col N="618" /> No one admires more than I do the fact that the Government did take the view that we would join no Atlantic Pact while Ireland is partitioned.  It was a manly and a noble gesture, but in the present ominous situation, having made our protest, we should carefully examine the position that too rigid adherence to that attitude may leave us in.</P>
    <P>We do not want the British in Ireland&mdash;we never did&mdash;but at least there is one thing I earnestly appeal for, and direct the Government's mind to: we want to ensure that no wilful omission or neglect on our part may bring about a situation in which there will be no Ireland for anyone to live in.  I am sure other Deputies who, like myself, are ex-members of the Defence Forces, interested in the development of modern warfare, interested in the theory of modern defence, interested in the theory of the inevitability of the coming war, realise how changed equipment is, how changed warlike stores are, even in a period of 12 months.  We realise that many of our units are equipped with the rifles of the first world war.  What purpose the Lee-Enfield rifle may serve in the future age of strato-cruiser atomic bombing I do not know, but I desire to direct attention to the fact that we may be unconsciously, through force of circumstances, shirking from action that, though it may have the stigma of momentary unpopularity, may have its vindication in the courage of men and women who were straight enough and honest enough to sink whatever may have been political advantage or the advantage of the hour to ensure that this nation of ours had a future.</P>
    <P>When I think of our young officers coming back from the latest type of tank courses and radar courses, when I think of our pilots coming back, having merited distinction in the handling of new super-sound speed jets, I feel appalled that that knowledge, so hardly acquired and so creditably displayed, is to be dissipated through lack of equipment to train further personnel &mdash;and that lack of equipment being due to our allowing the immediate view of the present situation to cloud what may be the destiny of this country.</P>
    <P>I know, of my own knowledge, going <Col N="619" /> in and out of the Army to meet many of my former colleagues and still friends, that the Army does feel that its best intentions are falling short through lack of equipment.  We can send our good young officers abroad to learn modern methods and modern technique, but how can they impart the knowledge to anybody at home when they cannot get the type of clothing or the anti-gas equipment to demonstrate their knowledge in a practical way to the civilian population?</P>
    <P>I wish to say quite seriously that, no matter how bitterly I resent the partition of Ireland, I would take the responsibility here of urging that, even if we had seemingly to condone it by taking part in an Atlantic Pact to come within the defence zone of the Atlantic, we might then be showing more courage than by standing in deliberate isolation that might mean ultimate annihilation.  The time has come for somebody&mdash;somebody more responsible possibly than I, somebody riper in experience and knowledge than I&mdash;to face the issue that we are gradually ticking away the valuable weeks, months and years, if years it is to be, before we find ourselves plunged into another world catastrophe, into a cataclysm, into another blood-bath, another mass extermination of nations, and we are wilfully ticking away those hours if we do not face the fact that it is essential to the future of the country that we should have both up-to-date knowledge and equipment if we are to survive at all.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister and to his colleagues in the Government to come in here some day to this deliberative assembly and let us&mdash;and the people of Ireland whom we represent and who are our masters&mdash;judge the full implications of our present position, so that we may take a solemn and responsible decision, in the light of the present circumstances, which are fraught with so many dangers.  I want to make that appeal in a very earnest way because I think we do not at times realise how sinister, how ominous, how far-reaching are the tentacles of the new materialism under the guise of Communism or how increasingly necessary it is for this small nation, bulwark of Catholic philosophy, <Col N="620" /> to gird itself with all the defences that the modern Republic of the great Americas can place at its disposal to ensure that, an outpost once, the island of saints and scholars, the seat of learning of a dark Western Europe, will remain a bulwark and ensure that the future world will see the light of a Christian ideal and a Catholic philosophy.</P>
    <P>To come down to the question of the Army itself.  Sometimes I feel terribly sorry for the Army, sorry that ex-Ministers for Defence, like Deputy Traynor, Ministers for Defence, like Deputy O'Higgins, or ex-Army officers, like Deputy Vivion de Valera, Deputy McQuillan and myself, in the heat of our own political aspirations, make arrows to fire at each other, while men toil fearlessly and unashamedly, doing the best they can within the framework of the Department of Defence and within the framework of the money they are given to spend.</P>
    <P>I am very sorry that we have not a stronger Army.  I will answer the Minister for Defence straight.  He has indicated that there are ways in which responsible Deputies can help to strengthen and enlarge the F.C.A.  I say to him quite straight: tell me what to do and I, certainly, for my part, will do my best to do it.  I feel absolutely certain that Deputy Traynor or Deputy Colley would do the same. There is no difference, I think, between any of us on principle.  There may be difference as to method.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe&mdash;and I emphasise it again&mdash;that until we face up to the question of where our destiny lies in a future world war, we are only toying with the question by arguing as to whether it is 8,000, 9,000, or 12,000 men, because we will still be in the position that we will not have the modern instruments, modern equipment, modern technique that it is essential to place at the disposal of these men.  We will not have it.  We will not be able to train them in it.  I am talking for a generation that was called upon, not to fight, but to come to the colours.  I think Deputy Traynor will say manfully in this House at any time that well and truly, throughout the length and breadth of <Col N="621" /> this country, that call was answered. The same blood is flowing through the veins of the people of this country. The same spirit activates them.  I am firmly convinced that that call will never be made in vain from any Government in this country when this country is threatened.</P>
    <P>I am oppressed, in fact depressed, when I feel that with all that wealth of voluntary effort, all that bank of goodwill, all that intense, sincere patriotism that is traditionally ours, we may find ourselves in the position of sheep for slaughter in a new and terrible situation.  The position is that there is nobody in this country at the moment competent to instruct us in, or who has knowledge of, many of the new and terrible instruments of war.</P>
    <P>At some time we will have to realise that, if we are to have an Army at all, we must analyse and take a firm decision on the first question first. Deputy Traynor closed on the note of a sham army or no army at all.  I do not believe you could ever have a sham army in Ireland.  I do not believe you could ever have no army at all because, deeply within us, no matter to what political sect we owe allegiance, our sense of patriotism that is fundamentally Irish, fundamentally national, will rise in any hour of trial or tribulation, to bring back again into the fields and the hillsides the younger men and the older men, still ready and willing to battle for a liberty hardly won and hardly kept.</P>
    <P>We must realise&mdash;I think Deputy Vivion de Valera will possibly realise it with me&mdash;that the difference between 10,000 or 12,000 men is microscopic unless we are in the situation that we have some knowledge of the technique and new instruments of war and can have an army fit not only to defend itself but to train the civilian population in the new methods of air-raid precautions, unless we can have an F.C.A. equipped to deal with a new situation, and unless we can have all the voluntary services trained and equipped in modern methods and technique to the latest and highest degree.  Unless we <Col N="622" /> can have that, then I say, in a serious way, that well indeed may posterity indict the 13th Dáil as failing in its real obligation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me, as far as this debate has gone, that we have made some advance on last year.  There seems to be now a general realisation that the modern position is critical and that, of necessity, we must take our share or suffer our share in the conflict that seems to be coming on the world. Let us hope that we are wrong, that we are very wrong in that view and that things will not turn out as they seem at the moment to be about to turn out. It is a wise man surely who tries to do his best according to his lights to meet a threatening situation and if it does not happen such a man is all the better pleased to be able to say &ldquo;Thank God, it never happened.&rdquo;  Having that situation in mind we have been trying to draw attention here to the matter for the last few years.  It seemed to be realised, yet when one comes to the Defence Estimate not one step has been taken as far as one can see to prepare for that situation beyond what was done last year and the year before. The total increase in the Estimate of about £270,000 seems to be accounted for by the rise in pay to personnel.  No realisation of the position appears in this Estimate.</P>
      <P>I heard Deputy Traynor quoting the Minister for Finance of some years back about a real or a sham army.  I for one will never stand for a sham army.  I think it would be outrageous deceit of our people to let them believe they had some sort of defence force if it were not capable of doing all possible, at least to the extent that we with our small population and small resources could expect.  Again, it would be sheer waste of money.  I think we should all agree on that.  I think that the only thing for us to do is to get our real army within our resources of men, money and materials, an army which would be at least able to deal with the situation where we might be attacked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the experience of the last war, the experience of what our Army in 1939 was able to do and there are <Col N="623" /> very big lessons to be learned.  Our Army staff tried to learn that lesson and they put up their proposals at the end of the emergency for what they believed to be the minimum&mdash;they could have done with far more&mdash;for safety and for a proper attempt to defend the country in the event of an invasion.  We have been jibed at both when we were in office and when we were in Opposition for trying to bring about an Army which the Army staff believed to be the minimum.  Anything less, I say, is a sham Army.  None of us over here wants to spend money any more than anybody on the other side if it can be avoided, but why should we waste practically £4,000,000 a year if it is a sham Army?  That must be the view of the Army chiefs when the very minimum they suggested was not accepted.  Even if we accept it we cannot get that position to-morrow I admit, but we could do a lot if we were all agreed to build up the Army to that mininmum strength.  Having built it up, if we were given some years, with the development of the Reserve and the enthusiasm that would probably be generated thereby in the voluntary force, we would have an Army which we could in all reason say would be able to do the best this country is capable of doing if it should be attacked.</P>
    <P>If I have the figures correctly the Army to-day does not seem to have changed very much from last year even with the recruiting campaign which has been going on since the beginning of the year.  If it were not for that our strength would be even less and last year's figure was something over 600 less than the figure in February, 1948.  I hope that the present critical position in the world will be taken to heart and that we will set about doing the best we can to meet whatever may come from it.  One thing certain is that if we do not do so we will have no choice if the crisis comes.  If we do not build up our forces and reserves to a minimum strength we will just have to do as we are told by the bigger powers and we will have no choice whatever in the matter.  I do not think that that is a situation that any of us would like to see and I do not think <Col N="624" /> it is a situation which we should allow to develop.  With our history and with the number of gallant lives that have been lost to achieve the freedom of this country we would be failing in our duty surely if we did not take all steps to see that this country would have the right and the power to act as it thought fit in a world emergency and that its freedom would not be put in jeopardy by our delinquence in providing what we could provide even in spite of the meagreness of our resources.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a couple of points of detail in the Estimates.  Under sub-head C&mdash;Engineer Services&mdash;I notice a decrease of 78 in the personnel of tradesmen, helpers, etc., estimated for this year as against last year and a reduction in the amount provided of £14,481 which works out over the year at an average of approximately £3 10s. per man per week.  I may be wrong, but I take it that it will be the lower paid men, the helpers, who will be affected and that will again hit the Old I.R.A. and 1916 men employed in the various barracks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, a few years ago when the economy axe fell a number of these men were dismissed and the first four men who got notice were 1916 men.  I do not think it is creditable to this House that men who risked all to found this State and who have found employment in these barracks when they are getting on in years&mdash;none of these men had a large pension; one of the conditions of their employment was that their pension should be a small one&mdash;should at this stage of their lives be the first victims of the economies.  That happened during the first year of office of the present Government.  I hope those figures here do not mean that there will be a further reduction in the number of these men employed.  Surely this House is not going to stand for that. There is no country in the world which achieved its freedom by revolution but has honoured the men who took part in that revolution.  Apparently, the way this Republic is going to honour them is to throw them on the scrap heap when they are getting on in years <Col N="625" /> and cannot find other employment.  I raised this question when it happened before.  If it should happen again, I hope I shall get more support from the people who have claimed to be such strong republicans in the last few years.</P>

      <P>I should like to see some steps taken to re-establish the various services found necessary during the last war in connection with civil defence and try to make the people conscious of the position that is developing. So far as I am aware, all these services have ceased to exist and I think steps should be taken to re-establish them.  That is being done in other countries and a great deal of money is being spent on it.  These services are a necessary adjunct to the military side.  I hope that the Minister will take his courage in his hands and provide the services that are necessary both in the military way and in the civil defence way.  A beginning should be made in establishing the civil defence forces again.  The Minister will get the support of this side of the House in any efforts he makes in that direction and in connection with any necessary money he asks for.  We have already lost two years which may be vital years judging by the way things seem to be developing.  I ask the Minister to lose no further time, to get his advisers around him immediately and take the first steps to put us on the road to safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I may confess to the Minister that I came in prepared with a number of arguments to convince him and, in particular, a certain amount of evidence with which I had hoped to convince him that a point of view which I was advocating had something in it.  But largely from the Minister's own remarks, the necessity for using my ammunition is gone and he will be spared that, because I am glad to see that the Minister does apparently realise now that we have a serious defence problem, that there is a serious situation here, and that that problem should be tackled.  Thus far <Col N="626" /> we have got and I think that is a good thing.  I, for one, will be glad to accept the Minister's invitation, as I have tried to accept it, and most of the Deputies on this side of the House have tried to accept it in the last two years when he extended it, to approach this Estimate objectively and sensibly. But, in so far as the Minister has made any suggestion that a detailed analysis of the figures or anything of that kind is not being objective, I do not think I will agree with him on that.  I think the only way in which one can keep one's feet on the ground in a matter such as this is by taking hold of the concrete facts and basing one's arguments on them.  In that way one keeps much nearer to reality.</P>
      <P>First of all let me say that a small country like this is always faced with the problem as to whether it should provide for its defence by way of an Army or whether it should merely provide something in the nature of an auxiliary police force.  That matter has been raised in the past.  I have raised it myself.  With one exception, we are now all agreed that an Army is essential and we can approach this Estimate now on that basis.</P>
      <P>Secondly, it appears to me that we can take also as an agreed basis that, not alone is it desirable but it is our fundamental duty to provide for our own defence to the maximum extent possible.  I took a note of what the Minister said.  He said it was &ldquo;a sacred responsibility to do our utmost to defend our territory.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Thirdly, we are agreed that the situation is sufficiently dangerous to warrant our giving serious attention to it and to warrant our making every effort towards practical achievement in defence preparations.  As the Minister himself has pointed out at column 884 of Volume 119 of Dáil Debates of 28th February, 1950, in relation to the Defence Forces Bill, a problem does arise because of Partition, but we must nevertheless prepare our defences for a possible emergency.  The Minister said on that occasion:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Those who can read and have brains to understand words, can read into the sentence what the policy and what the outlook is&mdash;that, as <Col N="627" /> things are, we have to rely on our strength to hold this island against anybody who may be an aggressor.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Seán Collins raised a point, I do not intend to pursue it very far, as to whether we should adopt a policy of neutrality, as the Minister defined it, or a policy of active co-operation.  May I repeat once more what I have already said on at least two occasions: having regard to the present actual position in regard to defence, whether it be civil, military, general or particular, and having regard to the general over-all situation, the steps we should take and the policy we should pursue would be the same in either contingency.  In other words, the general policy and the general plan for its implementation can and should be so framed as to fit either situation over a considerable phase of its development.  It is not necessary, therefore, to resolve that problem before undertaking the actual organisation of our defences.  There is then no reason to make the fact that such problems&mdash;admittedly vital and urgent &mdash;arise, the excuse for doing nothing. We can do a considerable amount to prepare ourselves to meet and successfully survive another emergency at the present moment without involving ourselves in any way.  Even if that particular problem is posed, broadly speaking, we should put ourselves in the position to tackle our defence problem without any distraction and without finding excuses in our present difficulties for not tackling it.</P>
    <P>I think those are the general surrounding circumstances which condition this debate.  It seems to me that the surroundings are more or less agreed between us.  It remains, therefore, for us to deal with this debate on the basis of the specific problems of defence on the basis that we must do the best we can to defend our own territory.  We are agreed that the situation is dangerous and warrants a serious effort. It is agreed that we must do our best to undertake our own defence to the fullest possible extent.  The question then arises as to what we can do in regard to our own defence.  We are a small country.  It may be said by some that the problem of defence is such a <Col N="628" /> big one now that we can do nothing about it, but I think most people would agree with the Minister that it is our sacred duty to defend our territory and not to sell it.  I think those were the Minister's own words.</P>
    <P>What then have we to face?  What is our position?  A situation exists in the world at the moment which is fraught with danger.  It is difficult to estimate how dangerous the situation is.  Sometimes it looks very threatening. Sometimes there are hopeful signs.  Sometimes people say the threatening danger will be averted. To-day it is &ldquo;It will&rdquo;; to-morrow it is &ldquo;It won't.&rdquo;  That is the kind of thing which makes the position so difficult.  But we must remember that that was almost precisely the picture from about 1934 to 1939.  There is a disheartening resemblance in the present-day oscillations between &ldquo;it will&rdquo; and &ldquo;It won't&rdquo; and similar oscillations in those critical years leading up to the Second World War. There is, however, one difference as between the two periods.  Nations are to-day steadily working on the hypothesis that war may come.  There is hardly a country in the world that is not preparing itself.  The hard test of that is the expenditure in effort and in money that is being devoted to rearmament and defence programmes. You have that constant emphasis on expenditure running as a substratum, so to speak, right through these surface oscillations of probability to which I have referred.  That is hardly a hopeful sign.  There is the type of world we live in.  However, the very fact that such a pessimistic view is being taken, the very fact that Governments abroad are preparing for the worst may be the ultimate insurance that the worst will not happen&mdash;just as it was very largely the failure of Governments to prepare for the worst in the pre-war years that contributed to the ultimate calamity.  But be that as it may, I think a sober estimate is that in this present-day world there is a grave danger of war, that no one can say for certain that it will come but that the danger is such that any prudent man or people would take steps to prepare themselves for it.  I think that is a sober estimate.  If that is so and if it <Col N="629" /> is applicable to the people of practically every country in the world, there is very good reason to believe that we, too, should adopt that view and prudently, not extravagantly but nevertheless sufficiently, prepare for what may come.  In that, there is nothing of a scare or any intent to incite people&mdash;as I think Deputy O'Leary accused me of doing on a previous occasion.</P>
    <P>In so far as this part of the world is concerned, you have a big Power in the West facing a big Power in the East and threatened from the East. The centre of the Western forces opposed to Russia is in the Continent of America.  But along the fringe of Western Europe are to be found the outposts' line, so to speak, of that vast Western Power which is presently menaced, as we know.  Trace that line.  From Turkey to Italy, from Italy and Switzerland to Spain and Portugal, by France to Belgium, Holland, Denmark and Norway&mdash;and Sweden and Finland, along the curtin's line you have those outposts, and the island of Britain just on that line too, and if anything happens it will be along that general line and some particular areas on it that considerable activity will follow.  And where are we?  Let any Deputy look at the map.  There, practically along that line, our island lies. It lies behind the island of Scotland and England, right across the communications of the North Atlantic, with potentialities in respect of the air, and, generally, in such a position that leads one to conclude that if the catastrophe which many fear should come, our geographical position is such that we could not ignore the storm breaking.  In other words, in that situation we would have a serious defence problem.  That serious defence problem, having regard to the dangers of the situation which I have already mentioned, require us now to take a sober but nevertheless energetic and practical approach to deal with such a contingency if it arises.</P>
    <P>There is the general picture of what we have to face.  Can anyone deny, in face of it, that we have a definite defence problem to cope with?  On the other hand, if that is our situation, <Col N="630" /> what can we do about it?  There was one thing that disturbed me about the Minister's speech.  What disturbed me was the complete emphasis on what I might call our apparent helplessness, the Minister's attitude&mdash;at least he conveyed the impression to me&mdash;that things were so difficult and what could he or anybody else do about it.  I find that disturbing and I think many Deputies will, because there is a considerable amount that one can do in regard to such a matter of defence, as I hope to show in a moment.  What is more, there is an old proverb which says that God helps those who help themselves, and it has frequently happened in history, and it happened in our own case during the last war.  We did try to do the utmost that we could to meet it in the years immediately preceding the war and during the emergency.  Everybody knows that that utmost, if tried by a direct assault, might perhaps have availed not as much as we would have hoped but, nevertheless, coupled with what we did try to do for ourselves, God helped us the rest of the way.  In this regard, the fact that, even in respect of the most you can do, there will still be a risk that you have not done enough, is no justification for not trying.  In fact, your best hope and your best guarantee of getting through is to do the best you can, even though that best might in absolute value be relatively little.  What can we do?  In either event, whether we were involved in the war or whether we were neutral, as we were in the last war, if war should come our people have to be fed.  Life here would have to be organised to meet such an emergency and to survive it.  Protection would have to be afforded for our civilian population.  Arrangements would have to be made for passive defence such as medical services, civilian evacuation and so forth.  All these would have to be done in either event and, what is more, could be done if we prepared adequately and in time.  But that preparation must be made and made in time.</P>
    <P>We know from our experience in the past not only that we can do that much at any rate but that in doing that much we have quite a good chance of survival.  The fact, as I think many <Col N="631" /> of us have mentioned in previous debates on this Estimate, that we were independent in that sense and able to cater for ourselves during the last war, to the extent to which we did, was responsible for our getting supplies which we might not have got so readily had we been in a weaker position.  That we can do for defence.</P>
    <P>Now, for the question of defence in its more narrow aspect.  What can we do?  Well, everybody will concede that absolute defence against any aggressor is out of the question.  Nobody suggests that.  But there is one thing that we can do.  We should be able to provide a garrison here for this part of our island and so prevent anybody having an excuse to occupy the country because it is not garrisoned, and also to provide a deterrent against anybody who might be tempted to interfere with us by force.  You can supply that garrison and your own local security in such a way that any aggressor, whether you are involved or not, will find it costly in men, material and time&mdash;so costly in fact that the temptation to come may be removed from him.  For instance let us suppose that a situation should break out in the morning something similar to that obtaining at the outbreak of the last war and that we had the necessary force here&mdash;and we could have it&mdash;to garrison the country, to provide our own local security and then have a sufficient force to meet an aggressor to the extent of delaying him and making it costly for him.  Consider that situation. Then if some Power were tempted to try to come this way to attack our neighbour, where it would be very easy and open to him if we had made no dispositions for our own protection, if he finds that we are ready to look after ourselves to that extent, particularly if you can delay him even for a few hours, then the temptation to come this way at all is removed and he would find some other route more attractive to him.  The net result would be that he would leave us alone.  Similarly, the excuse to anybody, no matter how friendly with you, to come in, because you are not able to protect yourself and so leave a vacuum, is removed and you are not interfered with from <Col N="632" /> that quarter either.  We can go that far and if we can, surely we have the duty so to do.</P>
    <P>Now with these necessary preliminaries, let us look at the situation in regard to strengths first and then in regard to expenditure under this Estimate. Before the last war and before the emergency we maintained a force here of approximately 5,000 to 6,000 of a regular Army with reserves generally to make a total available defence force of about 20,000.  That was the Army before the war&mdash;20,000 first line, of which 5,000 to 6,000 were permanent or regular personnel.  Coming up to the war, we strengthened the proportion of our regular personnel.  In March, 1939 it was, as the Minister stated, about 7,200 and on mobilisation in September, 1939 it was about 7,500. That plus your reserve, first line of all classes, left you an army of about 20,000.  That was our pre-war position. Incidentally, I have traced that history in detail in Volume 110 of the Official Report in which appears the debate on this Estimate two years ago.  If Deputies are interested in the details as to how I arrived at that figure, they will find it in that Volume.  It is sufficient to say that to meet the war situation in 1939 we had a regular Army of approximately 7,500 men with reserves bringing the total force that we theoretically could mobilise in September, 1939 up to the region of 20,000.  In September, 1939 as a matter of fact we mobilised over 19,000 men, quite a respectable percentage of our available 20,000.</P>
    <P>During the &ldquo;phoney&rdquo; war period there were certain exemptions and when the situation became critical in the early summer of 1940 you had in effect a regular Army of 14,000 men, 7,500 of whom were your normal permanent force.  During the months from September until spring of 1940 the first Line Reserves&mdash;and they were First Line Reserves, A and B Reserve and the Volunteer force&mdash;had been trained and assimilated as regulars. The A Reserve were in all respects equal to the Regular Army.  The Volunteer Reserve and the Volunteer force were also trained up to a first line standard.  These were absorbed into the Regular Army during <Col N="633" /> that &ldquo;phoney&rdquo; war period, so completely absorbed, in fact, that it is legitimate and correct to say that you faced the acute emergency of 1940 with a regular Army of 14,000 troops, who had for a considerable period before, experience and intensive training facilities that the Army would not have got normally in any peace time.</P>
    <P>In addition to these 14,000 men, you had 6,000 odd who had been exempted in the period, less a few essential civil servants and people like that who could not be allowed back to the colours because they were wanted in essential jobs.  You met what might be easily in the future your first problem, with so many months' preparation with a regular Army of 14,000, with a further reserve equal, approximately, to the first line we have to-day available. Both the Government, the Army and the country found that when you had provided for garrisons, protective duties and the training of the emergency Army, and everything else that was involved, that that force was barely sufficient to do the job.  During the period of raising the emergency Army there were very few mobile forces available.  Anything that was available was more or less tied up with local security or garrison duties.  That was the experience at that time and we were starting the situation so favourably that we were not committed to hostilities then.  Now it is with that lesson before their minds that the General Staff approach this problem of post-war reorganisation.</P>
    <P>In 1944, when it was apparent the war was coming to an end, the then Government gave directions that the problem of defence should be examined for the post-war years and a report presented to them.  During those last two years an intensive study of the situation was undertaken for the former Chief of Staff by a staff under his vigorous guidance.  We have heard a lot of talk in this House about brass hats and I think it is about time that a certain mirage was dispelled.  The recommendation made to the Government at that time was not made by a few brass hats at General Headquarters. The recommendation was a <Col N="634" /> carefully considered one, drawn up at Headquarters, but in consultation with the senior officers of the Army.  The recommendation, to my recollection, was submitted as the considered opinion of the General Staff and the senior officers in the Army.  That is by way of an aside, but I make it because of the frequent references here to brass hats.</P>
    <P>With the lesson of 1940 and with the experience gained during the war vividly before our minds, the necessity was apparent for dealing with civil defence problems, with the co-ordination of industry and supplies, military requirements, transport and other things.  With all that before their eyes, the seriousness of the situation was brought home to the Government of the day.  The opinion was that anything less than the peace establishment proposed would be wasteful and not worthwhile.  In fact, if you were forced below that figure you might as well be properly economical and simply have an auxiliary police force.</P>
    <P>There have been many things said about the 12,500 Army.  It was simply this, that on any showing, no matter how you were to raise and prepare a defence force, a minimum regular Army of that number was necessary. As a matter of fact, the staff considered you needed a few hundred more which you might add to the 12,500 as a minimum.  If you had that minimum you could make a serious attempt at building the defence force that this country could afford; that would be a practical and realistic approach to the defence problem in so far as a country like ours could approach it.  That figure has been so bandied about that I think that explanation in regard to its genesis is necessary.</P>
    <P>It was undoubtedly a pity that the strength of the Army ever fell below that figure during the demobilisation years, but it did.  The previous Minister and his Government did intend to work towards that figure.  To this day the peace establishment, as the Minister mentioned in his opening statement, remains at that figure.  It is quite obvious the peace establishment remains at that figure&mdash;we have it both from the Book of Estimates and what the Minister said.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="635" /> If we are serious about our defence problem, and if we find a situation where the General Staff consider that to go below a certain figure will mean that you are only toying with the problem and wasting money, why do we not try to build towards a proper establishment?  On various occasions the excuse was that we could not get the men.  There is a very interesting commentary on that.  We were getting some recruits when the recruiting drive was stopped some years ago.  What has been the history in regard to Army strength since?</P>
    <P>It might not be any harm if the House adverted to the situation in regard to Army strength over the past two years, not so much by way of criticising the Minister, but rather from the point of view of a sober approach to the strength problem.  So far as I can piece together the figures the Minister has given at various times, and with such information as we have had available previously, when the Minister took over in 1948 he had approximately 1,060 officers, 2,400 N.C.O.s, 40 cadets and about 5,172 privates.  All these figures are estimated, but they tally with the actual figures the Minister gave when he came into office.</P>
    <P>In February, 1948, we had a total Army of 8,672.  A year later&mdash;and these are the actual figures given by the Minister, not an estimate&mdash;there were the same number of officers, approximately, 1,057, approximately the same number of N.C.O.s, 2,387, 4,562 privates and the total apparently included cadets.  I do not know how many cadets there were, but they numbered at least 40.  The Army had then fallen by 600 men to 8,006.  There had been in that period a net decrease in the strength of the Army&mdash;that is, adding recruiting and subtracting wastage &mdash;of about 600 men.  The Army was wasting at that rate and the wastage was occurring mostly among the privates.  Apparently this wastage went on.  Having regard to the figures given by the Minister, the officer and N.C.O. strength apparently remained constant, but the private strength continued to fall.  You had during that period 134 cadets.  In September, 1949, <Col N="636" /> the total strength was 7,849 and in December of the same year it had fallen to 7,491.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It was all officers then and no men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That represented the total strength then.  In other words, in December last, notwithstanding the fact that the Army was taken over with a strength of approximately 8,672, it had fallen to 7,491. That is a serious decrease.  There is no use trying to pretend that we are merely arguing about a few hundred men.  There were more than 1,000 men less in that period.  I am very glad to see now that the number is rising again, thanks to the recruiting campaign. The figure at the moment is 8,113.  Over these years you had a loss of about ten or 12 officers.  The N.C.O. strength remains the same. The decrease in strength has been largely at the expense of the other ranks.  As I have said, the reason why we are pressing the Minister to try and get the strength back is that our experience in the past was that any less strength than the peace establishment strength is a futility.  You are hardly warranted in having an Army at all if that is all you are going to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that in the demobilisation years the strength fell well below the peace establishment figure.  It is also true that Deputy Traynor, when he was Minister, and the general Staff were trying to get recruits, and that after a war, on an emergency period such as we had then, you may expect a decrease, and so we expected a fall in strength and a difficulty in getting recruits.  Nevertheless, the policy then was to try and get back to that figure and so offset the waste.  It is a pity that the Minister let two years pass in which there was no increase because these two years could have been used to build up the strength of the Army.  We know that with his recruiting drive he got 1,104 men.  If he could get that number in three months, he certainly could have got 1,000 men in the previous two years.  If he got 1,000 or 1,200 men in the 18 months previous to starting the recruiting campaign last December, he <Col N="637" /> could have kept the strength up against wastage.  If he did that he would be in the happy position of being able to come to the House to-day and of saying &ldquo;I have now got 1,000 nearer my peace establishment since last Christmas.&rdquo;  If he got the number I have mentioned in three months, it is not, as I say, too much to expect that he would have got the same number in the 18 months that went before.</P>
    <P>Anyway, I do not want to cry about spilt milk, but I do want to point out, on that showing and on these figures, that if we want to be serious about it we can achieve our peace establishment strength.  It is still our peace establishment strength.  We have not been told that the General Staff have in any way modified their view, or that anyone can say that we can usefully subsist with a lesser strength than that of the peace establishment.  What I want to say is that we should do our best to try and build towards that.  For my part, I would like to say to the Minister &ldquo;go ahead with the good work, now that you have started with the recruiting drive, fill your establishment.&rdquo;  I have only gone back on the past to demonstrate that it can be done.</P>
    <P>The other argument that was advanced was that in getting people for the Army you are taking them away from the pool of productive employment. Well, as only two or three thousand men are involved for the Army, I will be forgiven if I say that that particular argument is &ldquo;poppycock&rdquo;. As long as we have the unemployment and emigration figures that we have, there is no use in people talking about the Army running away with men from the pool of productive employment.  The plain fact of the situation is that what I suggest can be done.  That has been demonstrated by the recruiting drive.  I hope that the Minister will keep that up and will get more and more recruits and so build up the strength of the force.  It has been adequately demonstrated that if we are serious about it and go after it as the Minister did since Christmas, it can be done.  I say also that the situation is sufficiently serious to warrant us in doing that.</P>
    <P>The next question is that of the <Col N="638" /> Reserves.  According to the latest figure which the Minister gave us, we have, approximately, First Line Reserves between 5,000 and 6,000, all ranks.  That is, approximately, the same strength as the First Line Reserve, A and B categories, before the war.  At that time we had about 5,000 in the A and B Reserve and from 7,000 to 8,000 in the Volunteer Force. Actually, we had about 12,000 as a First Line Reserve in 1939.  We have only half that First Line Reserve available to-day.  In other words, in last December, before the recruiting drive started, we were in a worse situation as regards First Line troops than we were in 1939.  These are the facts. In December last our Regular Army was below the strength in September, 1939, and our First Line Reserve was only approximately half the First Line Reserve available and mobilised in 1939.  On the other side of the sheet, of course, I should say, in fairness to the Minister, that he had his 20,000 to his 30,000 F.C.A.  I shall deal with that later.  That adverse situation has been adverted to by Deputy Colley and others.</P>
    <P>I should like Deputies carefully to note these figures.  They have been given in previous debates over the past two years and have not been contradicted. I am giving them again with the conviction that in what I say I am accurate.  The fact is that last December you had an Army and a First Line Reserve that was notably of considerably less strength than you had in the year 1939, just before the war broke out.  The Regular Army was a couple of hundred less than the Regular Army of 1939, and the First Line Reserve was only about half that of the 1939 Reserve.  In other words, if you had a mobilisation in December last the only troops you would have would be the 7,500 plus the 5,700 making in or about 13,000, so that you were somewhat worse off on that showing not only as compared with the 1939 mobilisation figures but, more so when the comparison is with the 1940 mobilisation figures.  These are the hard facts of the situation, and it is these facts that compel some of us who know them to stress them not with a view to scoring over the Minister but rather <Col N="639" /> with a view to trying to help the Minister by adducing arguments as to why he should secure the filling of his existing peace establishment.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the F.C.A.  In a general way, that is tied up with some of the more detailed matters on the reserve that I want to refer to.  We must guard against confusing the rôle and potentialities of the F.C.A. with those of the First Line Reserve.  When I say that, I want most carefully not in any way to disparage the F.C.A.  In fact, in many ways they are bound to have perhaps greater reserves of human potentiality than the Regular Army or its First Line Reserve can ever have, because they are a much more representative cross-section of the whole community and can call on the best brains and the best physique in the community in a way in which the Regular Army or a voluntary First Line Reserve cannot hope to.  The fact is nevertheless that, because they are a local force which will do only a certain amount of local training and cannot afford to do whole time training, they can never get the standard of training necessary in modern times for a First Line Reserve.</P>
    <P>The next difficulty is that because many of them will be required to maintain their civilian employment, which is equally essential in peace and in war, and because they will have other rôles to fulfil, they must be regarded essentially as part-time soldiers, even if war should come.  That limits the amount of training they can be given and limits their availability, so that they cannot be considered to be a First Line Reserve. Thirdly, the development of modern war is such that there is an exalted and important rôle for them in conjunction with the proper regular forces&mdash;when I say regular forces, I mean the mobilised forces&mdash;a rôle alongside and in conjunction with the regular forces, a rôle which is equally honourable and at least as important as, if not more important than, the rôle which any of your regular troops will be called on to play&mdash;a more specialised rôle, a rôle for which these intelligent and enthusiastic men who also have to look after their everyday duties are best fitted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="640" /> That situation is a new one and I propose to deal with it at some little length for the reason that I feel there has been a certain amount of confusion. There is, I feel, a certain amount of confusion in the Minister's mind because he has been talking about a voluntary force and I fear that we are tempted to look on these members of the F.C.A. as taking the place of the First Line Reserve, as absolving us from doing anything about the First Line Reserve and equating them to the First Line Reserve pre-war and expecting them to fulfil the same rôle.  That is not so.  The men would not be available in peace or war to do the necessary training and to be mobilised whole-time. We know a great deal with regard to that from our experience in 1939-40 when many men had to be exempted because of their employment but who, nevertheless, served vitally and honourably in the L.D.F.&mdash; equally honourably with those who served in the forces&mdash;contributing to the welfare of the country in its productive and civilian aspect as well as contributing in their spare time as voluntary soldiers to the defence of the country.</P>
    <P>That situation arose because of the peculiar developments in warfare which have taken place in our generation. I do not want to appear pedantic in going into some of these matters which are really matters for the General Staff, but there are nevertheless some things which we must face and which we must assimilate and one of these is the fact that up to our time war was a two-dimensional affair.  The boundary between yourself and outsiders, potential enemies and so forth, was a line on the surface of the land, and, while that situation existed, it was sufficient to have regular armies with their mobilised reserves and a line of outposts.  Everything behind that line more or less took care of itself, if the outpost line was not penetrated, and the need for citizen soldiers each in his own area doing local protective garrison work was not the same as it is now.</P>
    <P>The aeroplane changed all that and made war a three-dimensional affair. Your mobilised forces cannot now shelter behind a line on the ground <Col N="641" /> and a line of outposts, because the enemy can come in from the top.  The result of that, whereas chains of outposts would give protection in the past, you have to afford local security and local protection at every spot now. That was accentuated by the advent of tank warfare&mdash;the mobile type of armoured warfare.  The net result is that it has become necessary in modern times to have not only your Regular Army, your permanent Army with its First Line Reserve mobilised to do essential work, garrison duty and so on, but in every town and village, at every important bridge and railway junction, practically every townland and every parish, a group of men armed and ready to deal with what might come from the skies, to garrison their own little area and to co-operate if anything was happening in the area.</P>
    <P>In other words, a rôle for a local defence force, a local territorial force equally important with the other elements of your forces, arose and the necessity for supplying troops to fill that rôle arose.  There is the position with regard to the F.C.A.  Even if you were to achieve a position of minimum satisfaction with regard to your Regular Army and First Line Reserve, you would still need your F.C.A.  There is, therefore, a problem for us to look into in that regard, a problem with which I will deal later.</P>
    <P>Our strength situation on that showing is not very satisfactory.  It is, in fact, most unsatisfactory.  What is our position then in so far as expenditure is an index?  It is very interesting to tabulate some of these items in the various Votes over the years and make a comparison.  If one takes the Estimates for 1937-38, 1938-39 and 1939-40 and compares them with the Estimates for 1948-49, 1949-50 and 1950-51, one gets a very interesting picture.  We are expending to-day approximately £4,000,000 where before the war we were expending from £1,500,000 to £2,000,000, that is to say, about double the amount.  We all know that from 1946 onwards, to say nothing about devaluation, money values have changed practically everywhere, in every business, in our own Estimates, and so on.  You could expect that where you were expending £1 on something <Col N="642" /> pre-war you would spend £2 or £2 10s. 0d. now.  Roughly speaking, therefore, as far as money is concerned, we are not doing any better now in preparation for defence than we were doing before the war.</P>
    <P>In the details, there are some unsatisfactory aspects, with which I wish to deal.  I think it was Deputy Colley who pointed out that the bulk of the increases have been inevitable and long overdue, in pay, but that there has been no corresponding increase on equipment.  I know what the Minister has said about that, but let us look at the figures.  In 1937-38, on pay, under sub-head A, we were spending nearly £550,000.  That had risen to about £687,000 in 1939-40, in the original Estimate for that year.  Financial adjustments were made in that year, but I think the Supplementary Estimate, in the net, was only about £10.  That figure to-day has become three times as great, £1,535,000.  It was at £1,320,000 in 1948-49 when the Minister took over, it had already doubled itself when he took over, and it has increased since then.</P>
    <P>Marriage allowance shows a corresponding trend, again almost three-fold increase.  Pay of civilians attached shows something more than a three-fold increase, pay for the medical corps, the same.  The Office of the Minister, covering the cost of the civil administration of the Army, has increased from £67,000 to £200,000 again approximately a three-fold increase.  If you go through the Estimates in that way, you will find that over these years the increase in the amount of money that we are spending now is due to the change in money values.  It more than corroborates&mdash;certainly as far as strength is concerned, and in regarding to everything else, too, as I will show &mdash;what I have said already, that is, that our situation in regard to defence to-day is no better than it was in 1939 and in the two years immediately prior to that, and that, if anything, the situation is worse.</P>

      <P>I will take General Stores first.  If Deputies will look at the headings there, they will see that General Stores is really a type of Warlike Stores.  It includes harness, signal equipment, aircraft and educational equipment.  In 1937-38, £69,130 was allocated to General Stores.  More than that sum was spent.  There was an over expenditure on those stores in that year in preparation for the war that was to come two years afterwards. The Government spent not only what it had budgeted for but spent more while the going was good and while they could get the stores in. In the following year, that was stepped up to £199,257, of which nearly £104,000 was spent.  In the following year, 1939/40, it was stepped up again to £224,221, of which £121,000 was spent.  That was the year of the war. There was a big saving forced on us in that year.  We find in 1948-49, only £95,000 allotted for such stores.  It was reduced to nearly £69,000 last year and it is down as £87,000 in the Book of Estimates this year.</P>
      <P>About Warlike Stores, the interesting thing is that, while the change in money values has reflected itself in pay, in the matter of essential stores we find a startling opposite trend, which means buying less than ever we bought.</P>

      <P>Very good.  I will deal with the reason but I note that the Minister has said &ldquo;much less.&rdquo;  In regard to warlike stores, the same trend is to be found.  There was <Col N="644" /> £137,000 allocated in 1937-38 which was over-expended, that is, £142,000 was spent.  These figures are taken from the Appropriation Accounts, in conjunction with the Estimates.  In the following year £164,000 was allocated, of which £139,000 was spent; and in the next year, the war year, there was over £1,000,000 allocated, but we could not get the stores and only £131,000 was spent.  In the post-war year, there was £215,912 allocated, in the Minister's first year of office.  The Minister himself took off a certain amount and succeeded in placing the orders for the rest.</P>
      <P>In the last year, it was only £97,000 and this year it is to be only about £95,000 for those essential materials. Those figures show that the position is most unsatisfactory.  It means that, bad as we were pre-war, we are not now making even the inadequate provision then made in spite of all the experience we have had before us in recent years.  Whatever the difficulty in getting equipment, we should certainly take these facts and figures to heart.</P>
      <P>That dispassionate analysis of the figures published in the yearly Estimates and in the Appropriation Accounts which go through the Auditor, show that picture.  If it means anything, it means we are getting less than we ever got&mdash;and the Minister now says that that is true.  The Minister may suggest that we are going unnecessarily into figures.  He has glibly talked about figures on previous occasions.  When one makes an analysis, one finds that his recollection is not very accurate.  He made a mistake as regards the Army strengths. I move to report progress.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; the Committee to sit again.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 19th April, 1950.</P>

      <P>(a) A formula was not used in 1928 to calculate the average number of vehicles circulating on certain roads.  The figures obtained in a traffic census in 1928 were recommended for use in 1944, however, as a basis for calculating for design purposes the traffic density on a road. The average number of mechanically-propelled vehicles per hour for the three-day period taken in September, 1928, from 6 a.m. to midnight, was:&mdash; Bray Road&mdash;point south of Donny-brook&mdash;121 v.p.h.; Bray Road&mdash;point north of Bray&mdash;105 v.p.h.</P>
      <P>(b)  The increase between August, 1928, and August, 1949, in the number of vehicles licensed in Dublin City and County was 147 per cent.</P>
      <P>(c)  On the basis of the 1928 census figures and assuming that the increase in mechanically-propelled traffic on the Bray Road is proportional to the increase in the number of vehicles licensed in Dublin City and County, the average number of vehicles now circulating between 6 a.m. and midnight would be:&mdash;point south of Donnybrook &mdash;299 v.p.h.; point north of Bray&mdash;260 v.p.h.</P>
      <P>(d)  The total cost to date of providing the existing dual carriageways on the Bray Road was £41,615.</P>
      <P>(e)  The proposals of the Dublin County Council for the improvement of the Bray Road, in connection with which land acquisition proceedings have been suspended, would involve an expenditure of £389,000.</P>
