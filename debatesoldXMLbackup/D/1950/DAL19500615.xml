      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £10,065,040 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1951, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain Subsidies and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>In reviewing the work of this Department for the last year, I think the golden rule applies that the best test of a policy is its results, and that the best arguments are facts.  I have, therefore, for the convenience of Deputies, prepared a short White Paper which is available to all Deputies on the Lobby and which, I thought, might be of assistance to those who are interested in the Vote in mastering the rather wide range of topics which may properly arise in the course of this discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1790" /> In regard, however, to certain factual statistics, I am in a position to bring the House up to date a little more precisely since that White Paper was prepared.  The deliveries of milk to creameries up to June 3rd from the 1st January, 1947, were 34,587,000 gallons; for the corresponding periods of 1948, 1949 and 1950 deliveries were 41,020,000 gallons, 54,246,000 gallons and 62,830,000 gallons respectively.  The most recent figure for the production of butter is that for the fortnight ending on the 31st May.  In 1947, from 1st January to 31st May, it was 85,065 cwts.; for the same periods in 1948, 1949 and 1950 it was 105,471 cwts., 149,048 cwts. and 180,887 cwts. respectively. I now come to the export of eggs to date for the same period.  The latest figures I have relate to the 8th June, and I give them in statistics relating to 300 cases, each case containing three long hundreds of eggs. In 1947, the figure was 344,581; in 1948, 554,374; in 1949, 862,404, and in 1950, 811,256.</P>
    <P>I think the White Paper contains the most recent figures that I am in a position to offer in regard to the exports of dead poultry.  Then we come to an interesting figure in regard to the delivery of wheat to the mills.  The House will remember that there was a substantial decline in the total acreage of wheat this year.  But, despite that fact, the delivery of wheat to the mills up to the 29th April last amounted to 2,350,648 barrels, as compared with 2,514,088 barrels last year, off an acreage nearly 150,000 acres less this year than was laid down under wheat last year.</P>
    <P>I think Deputies will find in the White Paper the last figure which I am in a position to give them authoritatively for the total exports of cattle is that relating to the month of April. Deputies are already informed of the total delivery of pigs to the factory.</P>
    <P>That brings me now to the matter of employment on the land.  I noticed, with emotion, that the Leader of the Opposition repaired recently to Louth and there spoke more in sorrow than in anger.  He was grieved to observe that 50,000 male employees had left the land.  I need hardly say that his <Col N="1791" /> kept newspaper was thrown into a state of deep distress by this.  But neither the Leader of the Opposition nor the kept newspaper deemed it expedient to say that this remarkable exodus from the land had taken place during the last five years of his administration.  It did not appear to trouble his conscience so gravely until he became Leader of the Opposition; and then it became a matter for anxious comment, wide publicity and implied rebuke to those now responsible. Lest there be any misunderstanding on this, it may be well to recapitulate the figures which were recently published in the Statistical Abstract for this year: males employed on the land in 1941, 555,601; in 1942, 541,181; in 1943, 536,383; in 1944, 526,147; in 1945, 521,980; in 1946, 519,634; in 1947, 507,568; in 1948, 499,542.</P>
    <P>As the House knows, I have sought to crystallise the agricultural policy of this Government in the aphorism: &ldquo;One more cow, one more sow, one more acre under the plough.&rdquo;  That phrase was first used by my distinguished predecessor, the late Mr. Patrick Hogan.  I think it makes pretty clear the view that we desire to see on the land of Ireland mixed farming so that those who own the land and live upon it will be, in so far as-is possible, protected from any transient economic wind that blows and that they shall be equipped, if one market should fail, in such manner as to enable them to avail of an alternative without undue dislocation of their livelihood. I have constantly maintained that that system of agriculture has the additional advantage that it employs more of our people on the land; that that system of agriculture tends to multiply on our land farmer proprietors; that that is what this Government wants to see &mdash; not quasi-landlords or 11-month tenants, but people owning and working their own land.</P>
    <P>The kept newspaper has been concerned for the last couple of days to prove that, despite the steadily increasing production of milk, despite the increasing number of cows, despite the increasing number of heifers in calf, the dairy industry is tottering to ruin. <Col N="1792" /> But they prove too much because, in seeking to prove one thing, they inadvertently prove another.  Just imagine the kept newspaper proving that tillage, to the exclusion of everything else, employs less men per 100 acres than any other system of farming known in Ireland.  Picture the havoc that will be wrought at Burgh Quay tonight. Rows of dangling corpses will swing from the rafters when the full significance of the table printed on page 6 of that newspaper is appreciated.  These tables show the employment per 100 acres in 1947&mdash;the last year of the blessed 15.  Limerick: tillage acres, 12 per 100 acres of arable land; males employed, 3.8 per 100 acres.  Meath, Westmeath, Kildare: 20 tillage acres per 100 acres; males employed, 3.3.</P>
    <P>That does not finish the story.  I thought it such an interesting one that we might follow it further afield.  Let us leave the rolling lands of Meath and Westmeath, the bullock and the dog, which have this mysterious power of employment, and turn to Wexford and Laois.  Here are counties where tillage is conducted with greater intensity than in any other counties in Ireland.  Take Laois, where it is conducted almost to the exclusion of live stock.  In Laois the total area under corn, root and green crops, flax and fruit is 82,972 acres.  The total number of males employed is 12,015. The number of males employed per 1,000 acres cropped is 145.  Turn now to despised Roscommon, Meath and Limerick, to the Golden Vale where the plough is said never to be seen.  In these counties the number of male employed per 1,000 acres cropped is 294 in Roscommon, 160 in Meath and 328 in Limerick.  In Wexford, where the total area under corn, root and green crops, flax and fruit is 157,076, the number of males employed per 1,000 acres cropped is 113.  I wonder has the kept newspaper, by its revelations, taught Fianna Fáil what reason and argument could not teach them in the last 20 years, and that is that &ldquo;one more cow, one more sow and one more acre under the plough&rdquo; employs our people on the land in dignity, peace and prosperity and in numbers, and that wheat, peat and beet reduce the <Col N="1793" /> number of people employed upon our land as farmer proprietors, multiplies the number of wage-earners on the bog and leaves the arable land of Laois with 145 males to the 1,000 acres, while the despised live stock of Limerick and Roscommon manages to give a good livelihood to 328 males per 1,000 acres in Limerick and 294 per 1,000 acres in Roscommon.  That sow, that cow, that other acre under the plough should be written on the heart of the Leader of the Opposition as Calais was written on the heart of Mary Tudor.</P>
    <P>I promised the House that inasmuch as Deputy Lahiffe was good enough to give me the names of the farmers in Galway whose barns were burdened with great mountains of unsold barley, whose credit was strained and whose families were distressed by their inability to sell their humble stores, I would have inquiries made.  I, in accordance with the Deputy's instructions, sent officers of my Department to each of these farmers with a respectful inquiry if I might be of service and whether I could assist them to dispose of this unmanageable burden of unsaleable agricultural produce. I went first to Mr. J.H.  His barns were said to be bursting.  He told us he had not any barley at all, but that he had sold 73 barrels some time ago for 42/-.  I thanked him and went my way.  Deeming Deputy Lahiffe's information to be an invitation to enter on the premises of Mr. T.K., I knocked at his door.  He said he had three barrels, but that he would not take a penny less than 50/- for it because he wanted to feed it to his stock.  I said &ldquo;one more sow, one more cow, one more acre under the plough,&rdquo; and bid him the time of day. I went to Mr. S. S.  He said he had not a barrel of barley in the barn for some time, that he had sold the last of it for 44/- some weeks ago.  I wished him luck of it.  I repaired to Mr. P. H.  He said he had not a grain in the place, and had not had for some considerable time.  I went to Mr. M. C.  His larder was also bare.  At this stage the officer of my Department fell ill, and I had to bring him home.  I sent down another officer, but the poor man was again disappointed. As fast as I could get that other <Col N="1794" /> officer of my Department to the scene, he called on Mr. M. M. and Mr. O'B., both of whom received him with genial but ribald laughter, and said they had no barley at all, but that Mr. O'B. had had three barrels which he had sold six weeks ago for 42/-.</P>
    <P>It was a pleasure to discharge this duty.  I am grateful to Deputy Lahiffe for communicating his anxieties to me. I trust he feels that I have discharged my duty in making sure that the distresses, under which he believed his constituents to labour and in reference to which he thought it necessary to move the Adjournment of this House, were not as grave or as pressing as they were represented to him to be.</P>
    <P>I assume the permission of the House not to dwell on the general topics that have been referred to in the White Paper I have submitted, though I need hardly reassure Deputies that if any particular facts therein set out appear inadequate I am at their disposal to elaborate them in any way I can on question.  I have to announce to the House that, as a result of negotiations which have recently been proceeding in London with the British Ministry of Food, I am now in a position to indicate the price of eggs to the producer up to 31st January, 1952.  The price of eggs to the producer will remain at 2/6 per dozen until 31st January, 1951.  From the 1st February to the 31st August, the price of eggs to the producer will be 2/- per dozen and from the 1st September to the 31st January, 1952, the price will be 3/6 per dozen.  It is fortunate that we are in a position to give this notice in due time so that those poultry people who desire to avail of the 3/6 for eggs between the 1st September, 1951, and the 31st January, 1952, may take measures in due time, as experienced poultry-keepers will know they can be taken, by judicious feeding to bring their fowl into laying in the month of September.</P>
    <P>Deputies unfamiliar with the technique of this business may not fully realise that if you take certain well-known precautions in the matter of feeding, you can bring young fowl into laying in the autumn: they will then <Col N="1795" /> moult in December or January.  If, on the other hand, these ordinary precautions in relation to feeding are not taken, fowl will not begin to lay until February, and will then continue to lay through their ordinary laying season. I hope that the majority of fowl-keepers in the country will spend the interval between now and this time 12 months consulting the poultry instructress and seeking her advice and guidance and help to inform themselves of the appropriate method to secure for themselves the maximum yield from their fowl between the 1st September and the 31st January &mdash; and the more eggs that are laid in that period of high prices the better it will be for the fowl-keeper and the better it will be for the country.  I do not think the House will expect me, and, in any case, I would not be able, to interview every woman who keeps hens in the country and instruct and advise her how to bring about that desired result, but I think there are available now throughout the country as fine a body of women as we have ever had concerned to help and advise poultry-keepers in every county in the country wherever they are.  If there are people who lack the technical information to get for themselves from their fowl the maximum return in the months of high prices, it will not be the fault of the poultry instructresses &mdash; it will be the fault of the women who have failed to call on their services. There is no hurry or rush, but no time should be lost by any farmer's wife who derives any substantial income from fowl in making contact with the poultry instructress and planning her programme next year so as to ensure that the bulk of her eggs will be available for sale when she can get 3/6 per dozen for them, instead of allowing the fowl on her farm to produce them at the period of surplus when they will sell for 2/- a dozen, 2d. an egg.  It is not a bad price for eggs if you grow your own stuff on your own farm and there ought not be any fowl in this country eating anything except what is grown on the land of this country.  Twopence an egg: I can remember when it was the top price for eggs, and it is not so long ago. Twopence an egg is the minimum now <Col N="1796" /> and 3½d. an egg for the five winter months.  They can produce an income a man or a woman could rub along on if they make the best of it.</P>
    <P>I would direct the attention of Deputies to one very encouraging feature of our agricultural set-up at the present time and that is the tendency for the numbers of our live stock to increase.  One of my great anxieties when I first became responsible for this Department was the very low figure to which our live stock had fallen.  In January, 1947, our total cattle were 3,703,000.  In January, 1948, they had fallen to 3,531,000.  There were a great many sages who told me that to increase the number of your cattle with any degree of rapidity was hopeless.  It was a long, slow business and to hope for anything else was chasing rainbows.  Sometimes there is a profit to be got from chasing rainbows because you sometimes catch them.  I think we have caught this rainbow.  From 3,531,000 in 1948, we have gone, in January, 1950, to 3,821,000, and I will take a flyer on this: wait for the June figure.  I will be judged by it.  I have not got it yet. I have a shrewd suspicion what it is going to be.  It will knock a grunt out of Fianna Fáil.  One of the most menacing characteristics of the cattle picture was that in January, 1947, our cattle under one year numbered 744,000. By January, 1948, that had fallen to 659,000.  In January, 1950, the number of cattle under one year is 804,000.  For the previous five years, any increase in cattle that we had was an increase in the veterans &mdash; the three-year-olds, the four-year-olds and the five-year-olds. These were increasing.  The one year-olds and the two-year-olds were going down.  I am glad to report to the House that the veterans have emigrated, lock, stock and barrel.  The juveniles are multiplying.</P>
    <P>Sheep show a gratifying increase, as do pigs and poultry.  I have reminded the House that, although the acreage of wheat has fallen by 150,000 acres, the yield has declined by less than 40,000 tons.</P>
    <P>Oats: In this I am beholden to Deputy Blaney and my distinguished <Col N="1797" /> colleague Deputy Davern.  Their exertions and melodious, mellifluous accents carried such conviction to the public that, to use the classic phrase of Deputy Davern &mdash; or was it Deputy Blaney&mdash;oats were rotting in the hedges of Donegal.  The acreage of oats was reduced, from 880,000 in 1948, to 686,000 in 1949.  The yield fell from 792,000 in 1948 to 559,000 in 1949.  That, I think, provided the text of my distinguished colleague from County Monaghan, who delivered a moving speech on the distressing cost of oatmeal. I hope Deputy Blaney and Deputy Davern listened closely to my distinguished colleague from Monaghan when she spoke so convincingly on the subject of the price of oatmeal. They wrought well but to the great cost of our people.  I trust that when they next go to the palisades they will deal with something which is not so costly to the people of our country as the oat crop.</P>
    <P>Barley: The acreage rose from 119,000 to 157,000 and the yield from 100,000 to 159,382 tons and, as there was no legislation to prohibit the brewers from paying more than 35/- a barrel, I am happy to report to the House that farmers who produced barley last year found it a very remunerative crop.</P>
    <P>I direct the attention of Deputies to the item of agricultural exports in the White Paper which, I think, will stimulate and cheer them.</P>
    <P>I may be able to give an account of the daily average consumption of milk in the cities of Dublin and Cork. These figures are at present being prepared and, if they are available, I hope to lay them before the House.</P>
    <P>The fowl market in England will be released from control shortly.  I cannot forecast, nor can anyone else, precisely what the result of that will be but this is certain, that we are entering a phase when competition in that and every other market will be much more intense.  I want to assure the House that we have no reason whatever to be apprehensive on that score.  We shall produce and offer for sale on its merits fowl of better quality and better finish than are offered anywhere else, and we will <Col N="1798" /> seek for it on the open market in Great Britain or elsewhere nothing less than the top price ruling on the day of sale.</P>
    <P>Certain amendments have already been made in the regulations controlling the packing and grading of fowl in order to produce uniformity. We will gradually advance along the lines of ensuring that where prime fowl are exported from this country they shall be exported only when they are finished and in a proper condition, due precaution being taken to ensure that the benefit deriving from that improved procedure will accrue, not to the middleman, but to the producer who takes the care to learn how to do it and, having learned, the trouble faithfully to perform the necessary operations to put our fowl on the market in the best condition.</P>
    <P>Turkeys, I think, will be a good trade.  There again Deputies are as good a judge as I but I should imagine that, next Christmas, turkeys will be at least as remunerative as they have been heretofore, but we are on an open market and I am merely making my prognostication of what that market is likely to be.  I have not the slightest doubt that we are putting on that market better turkeys than any other country in the world and I will not have the slightest hesitation in looking for, or the slightest difficulty, I believe, in getting, the top price obtaining on the London market for any Irish turkeys exported.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word about cheese. Deputies will recall that Deputy Allen and other Deputies have spoken to me on more than one occasion about the difficulties relating to those who produce farmer's butter.  I think Deputy Cogan interested himself in that matter on more than one occasion.  I have explained repeatedly that I cannot sell farmers' butter, not because it is inferior, but because the public taste has changed.  Heretofore, the British Ministry of Food were prepared to buy it, at a price, for confectionery manufacturers.  This year they notified us that they would not buy it any more because they could not get confectionery manufacturers to take it because the confectionery manufacturers <Col N="1799" /> could buy vegetable oils cheaper.  They said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If you can get a buyer in Great Britain, we will gladly license it, but we will not buy it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I cannot sell it.</P>
    <P>In so far as that problem existed in South Galway, North Clare and Kerry, my first concern was to try to meet it by bringing these areas into the butter manufacturing business.  In Clare, in South Galway, in Kerry and in West Cork, I am glad to inform the House that, as a result of the superb exertions of the Dairy Disposal Board and its staff, an organisation has been set up which I think faithfully provides for every farmer in these areas who wants to sell milk to have it collected within three miles of his door and converted into butter at a creamery operated by the Dairy Disposal Board. I then went to Wexford.  The Shelbourne Co-operative Society having abdicated and gone over to the retail distribution business and closed their creameries, I proceeded to survey the county to see if I could fill the gap they had deserted.  My difficulty is this, that the people have got out of the habit of providing milk in quantity and with the regularity which makes the maintenance of creameries easy over wide areas.</P>
    <P>Now I am going to make a proposal to them.  They closed down three creameries in Wexford.  If they will put these abandoned premises at our disposal, I will try this experiment out. I cannot establish creameries because the people are not minded to produce milk in quantity to make that economic; I cannot sell farmers' butter because the purchaser will not buy. Deputy Allen tells me that the farmers in Wexford are constrained to sell their butter for 1/6 and 1/9 a lb.  I will give them the equivalent of 2/6 a lb.  If they will bring their milk into any one of these abandoned buildings, I will reopen it as a cheese factory. We will try converting that milk into cheese and we will pay them 1/- per gallon for the milk.  We will annex to the cheese industry the feeding of pigs, using the whey which farmers have not yet familiarised with as a substitute for <Col N="1800" /> skimmed milk, barley locally produced and other feeding stuffs.</P>
    <P>If, at the end of 12 months' operation, there is a surplus of profit on our year's transactions, whatever that surplus is will be distributed by way of bonus in respect of each gallon of milk delivered to the cheese and pig centre by the farmer.  There will be no shareholders and there will be no stockholders.  The only measure will be: how many gallons of milk did the farmer deliver to the cheese factory?  If he delivered 100 gallons and there is to be a distribution of a surplus permitting of ½d. a gallon for all the milk received at that manufacturing centre in 12 months, he will get ½d. for every gallon, that is, 4/2 per 100 gallons, and if he delivered 1,000 gallons, he will get 4/2 multiplied by ten.  Whatever surplus there is will be distributed among the milk suppliers.</P>
    <P>That is the best I can do.  I do not know whether it will succeed or not, but it is worth trying, and, in any case, it is some effort to ensure that those who do not want to produce milk on the basis on which it is produced in Limerick, Cork and Tipperary, but who still, in their ordinary course of mixed husbandry, have a surplus of milk for which Deputy Allen tells me that, consequent on their abandonment by the Shelbourne Co-operative Society, they are now constrained to take 1/6 and 1/9 a lb. as butter, will get more for it.  I will give them 2/6, and more if the product of their milk realises it, and for any quantity. Maybe it will be a greater success than I dare to hope.  I do not want to raise false hopes.  I am talking in terms of minima and the equivalent of 2/6 per lb. is better than 1/6 and it has this virtue, that it is better than hot air. Lip sympathy is cheap.  A concrete effort to help may be neither popular nor successful, but it at least has the virtue of an effort to do one's best.  If there is any Deputy who can make me a proposal that would improve on that, I want to hear it, and, if it can be grafted on to that proposal or substituted for that proposal, I will be glad to give effect to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so I shall have it investigated at once.  The returns made to my Department do not reveal that, but I shall have that checked and examined at once, and the accounts of the creamery can be further reviewed.  This interesting fact, however, is true, that, in an effort to help the farmers of Mitchelstown, I sought a customer to buy their Gruyere cheese &mdash; 500 tons of it &mdash; and the thanks I got was that the customer I sought for that cheese got a letter consisting of one line: &ldquo;We are not interested in your business.&rdquo;  I had to send for the customer, bring him back again, and ask him to go down to Mitchelstown because I was not interested in the Mitchelstown creameries.  I was interested in the farmers who supplied their milk, and I did not want to be told again that their milk was surplus and an embarrassment to that establishment. Small wonder it would be if the reaction to an order is that they are not interested in the business.  Do not quote that establishment's figures to me.  I do not hear any yells of denial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>For the past three weeks the Fianna Fáil Party, debating another Estimate, have concentrated their attention on the cost of living. We listened to the grievous story of the people labouring under the cruel burden of a rising cost of living.  Now, mark this interesting fact.  The pied piper of Hamelin of that <i>démarche</i> was Deputy Lemass.  He sounded the tuning fork and the band behind scrupulously tuned their instruments and played loud and long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The burden of their symphony was that the wage-earner and the poor were staggering under the cruel burden of the murderous prices that the ignorant, grasping farmers were demanding for their produce.  All the food the people had to eat was dear and scarce, the people in the country were well enough off, but God help the poor; the cost <Col N="1802" /> of living had gone up and they were groaning under the burden, and it was the farmers, it was the food, it was the agricultural produce that were grinding down the people.  We reached the stage when it had become almost a crime to spit on your hand on a fair day and to ask a man to rise 10/- or £1 in the price of a beast was to turn the screw again and drag the last drop of blood out of the suffering people of the country.</P>

      <P>It was &mdash; those begotten by Fianna Fáil &mdash; and I reveal them now. Nineteen hundred and forty-seven is the datum year for the cost of living; every cost of living figure since is related back to 1947, which is taken as the datum figure of 100.  There has been 40 per cent. devaluation of currency since that datum year was fixed; 40 per cent.  Yet the cost of living in this country held the line; despite devaluation of 40 per cent., not one point went on the cost of living. Do you know why?  During that period of two years the cost of living rose by 18 points in respect of clothing, rent and rates.  Do you know why the allover figure did not rise?  Because every one of its 18 points was absorbed by a fall in the cost of food.  Irish agriculture absorbed 18 points of that rise, and because the poor old camel staggered under the 19th straw, the elements in this country that put the 18 straws on his back are never blamed, but the camel who carried them all and faltered when the 19th and 20th straws were put on his back is made the villain of the piece.  Agriculture, food: these are the things that are crushing our people &mdash; when, in fact, agriculture and food counterweigh the rise in the price of clothing, the rise in the price of rent and taxes and insulate our people from the impact of it all.  But that is not all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the same period, the boot and shoe industry and the leather industry had been subsidised by the live-stock industry to the tune of £700,000 a year. £700,000 per annum of a subsidy is paid by the live-stock industry to boot, shoe and leather industry.  Fianna <Col N="1803" /> Fáil Deputies have been spending three weeks for the purpose of establishing in this Parliament that the farmers are a burden on their neighbours, that they are plundering the poor, that they forced the price of food up and that if there is any increase in wage demands by the trade unions or the wage-earners it is due to the agricultural community having forced up their prices and their profits.  What has happened to the Deputies of Fianna Fáil that they want to sell their own people whom they are supposed to represent, to traduce and falsify them to serve their own political ends?  The farmers have carried the cost of living, they have carried the boot and shoe industry, they have carried 40 per cent. devaluation.</P>

Is it not true that in the last three weeks the case was made in this House that our people were ground down by the rising cost of living, largely consisting of increased cost of food, and that the wage-earner could no longer bear this cruel burden?  Is not that the case that was made?  Was there a word said from Fianna Fáil making the case that there was an increased cost of living from tariffs, from clothing, from boots, from rents, rates and everything else?  Not a whisper.  It was food, food, food.  These creatures who are supposed to represent the farmers were afraid or were too ignorant to state the facts.  Do not forget who sounded the tune.

No, when they have been made fools of, it now becomes a matter of personal honour with them to justify their folly &mdash; and they will &mdash; but I am asking them to say now, when they are discussing the Vote for Agriculture, whether they were right when they followed the Pied Piper of Hamelin, as played by Deputy Lemass, in charging agriculture with burdening the wage-earner and the poor; or do they suffer the wool to be pulled over their eyes and were they misled into denouncing agriculture for what agriculture had, in fact, protected the people from, to the tune of £700,000 a year on boots and shoes, with 18 points in the cost of living and 40 per cent. in the devaluation of money?  If there is blame for a rise in the cost of living, put it where it belongs; but so long as I am Minister for Agriculture in the existing state of affairs, it will never be put on the farmers.  As in the past, so to-day, they carry on their backs every other section of the population; and they have fought valiantly in the last three years.  If everyone else in the community did as well, we might not have as many difficulties to contend with.  God knows, when we look around the world, hopping and trotting, we are wonderfully well off.

      <Col N="1805" /> I have to inform the House that the grain storage problem is now being dealt with.  Twenty thousand tons of extra storage is being built in Cork; 16,000 tons is being built at the port of Dublin, and plans are under examination to build a further 60,000 tons storage at that port.  When we have that storage established the general situation will be further reviewed, and if further additions are necessary they will be made.  I should say that certain converted additional storage is being made available at the port of Limerick.  Our aim is to provide sufficient first class storage to permit of carrying 12 months' supply of bread cereals should that course at any time be considered prudent or necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that schemes are proceeding for the eradication of contagious abortion.  They have been attended with a remarkable degree of success, and I am happy to report that whereas in other countries where similar schemes were started it took two or three starts before they got under way, here in Ireland the thing took on splendidly from the very beginning, largely owing to the fact that people on both sides of the House and supporters of Parties on all sides of the House made common front and common cause behind the campaign. There is not the slightest doubt that the uniformity of desire to make a success of it contributed very materially to the outstanding success it has been and is being.  I am beholden to Deputies of all sides of the House for the help and co-operation they gave. I think we have all reason to be proud of the measure of success which has attended our efforts to get the people to appreciate the value of Strain 19.</P>
    <P>We are pressing on with the campaign to eradicate parasitic diseases, and I think that has met with a very high measure of success.  I ask Deputies, when they look at the June figures of live-stock population, to take very careful note of the relations between the number of cattle under one year in June, 1949, and the number of cattle between one and two years in June, 1950, for that difference will be the measure of our success in the <Col N="1806" /> eradication of parasitic diseases.  I venture to prophesy that it will reveal a very remarkable and gratifying success.</P>
    <P>I hope that we will shortly be able to commend to the public a standard and approved method of dehorning cattle.  We should avoid as far as possible the necessity for that operation after cattle have reached maturity.  It is perfectly easy effectively to perform the operation without causing an animal the slightest pain or inconvenience if it is done at an early stage of horn development. I know that it is not for the want of the will, but for the want of the way that a great many of our people have failed so far to practise this method.  I am trying to find out the surest, the safest and the easiest method of application so that we can get a standard applicator and a standard material which will not melt away in the cow-house, which will not contaminate anything it comes in touch with, and which, at the same time, can be easily and painlessly applied to a calf with the assurance that horn-growth will thereafter be arrested.</P>
    <P>Now I have to tell the House that we are confronted with the necessity for undertaking something that understandably we have been reluctant to undertake heretofore and that is the eradication of tuberculosis.  I would ask the House to appreciate that that is no mean undertaking, and I would ask the House to believe that we are preparing to face it with no illusion as to the magnitude of the task, because my aim is not to attack tuberculosis on the basis of clinical disease, but to attack it on the basis of tuberculin reaction.</P>
    <P>Now, all of us in this House know that, of the animals who react to the tuberculin test, a high percentage have no clinical tuberculosis at all.  But if you look at it from the other end it is equally true to say that a very high percentage of cattle which will react to the tuberculin test, if they are allowed to go into the herd as milch cows, will certainly develop clinical tuberculosis and in the process of manifesting clinical symptoms will infect two or three more cows, and so the cycle goes endlessly on.  Experienced <Col N="1807" /> persons in live-stock matters will recoil in dismay at the thought of tackling this on the ground that it is too formidable.</P>
    <P>Nothing is too formidable to be done. If it is not done, some child is going to get tuberculosis that need not have got tuberculosis.  I do not want to be visionary, I do not want to be impracticable, I do not want to put my hand to the impossible, but quite simply, and I have thought over it for a long time, I am just not prepared to buy peace of mind and ease of body at the cost of my child's life or the life of any of my neighbour's children.  If I had a herd of cows and was selling liquid milk for consumption, I, and I think most Deputies here, could not rest easy if I or they thought that any of the cows might be giving tubercular milk and the child of one of our customers died.  Not in so direct a sense, but in an analogous sense, for good or ill, I am fool enough to accept £1,550 a year as Minister for Agriculture in this country.  It must be the lowest paid Ministry of Agriculture outside Liberia. But, so long as I am fool enough to take that salary, I am in a sense responsible for the milk supply that is made available to our people, as the delegate or agent of the Deputies of this House.</P>
    <P>I am going to eliminate tuberculosis. It is going to cost a lot of money. There are two methods of approach. You can either go to the area where you think there is the least incidence of disease, or you can go to the area where the disease incidence is highest and which is the source from which the disease perennially percolates out through the rest of the country.  In Great Britain they are proceeding on the basis of attacking the fringe and working inwards.  In Ireland, they are going to attack the centre and work outwards.</P>
    <P>Now, we have one exceptional stroke of luck which makes it physically possible to contemplate this thing. The really formidable difficulty here has never been the question of money, has never been the question of will or desire on the part of this Government or its predecessor or the predecessor <Col N="1808" /> of the last Government to tackle this job; it was the question of replacement. If you went in and slaughtered all the animals, it became a question of physical difficulty where you would get cows to put in their places.  Now, we have had a queer stroke of luck. Heretofore, there was always a stiff demand from Great Britain for milking Shorthorn heifers and, by the mercy of God and the goodness of Providence, the British milk farmer in the South of England has gone over to Friesians, Ayrshires, Guernseys and Jerseys.  Thanks be to God, because I have the heifers now in Ireland wherewith to replace the cows which we might not have been able to replace if the Friesians, the Jerseys, the Guernseys and the Ayrshires had not been favoured by the milk producers in the South of England.</P>
    <P>Here, in Ireland, we have the dual purpose Shorthorn as the rock on which to build; the best milking breed in the world, if we want to go in for milk, is the Kerry cow, and be independent of outside sources of supply; thus we have for replacement, whichever type of farmer wants replacement, the best pure milking breed in the world and the best dual purpose breed the world has ever seen. Tuberculosis on that definition is not going to be wiped out to-morrow or the next day but, with the help of God, we have put our hand to it to-day and we will not stop until it is.  If the bill is big, I make this offer to any Deputy in the Dáil or any Deputy hereafter, that whatever the bill is, I will ask the Government to put its counterpart in bundles of notes on that floor and, if there is any citizen in the State who will bring his son in and cut his throat with the razor I will provide, he can have the bundles.  If he is not prepared to make that bargain with his own son, he should not chide me for refusing to make the same bargain with some other one's son.</P>
    <P>I want to touch for a moment on the consumption of liquid milk in this city.  In Dublin, it has risen, as between 1947 and 1950, in the months of January, February, March, April and May, in this ratio: January, 44,000 to 54,000, average daily consumption; <Col N="1809" /> February, 43,000 to 55,000; March 46,000 to 56,000; April, 48,000 to 56,000.  I have not got the May figure. In the Cork selling area from 1947 to 1950, the average daily consumption of milk has risen in the month of January from 9,100 to 9,400; in February it rose from 9,100 to 9,600; in March from 9,000 to 9,800; in April from 9,200 to 9,700.  I have not got the May figure, but I am glad to be able to inform Deputies that the tendency is upwards and we have felt justified in initiating a &ldquo;drink more milk&rdquo; campaign, and we hope that it may be successful in driving the consumption still higher.</P>
    <P>I promise Deputies that I will make available, at such intervals as they think it reasonable to demand, full statistics in respect of the performances of the land rehabilitation project in each of their constituencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but wait until I give the other figure that I have here. In respect of the works executed and completed, we have dealt with 32,950 perches of fencing.  We have cleared 41,870 perches of out-fall drains.  We have drained 1,723 acres by clearance of out-falls and made available for field drainage, as a result of out-fall clearance, .2,493 acres.  We have drained by field drainage 5,426 acres, and we have cleared an area of 4,320 acres of rock, furze and scrub.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of persons employed by <Col N="1810" /> the Department is 495 at headquarters and in the country, by farmers, whole time, 9,638, and part time 4,862.  In the spreading of lime and phosphates, it is estimated that 636 will be employed, and in the manufacture of drainage pipes, 800.  I would like to pause for a moment there.  Open confession is good for the soul.  I ran into a bottleneck.  I took a gamble.  I believed that the land project would not develop faster than I could locate pipes.  In a sense, I am glad and happy to say that it did, but I do not deny that I experienced a couple of weeks' embarrassment because I had drains opened and could not get pipes to put in them.  But where there is a will there is a way.  We got them in Derry, Holland, Crumlin, Athlone. We got them wherever we could get them.</P>
    <P>Now, Deputies may think that we need not have gone to so much fuss, bother and trouble in regard to the making of a cement pipe.  The snag in that is this, that it takes a minimum of three months to cure a concrete pipe. You may have 250,000 concrete pipes stacked in the manufacturer's yard, but the manufacturer, and perfectly rightly, will not sell you one of them until he has had them for a minimum of three months, and many prefer to have them for six or eight months.</P>

      <P>Provided the land has not an acid reaction generally; then the Deputy will have observed that in that category of land we are using clay pipes.  These are the ones that we had to get in Derry and anywhere else that we could put our hands on them.  However, the panic is now over and we have got them.  But we are going to do more than that, I hope.  We are in consultation with the Turf Development Board, and I am hoping that we shall be able, where there is a suitable deposit of clay anywhere convenient to a bog, to marry the turf and the clay&mdash;<Col N="1811" /> the turf as fuel for the kiln and the clay as raw material for the pipes&mdash; and to make these pipes as cheap as they can be made anywhere in the world, because nearly 80 per cent. of the cost of a clay pipe is fuel and 80 per cent. of the cost of fuel is transport. If you can bring the clay and fuel together you can equate the calorific value of turf fuel with coal, because the absence of the transport of turf off-sets the superior calorific value of the coal.  If we can do that in small units, wherever you get the coincidence of turf and clay, you can have a whole lot of very nice useful little industries using domestic raw materials and involving a capital outlay which would not be beyond the capacity of any half-dozen enterprising lads down the country.</P>
      <P>So far as the resources of the Industrial Credit Corporation and of the Agricultural Credit Corporation would be necessary to help an enterprising group of lads down the country who are prepared to go the right way about it in consultation with the Turf Development Board, the quicker they come to us the more welcome they will be.  Now I am going to get the pipes. I will buy them in Nagasaki or Peru if I have to, and I will buy every pipe that is produced by anybody from clay and a turf-fired kiln in this country.</P>

      <P>There are two other matters I want to mention: one is agricultural credit and the other is wheat offals.  I am a great believer in the sovereignty of Parliament.  I think this Parliament has a right to do anything it likes within the moral law.  Now, you want pollard to be made available to the consumer rather than put it into compound feeding.  So long as I could not find an alternative anywhere to take the place of pollard in the compound feed, I had to resist that demand from the Opposition because I knew that, if I conceded it, I would reduce the total volume of feeding stuffs below the level which it was safe to do. Nevertheless, if you want it and if it is possible, there is no reason on this earth why, out of pure mischief, I should refuse to accommodate you. You have as much right to live in this country as I have and, so long as I am working for the Opposition Deputies, as I am for the Deputies on this side of the House, my job is to do as nearly as I can what you want. Accordingly, I have been able to buy cheap wheat on the Pacific coast.  As soon as the cheap wheat comes in so that I can offer it to the compound feed manufacturers to replace the volume of pollard they are at present getting, I will release all the pollard and all the bran for retail sale.  Now, you will not be one ha'porth better off; but the Deputies across the way do not know that.  What will happen is that there will not be enough pollard to supply everybody's need.  It will be distributed on a quota basis to each shop, so much per cent. of what they got pre-war.  The cute boys will know the day the pollard is coming in and they will be sitting on the doorstep at 9 o'clock in the morning, waiting with a horse and cart and they will gallop in and take a bag of pollard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputies opposite think that shopkeepers in the country will quarrel with customers by refusing them a bag <Col N="1813" /> of pollard and offering them instead three-quarters of a stone in a paper bag they are very much mistaken.  The first 20 customers will get 20 bags, and the next 80 will get nothing.  But if that is the way you want it, and I can so arrange it without injuring the public interest, I conceive it to be my job to go as far as I can to meet your wishes.  That will be done just as soon as the Pacific wheat gets here.  I will bring it in at £23 a ton, or thereabouts, at the railhead down the country, and the manufacturers will have to make the best fist they can of it.  They will have to make the compound with that low grade wheat instead of with the pollard they have been getting heretofore.</P>
    <P>I come now to credit for farmers. Any co-operative society that will work with me can operate any credit scheme they care to formulate consistent with the approval of their suppliers. The sky is the limit.  Does that constitute fair provision of credit facilities?  Any co-operative creamery society in rural Ireland that wants to operate any credit scheme they care to formulate for their suppliers, if they will come to me I shall facilitate them, and the sky is the limit.</P>

      <P>That is the very information I want to give the Deputy.  My information is that you have to divide the applications and the grants of loans by the Agricultural Credit Corporation into two categories; the first is that in which they exercise exclusive jurisdiction and the second is that in which the loans are made as the agent of the Department of Agriculture.  In respect of the loans in which the Agricultural Credit Corporation has exclusive jurisdiction, my recollection is that of the applications made 20 per cent. withdrew. That seems to be a pretty common experience.  When the formalities are completed, out of every 100 applicants originally, 20 per cent, withdraw; the applicants say that they will not bother about it, that they have made other arrangements.  Thirty per cent. of the total were refused and about 50 per cent. granted.</P>

      <P>I wonder is it?  I hate to see people in this country mortgage their lands.  Some people deplore the fact that land is a bad security for a loan.  I glory in it.  In the part of the country from which I come, we do not like bailiffs and we do not give two fiddle-de-dees whether a hardpressed <Col N="1816" /> man was induced to give a bank a mortgage or whether he was not.  We still do not like bailiffs, and we do not like grabbers.  If any man takes a mortgage on land, particularly in Mayo or the West, let him take the mortgage but he does it with the full knowledge that, mortgage or no mortgage, we do not like bailiffs and we do not like grabbers.  We do not think it suitable if you cannot recover your debt which nobody made you lend&mdash; you lent it yourself&mdash;that you should claim a right to put your neighbour out on the roadside.</P>

      <P>If you want it put any clearer, I do not believe a mortgage, whether it be a landlord's or a grabber's mortgage, on any man's holding in this country, is worth two straws.  Whether it be a bailiff or a grabber who comes by virtue of a mortgage to claim the title to a man's land he will find there are a great many people not prepared to give up their title because he is a bailiff and a grabber, and they do not want him. If that is injurious to credit, let it injure credit.  We do not want a system in this country under which anybody&mdash; banker, moneylender or anybody else &mdash;can acquire a lien on his neighbour's home that will entitle him to go in on foot of a debt that he himself created, not for love of his neighbour's lovely blue eyes, but because he thought he could get a profit for himself.  We do not want him to come down under the mantle of virtue, put his neighbour out on the side of the road, and grab his holding.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is quite mistaken.  Does the Deputy see no difference between the investment of money in the improvement of land which remains a charge upon the land, no matter who lives upon it, and the lending of money by mortgage?  Does the Deputy see no difference between a land annuity payable for land and the payment of money obtained on security of land for the purchase of something else that is gone, lost and forgotten?  Does the Deputy see no difference between a loan enjoyed and dissipated by somebody of the last generation or the generation gone before and a loan, the entire proceeds of which are applied to the improvement of land that survives the borrower, no matter who he may be, and that is created only when this Government is satisfied that every penny of it, and a good deal of his own money too, will go into the improvement of the land which will survive him?  Is there not a distinction there?  Grabbers are unwelcome in this country and will ever be so.  I know of no credit facility that any farmer in this country may require that cannot be made available now, but if there is, whatever it be, let a creamery co-operative society or other co-operative society formulate a scheme to provide that and, if it conforms with the elements of prudence, they will get every facility from this Government and the sky is the limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to tell the House of the <Col N="1818" /> work which is proceeding at Johnstown. That, however, could best be appreciated if Deputies would accept the very cordial invitation which the Department extends to each one of them to visit Johnstown now.  It belongs to our people.  You represent them and I feel that agricultural-minded Deputies would be doing a useful work if they visited it.  I need hardly say that the institution would feel exceptionally favoured, if the two Deputies at present occupying the Front Benches opposite honoured it by their attendance.  I believe they and their colleagues would find there much to interest them and much to be proud of.  If they visit it before the middle of the next month, or just at this moment, they will see the various experiments that are proceeding there at present, experiments that are of special interest to those who are not primarily concerned with the scientific end.  They would see these experiments in their natural progress. You have one large field there in which every cereal is grown, subject to every mineral deficiency we know, while growing beside it is the same crop fully fertilised.  There is a potato field divided into sections where potatoes are growing side by side, each plot subject to a deficiency in one mineral.  Any farmer having studied that plot, can afterwards discern in his own potatoes what lack there may be.  Trials and demonstrations are also carried on in respect to wheat, oats, potatoes, swede turnips and, I think, mangels.  That only touches on the fringe of the work which relates also to grass management, the availability of fertilisers, etc.  In short, I exhort all Deputies to gratify the most excellent staff of that institution by showing sufficient interest to go and visit them. I am glad to inform Deputy Allen, who is interested in it, that at last we are on our way.</P>
    <P>We are building up stocks of indigenous dry grass and hope we are on our way to ensure that every farmer in this country growing rye grass for sale will grow a pedigree perennial indigenous stock suitable to the soil of this country.  I have this interesting fact to tell the House.  I abolished protection and restriction of every sort, <Col N="1819" /> kind or description on the grass seed trade 18 months ago.  It has never been more prosperous since and we are now exporting substantial quantities in competition with every other country in the world and, in any market we meet them, we can beat them hands down.  Our only difficulty is to get sufficient supplies to meet the demands that are being made upon it.  Deputies should get it out of their heads that there is nothing produced in this country that cannot be produced cheaper and better somewhere else. What we produce in this country can and should be the best of its kind.  We are now about to embark on the propagation of varieties of swede turnip. We will sell it on the open market without restriction or tariffs whatsoever. I do not want any farmer in this country to buy an ounce of it because it is Irish.  The only grounds on which I would suggest that anyone would buy it were because it was the best in the world, and if people here do not think so there are plenty of people outside who do.  We have also inaugurated the litter-testing of pigs. The artificial insemination centre will be based at Grange farm, close to Trim, where we recently acquired 516 acres of land.  We aim to use that farm (1) to take the place of Chantilly, the title to which we shall shortly relinquish: we held it on a series of leases under which we paid an annual rent; (2) to operate a liquid milk business for the City of Dublin so as to check on methods, costings and any other developments that might be of use and profit to those farmers who are primarily engaged in the liquid milk business; (3) to assemble a supply of proven bulls.  These will be assembled at Grange and, in so far as may be required, they are used for the central artificial insemination centre.  If it becomes desirable to have further artificial insemination centres in other parts of the country, they can be sent thence to them.</P>

      <P>No.  The last thing I wanted to say is that I had hoped to <Col N="1820" /> be able to tell the House the basis of the settlement with the British Ministry of Food in respect of pigs and bacon.  I am not, because I have not made it, but the matter is still under discussion.  It may be that I am unduly optimistic.  I do not think I am.  I think we will settle that matter to our mutual satisfaction.  If we cannot, it will not be for the want of the will. It will be just that we are not prepared to produce for what they are prepared to pay.  We need not quarrel about it at all.  There is a certain minimum which I am prepared to propose to our people and I am not prepared to propose less.  I have always found, when dealing with the British people, that they are a reasonable people.  It is legitimate to anticipate that when you are dealing with reasonable people ultimately they act reasonably.  To date I have not been disappointed. Therefore, I want most deliberately to say to those who value my opinion that I believe that, for the next four years, pig production is going to be highly profitable for our people.  I hope, and I emphasise the word &ldquo;hope,&rdquo; to make an agreement with the British Ministry of Food which it will tax the capacity of our bacon factories to produce&mdash;tax their capacity to produce&mdash;and which, at the same time, will tax the capacity of our ships to carry pigs to Great Britain.  I want to warn the House of this: you have wrought so powerfully on the subject of the cost of living and the price of bacon that you are going to have the satisfaction of seeing certainly one, and possibly two, of the largest bacon factories in the country close down in the course of the next few weeks.  I do not know how far that gratifies the Deputies who have succeeded in making the welkin ring on that subject.  It causes me acute and bitter anxiety for the hundreds of men who are going to be thrown out of work.</P>

I pointed to the number of men they were employing and, with great public spirit, they did carry on, on my strong recommendation to do so, in the belief that they were going to make a profit. I said that things were coming round. I said &ldquo;recover what you have lost and what you are losing&rdquo; and they did, but they are gone now and folding up.  I am afraid there is another one going to go in the West.  I wish to God Deputies would think before they let themselves loose without realising the line they are taking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a bombardment here about the price of bacon in the last three weeks.  You would really imagine, to read it, that the price of bacon consisted exclusively of the price paid for best back rashers in Baggot Street.  There is no use pretending that I or any other Minister for Agriculture can produce a breed of pigs which consists of nothing but best back rashers.  No pig can walk on best back rashers, or sit down on best back rashers, or root in the ground with best back rashers. If you ask me what part of a pig is tastiest and best, I would say a pig's cheek, but we have all got so grand and aristocratic that nobody would eat a pig's cheek.  Nobody in this House would bother to debate a pig's cheek. Nobody gets lower than streaky bacon, which used to be called belly bacon in the unilluminated days of yore.  It is now streaky bacon.  I cannot produce pigs, and nobody else can produce pigs, which consist exclusively of best back rashers, but if you will read the advertisements that are appearing in the papers, you will see that there is a great deal of every side of bacon which can be bought from ½ a lb. up.  If the whole community has got so stylish and so rich that they will eat nothing but best back rashers, I hope to God they will be made pay 5/- a lb. for it. I will do without them without any difficulty at all and I will enjoy the bit <Col N="1822" /> of bacon I will buy just as well as they will enjoy their best back rashers. I will get my bit for ½ and the more they have to pay the less I will have to pay.</P>
      <P>I have no sympathy in the wide world with people who can eat nothing but the best back rashers.  The devil mend them.  But I would be concerned if I had evidence before me that a deliberate attempt was made in a situation of scarcity to exploit the people.  There is no scarcity.  There is plenty of bacon.  There is not plenty of best back rashers, but you can get good boiling bacon in any shop in the city to-day from ½ a lb. up, and you can get a pig's cheek for 1/- a lb. I had one the day before yesterday.</P>
      <P>The Lord have mercy on John Count McCormack.  He, I suppose, had been in the most fashionable restaurants in the world.  We never had lunch together that we did not have pig's cheek because both of us liked it.  If it was good enough for him, it is good enough for the aristocrats that are going the road now.  Those who want best back rashers, let them pay what they like.  Those who want bacon, I would like to see them get it at a fair price, and those who want a pig's cheek can buy it at 6d. a lb. cheaper than they could buy it three months ago.  I will do with the pig's cheek and a piece of boiled bacon until the rashers come down.  If the grocers are waiting for me to pay 4/-, 5/- or 6/- a lb. for best back rashers they will be in the old men's home in Kilmainham before they sell any more best back rashers, and I will never miss them.</P>
      <P>If a few more people in this country would say as much, this House would not be given over for three weeks to an ill-informed assault upon the agricultural community, the first fruits of which are the closing down of two bacon factories.  Does Deputy Killilea doubt it?</P>

I am <Col N="1823" /> concerned with the men who are going to lose their employment in those factories.  I am going to take the risk of saying that, in my judgment, we will make an agreement yet that will make both of those factories pay.  We will make an agreement yet that will put both those factories on overtime, provided one thing, that the farmers will accept my word for that and breed pigs now.  I do not deny that I am asking them to take a risk.  There will be those who will say to them that feeding stuffs are dear and that maybe the demand will not be there.  I cannot counter that at the present moment, but I give them this advice and none of the advice I have given them so far has failed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Harris has begun already, saying that they will have to live on grass.  The farmers can now choose between Deputy Harris and me.  He has already started to help. He says that if you breed pigs you will have only grass to feed them on. I suspected that that would start pretty soon.  I set my views against Deputy Harris's.  Let those who believe in Deputy Harris take his advice.  Let those who accept my view take mine.  My advice is clear and concise: breed pigs now to employ the men who would otherwise be unemployed, and to earn the money that otherwise cannot be earned.  Deputy Harris's advice is: breed no pigs; do not risk it; I prophesy that they will have nothing to eat but grass.  Deputy Davern, Deputy Harris and Deputy Blaney&mdash;these three distinguished public servants&mdash;advised the people not to produce oats, not to produce potatoes and, having allowed that advice to sink in, Deputy Harris enters the arena to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and do not breed pigs because there will be no oats or potatoes so that they will only have to eat grass.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a constructive agricultural policy. If you keep on long enough at it, I suppose we will make our principal <Col N="1824" /> income out of moleskins because Deputy Harris will not be able to stop the moles from breeding.  He will not be able to get at them.  He could kill the rabbits, but the moles live underground, and I do not think Deputy Harris would be energetic enough to dig down to them.</P>

      <P>However, I set our policy against Deputy Harris's policy and let the people choose between them.  I have suggested to the House that facts and results show that the policy we have recommended to our people employs more people on the land, produces greater wealth for this nation, than any policy adumbrated by the Opposition, and that agriculture has carried on its back all the increases and the burden our people have been called upon to bear, through clothing, through rent, through rates, has contributed £700,000 per annum in direct subsidy to the boot, shoe and leather trade, and still is proudly able to carry the community on its back and to get a decent living for the farmers too.  I hope that will always be so.  It will not be so if the advice of Deputy Blaney, Deputy Davern and Deputy Harris crystallises into an agricultural policy for this country.  In my respectful submission, it will be so if the policy of this Government continues.</P>

When a Minister comes in here to move his Estimate &mdash; it is not an experience I had very often&mdash;I am inclined to have a good deal of sympathy with him because it is a nerve-racking kind of job.

There was no attempt to-day to rally the boys behind him.  There was, of course, a feeble effort to talk about the kept Press, to ginger them up.  There was a reasonable effort to band them together in the hope that he would induce them for the third time to take the story he had to tell, but it was not the Deputy James Dillon we used to know who spoke to us to-day.

With the arguments, I am not now concerned; with the wisdom of the policy, I am not now concerned. I am not even going to say that it was unwise or that it was bad, nor am I going to claim that, if I had been there, I would have made a different decision; but Fianna Fáil at one time had an admixture scheme like the compound scheme to which he has referred.  Will the House listen to a few words from Deputy James Dillon in regard to his attitude towards that scheme when he sat on these benches?</P>

      <P>I enjoyed more thoroughly the speech to which I have listened to-day than anything I have listened to or witnessed in this House since I came here in 1927, and I have been here without a break.  These were the words of the Minister in regard to the maize mixture scheme.  When he came to finish off his speech to-day, he left the pig on the rope to the end. If I were to read&mdash;I am not going to delve into this pig and bacon industry now&mdash;part of a speech delivered here by the present Minister some years ago on this question, surely it would help to an understanding as to why one must, being a human being, feel as I feel now, having listened to the Minister for two hours and 20 minutes? On the 15th October, 1947, as given in column 474 of the Official Debates, Deputy James Dillon said&mdash;whether he thought along these lines or not &mdash;in this House:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I could restore the pig population in 12 months.  I could provide every farmer and every consumer with all the bacon they would want and leave a substantial surplus for export to Great Britain.  If you set out now to plant feeding barley and potatoes on the land at present being wasted in the cultivation of beet and some of the rubbish called wheat&mdash; but leave wheat out for the moment &mdash;we could restore the pig population in 18 months at the longest, make a profit on every pig, provide bacon for every table in this country, and have an export for Great Britain wherewith to purchase goods we want, because we should have an export which they particularly want.  Of the total of their consumption, our production would form an appreciable percentage.  Instead of that, we are to subsidise to the tune of £400,000 the increased acreage under beet, every acre of which will complicate <Col N="1828" /> the world situation created by a sugar surplus and every acre of which represents a serious loss to the national income.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I think of the strutting fashion in which, in 1948, he came into this House to move his Estimate, after the completion of an agreement with Great Britain, the heads of which only were available to members of this House.  Let me read an extract from his opening speech then.  It occurred during the discussion with you, Sir, as to the scope of the debate.  I came across a passage like this, given in column 2587 dealing with the Estimate for 1948:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Dillon: It is my impatience, Sir, to deal with them and to disclose their advantages which brings them to my mind.  Let us be clear about it, and if we are to discuss their merits, I shall open the matter now.  If, on the other hand, it is decided to postpone discussion on that matter I must, with reluctance, await the pleasure of doing so on another occasion.</P>

    <P>An Ceann Comhairle: The Chair <Col N="1829" /> would like to know how far they cut across agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: They create quite unprecedented advantages to the agricultural industry of this country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have heard the speech to-day. Having waited all these months &mdash; it is a bit late to take this Vote now; it was taken a month earlier for the last two years &mdash; I thought we would have a comprehensive statement from the Minister for Agriculture, telling us the way in which the agreement referred to in these terms would work.  I wanted to hear from him some information &mdash; we got it in regard to the price of eggs &mdash; on the butter situation.  I wanted to hear about the prospect of disposing of it in a profitable fashion, in the event of our having a surplus for sale.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to give the impression that I am making a plea for mercy, but I think I should not be interrupted and that I am entitled to that protection.  If I am entitled &mdash; as I am &mdash; to relate the speech to which we have listened to the opening passage in the speech of 1948, where are the &ldquo;unprecedented advantages&rdquo; referred to in that speech?  In what sense does the performance of the Minister reach the promise which is contained in the speech, an extract of which I have read out, in which he told us that in 18 months he could raise the pig population, provide every household in the country with bacon and have a surplus for export and all the whole litany? Almost three years have elapsed, three years during which, as we know, the world was starving for food.  When the agreement made in 1948, and described in this House in the language to which I have referred, was put to test, of what did the &ldquo;unprecedented advantages&rdquo; consist?  They consist of our eggs being sold at 2/- a dozen when eggs are available for selling, and, of course, from an export point of view an inflated price when no eggs are available, no market for cream, no market for our surplus butter unless by the payment of a subsidy.  We <Col N="1831" /> could only sell the first few thousand cwt. of bacon we had to sell in a market which gave us &ldquo;unprecedented advantages&rdquo; by the payment of a subsidy from the pockets of the farmers which brought the price in the British market from 217/- a cwt. to 224/- or 225/- a cwt. when, as I would be able to demonstrate by the production of figures given to me by the Minister himself, the wholesaler here at home was charged a much higher price than that at which this small surplus was sold in a world which was, as we know, starving for food.</P>
      <P>The speech to which we have listened was a real Dillon speech.  Not having a field wide enough to hold him he flashed on to the cost of living and talked to us about the time wasted by members of the Opposition in endeavouring to show that the cost of living had gone up.  He made a charge which I at least think must be untrue. I did not take part in the discussion myself; I made no speech on the Vote. I seldom speak here at all because I hate it, but when I do I like to get a fair innings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to agree with the case that the increase in the cost of living was attributable to high food prices and an increase in farmers' incomes solely.  There is one thing wrong with this Government above all others and the Minister for Agriculture has demonstrated that more clearly here to-day than any other Minister during the last two and a half years.  If the present Government's industrial policy is having the effect alleged by the Minister for Agriculture, is it not reasonable that I should ask him what part he is playing to ensure that a policy which in his view is imposing these hardships will be modified or ended?  I am not contending that I approve of or agree with the point of view expressed by him, but after all, if, as he claims, the boot and shoe industry has imposed a burden of £700,000 on the farming <Col N="1832" /> community &mdash; I do not accept that; but if it is a fact &mdash; what contribution is he making in that regard as a member of the Government which is responsible not only for the determination of agricultural policy but of national policy?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree he is not directly responsible, but as a Minister he is one of a team who from day to day determine national policy.  If one of that team comes into the House and makes a case that a particular industry is responsible for saddling the farming community with the substantial sum of £700,000, if that statement can be substantiated, if that argument can be proven, my question is: what is the Minister for Agriculture doing in the Cabinet?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to resist your ruling in any way, but I am certainly not exceeding to the slightest degree the distance the Minister went in demonstrating that the increase in the cost of living in so far as it may have increased at all was attributable to the industrial policy we were pursuing in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that the Minister for Agriculture has charged one single industry with imposing on the farmers of Ireland a tax of £700,000 per annum?  There is no use in the Minister's coming in here and making that accusation while at the same time, when you ask him what he is going to do about it, he says: &ldquo;Would you <Col N="1833" /> close down the factories?  Would you close down the tanneries?  Would you close down the boot factories?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>My contention is that that is not the dilemma, but here is the dilemma. Deputy Daniel Morrissey, Minister for Industry and Commerce, has made up his mind, belatedly, that the wisest course to adopt is to pursue the Fianna Fáil policy.  There is no talk now about a tariff on agricultural machinery.  I sat in that place, responsible for this Estimate, only on one occasion and there was scarcely a Deputy on that side, including Deputy James Dillon, the present Minister, who did not tax me in the most violent way because I allowed the agricultural community to carry a tariff upon agricultural machinery.  I believed in that policy and I believe in it yet.  Am I not entitled to ask those who have claimed that these burdens were placed upon the agricultural community what they can do about it in the place where these things are decided, rather than come here and trot them out, giving us the impression that Deputy Morrissey, Minister for Industry and Commerce, made it clear to all those around him in the Cabinet: &ldquo;Look here, this is my show and I will run it myself.  The artificial manure factories give employment; I am interested in them, and so are the trade unions who are involved in the boot and shoe industry, and so are all the others&rdquo;? On the other hand, the Minister for Agriculture says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If that is going to be so, I must have a free hand, too.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the greatest mistakes that, in my view, has been made and will be made is this: When a Government decides upon a policy of national protection, there is no use in one member of that Government saying to himself, &ldquo;I do not agree with that policy, but in order to keep in line, to keep the show going, I will not split on it, but I do not believe in it and I will not operate it in relation to the industry for the prosperity and direction of which I am responsible.&rdquo;  Suppose that, as a national policy, were a bad policy, and suppose one individual held out against it and said: &ldquo;I will not operate it in relation to the matters <Col N="1834" /> for which I am responsible,&rdquo; that would be an unwise decision, even though he might be fundamentally right.  What would happen is this, that the section of the farmers who might get benefits of one kind or another, if the policy of national protection were applied to their interests, would get none of these benefits, while at the same time they would be called upon to pay the charges the Minister has indicated. To whatever extent additional charges are imposed on these people, they have to pay them and no section derives any advantage whatever.</P>
    <P>The Minister made some reference here to the facilities available to co-operative societies to extend credit to any limit they wished.  Then he went on to deal with mortgages and bailiffs and he got into quite an involved discussion on subjects about which all of us, I suppose, know a little.  When we discuss credit, I think it is only right to say that when you invite a credit society to lend money, you are naturally expecting the neighbours to take action very often for the recovery of that money &mdash; perhaps not very often, but on some occasions &mdash; and much and all as farmers might be credit-worthy &mdash; the majority of them might be &mdash; you will find in every section of the community somebody who is not, and you are placing upon the neighbour the onus of making a decision as to who is and who is not, and you are asking him to do that in a perfectly voluntary way.</P>
    <P>I never regarded that as a likely way out of the difficulty.  It is all right as a challenge to co-operative societies to say: &ldquo;Why do you not do your duty &mdash; the money is there for you?&rdquo;  But when you think of the member of the co-operative society who is a progressive man and has his business to mind and has no anxiety to get into difficulty with any neighbour, desirable or undesirable, he would say as most of us would say: &ldquo;That is a task I am not prepared to undertake.&rdquo;  The clearest guide as to the credit-worthiness of our farmers will be secured from an examination of the repayments in regard to a heifer loan scheme that was in operation some years ago, and it will be found also in a reply the Minister gave me last week as to the condition of the <Col N="1835" /> loans that were made in my time for the purchase of cattle and sheep after the bad winter of 1947.</P>
    <P>As regards these loans I made sure that, so far as security was concerned, any sort of security whatever, in many of these cases those who were given as security may not have signed a document at all and yet, according to the Minister's statement here, the loans have been almost 100 per cent. paid.  I gave the officials to understand that it was a loan free of interest, that we were taking these chances and there was a possibility that many of them would not pay.  The fact that you had such a good response from the point of view of repayment &mdash; does the Minister desire to interrupt me?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to suggest that the Deputy should not tell the people not to pay their loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mean that at all.  I do not believe it would have the slightest effect.  To tell you the truth&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They were meant to pay their loans, given time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of them might want time &mdash; an extension &mdash; but if a man has it in his mind to pay, the question of whether it is secured by somebody else or not will not arise.  In our approach to this whole credit business, I give these as examples to indicate that the farmer is entirely different from what he is represented to be.  I do not want to make it appear that he is a saint or that you will not find amongst the farming community, as you will amongst other classes, people who are not perfect.  You sometimes hear people talk of farmers as if they wanted loans just for the purpose of stuffing them in their pockets or of spending the money foolishly with no intention of repaying it.  My experience of farmers in the main would certainly not answer to that description.  My experience of farmers generally is that they will never take a loan unless they are reasonably satisfied that they will be able to repay it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made some remarks about utility mortgages.  I do not agree <Col N="1836" /> with him in that regard.  I think his statement as to the value of a mortgage was extravagant.  I know myself that in many cases a mortgage, any more than any other type of security to which I have referred in regard to a loan, is not worth the paper on which it is written.  There are cases in which it is not a hardship or an injustice to enforce a mortgage, to whatever extent the mortgage is of any value, so as to increase the credit-worthiness of the agricultural community.  I do not think we should give the impression that mortgages, in all circumstances, are just something to be thrown on one side and to be completely scrapped.</P>
    <P>The Minister in this House and outside of it seems to harp a good deal on one thing, namely, wheat deliveries in the year 1949.  To my mind there is nothing which makes a deliberative assembly look so childish &mdash; perhaps I may not be the best judge in the world of this but it is no harm to have an opinion &mdash; as to have a Minister standing up here endeavouring to prove, by the production of figures, something which we all know in our hearts to be foolish, or, if there is any reality in the figures which he produces, for a Deputy on the other side to attempt to knock the bottom out of them and show that he was entirely wrong.  That always appears to me to be too much like child's play.  I may say that I am not going to engage with the Minister in that sort of competition.  It is not the sort of competition that I have any interest in.  At the same time, I cannot resist referring to the matter.  I know that, in referring to wheat deliveries in 1949, the Minister is trying to show that the policy pursued by him while resulting in a reduced acreage, has had a compensatory advantage of producing higher yields.  There is a question that I would like to ask those who advance that argument in a serious way.  It is this: if the policy which the Minister claims he has been operating has had that result in relation to wheat, why is it that it has not had the same result in regard to the yield of oats?  To my sense of reasoning that is a far more intelligent question to ask because, as far as I am aware, the yield from the oats crop in 1949 was not as good as in previous years, while the yield from <Col N="1837" /> wheat was higher.  The same, too, can be said of potatoes.</P>
    <P>My query to the Minister is, what has he done to the soil of the Republic of Ireland to make this difference which he claims in regard to wheat yields and in regard to milk deliveries to the creameries?  Am I not entitled to ask the Minister a further question? Assuming that the condition in which he found the soil was such that it was in need of lime and fertilisers, would I be not entitled to ask him to demonstrate in this House what tonnage of lime was distributed?  He told me here a short time ago that the estimate of the requirements of lime in the country was 10,000,000 tons.</P>

      <P>When the Minister claims that these results have accrued from the application of a policy which we do not seem to see in motion, would it not be reasonable to expect the Minister to show that they were the result of the grinding or burning of 1,000,000 or 2,000,000 tons, or some enormous quantity of lime, or that they were due to the purchase, importation, sale and spreading of so many hundred tons of phosphates?  I went into the figures for phosphates for the last three years, and all that the increase would give was 4 cwt. per acre.  All the increased phosphates brought in would just give about 4 cwt. per acre over half the County Wexford.  I suggest that is a very low figure.  Why should a Minister make that sort of case for the purpose of advancing a political argument or of trying to justify himself before the House and the country?  I suppose it may be a defensible kind of case to make, but it is not the sort of case that I would like to have to make myself if I were Minister, unless I was able to drive it home in the rough and <Col N="1838" /> ready manner that the ordinary farmer would do.</P>
      <P>My attitude in that regard is exactly the same when I hear the Minister talk and give figures about milk production. Everybody knows that butter was scarce during the war years, and that during that time there was an excellent market for farmers' butter. Everybody knows that the scarcity of fats of one kind or another induced the farmers in those days to retain a proportion of their milk &mdash; in some cases all their milk &mdash; for conversion into butter at home.  I am not saying that just for the purpose of proving to the House and the country that for the short time during which I was in office, or my predecessor we were not as bad as Deputy James Dillon painted us when he was a member of the Opposition.  I do not care two hoots about that.  I take this line because I think it is better when discussing agricultural matters, irrespective of whether or not it is to our political advantage, that Ministers should not make fools of themselves in making statements here about the rate of progress when all over the country every farmer is laughing his belly-full at such statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The acreage under wheat went down and the Minister tried to establish that the increased yield, despite the reduced acreage, was as a result of his policy. I invite him to tell us why we had not a similar position in regard to oats and potatoes.  He should remember that in the years preceding 1949 the price and the availability of feeding-stuffs and the fact that wheat was controlled led the farmers, as we all know, to retain a larger quantity of their wheat at home for conversion into bread and for other purposes with the result that a lesser quantity was available generally for the public.  Where is the use then in making a case here which every farmer knows to be unreal?  The Minister is admittedly a very good and a very effective politician.  I enjoy the way in which he tries to put some things over.  When one wants as a Minister of State to impress the people, it is quite a good idea to talk about the conditions of employment for a Minister of State and the miserable salary attaching to that employment. By doing so the present Minister for <Col N="1839" /> Agriculture conveys the idea that he is practically tumbling over in wealth and that he has no selfish motive to serve; he is simply anxious to be there in order to speed the plough.  When I hear the statement so often repeated of how underpaid the Minister is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is not the kind of argument in which a Minister should engage.  I do not think reference should be made as to whether one is underpaid or overpaid.  I think one should take the reins and do one's job to the best of one's ability.

      <P>I have covered nearly all the points that occurred to my mind to show the tremendous change that has taken place in the Minister's attitude <Col N="1841" /> but I shall refer to just one more &mdash; an advertisement which appeared away back in 1948.  I think it was discussed in this House before.  The Minister was about a month in office at the time but he was not nearly so co-operative as he is to-day.  The high horse was in the yard and the Minister was in the saddle.  It was a very peculiar advertisement, so peculiar that nothing like it had ever appeared in any of the papers of this country at any time since the State was established because it was signed &ldquo;James M. Dillon, Minister for Agriculture&rdquo; and it told the people of the things and the ways in which they could help the Government. &ldquo;I believe co-operation,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;works better than compulsion; let us show them &mdash; James M. Dillon.&rdquo;  At that time I thought that was the most disgraceful performance which any Minister could have given because it was indicative of the whole approach to the problem by the Minister.  There was something mean about it; there was something terrifically low about it; there was something so challenging about it that it almost drove sensible people mad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>But the strutting has died down now.  We may now be able to think in terms of trying to understand, in a common way, the problems of agriculture.  We shall have now perhaps an effort on the part of the Minister to enlist, as we had in his appeal to us in regard to some matters in which he is proposing now and in the future to interest himself and his Department, our co-operation.  Costly and all as it has been, it is a wonderful source of satisfaction to us all to see that the change has taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember coming to this House in the late spring of 1947.  There was snow on the ground for weeks before and weeks after.  I was asked by the then Opposition to come in here so that an explanation could be given and a discussion could take place on the whole question of our food supply position and the prospects for the year following.  To tell the truth I was as nervous as any man could be.  There <Col N="1842" /> were problems of all kinds confronting me in the Department, as they will confront any man who is ever there, every solid year, every solid month, every solid week, every solid day and every solid hour, if he is taking his work seriously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I gladly concede that 1947 was the worst year of all from the point of view of weather conditions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree and I must say that I have rarely felt myself in such a position as I was then.  There was, of course, as was natural, a tendency to be critical.  I must admit that Deputies on all sides were fairly reasonable, in fact more reasonable than I had expected. I had a good deal to say in regard to the ploughing work that had been done, the work that remained to be done, the available machinery for doing that work, the fertiliser position, etc.  On that occasion, if I wished, I could have been very sore with some members of the Opposition who were expressing great anxiety because of the fear they felt that we might not have enough to eat during the following year but it was not a time to try to take advantage of a political opponent or to try to score one over him, as I could have.  There were Deputies in the Opposition then who were showing great concern and I could not help feeling that, if that concern had been shown some years earlier, we would have been in a much stronger position. We got through that year and, looking at the figures and thinking of the lateness of the season, I often feel amazed at how the farmers and landowners of the country accomplished the work which they did in that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After leaving this House I was obliged to go down the country to meet representatives of county committees of agriculture.  Of course I had to make speeches.  I made a few speeches that were harsh and wicked.  I made a few speeches that interpreted, as truly as any man ever could, the things that were in his mind, speeches that were designed to bring home to farmers, who might be careless or selfish, that I was going to be merciless in my dealings with them, that I was going to <Col N="1843" /> regard myself and the Department as completely free, to go in and do that work, irrespective of what it was going to cost so as to ensure that the frightfulness of that winter and the ill effects that were sure to follow it, no matter what we did, would be reduced to a minimum.  The achievement, as I say, was tremendous.  The return from the crop which they put down was understandably poor.  That was the year 1947.  It was our last year in office. Here, now, we begin at this point of how that policy was treated by the present Government.  I do not regard the present Minister as being entirely responsible for the things which have happened. There is no use in people in this House being unreasonable.  I do not see why all the blame should be thrown upon the head of the Minister for Agriculture.  Surely all the decisions that were made from the point at which I have now reached must have been the result of the collective wisdom of not 11 Ministers as we had in our time but of the 13 Ministers we have had for the past two and a half years. There is not a member of this House and certainly there is no Deputy who understands better than the Minister my reasons for behaving in 1947 as I was obliged to behave in order to ensure that our people would get enough.  It is all right to talk about pigs and bacon, poultry, the cattle population.  I am interested in these just as the Minister is interested in them and just as any Deputy in the House is interested in them.  I have need to be interested in them.</P>
    <P>In these bad times we had first of all to think of something that was even more important than these and, with regard to some of the speeches I was obliged to make in order to bring that fact home &mdash; not, now, that I am going to make this by way of complaint &mdash; in a few months' time these speeches that were delivered for the purpose of securing an end which was agreed to by everybody in this House were trotted out down the country and in this House to decry tillage, to prove that we were a Party which favoured compulsion, to prove that I wanted to be in every farmer's back yard and <Col N="1844" /> that I wanted to collect all the Gardaí and all the inspectors and bundle them in over the farmers' fences without consultation of any kind.  They were trotted out to prove one thing that no Minister for Agriculture should ever attempt to do and he certainly should not attempt to prove it with such enthusiasm as the present occupant of that office has attempted to do so &mdash; to prove that the other fellow was wrong in everything he did.  If we had had less of that enthusiasm in the past two and a half years not only in relation to agriculture but to national policy as well we would be much further on now. If, in relation to that advertisement which I have read out to the House, there had been a different approach, a different understanding, from the point of view of the occupant of the position of Minister for Agriculture, if, in fact, he really meant the words which he uttered when he said that the agricultural policy should not be reversed suddenly and that a new Minister for Agriculture should not behave like a bull in a china shop, why is it that that is exactly what he set out to do?  If there is one piece of advice &mdash; it may not be very valuable advice &mdash; that I would give to any future Minister it is that he should not make it the principal aim in life, while he has that responsibility, to prove his predecessor wrong.  He should realise that if his predecessor had had any brain or head at all he did not make a decision affecting any important matter without having considered it carefully.  It would be far better for the community if the Minister would approach what his predecessor did in the belief that I have indicated here and proceed on the basis that there was a good reason for making the decision he might be tempted or invited to change.</P>
    <P>Members of the Opposition are sometimes twitted in this House, as we have been to-day, by the Minister, for the part we played, as he alleges, in effecting certain changes that took place from year to year.  With regard to that advertisement of 1948 which was issued a month after the Minister came into office, surely the Minister is conscious of the appeals which he made then to the farmers to grow potatoes and oats?  They answered his call at <Col N="1845" /> the time.  They neglected to grow wheat to a considerable extent and they increased the production of the produce for which he asked.  I cannot genuinely understand the Minister's frame of mind when he makes, as he is free to make, any accusations he likes against members of the Opposition. Here is where I find myself.  I am told in 1948 to grow potatoes.  I grow them. The Minister makes a deal with the British Government to sell them 50,000 tons at a stated price.  This price is held up to me as the price that I am going to get.  There happens to be an abundant harvest in Britain and elsewhere. Our Minister for Agriculture only decides to press the British to keep the contract because he is pressed from other sources here that a contract when made should be kept.  I believe that.</P>

      <P>Let me continue.  The British did take the 50,000 tons of potatoes.  That is the important part. They did not want all of them for human consumption and there was an arrangement whereby the quantity that they did not want would be taken by us at the price they were worth for conversion into industrial alcohol and the British would pay the balance. When the Minister for Agriculture accuses Deputies on these benches of contributing to a reduction in the potato acreage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;attributing to us the responsibility for what is taking place in regard to the potato acreage.  I am not a very big grower but I grow some potatoes as best I can, as a farmer, and sell some.  I think of myself trying to pick potatoes under this contract, trying to induce my men to pick them, trying to pick them to a standard that would satisfy the traders, trying to meet the traders who were always able to say: &ldquo;We do not want any for the industrial alcohol factory to-day.  There is only the Dublin market available and we will give you only £6.&rdquo;  What I am telling the House is genuine.  What I am telling this House is the truth.  I am not trying to bluff anybody.  I think of the accusations that were hurled against us as to our part in effecting a reduction in the acreage, and so on, not only in regard to the <Col N="1847" /> potatoes but in regard to other crops. I know how I was treated in 1948.  I know how my neighbours were treated when they had potatoes to sell.</P>
      <P>I know the protection that was afforded to them by those who should protect them and who should have seen that the price, even of £8, should be paid.  As a matter of fact, in the main, they sold their potatoes that year at £6 although some potatoes which were sold at that price were sold for the purpose of the British contract.  Not a finger was raised to protect them.  Then we come to this House and the co-operation that is expected from us is to keep our mouths shut, never to speak a word, and to listen to the Minister for Agriculture lacerating us and telling Deputy Blaney about the sabotage in which he has been engaged and telling the Deputy from Tipperary and the Deputy from Kildare that it was their sabotage that brought about the change from 1948 to 1949.</P>
      <P>In 1949 things were not good in the potato world.  The Minister for Agriculture tried to justify the position by accusing us of sabotage.  That is the reason why, as long as this thing is persisted in, there cannot be any degree of co-operation or understanding between the people in this House who are all interested in agriculture.  I am sure my mind is not much different from the minds of most farmers.  I was not influenced in 1949 by the fact that Deputy James Dillon was Minister for Agriculture as to whether I should grow potatoes or not.  I would have grown potatoes in 1949 if they had paid me in 1948 and if I was reasonably certain that there would be a market for them in 1949.  I did not care two hoots who was Minister for Agriculture. After the way in which we had been treated in 1948, the Minister for Agriculture speaking at Mountbellew on 29th September, 1949, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;You have been persuaded, I think most unfortunately, not to produce as much oats and potatoes as you did last year.  We will be short of potatoes and oats this year and we will suffer from the lack of them next year.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1848" />&ldquo;You have been persuaded.&rdquo;  Who persuaded us not to grow the same quantity of oats and potatoes?  It was the treatment that was meted out to us in the handling of the situation in regard to the 1948 crop that persuaded us.  I have indicated the way in which the British contract for potatoes was handled.  I have stated that only a very small percentage of that 50,000 tons purchased by the merchants was paid for at the rate of £8 or £8 5s. 0d. per ton.  I have stated that most of the potatoes sold for that British contract, although the merchants could have paid that price, were sold at the Dublin market price of roughly £5 10s. 0d. to £6.  I have shown that no effort was made by the Minister, that I could see, to protect the farmers who were so suffering.</P>
    <P>What was the situation in the same year in regard to oats?  There was a hullabaloo all over the country that there was no market for oats.  That also was largely brought about by the Minister's loose talk as to the prospect of the availability of feeding stuffs at a cheap rate.  The Minister would not agree to buy, there was no market and everything was in a state of chaos. Finally, the Minister went to America. He went to tell the world the few things that he knew that they did not know.</P>

      <P>While the Minister was in America, some one of the team &mdash; I do not know what part of the team must get the credit for the purchase scheme announced before he came back &mdash;convinced the acting Minister that a scheme for the purchase of oats was desirable and that scheme was launched fairly and squarely.  After it had been launched, the Minister arrived back.  The man responsible for launching it was a wise man in a way because he knew it would not be taken too well by the Minister that such a thing should be done behind his back and he knew that the Minister for Agriculture was a man who was prone to talk and to talk freely and lucidly. When the acting Minister heard that the world had been sufficiently enlightened by our Minister for Agriculture at the meeting of F.A.O. in America and that the Minister was arriving at Shannon, he boarded the plane at Shannon to ensure that no Press man would get within earshot of the Minister, lest the beans should all be spilt.  Just as in the case of the potatoes, the scheme was a hopeless scheme and a hopeless approach to the problem that existed at the time.</P>
      <P>I do not own a great deal of land, but I have some, and I have always been accustomed to carrying out a fair share of tillage in proportion to what land I have.  In 1949, I did not break a single acre of lea land.  What would a Minister for Agriculture think of the farmer who, when promised maize meal at 20/- a cwt., would go out and slave, breaking his back and contracting rheumatism which bends him in two, in order to break up land while tillage was being scoffed at, while the horse was being scoffed at and while the plough was being scoffed at?  We could think of nothing but mechanisation, as if we were in the prairies of America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want all the time to be lashing any man's back in regard to these matters, but I have sat here so often and listened to the charges levelled against members of this Party and to the accusations made that they were <Col N="1850" /> responsible for any change that took place from 1948 to 1949, that I feel I must speak of these things, when I think of the way in which we were treated and when I know how that treatment affected me as an individual and how indifferent I am as to whether that treatment comes to me from Deputy James Dillon, as Minister for Agriculture, or from any other Deputy who might occupy that post.  It would not concern me in the least in 1949 if I were sure that I could have had some reasonable security in the disposal of my crop in whatever form I decided to dispose of it, if I were sure that I would have some protection from the man responsible for that Department and that I was not to be told that he was going to flood me out overnight, perhaps with cheap feeding stuffs, if it should so happen that I could not convert the crops I have grown into the sort of produce he was recommending to us.  Even if I could, even if I could walk, run or jump it off the land, why should I produce and walk off the land bacon, pigs, butter, eggs and any other commodity by producing a crop the cost of producing which was going to be far higher than the cost at which I was told I could buy raw materials from the Minister in charge of the Department?</P>
    <P>One of the major charges that can truthfully be levelled against this Government is the charge that they were far too industrious jointly, severally and collectively, in setting out to prove that their predecessors were wrong in everything.  In no case has that attempt been more disastrous for our people &mdash; farmers of Fianna Fáil and every other political Party &mdash; than the attitude of this Government towards tillage.  The Minister would have the House believe that this is a sort of religion with Fianna Fáil, that tillage is the be-all and end-all of everything.  I never believed that and I never thought that.  I do not believe it now, but I say that we would have been much better off now if this advertisement, in which all controls were withdrawn, had never appeared in March, 1948.</P>
    <P>That advertisement asked: &ldquo;Give us a bit of co-operation.  Never mind the boys who wanted to compel you.  They were only the Nosey Parkers who <Col N="1851" /> wanted to strut into your business. Show these fellows what we can do.&rdquo; We would be much better off now if the speeches had never been made to the poor fellow on a spring day trudging after a tired horse, with the clods of dried clay and perhaps stones getting into his boots, while he was told by the Minister that he was only a poor lout who knew nothing of the world about him and that there was a different way, a more progressive way, of doing things, that this was an enlightened age and that we should take advantage of it here.  Every word that could be uttered that was wrong was uttered and every type of inducement, everything which those who addressed themselves to this subject suspected would appeal to the selfish interests of landowners on which they could lay their finger was put forward.  What has it all secured for us and what is it likely to secure for us?  We were not done with the shocks in agriculture in 1949.  We are getting them still in 1950. We got one shock after we had been told by the Minister for Maize about maize prices.  On the 29th September, he said: &ldquo;This country was particularly fortunate that there would be no increase in the price of maize; he wanted to repeat that, with emphasis, as the Minister for Maize.&rdquo;  We were coming on to 1950 and I suppose things were happening in the outside world about which he knew something, between the 29th September, 1949, and another date I will give later.  Although things were happening in the outside world, we were not hearing of them and getting no hint of them until they had happened.  It was hard for a Minister who had spoken so in Mountbellew on the 29th September, if the indications were that that was not the kind of prophecy he should have made.  It takes a man a while to swallow words like these.  He is always hoping that something will occur to make it unnecessary for him to do so.  In this particular case, we did not hear a word about any change that had taken place, from the Minister for Maize, until some time about the 25th February.</P>
    <P>There was an advertisement issued, telling farmers something about conditions outside and warning them as to <Col N="1852" /> what they should do for themselves, their families, their stock and so on. Then a number of advertisements was issued telling farmers about Ymer barley.  The present Minister will always try to have something new, something about which nobody in the country knows anything.  I was reading the speeches on his Estimate in 1948, I read his speech in 1949 and his speech on the agreement in 1948, and I read his speech on my Estimate in 1947. That is about all the reading I did and it was enough.  Perhaps I should not have done it at all.  Last year, in moving his Estimate he talked about contagious abortion, sterility, mastitis and stomach worms or fluke worm, a little about tuberculosis and he spoke learnedly on all these subjects.  You see it is always a good thing to let everybody know that you are not depending on all the experts on your right, knowing they have it in their heads and that you know nothing; so it is well to read from these journals and documents to impress the public at large.</P>
    <P>This year, when he decided to warn the people about the dangers of the falling off of food supplies for our animals in the Fall, he told them that if they were to play safe they would have to provide for all oats, potatoes and barley.  Then two advertisements were issued in relation to Ymer barley.  It may be the best type of barley in the world but anyone knowing the kind of mind that our farmers have knows they will not cotton on to anything they know little about until they have tried it for a while.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They cottoned on remarkably well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but not to the extent that it should be necessary to single Weimar barley out as compared to the importance that should attach to oats or potatoes as feeding-stuff in the sense that the barley area is very small when compared to our potato growing area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1949, after making the speech in Mountbellew telling us as Minister for Maize that we need have no fears, we never heard a single word about the position until the 25th February.  What <Col N="1853" /> was the poor clodhopper to do with two lazy horses not too well fed, how was he to break additional lea ground from that period on?  This is no lie.  We have a lot of small farms and many ill-equipped farmers but there is no use in talking to them as if you can change that overnight.  I saw some of these ill-equipped farmers as a result of the lateness of the warning they got, trying to break lea ground in the month of May.  They were in the same position as that in which I found myself in 1949, that I would not break an additional acre of lea as long as there was an assurance from the Minister for Agriculture that I could get all the imported maize and feeding stuff at the prevailing price.  Who would employ labour, in face of that assurance, to engage in tillage?</P>
    <P>What is a farmer expected to be? A philanthropist who would employ labour and take upon himself the hardship and responsibility of breaking land with no assurance or protection when the crop is harvested?  I say that something must have happened between the making of that statement at Mountbellew and the 25th February. Some knowledge must have come to the mind of the Minister for Agriculture, his Department or the Government that would enable the Minister to warn farmers of the dangers of the feeding-stuffs position before the 25th February.  It was due to his futility, stupidity and anxiety to talk in a glamorous way.  He did not want to swallow his words and he took a risk and lost.  If it were only he that lost with his £1,520 a year it would not be so bad but people who have to live on a far smaller allowance than that have suffered and will suffer in the future because of it.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Tillage policy&rdquo;&ldquo;mixed farming&rdquo;; this is how it is mixed, and this is where, I charge, the Government do not know where they stand.  They have no attitude as a Government towards that problem.  The reason for that is the reason I have given.  The night before last the <i>Evening Herald</i> had a speech from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach and to the Minister for Industry and Commerce urging upon farmers the necessity to grow wheat and to provide beet and <Col N="1854" /> conserve dollars.  Can I not put this point?  Is it not a fair one to put to members of the Dáil who support this Government and who can support it as long as they like, &ldquo;until the cows come home&rdquo; as the old expression has it, as far as I am concerned?  Can you not get some clarification as between the attitude outlined by the Parliamentary Secretary two nights ago when he spoke to his constituents and advised farmers what they should do and told them how much it would save the community, this speech as an announcement of the policy of the present Government, with the present one?</P>

      <P>I would never make it, for the reason that I would know that a statement like that was bound to affect, maybe, a small farmer whose way of doing work and whose equipment would not be up to date.  The Minister was pouring ridicule on the man who went out and took the plough in his hand, with horses &mdash; he regarded that as out of the question.  The unfortunate part of it with this Minister is this, that, when you go to reason a matter of this kind with him, you find he drives you into the position of appearing that you want to stick on to something that is antiquated, something that is old.  Because of my criticism of the sort of line he has taken on a number of occasions &mdash; and which I think was genuinely harmful &mdash; some other Deputy might follow me and say that I was still thinking of antiquated weapons.</P>
      <P>I do not mind letting anybody see what is in my mind in relation to that matter, and let them whip me up and down the country as much as they like. The extent to which the Minister claims that mechanisation can be introduced on our farms within the next ten years is something I do not agree with.

      <P>Speaking at Ballyhaise, in my own county, the Minister gave us the assurance that compulsory tillage would never see the light of day in this country again, except in certain circumstances, and he told us that the people need have no fear, that there was a year's supply of wheat on hands. He also informed us that if ever there was to be compulsory tillage again, every farmer would know from him or his Department what exactly was the crop they would be called upon to grow.  During the past week I put down a parliamentary question asking the Minister what progress he had made in the soil survey that would enable him to do as he had promised. I was given the assurance that the soil survey had been completed.  I think it is not right that this House should, as I suspect it was &mdash; not only as I suspect, but as I am certain it was &mdash; be misled in that reply.  No soil survey of the type has been made.</P>

I do not want to have to listen to the charge being levelled that we, because of some campaign, as was stated by the Minister in Mountbellew, persuaded the farmers not to do so-and-so, when I know well we could not sell our potatoes or oats in 1948 and that in public statements the Minister told those of us who would be foolish enough to follow such a policy that he was going to swamp us in maize meal at £1 a barrel and, a year later, told us we need not be prepared to plough land in October, November and December because there would be no increase in the price of maize and there was, therefore, no need to plough additional land to provide for our stock.</P>
      <P>I want to secure that there will be some degree of clarity in the mind of the Minister and in the minds of those who have to work on the land and that we will not be reduced to the sorry plight of having a Minister for Agriculture, who has been almost all his public life denouncing wheat, beet and peat, scrounging around through Leinster House looking for advice and assistance as to how the beet acreage could be increased.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand it has not been an unusual practice to withdraw money from the Road Fund and transfer it to the Central Fund.  We know that the Central Fund is the general pool from which all the money needed to meet State outgoings has to come.  When the practice that I have referred to was in operation in the past, we had better grants given for roads.  I take it that all the taxation collected from motorists who use the roads to any great extent is put into the Road Fund from which it is later made available for the maintenance and upkeep of the roads.  During the Fianna Fáil régime certain grants were given out of the Road Fund for the maintenance, particularly of county roads, by way of special relief grants. That has been discontinued to a considerable extent.  The grants have been reduced in most counties.  In Kilkenny the grants in 1947-48 amounted to £114,808; in 1950-51 we will only get £73,000.  If money is available in the Road Fund it should be devoted to the purpose for which it was collected.  I take it it was collected for the maintenance and upkeep of the roads.  At any rate, that was the original intention.</P>
      <P>There are 20,000 miles of culs-de-sac in rural Ireland.  Why have the grants given by way of minor relief schemes been reduced and, in some cases, discontinued? I take it the Minister for Finance is directly responsible for that. At one time there were schemes operated by the Employment Schemes Office.  In 1938-39, the amount of money made available for the repair of culs-de-sac was £225,000.  In 1949-50, it was reduced to £152,000.  We hear a good deal about the flight from the land.  The reason put forward for that flight is that the people have not the same amenities in the rural areas as they would have in the cities and towns; therefore, they are drifting into the cities and towns where they will have these amenities.  I do not think these people could be given a greater inducement to remain at home than providing them with suitable roads to their homesteads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Government had a scheme under which farmers could obtain grants for the repair and upkeep <Col N="1867" /> of these roads.  That money came from the Road Fund.  Why has that been discontinued by this Government?  We hear a good deal about unemployment. There would be plenty of employment in the rural areas during the winter months and the early spring, when agriculture is at a low ebb, if these grants were given for the repair and maintenance of roads.  I think that would be one way in which we might keep the people on the land by providing them with employment under these schemes.</P>
    <P>Grants were made available for a variety of reasons.  The number of people on the register was an important qualification in the obtaining of a grant.  The farmers had to contribute 25 per cent. of the total amount.  Some of them were not in a position to contribute that 25 per cent.  In such cases I think the Government should increase the percentage contribution they are prepared to make.  Surely it should not be necessary for the Government to borrow from the Road Fund for other works.  The money in that fund should be utilised on the roads.</P>
    <P>In 1947, the Local Government Department asked for a survey of all the roads.  In almost every county the surveyors reported that it would take at least a year, and possibly two years, to bring the roads back to the condition in which they were pre-war.  In 1947, we asked that the same grant would be given as was given in 1946-47.  That was not done.  If those who are now holding the national purse-strings were to go down the country and see for themselves the condition of the roads, I do not think they would quarrel with county councils asking for increased grants or with the farmers living along these culs-de-sac if they ask for a greater contribution than 75 per cent. Difficulty arises where there are, for instance, five farmers living along a cul-de-sac, three of whom can make the necessary contribution and two of whom are unable to do so.  In that case the work is not done because of the inability of the two to make their contribution.  In such cases I think the Government should increase the grant so that work could be done.  On some of these by-roads it is impossible to <Col N="1868" /> bring in modern machinery for farming purposes.  Threshing sets cannot be brought in.  Lorries cannot call to collect beet and the beet must be carted by the farmer to a pick-up point.  In the West of Ireland the beet has sometimes to be carried five or six miles to a pick-up point.  Loss is sometimes sustained because of bad weather and through trespass by wandering animals. These factors should be taken into consideration when applications are made for grants for the repair of these cul-de-sac roads.  The Government should have some other means of recouping itself other than by borrowing from the Road Fund.</P>
    <P>We know that many of the county roads were never built for the purpose of taking heavily laden vehicles.  I have seen a vehicle weighing 29 tons travelling on a road that was originally built to take one ton.  Who will be responsible for the condition of the roads and their upkeep if that continues?  In a very short time these roads will give way.  Will the cost of putting them into repair then fall on the unfortunate ratepayers?  It might be interesting to see what the position is as regards the grants made available last year as compared with the year 1939.  In 1938-39 the amount of money contributed by the Road Fund per mile was £82, and in that year the rates contributed £63 per mile, making a total of £145 per mile.</P>

      <P>The grant made available in the year 1938-39 from the Road Fund amounted to £82 per mile and the rates contributed £63, making a total of £145.  In 1948-49, the contribution from the rates was £319 per mile and the Road Fund contributed £76 per mile, making a total of £395 per mile.  In 1949-50, the Road Fund contributed £126 per mile and the rates contributed £83.  There was a reduction in the grant made available from the Road Fund and there was a substantial increase in the amount contributed by the ratepayers in order to maintain the main roads.  The same thing applies so far as the county roads are concerned.  The main roads for the past 15 or 20 years received so much attention that they are now able to carry the heavy traffic put on them, but during that period the county roads were neglected to such an extent that they are not now in as good a condition as they were in 1935-36, for instance.  Now they have to bear a different type of traffic altogether from that which they had to contend with in 1935-36.  In 1935-36, we had not anything heavier than a horse and cart travelling over these roads, but last year, as I say, I saw a lorry weighing 29 tons laden with beet passing over these roads.  Unless attention is paid to these roads now, the ratepayers of the country are going to be faced with the prospect of contributing far more than at the present time in order to keep them in repair.</P>
      <P>The Minister challenged me on the question of the amount of money that was contributed from the Road Fund in 1938-39.  I shall now give him the figures.  In that year the rates contributed £1,325,000 and the Road Fund contributed £700,000.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask <Col N="1870" /> the Minister the position as regards the county roads.  Does he not agree that because of the reduction in the amount contributed by the Road Fund, the rates will have to contribute a considerable amount for maintenance on the main roads?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We are paying a less proportion of the expenditure on the country roads but taking it all in all &mdash; and you must take it all in all &mdash; the amount of money now expended by way of grants in any county is less that it was in 1948-49.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to draw attention is to the question of special grants for tourist roads.  There are many parts of the country &mdash; I might call them inland parts&mdash;that might attract tourists if we had good roads leading into them and proper means of transport.  Very recently a deputation from my constituency met the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government regarding a certain road and we applied for a grant but no grant was made available for that purpose. That particular locality could be made a good tourist centre if there was a decent road leading into it.  If the Minister thinks that the Road Fund can afford to lose £300,000 this year, why should not some of that money be made available for the purpose of putting that road into a proper state of repair, so as to give people who might wish to visit that part of the country an opportunity of doing so? The people who live in that part of the country are prepared to cater for tourists and they believe they have something to show them.  There are as many beauty spots in that area as there are in County Dublin but the trouble I see in this country at the moment is that everybody seems to be looking through Dublin eyes.  Provided Dublin and its surroundings are catered for, they think that no other part of the country needs any attention.  Surely that should not be the case when the money is there available to expend on roads in these country districts?  Such expenditure will not entail extra taxation and will not mean a greater burden <Col N="1871" /> on anybody.  The money is available in the Fund.  It was collected for this purpose and it is not being used for the purpose for which it was collected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy say it was collected for a certain purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. T. Walsh Mr. T. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Walsh</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Absurd.  You must have forgotten the Supplementary Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. T. Walsh Mr. T. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not concerned with the Supplementary Budget at all. The matter with which I am concerned at the moment is this £300,000 which the Minister is taking out of the Road Fund and transferring to the Central Fund.  That is the only matter that concerns me at the moment though at a later stage I may be concerned with many other things.  Ostensibly this money was collected for the maintenance of roads and surely it is the duty of the Minister and the Government to see that money is devoted to the purpose for which it is collected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said that the amount of money contributed by the rates to road maintenance has increased generally.  I might say that the rates themselves since 1938-39 have doubled and they cannot be increased to any further degree.  There is a general outcry throughout the country for a reduction of rates.  The Minister cannot say that it is the duty of the local councils for instance to put some of these roads into a proper state of repair.  When the Fianna Fáil Government was in office, during the period of the emergency and when money was needed for many other purposes, they continued to make these moneys available for the purpose of repairing these roads, particularly cul-de-sac roads.  I have not the information before me and I should like to know what amount of money was paid out from the Exchequer last year and the year before for cul-de-sac roadways.  As far as the constituency which I represent is concerned, I know that it is far more difficult now to obtain a grant than it has been for years past.  I would ask the Minister that when this money is available&mdash;and there seems to be no <Col N="1872" /> other purpose for it except to transfer it by way of borrowing to the Central Fund &mdash; it should be used for the purpose of repairing cul-de-sac laneways throughout the country.  In parts of the country the terms that now obtain are all right and people are perfectly satisfied with them while in other parts of the country the people are unable to meet the 25 per cent. contribution which is required.  I would ask the Minister to make this £300,000 available and, in addition to that, I would urge, when making this grant, that if it still has to be maintained at the 75 per cent. level in many cases where the valuation is over £12, the county councils be empowered to give a grant for the purpose in order to lighten the burden on the people living in these laneways.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I also oppose this section in the light of the general position of the roads after the conclusion of the world war.  During the term of office of the last Government we went through two different periods. There was the period of the economic war during which much national development was undertaken and during which, having regard to the circumstances of the time, we were unable to do what might have been regarded as the ideal maximum in road construction and improvement.  A great deal of work was done and as the number of cars on the roads steadily increased the roads were improved throughout the country.  During the world war the amount of money available for Road Fund work, and equally for materials for road repairs, was very substantially reduced.  At the end of the war the last Government gave additional grants &mdash; £2,000,000 more than is being given at the present time&mdash;for the period 1948-49 in order to overcome the deficiencies of the war years.  The last Government on frequent occasions raided the Road Fund for the purposes of general revenue.  However, I think that if the Minister were to calculate the amount made available in each year of the Fianna Fáil Government's régime for the improvement of non-public roads, the improvement of bog roads, in contributions to local county councils for the improvement of county <Col N="1873" /> roads and the expenses undertaken in connection with the rural improvements scheme, he would find that, on the whole, the amount made available under those heads exceeded the total raids made on the Road Fund.  I should be very surprised to hear that that is not the case.  For a number of years the amounts spent under these heads greatly exceeded any raids made on the Road Fund.  Even if that were not the case, we have so much of the effects of the war to overcome that it seems to me most inadvisable that the Minister now and in our present conditions should subtract from the Road Fund any sum of money for general revenue purposes.  As far as I can gather, for the year 1949-50 a total sum of £210,000 was made available for roads under minor relief schemes and rural improvement schemes.  Of the sum made available for rural improvement schemes which, I understand, was about £104,000, a considerable amount was devoted to catching up on schemes that had not been inspected or sanctioned in previous years.  I was unable to obtain from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance the actual net expenditure on rural improvement schemes actually sanctioned and applied for in the year 1949-50.  As far as I can gather, not more than £200,000 was spent on all these road schemes and £300,000 is now being taken from the Road Fund for general revenue purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well at this point that we should examine the question of the roads of this country in a general way.  I should like to remind the Minister there are 50,000 miles of roads in the country in the ownership of public authorities of which only 10,000 miles are main roads. Only about 13,000 miles are surface-dressed. The remainder consists of county roads not surface-dressed.  The condition of these county roads, although greatly improved in the past 20 years, compared with those in other countries with a similar income to ours, is very defective.  Anybody who represents a country constituency knows that no matter what is going to be done for agriculture or industry in this country the young people, if they appear to the older generation to be spoiled, want comfortable roads to <Col N="1874" /> travel to the market, to school, to Mass, to the cinema or to dances.  The Minister knows as well as I do that one of the definitions of a modern State is the condition of the roads therein.  In addition to these 50,000 miles of public roads we have, according to the Minister for Local Government, no less than 20,000 miles of non-public roads &mdash;boreens leading to farms.  An enormous mileage of roads has been repaired by various methods during the past 16 or 20 years but not repaired in any case according to any technical system or to any basis related to the condition of the road and the necessity for its repair having regard to modern conditions.  There was so much development to be done during the economic war and there was so much turf to be cut during the world war that it is no blame on the former Government that they had neither the means, money nor opportunity of discovering some method of repairing and improving the 20,000 miles of non-public roads which are in such a condition, as the Minister will discover from his Valuation Commissioners, that the price of a residential farm, no matter what the quality of the land, decreases in proportion to the distance of that farm along the boreen from the nearest county road.  This Government, not having the burden of intensive turf production and war difficulties which we had to bear, should have some way of dealing with the miles of non-public roads on a functional and technical basis and not according to the present method whereby grants are available if the users agree to contribute a certain proportion of the cost or if a certain number of people are unemployed in the area or if it is considered that enough turf can be moved off a particular boreen to justify a very small amount being made available under the bog development scheme.  These are basic facts in regard to this situation.  The Minister for Finance knows as well as I do that the number of motor cars on the roads is constantly increasing and that not even the most efficient board of Córas Iompair Éireann can do anything in the world to stop the use of lorries and private cars by the people of this country.</P>
    <P>We know the difficulties confronting <Col N="1875" /> Córas Iompair Éireann in regard to road freight traffic and rail traffic.  It is not the cost of carrying the goods from one area to another but the cost of handling the goods before they start moving and after they start moving that is the great bugbear of the transport system of this country.  As a result, people find it more convenient to own their own vehicles and farmers combine with one another to bring their cattle to the market.  That has been going on for the past 25 years. Not even Sir James Milne made any substantial proposal to try to correct or alter that tendency.  The result has been that the number of vehicles has increased since 1938-39 by 66 per cent. and the number of vehicles that do 90 per cent. of the damage on the roads, that is, goods and public service vehicles, has increased by 100 per cent. and with that increase there is a correspondingly increased amount of damage being done upon the roads.</P>
    <P>So far as I know, the capital value of the work done in putting a waterproof tar or concrete skin upon the roads of this country was estimated at £25,000,000 in the year 1944.  It probably has slightly increased since then and, in terms of replacement at present costs, it is enormously increased.  Much of the restoration work effected by county surveyors was meant to cover the road quickly with a waterproof skin to protect it and preserve it.  It was not meant to be in the nature of long-term improvement of roads.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind those figures that I have given, the increase of 66 per cent. and 100 per cent. in the case of public service vehicles and goods vehicles since 1938-39, we have the following figures that have already been given by Deputy Tom Walsh: The total amount made available for the roads in 1938-39 from all sources, Road Fund and rates, was £2,025,000.  The total amount made available in 1949-50 was £4,640,000.  On the face of it it seems like a very substantial and adequate increase.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister for Local Government answered a question in the Dáil to the effect that the cost of improving and repairing roads has gone up by at least 125 per cent., owing <Col N="1876" /> largely to the increase in wages of road workers, desperately needed by those men, given in succession under the auspices of the former Minister for Local Government and by the present Minister for Local Government, and also owing to the increase in the cost of materials.  Some county surveyors have told me that 125 per cent. is an underestimate and that it would go up to very nearly 135 per cent. by the end of this year, owing to further anticipated increases of wages or increases of wages already granted.</P>
    <P>You just take the ordinary mathematical rule that £225 worth of road work will do the work of £100 of road work in 1938-39.  There is no cooking about that figure.  There is nothing that can be disputed about it.  It is a perfectly simple mathematical figure. The total amount made available in 1949-50 then becomes, in terms of value effected, £2,220,000, an increase of 10 per cent. since 1938-39, in contrast to an increase of 66 per cent. in the increase in the number of vehicles and 100 per cent. in the number of vehicles that do the damage&mdash;the public service vehicles and the goods vehicles.</P>
    <P>You go further into the matter and you examine the question of the amount made available for main roads.  You find that, applying that principle of value to the amount of money available, there is actually 31 per cent. less available now for main roads than there was in 1938-39&mdash;31 per cent. less available. That is due partly to a decision by the Minister for Local Government to grant more money for county roads. It may have been a good decision from one point of view, that, obviously, something has to be done to improve the county roads and make them worthy of our modern civilisation. The only effect has been, however, to delay the inevitable improvement of the main roads, to endanger the scoring of the surface to the point where severe capital damage will be done and the increase made available for county roads will not be sufficient to effect a good job of improving those roads that will be noticeable even to the people who live in the country in the course of the next ten years.</P>
    <P>Applying the same principle to the <Col N="1877" /> increase in the grants for county roads, the figures on paper look magnificent. In 1938-39 the total amount available for county roads was the small sum of £853,000.  In 1948-49 the total amount available from rates and from the Road Fund had risen to £2,601,000.  The amount available last year rose not very much under the present Government to £2,696,000.  The impression has been given abroad very largely that the Government increased the total amount available for county roads over and beyond what was made available by Fianna Fáil.  The facts are that, having reduced the total amount available for all classes of roads by £2,000,000, the actual amount made available for county roads remained very nearly the same, with a slight increase.</P>
    <P>Applying again this ordinary principle of value of money in terms of work done, the increase in the amount made available for county roads since 1938-39&mdash;the real increase&mdash;is only 40 per cent., still less than the increase in the number of vehicles&mdash;66 per cent., in the same period and 100 per cent. in the case of goods and commercial vehicles.</P>
    <P>Therefore you have those three figures&mdash;10 per cent., real increase for all roads, minus 31 per cent. for main roads and plus 40 per cent. for county roads.  It seems to me that, in face of those figures, it is impossible to sustain the argument that in this year any money should be taken from the Road Fund for general revenue purposes.  I quite appreciate that the Government have embarked on very large scale schemes of national development and we could argue from this till Doomsday about how much of the £106,000,000 borrowed and taxed should be spent on roads, agricultural development, industry or any other of our many national development services but I do claim that the question of improving the roads adequately, of reducing accidents due to physical fatigue, of reducing the enormous damage done to commercial vehicles through poor corduroyed roads throughout the country, and the consequent waste of the national income, is a matter of vital importance to the Government and that the decision made <Col N="1878" /> this year to take £300,000, although it may seem a very small matter, does not augur very well for the future.</P>
    <P>I would seriously ask the Minister to reconsider this whole question in the light of the figures that I have given, which cannot be questioned.  They are not cooked in any way.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider it because, as I have said, the real amount made available for roads, having regard to this figure of 125 per cent. increase in the cost of repairing, is an increase of 10 per cent. on 1938-39.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of every single thing, the argument now is that it was done before, that Fianna Fáil did it for so many years and therefore it must be right in all circumstances.  Admittedly, Fianna Fáil, on a number of occasions in difficult times, had resort to the Road Fund, but, on the basis of the Minister's Budget this year, there seems to be no justification whatever for taking anything from the Road Fund.  His revenues this year were so buoyant that he needed no extra taxation.  Despite the many millions of extra expenditure to which he is committed, he needed no new taxation to provide this extra expenditure.  It is a wonderful achievement, but it is no reason why he should rob the Road Fund.  The moneys accruing to the Road Fund from duties on mechanically propelled vehicles have been spent, almost 100 per cent., on the maintenance and building of roads since the State was established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not forget any year. I remember that away back in 1929, <Col N="1879" /> 1930 and 1931, in addition to robbing the Road Fund, you robbed the old age pensions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In this year, when it was not necessary to raise a halfpenny from new taxation, because revenue was so buoyant, and when the Minister is enabled to spend many millions more for ordinary Government services without any extra taxation, he should not rob the Road Fund of £300,000.</P>
      <P>He will probably argue that the proportion the Road Fund is paying towards the maintenance of roads has changed and that less is being paid from local taxation and more from central taxation than formerly, but that is an argument which does not hold water either.  As Deputy Childers has pointed out, the heavy commercial vehicles have increased in number by 100 per cent. and these are damaging the roads most severely.  The ordinary light vehicles have increased by almost 50 per cent.  The Road Fund is greater and there is greater damage being done to the roads.  Eighty-five per cent. of what is spent on roads from local taxation is derived directly from land as against buildings and other property. Of the amount provided by local authorities, 85 per cent. is provided directly from a tax on land and the Minister should keep that in mind. He should also keep in mind that, while the State has been engaged for the past 30 years in improving the roads, it has succeeded in improving or building up only 10,000 miles of the 50,000 miles of main and county roads that we have.  There are still 40,000 miles to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the roads in the country are now main roads because they are all being used by owners of motor vehicles. There is scarcely a townland in the whole countryside in which somebody has not got a motor vehicle, or two or more motor vehicles.  The back roads, as we call them, or the county roads, are being utilised by motor transport at present and that is all the more reason why the Minister should make <Col N="1880" /> the total of the Road Fund available to local authorities for helping to build up the roads of the country.  It is a big problem and one that must be met by the State from central taxation to enable the local authorities to build them up.  They can never hope to put them in the state in which they should be, without the aid of the central Exchequer or the Road Fund.  In this year of buoyant revenue, the Minister should give this £300,000 to the Road Fund and so enable local authorities to improve a further mileage of the roads which so badly need to be improved.</P>

      <P>Whatever justification there might be for other portions of the Finance Bill, there is no justification whatever for this proposal.  I have here replies by the Minister to questions asked by me.  One of them given on 18th April, 1950, shows that the yield from the tax on petrol in 1947-48 was £1,500,000, which increased, in 1949-50, to £3,213,000.  According to a reply given by the Minister for Local Government on 3rd May, 1950, there was a sum of £785,396 more from motor taxation as compared with 1947.  That represents £2,484,000 more than was extracted in the last year of the Fianna Fáil Government.  The Minister has roughly about £7,000,000 of an income out of other people's property.  The roads are not the property of the State; they are the property of the local authority which built them up and maintained them out of the rates extracted from the farmer each year.</P>
      <P>What has been the attitude of the various Governments and what is the present position of affairs in regard to these roads which are the property of the local authority?  Here is the report of the county surveyors for Cork County:&mdash;</P>

      <Col N="1881" /> Our maintenance figures are the lowest at which we consider our roads can be maintained at their existing standard.  The comparative figures of our estimate and the amount available in 1939/40 show an increase of 126 per cent.  This at first glance seems large but is, in fact, on the small side as wages have increased from 35/- a week to 66/- a week, an increase of almost 90 per cent., and the price of cut back bitumen has increased from £4 1s. Od. per ton to £15 12s. 4d. per ton, an increase of 385 per cent.  This means that our surface dressing costs have gone up practically three times the pre-war price.  Having regard, therefore, to the value of money, we are asking for less than was allowed pre-war.</P>
    <P>The biggest factor of all we have left to last, namely, the intensity of traffic and the change that has taken place both in the location and weights of such traffic.  Roads that only occasionally saw a lorry pre-war are now expected to take very heavy traffic and these roads have deteriorated sadly.  In August, 1939, the number of vehicles taxed in County Cork was 5,571; in August, 1948, it was 8,997; in August, 1949, it was 10,791; and the estimate for 1950 is 12,300.  In other words, our motor traffic has doubled in numbers and is getting on towards trebling, and the weights of the individual vehicles have also increased in nearly the same proportion, so that it would be fair to say that the total weight of motor traffic using the roads to-day is not less than four times that of pre-war.</P>
    <P>Last year the amount of money available for county roads permitted only a negligible amount of surface dressing on existing surface-dressed roads and no money was available for this purpose from central funds, with the sole exception of a few miles of suburban roads carrying city bus services. In the South Cork district, for instance, there were 162 miles of surface-dressed roads at March 31st, 1949, and over 150 miles could not be done.  This is a very serious situation as a few years of this would mean the breaking up of these roads <Col N="1882" /> and the loss of the capital expenditure involved in their making.  The same applies, in a lesser degree, to the north and west areas, but the total money involved is not far short of £750,000.</P>
    <P>In view of the above, we consider that we are justified in not accepting responsibility for the maintenance of the roads unless the sum asked for the purpose is made available.</P>
    <P>In the course of the year, and in fact any year, representations are made in various ways to the council to have certain roads rolled, etc., and a common method of dealing with such applications is to refer them to the estimates meeting.  We are now submitting a list of roads which, in our opinion, should be improved, and we give in each case an approximate estimate for the council to implement resolutions, or take such steps as it thinks fit.  In considering this list, it can be borne in mind that a grant for the improvement of roads will, in all probability, be made available in the coming year much on the lines as in the current year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is signed by Mr. D. Coffey, Mr. J.T. O'Donnell and Mr. P.J. Malone, the three deputy county engineers for the area.</P>
    <P>What is the result of that appeal? They say, in the first place, that the minimum required for road maintenance was: main roads, £160,000; county roads, £253,000.  All they got from the county council was £136 for main roads and £206,000 for county roads, leaving a deficit of £71,000 for road maintenance on main roads alone.</P>
    <P>The reason is that in the past two years the grant for road work in Cork County given from the Central Fund has shown a reduction of £94,000 per year, according to the figures given by the Minister for Local Government in reply to a question asked in the Dáil by Deputy Childers on the 14th March this year.  The answer says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Statement showing amount of grant for all purposes allocated out of the Road Fund to each county council for the years 1948-49 and 1949-50:&mdash;Cork: 1948-49, £397,324; 1949-50, £302,709.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1883" /> Various moves are being made in regard to the borrowing of money and everything is thrown on the future.  The Minister has boasted here very often about the income from tourist traffic. The £7,000,000 collected each year between petrol tax, motor taxation and import duty on vehicles is collected out of other people's property, the property of the local authority.  The Minister then comes along coolly to extract this year &mdash; having an increased income of £2,484,000 between petrol tax and motor taxation over and above what the previous Government had in the year they left office &mdash; £300,000 out of the Road Fund, to let the roads go back into the condition of deterioration pointed out by the county surveyor.</P>
    <P>I did not think there would be any occasion for me to speak on this matter at all, but I thought from the support I got from Deputy Davin &mdash; he is missing now, but probably will be here when the Division Bell rings &mdash; and from Deputy Peadar Cowan and the protest they made here when an attempt was made to reduce taxation on the Finance Bill and when they pointed out that that money was needed for the roads and would have to go to the roads.  I wonder on what side of the Lobby I will find Deputy Cowan if the Minister is adamant.  I wonder what Deputy Davin will do &mdash; his county has suffered a reduction in road grants&mdash;in Laoighis from £160,000 to £69,000 and in Offaly from £90,000 to £48,000.  Those are figures which I would ask Deputy O'Higgins to look over.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>These figures were given on the 14th March, 1950.  The Deputy's county has dropped some £100,000 in the road grant.  I am endeavouring to save for him, as well as for my own county, some £300,000 and I hope he will show his gratitude in that respect in the Lobby.  That is where I would like to see him.  I am sure Deputy Davin, considering the row he kicked up here a few nights ago on the petrol <Col N="1884" /> tax and against the reduction in the price of petrol, stating he wanted it all for the roads, will realise his duty.  I regret he has not come into the House and given us the benefit of his pressure on the Minister in this respect, as it is a very serious matter when the central authority takes over property belonging to the local authority and starts using it as revenue, worsening that property year after year.  It is just like the description given by our esteemed friend, the Minister for Agriculture, when he talked of the fellows growing the wheat during the emergency and said they were mining the land.</P>
      <P>The Minister is mining the roads, mining what was built up out of the rates paid by unfortunate farmers in each county.  They built up those roads, but the Minister now lets them at so much a mile in petrol tax and so much a mile in motor taxation to the tourists who come in and gallop along in high-powered cars all over the country and eat all the money.  By extreme manipulation the total amount of the grant for all purposes which in 1948-49 was £4,470,000 was reduced in 1949-50 to £2,435,000.  That is a reduction of £2,000,000.  That is £2,000,000 less than was given by the Fianna Fáil Government in their last year of office, and the Minister has got £2,500,000 more than the Fianna Fáil Government got in the line of taxation on those roads.  I for one can see no justification whatever for this flagrant robbery of the Road Fund this year.  I opposed the taking of money out of the Road Fund before though I was a member of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the money the Minister is endeavouring to rob.  I have given one set of figures from our county surveyors in Cork County.  I have shown that, despite the fact that they stated that they could not be responsible for the roads if they did not get the full amount required for their maintenance, when we made appeals to the Minister for Local Government to increase the grant and give us back some of the £94,000 by which he had reduced the grant for Cork County, the Minister told us that despite anything that would happen he could only give us what he had given us before, £90,000 less than Fianna Fáil had given us, and that we could keep up the roads on that.  That was the attitude of the Minister for Local Government.  I do not blame him because the Minister for Finance is holding the purse.  Despite the fact that the cost of upkeep of those roads has increased enormously even during the past 12 months I could not, as representative of the ratepayers in that county, ask them to pay anything more seeing that the prices for their farm products are held on the 1947 level and that their costs of production have gone up steeply.  Therefore the roads in Cork County this year, according to the statement of the county surveyors, have deteriorated to the extent of £71,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Next I will give you the estimate of the county surveyors for the improvement of main and county roads in Cork County to bring a portion of the roads up to the standard required for comfort by the tourists who come in to increase the income of the Minister for Finance and incidently to increase the prosperity of the country.  The amount required in North Cork is £308,000; in South Cork, £419; and in West Cork, £279,000.  £1,700,000 according to the estimate of the surveyors is required to bring a portion of the road in Cork County up to a standard that will bear modern traffic.  With that knowledge, facing that condition of affairs, this <Col N="1886" /> Minister for Finance who borrowed £12,000,000 this year puts his two paws into the Road Fund and grabs £300,000 out of it.</P>
    <P>My appeal is not so much to him as to the rural Deputies of the country who are sitting there looking at this thing happening.  I want to know what those rural Deputies, each of whom has his own county which has dropped between £40,000 and £50,000 in road grants over the past two years, think of it.  I want to know if they are satisfied to have their roads deteriorate like the roads in Cork.  Are they satisfied to contribute that much into the pool so that the Minister for Finance might be quite happy?  Would each one of them consider that the whole £300,000 would only meet some 25 per cent. of the amount required by the surveyors of Cork County alone so that there would be nothing left for them any way?</P>
    <P>Take the position of County Kilkenny where the 1948-49 figure for road grants, £123,000, was in 1949-50 reduced to £73,000.  That is £50,000 lost to Kilkenny.  The grant in Kildare was reduced from £130,888 to £54,560. That is £80,000 from Kildare.  If Deputy Hughes thinks that is justified and that the Minister is entitled to put his hands in and take £300,000 out of the Road Fund&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Hughes has that attitude he can carry on.  I will make him a present of the list and he can find his own little spot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the point I want Deputies to consider and it is to them I turn rather than to the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance is doing his job, grabbing all he can and giving out as little as he can.  That is the job of every Minister for Finance I ever saw and I do not care what Party he belonged to.  He will take all he can; he will take all he is allowed to take and if Deputies representing in this House the different countries are going to stand by and see their roads deteriorating and see the Minister collecting £7,000,000 per annum in taxation off the roads and giving back <Col N="1887" /> £2,250,000 then that is their baby, but I will give them this much of a job: I will trot them into the lobby and let the people they represent here see what is their attitude on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can be very brief on this because most of what I have to say is directed against the speech which Deputy Corry made, to remind him of past history.  First the figures: In 1948-49 the Road Fund contributed £700,000 in respect of the roads and the local authorities contributed £1,325,000. Pre-war the Road Fund was responsible for a third and the local authorities were responsible for two-thirds of whatever charge was put upon the roads.  The division as between the Road Fund and the rates is, roughly, 50-50.  Deputy Childers mentioned that the cost of road making and of road maintenance has gone up, in respect of wages and materials.  In so far as that is so, the local authority view seems to be that the whole increase ought to be shifted on to the Exchequer.  Naturally, there will be another point of view on that.  I want the wage point to be borne in mind.</P>
      <P>In 1947&mdash;in the Finance (No. 2) Act of that year, which Deputy Corry supported &mdash; a special point was made as to a division of the moneys as between main and county roads.  That was a new point and the late Minister for Local Government, speaking on 23rd February, 1949, on a motion on this matter of the road grants, made certain comments which will be found, so far as my quotation is concerned, in column 380.  He revealed what was the attitude of the then Minister for Finance, of whom Deputy Corry was so much a supporter.  The late Minister for Local Government, Deputy Tadhg Murphy, said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The then Minister for Finance Deputy Aiken, very positively expressed his dislike of the idea of making any grants for county roads, and his sanction to road restoration grants for either main or county roads was given on the strict understanding that the revised basis of allocation as between Road Fund and rates would apply for one financial <Col N="1888" /> year only.  A circular, therefore, was issued from the Local Government Department on 28th February, 1946, notifying the grants for road restoration in 1946-47 and intimated that the issue of the grants for that year was a purely temporary measure confined to that financial year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is true that the grants were continued for another year.  They were continued on the same understanding and on the same basis, and it is also to be noted with considerable interest, because it throws a good deal of light on the whole position, that, on the second occasion, the proposal to issue the grant was strenuously resisted by the Minister for Finance to such an extent that the programme was very considerably delayed and the local authorities were in fact faced with additional difficulties because of that delay.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was at that point the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Aiken, in a strong minute which he sent to the Minister for Local Government, expressed astonishment at the proposal to carry on these grants for a second year and he reminded his colleague that the special grant had only been reluctantly agreed to for the current financial year. That was the situation in regard to 1947.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry has devoted a lot of time announcing to the Dáil the amount derived from petrol.  No money that comes from petrol is given to the Road Fund and never has been given to the Road Fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not be long until it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not care what extra money comes from petrol, it goes in the ordinary way to meet general Exchequer charges.  The then Minister for Finance, now Deputy Aiken, when he introduced his Supplementary Budget in 1947 said that the Government had decided to provide additional subsidies for the purpose of flour, bread, tea and sugar by imposing certain taxes.  One of the taxes specially referred to that night was the road <Col N="1889" /> tax, and it was decided to increase the road tax on motor cars so that the tax on an eight horse power car would be £12, on a ten horse power car £15, and on a 12 horse power car £20, and it was decided to appropriate the additional yield for Exchequer purposes. That was on 15th October and Deputy Corry was found on his feet praising that Budget.  The Deputy was found praising a Budget which appropriated the additional yield for Exchequer purposes. This, I hope, will follow him to his county council.  The Budget of 1947 included a special statement by the then Minister for Finance that extra charges were going to be made on motor vehicles and the money was not going to the Road Fund, but would be appropriated to Exchequer purposes.</P>
      <P>Raids were made in the past, and the raids were considerable.  Between 1932 and 1947-48 about £900,000 was taken by Fianna Fáil from the Road Fund. The Road Fund was built out of certain charges, and in those days it was described as appropriating the finances of the Road Fund, but in 1947 a change was made and a new taxation was imposed that drew forth Deputy Corry's verbal commendation on 15th October.  The object was to appropriate the fruits of the new tax on motor vehicles to general Exchequer purposes. I am taking £300,000 this year. If I followed up Deputy Aiken's Supplementary Budget of that year I would take about £600,000, because the increased number of cars, new vehicles of all types, would warrant me, if I applied the standard Deputy Aiken applied in 1947, in taking the whole of these increased charges on motor vehicles into the Exchequer.  That is what Deputy Aiken would have done, with Deputy Corry's backing, as he got it on 15th October.  &ldquo;This Budget will be welcomed by all,&rdquo; he said, including that appropriation, as he now calls it, of moneys that should have been devoted to the Road Fund to Exchequer purposes.  That clearly indicated that the revenue from additional taxation would not be available for roads but would be devoted to meeting various costs.  I am showing a good deal of moderation this year in not taking the whole of that; I am taking only £300,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1890" /> On roads generally, although it is not a subject-matter for this debate, I would like to express a personal point of view.  As between devoting money to such a thing as reclamation of land, drainage of land, or the local authority type of work which is progressing under the legislation we brought in, I would be prepared to give £20 any time towards work of such a productive nature to the single shilling that I would devote to road costs.  With regard to the restoration of the roads, that matter was considered and certain moneys were appropriated.  My information is that more money than what was expected to provide the full cost of the restoration has been spent.  I understand that the restoration programme has, in the main, been completed.</P>
    <P>I travel the roads a good deal.  It has been stated here that money is being devoted away from the main roads to what are called the county roads.  I suppose it is the main roads that I travel on in the main.  I am asked to believe &mdash; the statement was made by Deputy Allen or Deputy Walsh &mdash; that those roads are on the point of crumbling.  I have not seen any signs of it, but I have seen signs of what would seem to be very grave extravagance in regard to roads.  A certain controversy was going on for some months &mdash; it is stopped now &mdash; about a fantastic scheme for the spending of money on the Dublin to Bray road. Luckily, that has been put an end to, because it would have been a frightful waste of public money, or of money collected from the Road Fund and the rates.  One somewhat hysterical correspondent in one of the papers used the phrase that part of the Stillorgan road on the road from Dublin to Bray resembled a desolated bomb site.</P>
    <P>I have yet to see any stretch of road that can be described in that way.  In this city, within the last couple of weeks, there has been the astonishing spectacle of one part of Lower Baggot Street being held up by a lot of containers put down on the middle of the road, with ropes and red lamps as if it were a stretch of the Riviera coast. They were left there diverting and obstructing the traffic, and at about <Col N="1891" /> the end of ten days they were lifted. The result of the whole work, along a stretch of about 400 yards, was that there was one road diversion sign left, and it disappeared two days later.  I think there is more room for economy in regard to road expenditure than there is in regard to anything else.  As far as this £300,000 is concerned, I again want to put myself on record as saying that I am taking less money than what I am entitled to from the statement which Deputy Corry favoured <Col N="1892" /> and made on the 15th October, 1947, as to the new taxes then put on and as to the appropriation of that money to general Exchequer charges and not to roads.  With regard to wages, the one point made was that wages have gone up.  Deputy Corry also supported a proposal that was made at the time of the October Budget in 1947 to have wages pegged. That is one way of reducing expenditure on roads.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann hereby approves of the Garda Síochána Pensions Order, 1950, made on the 25th day of May, 1950, by the Minister for Justice, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, under Section 13 of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925, and laid before Dáil Éireann on the 13th June, 1950.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Order is to grant increases in respect of widows' pensions and children's allowances similar to those granted to other State pensioners by the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1950.  It also provides for a number of miscellaneous amendments in the Garda Síochána Pensions Orders.</P>
      <P>A memorandum which explains fully the effect of the various provisions of the Order has been circulated and I do not think it is necessary for me to go into the details of the Order at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>On the whole, this Order is to be welcomed but it is a pity the Minister did not make provision for some outstanding cases.  I refer to those cases where Guards were injured in the performance of their duties.  I understand there are only four such cases.  The position formerly was that a Guard who retired compulsorily because of injuries received while on duty was treated in the same manner as a Guard who voluntarily retired through illness or who himself asked to be allowed to retire.  It has been pointed out to me that a man who voluntarily retires is generally in a position to maintain himself and his family; he would not otherwise ask for permission to retire on pension.  The man who compulsorily retires has to look out for some employment.  Now, when he produces his discharge certificate, there is a statement on the certificate to the effect that he is medically unfit.  Those who made the representations to me in this matter maintain that this acts as a barrier to his obtaining employment. <Col N="1895" /> As these might be fairly young men with families it is essential that they should supplement their small pension by means of some other employment. Section 41 of this Order deals with these particular people.  Sub-section (2) of that section deals only with widows and orphans:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...The amendments effected by this Order shall not apply in relation to the members of the force who retired from or died while serving in the force before the making of this Order.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think the Minister would be well advised to try to rectify the position because I am told it is causing a lot of anxiety at present and a certain amount of discontent.  It will spoil the whole purpose of the Order if he does not do something to rectify the position. I know the difficulty the Minister is in; he has to collaborate with the Department of Finance.  As I have said, there are only four cases and I think he should try to do something about them.</P>
      <P>Sections 12 and 27 deal with the case of a Guard injured on his way to duty or on his return from duty.  Up to this if a Guard was injured on his way to or from duty, he was considered to be injured while actually on duty.  Under this Order it is no longer proposed to count the time during which a man is either going to or coming from duty as time actually spent on duty.  As far as the Guards are concerned, I think that is a retrograde step.  I do not know the reason why these two Articles have been introduced here.  Generally, the Order does improve the position.  For the future it will be all right.  I have no doubt at all about that.  I understand that it has been well received and the only drawbacks are the particular cases I have mentioned under Article 41 and Articles 12 and 27.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the case made by Deputy Boland. It seems to me a strange thing that a man who is injured in the course of his employment will get only the same compensation as a man who voluntarily retires for some reason such as sickness.  The man who retires as a <Col N="1896" /> result of an injury received in the performance of his duty is further prevented from seeking employment because the certificate which he receives states that he is incapable of undertaking employment.  In regard to the question of a Guard being injured while going on duty, on yesterday's paper there was a report of a statement by a district justice, in reference to a case where a Guard was summoned for being on licensed premises, that a Guard is always on duty and had a right to be there.  I hold the same view myself.  I feel that if a Guard is going through the streets, no matter whether he is regarded as being on or off duty, if he is called upon he will always endeavour to carry out his duties in every way possible.  I would appeal to the Minister seeing that there are only a small number of cases concerned, only four in fact, to reconsider his attitude and to include such men within the scope of the Order.  I have never known a case, where when a Guard was called upon, he was not always available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like if the Minister would consider the case of ex-Guard Clifford, the details of which are well known to every member of the House.  He was retired but it was suggested that he was not entitled to any compensation, even in the form of a small pension.  I should like to know if the Minister has had that case under review recently in connection with this present development.</P>

      <P>All the House has to do with an Order introduced in this form is either to approve or reject it. Clearly the Order has met with the substantial approval of the Garda Síochána.  At least, I am quite sure that if it did not meet with their approval, many Deputies in this House would have been consulted with regard to it.  I agree with the views expressed by Deputy Boland and Deputy McGrath in regard to the case of a Guard who is injured while proceeding to or coming from his station. If a Guard observed any breach of the law, either when going to or coming from his station, that Guard would be clearly bound to deal with the matter on the spot.  It may be that when the <Col N="1897" /> Minister comes to explain this matter he may be able to allay the apprehensions that are felt in regard to it.  Certainly the rules relating to workmen's compensation in the case of an ordinary workman should not be applicable in the case of a Guard.  I think a general rule might be laid down that a Guard is deemed always to be on duty except when actually in his own home or on holidays.  With these two exceptions, a Guard should be considered as being on duty all the time.  The Minister is to be congratulated on the improvements he has made.  Perhaps this particular point may not be as serious as it appears and the Minister may be able, as I say, to allay our fears in regard to it.  I think the House can rest assured that if an examination of this Order does bring to light cases of hardship, the Minister will be the very first to introduce whatever amendments are necessary to put these matters right.</P>

      <P>The Minister in introducing this Order said that the explanatory memorandum circulated by him was sufficient to disclose the nature of the changes brought about by the Order without calling for any elaborate explanations from him.  I made an attempt this morning to go through the mass of legislation by Order which governs the payment of pensions to Gardaí and to widows and orphans.  I find that the Orders go back as far as 1922 embracing I think five different Orders, and I think it about time that the Minister should codify these Orders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, even though the ordinary Guard receives a certain amount of legal training, no Guard of average intelligence would be able to interpret these Orders properly and intelligently.  Deputy Boland has dwelt on the hardships which will be created on four or five men by reason of the Minister not making the Order restrospective to cover them and I think that the Minister could hardly contest the case made by Deputy Boland with any fair argument.  Firstly, he has gone <Col N="1898" /> back over a whole period of years to modify these Orders in so far as they affect widows and orphans.  I know that in the Minister's own Department and in the Department of Finance very serious objection is taken to making retrospective provision for pensions improvement, but as has been pointed out, only four men are affected.  I cannot say whether they have any wives or children but these men will not benefit in any way by the increases made in the case of widows and orphans.  I should say that if provision were made for these men the cost to the State would be comparatively trifling.  If the men were deceased at this stage, their widows and orphans, if thy had any, would benefit by the increase but because the men are fortunate to be alive to-day, they are unfortunate enough not to come under these Orders.  The case has been very adequately put already by a number of Deputies and I think the Minister should try to meet it.  I know the alternative to approving of the Order now is to withdraw it and to reintroduce it to cover these cases but since there is such a mass of Orders covering the pensions of Gardaí, I think another little one would not add appreciably to the volume.</P>

      <P>I want the Minister to reply as fully as possible to the debate. The question of Guards going to and coming from duty is a big one and I consider that the deletion of the provision which covered Guards heretofore is completely unjustified.  The Minister is probably taking a line on the Workmen's Compensation Act.  There has been a lot of legislation in regard to the Workmen's Compensation Act and it is even yet fairly difficult to draw the line as to when a man begins work and when he leaves off.  Generally speaking, <Col N="1899" /> I think the law is that once a man comes under the supervision of his employer's orders, directly or indirectly, he has commenced work.  Surely a Guard even on his way to the Garda station to report for duty must come under the purview of orders?  He is bound either in duty or at least in conscience to apprehend any criminal he may meet or to put down any illegal action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>I had three questions on the Order Paper yesterday, all dealing with the same matter &mdash; the question of the appointment of a certain clerk of works by the Limerick County Council, which appointment &mdash; or reappointment, I submit&mdash;the Minister refused to sanction.  I am raising this question because I consider that the Minister has been guilty of injustice to the person whose appointment he refused to sanction and that he has been guilty as well of a piece of political jobbery in the way in which he <Col N="1901" /> handled this matter and in the appointment he has succeeded in having made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Early this year the Limerick County Council advertised for applications for appointments as clerks of works to supervise certain housing schemes.  An individual named Richard Sheehy, who formerly carried out these duties for the Limerick County Council, applied for the position.  His application was successful and he was notified by the housing engineer of the Limerick County Council in due course that he was appointed and he was directed to take up duty.  According to the Minister's reply his appointment was notified to the Department of Local Government on the 1st April, 1950. According to the information which I have, Richard Sheehy was acting as clerk of works with the Abbeyfeale housing scheme for 11 weeks before he was notified by letter dated the 20th May from the office of the housing engineer to the Limerick County Council that &ldquo;the Minister for Local Government had refused to sanction your appointment to the above post.  Accordingly I give you a week's notice as from the 20th May to terminate your temporary appointment. Please return all documents you have received in connection with this scheme on Saturday, 27th instant.&rdquo;  It amazes me that, in the first place, it took the Minister from the 1st April to the 12th May to make up his mind about this matter.  It would be interesting if we could discover what went on behind the scenes in the meantime during that protracted period for dealing with what was regarded as a rather urgent appointment. The housing scheme had started.  It was necessary to have some supervision and to have the Minister's decision in regard to the appointment of the Limerick County Council sent forward.  I was told in reply to Question No. 18 that seven persons applied for the appointment to the post and that two subsequently withdrew their applications; that the examination of the applications and qualifications of the remaining candidates showed that the person proposed for appointment had not applied for the post in the proper form and was not, in any event, the best qualified for it.  That is very strange.  Richard Sheehy was appointed <Col N="1902" /> clerk of works by the Limerick County Council when housing activities by way of the building of labourers' cottages started in Limerick in 1934. He continued as a clerk of works up to 1942 &mdash; until activities in the building of labourers' cottages ceased and there was no more work for him.  Then his services were terminated.  That was eight years' apparently satisfactory service as clerk of works.  As far as I know, and as far as he knows, there was no unsatisfactory comment either by his direct employers or by the officials of the Department of Local Government in regard to the supervisory work that he did.  Up to the year 1926, he had acted as supervising ganger for the Limerick County Council.  In the year 1926 these posts were abolished and, accordingly, Mr. Sheehy, with several others who were in employment of the same character, lost his appointment.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that he refused sanction first of all because the application was on the wrong form.  I regard that answer as contemptible subterfuge. The form was regarded as satisfactory by the Limerick County Council, the housing engineer and the county manager, I presume, who made the appointment.  If the Minister is going to base refusal of sanction on a subterfuge of that kind, I make him a present of it.  It then transpired, the Minister said, that he was not the best qualified person for the appointment. We can differ on that also, as I will point out to the Minister later on.</P>
    <P>In addition to the experience he had gained during the eight years, Mr. Sheehy acted as clerk of works to the Limerick County Council supervising the building of labourers' cottages.  He had excellent Old I.R.A. service.  He belonged to a family that had given outstanding service in West Limerick to the cause of Irish independence.  I do not know whether that would have any particular appeal to the Minister or not.  I presume it would not.</P>
    <P>The next thing to which I want to draw attention in connection with this juggling is the method by which his successor was appointed.  In reply to Question No. 19 yesterday, the Minister told me that the council's proposal was for the appointment of Patrick Mann, <Col N="1903" /> that his appointment was notified to the Department on 6th June and was sanctioned by 13th June&mdash;in one week. That is an amazing change from the attitude of the Minister in regard to the other case.  It took him seven or eight weeks to make up his mind before he notified the county council of the refusal to sanction Mr. Sheehy. I do not know much about the man who was to succeed Mr. Sheehy, whose appointment the Minister refused to sanction, but I understand that when cottages were being built by the county council in 1934 to 1942, this man was a contractor and not a very satisfactory one, so much so that on one occasion he was compelled to demolish a structure that he built and to rebuild it to the satisfaction of the clerk of works. In spite of that, the Minister says that he has experience of building works over a number of years &mdash; yes, but could the Minister say what kind of building works?&mdash;and that he has a thorough knowledge of all branches of the building trade.</P>
    <P>Would I be right in suggesting that the sole reason why Mr. Sheehy was refused sanction and the other gentleman was appointed was because Mr. Mann happens to be a political pal of the Minister's whom he wanted to assist?  Would I be right in suggesting that this appointment of Mr. Mann was not made by the Limerick County Council but was made at the direction of the Minister, by the direct intervention of the Minister?  I understood that the Minister was standing for restoration, as he calls it, of the powers that were filched from the local authorities under the County Management Act.  If that is so, how does the Minister justify an appointment that I consider was made because of the Minister's direct intervention and direct instruction to the officials of the Limerick County Council who are responsible for submitting this appointment?  Why was not this gentleman appointed in the first instance?  Why was not his name submitted for the appointment in the first instance by the Limerick County Council if his qualifications were, as the Minister tells me in his reply, so outstanding? How is it that Mr. Sheehy <Col N="1904" /> was selected in preference to him?  I could gather that he was an applicant when the applications were first considered by the housing engineer and when he made his recommendation to the county manager.</P>
    <P>I submit that this case is an outstanding case of jugglery on the part of the Minister, that he has simply perpetrated a job for a political pal and that he has been guilty of an injustice to a man who gave satisfactory and good service for eight years to the Limerick County Council as clerk of works.</P>
    <P>There is a suggestion that Mr. Sheehy was refused sanction because he happens to be a small farmer. I hope that we have not reached the time when a man who is qualified for a position will be refused it on grounds of that nature.  There is not a Clann na Talmhan Deputy in the House but I hope that the farmers' representatives who sit behind the Minister will not stand for an injustice of that kind.  The man whom I speak of and who has been treated unjustly, in my opinion, by the Minister for Local Government, happens to be a small farmer all right but that should not debar him from an appointment if he is considered otherwise satisfactory.  I think this whole thing is disgraceful.</P>
    <P>If there was one Minister on those benches from whom I would not expect a decision of this unjust nature, it was the Minister for Local Government, but I have to change my opinion about him now.  I did not think he would be guilty of any injustice of this kind to a fellow county man.  I only regret that I have to raise this matter and to have, so to speak, to put the Minister on the mat in regard to what I consider a grave injustice committed by the Minister in regard to this appointment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. J.J. Collins Mr. J.J. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>My interest in intervening in this matter is to protest against the treatment that has been meted out to Mr. Sheehy.  He was one of the best Old I.R.A. men that we had in West Limerick.  A matter that has not been brought to the Minister's notice is that when Mr. Mann, who has replaced Mr. Sheehy, was the contractor building cottages in West Limerick, Mr. Sheehy happened to be <Col N="1905" /> clerk of works and, as Deputy Ó Briain has mentioned, he had to get Mr. Mann to knock a structure on two occasions because he was not building it to the required specifications.  It looks very peculiar now that a man who was blacklisted by the Limerick County Board of Health as a contractor should now be appointed by the same body as clerk of works over a housing scheme.</P>
      <P>Apart altogether from Mr. Mann's qualifications as stated in the reply yesterday to Deputy Ó Briain, the one thing I do not like about the whole thing is that in a small place like Abbeyfeale we have three clerks of works.  There is a sewerage scheme in progress with a qualified engineer in charge.  There is a vocational school being built under another clerk of works and we have a third clerk of works in the person of Mr. Mann.  To my mind, a qualified engineer on the job could supervise the three schemes.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the rate of wages being paid to the clerk of works, £1,000 could be saved in one year by leaving the work to one man and we could have an additional house built in Abbeyfeale for the poor, instead of dishing out money to people not qualified to supervise the work.  The Minister will have seen recently in the Press in Limerick that ratepayers' committees and towns' improvement committees, not alone in Abbeyfeale but in Newcastlewest and elsewhere, protested against this waste of public money in having three men employed in one small place.</P>
      <P>As I said, my sole reason for speaking was to protest against the treatment of Mr. Sheehy.  I do not want to be very critical, but I will always take my stand behind an Old I.R.A. man. There is at the moment operating a bureau of military history and when they come to West Limerick, they will find in the records evidence of Mr. Sheehy's service during the Black and Tan period.  It would be very interesting if they inquired of the brigade intelligence officer to find out what part this gentleman, Mr. Mann, played during the fight for Irish freedom.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ó Briain opened up on a very healthy and happy note in accusing <Col N="1906" /> the Minister of political jobbery and he finished by stating that it was not the county council or the consulting engineer who appointed the second appointee, but the Minister.  That latter statement is not true.  With regard to the first statement about political jobbery &mdash; well there may be some tinge of truth in it, but we shall have to get the dates, because the date might more appropriately be taken as 1934 rather than 1950.  Mr. Sheehy did act for the county council in relation to the building of some cottages at that time and the Minister refused to sanction his appointment.  I have the file before me and I find that, due to the persistence of Deputy Ó Briain, the Minister was eventually persuaded to sanction his appointment.  I have reports on the files of his unsatisfactory work, and that he should never have been appointed, as he was not qualified. He could not be expected to be qualified to supervise building construction as he had not got the training. Apart from being a farmer, he was a road ganger.</P>
      <P>I am not challenging the man's qualities, characteristics or national service.  I am talking of the appointment of a clerk of works to supervise work being carried out for the local authority, and, if you have not got a man who is competent, he is a menace rather than a help because, if a builder wants to get away with defective work or inferior materials, and there is somebody over him who is not competent to supervise the work, it is an incentive to him to &ldquo;do down&rdquo; the public authority.  I speak with some knowledge of this matter, because I have been a clerk of works myself.  Mr. Sheehy had no training whatever &mdash; he is a farmer and has been a road ganger. The reports are on the file and, from these reports of inspectors, it is clear that he and two others were incompetent and helpless in the job they were doing.</P>

      <P>There is a reference by Mr. Ryan to the effect that he knew him to be a good man as a ganger. That is the only reference by Mr. Ryan, and that did not influence the then Minister, who said he could not appoint him as he had not the qualifications, but who, due to the persistence of Deputy Ó Briain and others, was persuaded to agree to his appointment, although he was unsuited for the position.  The Deputy now accuses the Minister of political jobbery and of all kinds of corruption.  I would be absolutely unentitled to appoint this man, who had ignored the terms of the advertisement. Deputy Ó Briain says it is a subterfuge, but this man did not recognise the terms of the advertisement. He did not write to the public authority, but to the consulting engineer who appointed him previously. He sent no credentials, qualifications or testimonials.  He could not do so, because he had none, except the fact that he had worked for Mr. Sheehan previously.</P>

      <P>Mr. Sheehan appointed him on the previous occasion.  He recommended him on this occasion to the county council and the county council sent the recommendation up here.  I did not sanction it I felt that in the case of a man working at his farm since 1942, if he had any qualifications in regard to building he had good scope to display it since that date, but he has been farming all that time.  The man who has been appointed has been a carpenter and builder all his life, as were his father and all belonging to him.  I worked side by side with this man.</P>

      <P>A political pal &mdash; call him what you like.  I worked as a carpenter with that man.  His father and his family made their living at that trade and he is perfectly competent for this job.  I did not appoint him nor did I recommend him.  He was recommended on the second occasion by Mr. Sheehan.  I would have taken any of the other men recommended by Mr. Sheehan, but two of them withdrew their applications.  Another man had building experience and another sent no testimonials, like Mr. Sheehy.  A carpenter has been appointed who understands and can interpret specifications and can carry out the job for which he has been appointed.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the appointment of a man without qualifications to a job of this kind is a waste of money, and it would be better to appoint no clerk of works at all than to appoint a man who is unable to supervise the work being done by a builder.  It would be much better to trust the builder to do the job than to appoint a man who has no qualifications for it.  I am perfectly satisfied with what I have done.  Mr. Sheehy had no right to be appointed on the first occasion or the second occasion and I believe a better man has been appointed to the job.</P>
