      <P>On a matter of personal explanation.  On my Estimate it appears a statement was made by Deputy MacEntee which I did not hear and which was reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In Dublin, he said, they had an individual driving while drunk, who had lost his licence in Glasgow, but nothing had been done about it.  One must ask the reason why.  Was it because there seemed to be some connection between those gentlemen and the Minister who placed a contract with them?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The inference was that I did something or that I had a contract with somebody. I wish to say that I never stopped nor did any of my predecessors, so far as I know, ever stop prosecutions or direct the Garda to stay prosecutions and I have no contract with any person and know nothing about the matter whatever.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pleased last night to hear the Tánaiste pay a well deserved tribute to the members of the committee and the staff of the National Health Insurance Society.  I think the tribute was well deserved and that it was fitting and proper that it should be paid at this particular time.  Few organisations set up in this country have been more successful than the National Health Insurance Society and, as I say, that tribute was well deserved because, out of chaos, a splendid organisation was built up with a reserve of something in the region of £7,000,000. When the society took over, the position was very bad.  Some of the former societies were bankrupt or semi-bankrupt. Many of our people were not educated to the value of national health insurance.  It was a difficult matter and they have made a good job of it and they deserve any tribute the Minister can pay to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 700,000 members of the organisation and I would like the Minister to make clear why the stamps were increased, without additional benefit being paid.  I cannot see any <Col N="1667" /> reason for that, as the society was in a good financial position and capable of meeting any extra payments.  I hope that the Minister, when he takes over completely on the 1st August, will abolish immediately, once and for all, disablement benefit.  The Minister understands full well that if a man is ill for 26 weeks his financial position is not better&mdash;it is worse&mdash;and I sincerely hope that the Minister will see to it that we will hear no more of disablement benefit, that the rate of sickness benefit will continue during the member's illness.  That would be an advance, and we have been advancing steadily since 1934. Additional benefits&mdash;dental, optical, surgical&mdash;are paid to-day, and any member of the society can go in alongside his wealthy neighbour, knowing that he has no longer the taint of pauperism about the treatment he gets, since his society will be paying for him a reasonable sum to meet the hospital demands.  He is as good as his neighbour and all that helps towards a speedy recovery of those unfortunates who have to go into hospital.  One of the best things that a man can feel is that he is being paid for there.  His one concern, if he is married or has dependents, is that his wife and family are not getting as much as will keep body and soul together. The Minister may say that he proposes to correct all this in the new Bill.  However, a long time will elapse and much water will flow under bridges before that.  Many people will become ill&mdash;I am not praying for an epidemic&mdash;and will be confined to hospital or to their homes.  The Minister should do something of a temporary nature until the proposed Bill becomes law, as everybody admits that the cost of living makes it well-nigh impossible for people to exist under the maximum benefit to which they are entitled to-day.</P>
    <P>The social welfare officers are a very fine body of men and have a difficult task to do in dealing with insurance and pensions combined.  I appeal to the Minister to see that their areas are not overlapping, so that we will not have an officer travelling through another officer's area, with consequent <Col N="1668" /> hardship on himself when he has finished a hard day's work and has to return a long journey.  Again, the expense is high and adds to the amount of the National Health Vote. You find a good deal of that and a little more time should be given to it. Again, the dispensary districts are unsuitable. They are very old, and I do not know why half of them are so arranged.  I hope the officials of the Department will not be guided by them at all.  It would be better to take the townlands.  The rural electoral areas are also bad, as you have one electoral area jutting perhaps two or three miles into another.  That does not make for good administration and the officers are not capable of coping with all the work to be done.</P>
    <P>We have not enough social welfare officers.  They are never able to do a survey, as their time is taken up with the investigation of national health reports and of old-age pension claims. As a result, we have a lot of fly boys getting under the wire&mdash;I do not say there is an awful lot, but some do get under the wire&mdash;and they shirk their responsibility towards their employees and towards the State.  I do not think they should be let away with it.  They are the exceptions, the minority; but if we had a few extra officers here and there, they would see to it that that position would not continue.  I suggest to the Minister that that be done.</P>
    <P>I have another suggestion&mdash;and I think the Minister can carry out this one by regulation&mdash;regarding cases where a person becomes ill and his cards were not stamped at the time by the employer through no fault of the member.  The Minister will understand that it is often hard for a member to report his employer; he may be under some debt of gratitude to him or may find it otherwise difficult.  If it is not through deliberate fault, such as withholding the card deliberately, that person should not be deprived of benefit for a certain period.  When the card is stamped, the card should immediately qualify him, instead of the penalty we have at the present time.  I would ask the Minister to amend that by regulation when he takes over the society on the 1st <Col N="1669" /> August.  The Minister and the House can readily understand that there are great hardships under that rule.  I know the remedy is there with the insured person, but unfortunately he cannot usually take advantage of it, so I hope the Minister will look into the matter and remedy it, if at all possible.</P>
    <P>We had a long tirade last night from Deputy Dunne.  It is a pity he took such an attitude in a debate of this kind.  Deputies should not be looking through their political glasses when they want to help the poorer sections of the community.  I think their contributions should be such as would be helpful and constructive rather than that they should try to score off somebody else.  Deputy Dunne accused Fianna Fáil of not doing anything for the old age pensioners.  That is farther from the truth than many a statement I have heard for a long time.</P>
    <P>In 1932 the rate of pension was 9/- per week.  Fianna Fáil restored the shilling, and it must be remembered that the value of a shilling then compares very favourably with the recent 2/6 increase.  Again, the 1924 Act debarred any person who three years before the passing of the Act or any time after transferred either property or income, and that property or income was taken into consideration under Section 7 of the Act even though it had been transferred for the most <i>bona fide</i> motives, such as the marriage of a son, infirmity or old age. Fianna Fáil abolished that penal section. Where there was a transfer of property they made it possible to have the pension paid.  The idea of transfer was a good one, and it did provide an incentive to our young people to get married.  I know many people concerned, and I know that comparisons are sometimes made, but I think it is always a good thing to implement a section of an Act if that section does good work.  There may be unfair discrimination here and there.  Every Act cannot be perfect.</P>
    <P>In 1932 the age limit for applicants under the Blind Persons Act was 50: Fianna Fáil reduced that to 30.  It is true that the schedules governing the <Col N="1670" /> means test were not altered.  They had been altered in 1924, and I would appeal to the Minister to restore the schedules governing the means test prior to the 1924 Act.  His officers could be given certain discretion in the case of small farmers with large families.  I think large families should always be taken into account in assessing an applicant's means.  Prior to the 1924 Act a person in receipt of £26 5s. 0d. was entitled to the maximum pension.  After the passing of that Act a person in receipt of £15 12s. 6d. was automatically debarred from the maximum pension, and so on up along the scale.  It is quite true to say that the Minister altered the means test from £39 to £52, and as a result of that there are pensions of 7/6 and 5/- now.  The greatest hardship always falls upon the section with the smallest income. That is why I appeal to the Minister to restore the £26 5s. if at all possible. If that were done a number of our people would qualify for the maximum pension.  That would be a great help to them.</P>
    <P>I have heard a lot of tripe talked here and there about the abolition of the means test.  People forget that the abolition of the means test would cost something in the region of £7,000,000 or £8,000,000 per year more. I fail to see why a person with plenty of money in the bank and a good income should become a burden on the unfortunate taxpayers.  I fail to see why we should help in any way to make the wealthy people wealthier.  I do not think that is a good principle, and I hardly think the means test will be abolished in our time.</P>
    <P>There are many people in receipt of disablement benefit who could be put into useful employment.  Surely a person with one leg or one arm is not entirely incapacitated from doing useful work.  I think the Minister should take some steps to make these people an asset to the State.  I think most of them would be very glad to be provided with some means of earning their own livelihood.  I am not now referring to those who are entitled to workmen's compensation.  I am speaking of those people who had no contract <Col N="1671" /> of service, and who had to fall back on national health insurance.  I do not know of any other funds under which they can benefit.  I think an effort should be made to train those people in some useful occupation.  I am sure they would be more than anxious themselves to take up some employment. The older people could be taught something fitted to their physical capabilities.  In that way they would cease to be a burden on the State, and would undoubtedly become an asset to it.</P>
    <P>With regard to national health insurance, cases sometimes arise where men have been in insurable employment for 20 or 30 years and for some reason or other they go out of that employment.  After the lapse of a year they cease to be insured persons, and they thereby forfeit their rights to benefits.  I think the period of grace should be extended.  Sometimes grave hardships are caused because the period is so short.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The period is now a year and a half, and during that period any person has the right to become a voluntary contributor, and thereby preserve the continuity of his insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble is that many of our people fail to grasp the advantage of becoming voluntary contributors, and many of them are afraid that they will not be able to pay the contributions.  The contributions are fairly heavy&mdash;45 contributions of 1/7. In certain cases that is a heavy draw on their funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to draw the attention of the Minister to the position of tubercular patients who are single and who are sent to different sanatoria.  I think an exception should be made in their cases and that the benefits should be paid to them weekly to enable them to purchase the little extra comforts they desire.  We know that, as regards this disease, the mind, above all, must be satisfied, and that anything that we can do to make the patient feel happy should be done.  I <Col N="1672" /> think that if my suggestion were adopted, it would contribute towards the more speedy recovery of patients. Under the system in operation, they can draw the money on account; but I think they would feel greater satisfaction and perhaps would be able to get much greater value if they had the spending of the money themselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne said last night that Fianna Fáil had done nothing for insured people.  That, of course, is not correct.  The Tánaiste knows full well what has been done.  Disablement benefit was increased by 100 per cent. during the period Fianna Fáil were in office, and sickness benefits were increased by 50 per cent.  All the additional benefits provided were, so to speak, the baby of Fianna Fáil. Therefore, it is ridiculous for Deputies to get up here and say things which are not correct.  If, instead of making such statements, they would examine the position and ascertain what had been done, they would, I think, be doing much more good for the sick people than in trying to make political capital out of these matters.</P>
    <P>Reference was made last night to the position as regards workmen's compensation.  Cases of hardship have arisen as regards people coming back from England in receipt of workmen's compensation.  There seems to be some flaw in the law somewhere, because those people are becoming a burden on this State at a time when they should be getting benefit from their employers in Britain.  I would ask the Minister to have that position examined and see what can be done.</P>
    <P>I do not know exactly what the Minister's functions are in the matter of home assistance.  The amount that is being paid to poor people is altogether too low.  It is ridiculous to expect an unfortunate creature to exist on 8/- a week.  That is happening in many parts of the country, and it is the duty of Deputies to inform the House as to what the position in regard to those people is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out to the Deputy that the Public Assistance Act of 1939 prohibits any Minister from interfering with the administration of <Col N="1673" /> home assistance in any respect?  I have no function in the matter.  If I had any power in this matter, I would like to use it as the Deputy has suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, the people in receipt of home assistance are the poorest of the poor.  They seldom come under notice except to those who are engaged on charitable work such as the members of the St. Vincent de Paul Society.  At the moment I am not able to suggest what exactly should be done.  It appears to be a very difficult matter.  Many of those poor people are widows and spinsters.  I would ask the Minister to keep this question of home assistance under observation.  The recipients are a most defenceless class.  I know that occasionally they tremble with fear when the home assistance officer arrives.  All the home assistance officers are not bullies, but some of them are.  I think they should realise their duties towards this poor defenceless class in the community.  I would say that, at some future date, this class of people should be included in the provision that is made for people under this Estimate.  In fact, I would say myself that home assistance should be abolished.  There is a taint about it that has come down to us from the famine days.  The amounts that are paid are of very little use.  They are hardly sufficient to keep the life in the recipients.  If it were not for the help they receive from charitable organisations, many of them would have died years ago from starvation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find that the position with regard to dental benefits is that many of those who are qualified in every respect to receive benefits are themselves not in a position to pay the additional amount which is required from them.  That is one of the big troubles I see.  Now that the funds of the society are in such a healthy state, I would suggest to the Minister that he should waive the payment of contributions, particularly in the case of members who are not in a position to make a contribution themselves.  In fact, I think the members' contribution in regard to those dental benefits should be abolished completely.  It is <Col N="1674" /> important that the provision with regard to dental benefits should be availed of on the widest possible scale, because doctors inform me that rheumatism, arthritis and gastric troubles from which many of those insured persons suffer are due to the want of proper mastication and to the fact that they have decayed teeth.  The fact is that members of the society will hesitate about availing of these dental benefits either because they have not the money to make the contribution required from them or, if they have, because the payment would mean a great hardship on them.  The reason I make that suggestion to the Minister is that I think in the long run it would result in a saving of money, because, if we have a healthier membership, the drain on the funds will be less costly to the State and, in any event, a healthier people means a lot to the nation.  I would ask the Minister to consider the matter in the light that perhaps a father might be saved to his family or a brother to an invalid sister. Rheumatism, gastritis and kindred diseases, which are alleged to be due to lack of dental treatment, are altogether too prevalent in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Two years ago I drew the Minister's attention to the delay in dealing with cases in Cork Employment Exchange and to the fact that a number of cases were sent up to be dealt with in Dublin, whereas I thought the local manager should have authority to deal with such cases.  The Minister expressed great sympathy with the plea which I then made, and he said that it very often happens that the final decision in such cases is made by a person of lower rank than the official who deals with the correspondence at the head office.  The same practice is still continuing.  For instance, a person may sign on in the morning.  Later on in the day, after signing, he secures employment, but he does not report in time.  His claim is held up for several weeks and is apparently sent up to Dublin to be dealt with, and eventually he is paid except for the time he has been working. It is all very well when these people can afford to wait, but I think <Col N="1675" /> that the local manager should have some authority to deal with cases like that.  It seems ridiculous that he has not that power, having regard to the amount of correspondence that is involved in sending the case to Dublin.</P>
      <P>Some months ago I put down a question to the Minister regarding the hardships suffered by dockers in Cork during a dockers' strike, in which they were not directly involved.  He told me that he was going to have a conference between the unions to see what could be done about it.  I should like the Minister to tell me if anything has been done because the position in Cork was that a man had his pay held up if he was a docker, even though he never worked with the particular company involved in the strike.  I think that is wrong when he had nothing to do with the strike.  For instance, men who were usually employed in discharging grain from vessels had never any connection with the general cargo companies.  I think the Minister felt there was some hardship inflicted on these men, and I should like to know if he has called the conference between the unions which he promised.</P>
      <P>I should like also to draw the Minister's attention to the delay in investigating claims under the two headings of old age pensions and widows' and orphans' pensions.  There seems to be a great delay, especially in cases where an investigation is carried out by the Minister's Department when an application is made to the Department of Defence for a special allowance.  There is a means test for that special allowance, and the application is referred to the Minister's Department for investigation.  It is quite a common thing to have these special allowance cases held up for three or four months when they are referred to the Minister's Department.  I put down a question to the Minister for Defence about six months ago, and I mentioned certain cases.  It was evident, from the time the application had been referred to the Department for Social Welfare and the time it was returned, that the biggest delay occurred in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1676" /> Deputy Davern spoke about home assistance, and the Minister stated that he had no jurisdiction.  He certainly had jurisdiction a couple of years ago when he took away the money that was being given to boards of assistance for food vouchers.  That involved an additional expense to the local ratepayers.  I had one particular case where an investigation was carried out by a home assistance officer of an application by an old age pensioner who was receiving the full 17/6 per week old age pension.  He wanted spectacles, and he applied to the home assistance authorities.  They sent the home assistance officer to investigate his means, and the applicant was told that because some of his sons were in good employment they would not provide him with the spectacles. Somebody was at fault there, for if the man had means, he was not entitled to the full old age pension Surely if he was eligible to receive the full old age pension he was entitled to get spectacles from the home assistance authorities.  The investigation in cases like that is carried too far.  My experience is that anyone who qualifies for an old age pension is put to a sufficiently severe test without having to undergo another test afterwards.</P>
    <P>In regard to appeals I had a case of a widow's pension appeal which was going on for two years.  It seems ridiculous that a case should be held up for over two years for investigation by anybody.  I agree that the referee probed every source possible in order to try to award this widow a pension but apparently there was one particular period of delay for which nobody could account.  The application was turned down after about two and a half years. She was kept dangling and waiting in the hope all the time that she might get a pension but, as I say, after two and a half years she was eventually turned down.  She probably was not entitled to it as there was some question over the number of stamps for a certain year which disqualified her.  My plea is that the investigation of claims should be carried out as speedily as possible.  Generally speaking, there is not a very long span of life left for <Col N="1677" /> widows and old age pensioners.  They do not know when they are going to the next world but I doubt if the next world would be of any great benefit to them if their claims there are not dealt with more speedily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief. May I point out that I find that the means test, although the ceiling has been raised from £39 to £52, is a great hardship on old age pensioners for in a number of cases in my opinion very deserving people are deprived of a pension?  While the Minister raised the ceiling to £52 it was still an increase of only 33 per cent. and things have gone up by a good deal more than that.  At every other old age pensions meeting that I go to I find a number of borderline cases where the inspector will come along and make up the £52 in a most exacting manner.  I have nothing to say against the inspector because he is only doing his duty, but the fact remains that the investigation is so through and exacting that very deserving cases, in our opinion, are deprived of the old age pension.  I would like the Minister to consider raising the ceiling to at least 70 per cent. above the £39 because that would be only in keeping&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Every old age pensions committee is up against this matter.  Whether we like it or not we find that we are depriving some of these old people of what they are entitled to.  I have come across cases in County Dublin where people have actually been given the old age pension for six months by the committee and by the Department of Social Welfare and then some friends of theirs&mdash;I <Col N="1678" /> suppose you could call them good friends&mdash;come along and report that a married daughter of the old age pensioner has come from America, England or Dublin and is giving him money and the pension is cut off or reduced.  I am sure that the Minister never meant that to happen but that is the position and it is not as it should be.  I am not asking the State to give money away for nothing; I am asking the State to be reasonable towards these unfortunate people who in most cases live alone.  May I again refer to the over-throughness of the inspector in trying to find out if the hen is laying and how much the garden is producing? In matters of that kind there should be a spirit of give and take because surely the amount of money they are getting is not going to keep old age pensioners in luxury and comfort. The big delay in the investigation of cases in certain areas is also a matter for comment and I would like if that could be speeded up.</P>
      <P>Another point is the investigation of people who have applied for the blind pension.  In many cases in County Dublin especially they will not get a certificate unless they are examined by a doctor in the Eye and Ear Hospital. I wonder if it would be possible for the Minister to appoint a doctor who would once every six months, say, investigate such cases in their homes? I know that it is hard for some of these people to get into the Eye and Ear Hospital and I had on a number of occasions myself to supply transport.  I am not objecting to it; I would do it at any time, but there are a number of people who cannot get transport at all.  If more power could be given to the medical officer to give such a certificate it would eliminate a good deal of the difficulties of these unfortunate blind people.</P>

      <P>I have also received complaints from time to time of the slowness in paying out national health insurance benefits and I had on occasion to take this matter up with the National Health Insurance Society.  If a man is married with a family and needs money to purchase the ordinary essentials it is too bad if he has to wait two, three, and often four and five weeks.  Something should be done to improve that because over the years I have received a number of complaints.  I really do not know what is wrong as I have been told that the doctor's certificate has been sent on.  Every poor man will not get credit for a week, a fortnight or three weeks when he is ill.  Some people, especially those with a big family, expect to be paid at the end of the week.  A man who receives a very small salary is not in a position to have money saved.  The time when a man is sick and no money is coming in is the time when he should get paid and he should not have to wait for three weeks until he has gone back to work and then get it all together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have long experience of handling old age pension cases. Deputy Davern, my half-brother in name, might agree with me in this: I find that a considerable amount of delay takes place in the handling of old age pension cases between the committee and the deciding officer at headquarters because the pension officer has no personal contact and refuses in many cases to attend the meetings of the old age pensions committee.  The deciding officers do their work in a real red-tape fashion, in a callous fashion&mdash;I say that without regard to the Government of to-day or the Government of yesterday, and perhaps the Government of <Col N="1681" /> to-morrow&mdash;without any consideration for the feelings and requirements of the poor people who are entitled to old age pensions.</P>
      <P>The Minister may hold the view, as his predecessor in some cases held the view, that members of pension committees are more than generous when they come to consider applications submitted to them.  The pension officer in all cases, in my long experience, takes the opposite view, and, if the pension officer could be persuaded, or still better, instructed, because some of them are not susceptible to any kind of persuasion, to attend the meetings of the old age pension committee to listen to the information which could be given to them&mdash;they are generally not locals and are not in touch with the people, living as they do far away from the people, and the poor people especially, and mixing with a different class of people&mdash;by the members who know more than anybody else about the domestic circumstances of the claimants, many of the disputes which have arisen, due to the absence of the officer, could be settled there and then and a good deal of unnecessary delay cut out.  I hope Deputy Davern will not object to that suggestion.</P>

      <P>I have come across such cases and have sent them to the Minister.  I do not like bothering the Minister of any Department with matters of general administration, and I write in in the ordinary way, but, because of the refusal in some cases of pension officers to attend, when they could attend, pension committee meetings, I have had to report cases of delay to the Minister, and that is why I make this suggestion for the Minister's consideration.  If it could be done without any inconvenience to the administration or the other work the pension officer has to discharge, I should be very glad if the Minister would consider it.  If he cannot see his way to issue instructions to pension officers to attend these meetings, he should use his influence to persuade them to do so when they have no other important work to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a member of a pensions committee, and I can recollect a few occasions on which the suggestion was made that the pension officer should attend the next meeting. It is not always possible for me to attend and it may have happened that the officer in question did attend, but whether he is bound or not to attend at the request of the committee, Deputy Davin's suggestion is a good one and much of the delay would be obviated if it were adopted.  When the pension officer goes to a claimant's house, he goes armed with certain powers which are governed by certain regulations.  He makes inquiries of the person concerned as to his financial position&mdash;the number of cattle he has, the number of acres of land he has, the value of his crop last year, and so on.  In the case of the average old-age pension claimant, the very fact of an official putting questions to him more or less knocks him off balance and he is inclined to answer questions with the intention of being truthful, but often to give replies against himself. That, in itself, is a reason why the suggestion put forward by Deputy Davin is a good suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not alone should the official appear before the committee, but the particular claimant involved should also appear, provided it was humanly possible for him to do so, so that the case could be thrashed out at the meeting.  Whether the pension officer has discretionary powers or not in arriving at an assessment of the moneys which a particular claimant may have received during the year, I do not know, but my experience is that when a case comes before the committee and the committee decides to grant a certain pension, let it be a <Col N="1683" /> full pension or a partial pension, the pension officer invariably opposes it. Whether he feels himself bound to oppose it or whether he has to do so under the regulations, I do not know, but he invariably does oppose it, and that causes much of the delay.  Deputy Davin's suggestion is a good suggestion, and I hope the Minister will be prepared to act on it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the method adopted of assessing income, an old age pension claimant may have been an ordinary working man&mdash;unskilled, if you like&mdash; who, because of a thrifty nature, has managed to save a certain amount of money over, perhaps, 50, 55 or 60 years' hard work.  When the pension officer comes to make his assessment, above a certain figure, he starts to get his pound of flesh, so to speak.  The claimant is assessed on the basis of a return of 5 or 6 per cent., whereas the money all the time is lying in the Post Office at 2 or 2½ per cent.  These people in no circumstances will agree to have it anywhere but in the Post Office and you will never compel them. to invest it in stocks and shares from which they could get 5 or 6 per cent. In such cases, these moneys should not be taken into consideration at all or, at least, the pension officer's evaluation of the income from these moneys should be based on the interest accruing from investment in the Post Office.  That is the most that should be done.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the question of unemployment benefits.  Within the past month or so quite a number of people have become unemployed.  The people concerned are single men.  It has been brought to my notice that a number of these young men, who were qualified for unemployment benefit, were refused unemployment benefit at the local labour exchange on the ground that they were single men, for whom alternative employment was available on bogs 40, 50 or 60 miles away.  I am not making a case for the single man of whom it could be said that when his hat is on, his house is thatched.  I have in mind a single man who is the only support of a widowed mother and, perhaps, a family of four or six young people.  In that case, he should be <Col N="1684" /> entitled to draw unemployment benefit. I realise fully the difficulty of deciding whether a single man has as much responsibility as a married man would have or not.  I know that there is right of appeal but, unfortunately, in the event of appeal there is a time lag of three or four weeks before a decision will be arrived at.  In the meantime, there would be no money coming into the house.</P>
    <P>I wonder would the Minister consider giving discretionary powers to the social welfare officer of the area so that, when such an individual would claim unemployment benefit at the labour exchange, the case would be brought immediately to the notice of the social welfare officer, who would be informed that unemployment benefit is claimed on the ground that the claimant has stamps to his credit and that he is not in a position to travel 40 to 60 miles to a job of any kind.  I suggest that, immediately on being notified, the social welfare officer would visit the home of the individual concerned, investigate the case and satisfy the Department that the case is a genuine one and that the young man in question is really in the same position as the father of the house would be.  I am not making a case for the single man who has no commitments, who, when his hat is on, his house is thatched.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to refer.  It is not specifically mentioned on the Order Paper, but I take it that it comes under unemployment insurance.  I refer to wet time insurance.  That insurance has been in operation for some years.  I am sure the Minister is well aware of the unwieldy method of collection.  In order to be recouped the amount he pays out under this scheme, the employer must fill up a number of forms.  In most cases, the amount involved is so small that the employer would not bother to make the returns but would prefer to be at the loss of the money rather than go to all the trouble involved in filling up these forms.  I am sure that this matter has been brought to the notice of the Minister, not only since he became Minister, but when he was Deputy Norton.  It <Col N="1685" /> is an unwieldy method.  After eight or nine years' practical experience of the working of that particular insurance, I am sure it is not beyond the capabilities of the Department to devise a more simplified method by which employers could recoup the moneys paid out under this scheme.  I would suggest that the Department should consider this matter and they might also get the opinion of employers, either in Dublin or elsewhere, that would help them to arrive at a simplified method.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredPByrne" hpid="Mr. A.P. Byrne Mr. A.P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A.P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>There are very many tenants' associations, debating societies and other small groups scattered throughout the country who would be very glad if the Minister would make available to them the facilities that he made available to a group at Longford, a month or two ago, whereby an expert on the new social welfare scheme would explain to them the intricacies of this scheme.  I would urge the Minister to send a team around to societies who ask for these services, in order that healthy discussion of the new scheme will take place amongst the working classes whom, of course, it mainly affects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matter that I want to ask the Minister is, will he be good enough to make representations to his counterpart in Great Britain, the Minister of Labour, in regard to the issue of travel vouchers?  Very many categories of Irish workers in Great Britain have received for many years past a 7/6 travel voucher that would enable them to come home on their holidays.  They could travel from any part of Britain to any part of Ireland on this 7/6 travel voucher.  In March last, that concession was withdrawn by the authorities in Whitehall.  I would strongly urge the Minister to use his good offices with the Minister in Whitehall so that our Irish workers would receive that concession.  I know that very many of them will not be able to come home this year.  They have not the money saved.  They did not get sufficient notice.  If they had got 12 months' notice, they might have been able to save the fare.  As it is, they will not be able to come home <Col N="1686" /> unless our Minister acts quickly and asks the British Minister to act quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say at the outset that, with one notable exception, the contribution to the discussion of the Estimates has been extremely helpful.  Deputies have approached the consideration of the Estimates with a desire to recount their own experiences and to be helpful.  I prefer, therefore, to deal with their helpful contributions first, and I shall deal later with the destructive contribution made by Deputy Dr. Ryan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davern raised the question of the abolition of disablement benefit. I should like to point out to the Deputy that before disablement benefit could be abolished it would require legislation.  I take it the Deputy wants the abolition to take the form of not merely the discontinuance of the disablement benefit as such but the provision in its place of a higher rate of benefit.  That would involve legislation. The Deputy will appreciate that that is not practical politics on that narrow front at this moment with the Dáil on the eve of Adjournment.  However, in the new scheme of social security which will be introduced, provision will be included whereby the rates of sickness benefit will be substantially increased from, let us say, in the case of a man with a wife and two children, 22/6 at present, to 50/- under the new scheme.  In addition, where the person has a number of contributions to his or her credit, he or she, once certified to be sick and having the required minimum number of contributions, will continue to receive sickness benefit so long as he or she is sick.  In other words, disablement benefit will be abolished then, and it will be abolished by allowing the person to receive the full rate of sickness benefit appropriate to him or her for the full period of sickness. Therefore, in the case of a person who is seriously ill at present, after six months, no matter what the gravity of that illness, a person goes on disablement benefit.  A person may continue on that disablement benefit at present for the rest of his or her life. <Col N="1687" /> Under the new scheme it is proposed that where a person is ill sickness benefit will be payable.  Where a person has a certain number of minimum contributions, that payment will continue without reduction for the rest of the life of that person, so long as that person is certified to be incapable of resuming work.  Therefore, the Deputy will see that he will not have to wait very long until that very substantial and, in my view, long overdue reform will be put into operation.</P>
    <P>Again, the Deputy raised the question of extending the free period of insurance.  The Deputy thought that at the moment the free period is 12 months but it is 18 months.  Here, again, legislation will be required to extend it further than 18 months.  At all events, I think there is a way out for the person who leaves insurable employment, if he leaves it to become self-employed.  If a person desires to become self-employed then he can continue as a voluntary contributor for national health insurance and widows' and orphans' pensions purposes.  If such a person will only reflect for five minutes on the benefits he can receive by becoming a voluntary contributor, while self-employed, for the relatively small contribution which she or he would be required to pay, the benefits are so obvious as not to require more than a moment's thought to induce him or her to become a voluntary contributor.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davern raised the question of additional benefits with, I think, particular reference to dental benefit.  The present position is that the full amount of the additional benefits is being utilised for the various purposes for which these benefits are made available. So far as dental treatment is concerned, the position is that the society pay the full cost of the treatment and half the cost of the dentures.  That is a substantial contribution to make.  If you try to make it greater by paying the full cost of the dentures then you are going to make the benefit available to a lesser number of people.  The full amount allotted at the moment is being used up for the purpose of providing the present scale of benefits.  If you <Col N="1688" /> increase the scale of benefits the effect will be to deprive a certain number of persons of these benefits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not allot more for the purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment it has to come out of the accumulated funds on a kind of actuarial examination over a period of five years to see what is available. If the actuarial examination does not shed more for this purpose it is not possible, nor is there authority to do it. You can, of course, resort to the old but very imprudent practice of feeding the dog on his own tail.  I would point out that no dog has ever got stout on that process of feeding or lasted very long.  If you do that with the society, you will get&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been done on the basis of the same prudence that has to govern the allocation of moneys for these additional benefits to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davern raised, also, the question of social welfare officers' areas. It is only three years ago since these areas were outlined and, in fact, since the grade of social welfare officer was created.  Inevitably, the first allocation of zones had to be provisional.  One had to gain experience of their working before one could say with any certainty that they represented anything roughly approaching perfection.  The question of the size of these officers' areas is constantly under examination to see what alterations are necessary.  There may be areas in which the work is light and where the officer might be able to take more work.  There may be an area in which the work is heavy and in which you have to take off some of the work from the officer.  There may, over a number of zones, be a situation in which it is necessary to create another zone in that particular larger zone in order to allocate another officer to take some from each in order to balance out the work.  I can assure the Deputy that that matter is at present under consideration. In fact, it is constantly under consideration-my aim and the Department's aim being to ensure that <Col N="1689" /> a person is asked to look after an area which he can reasonably overtake. Nobody wants to sweat the social welfare officer or to ask him to do an impossible job.  Certainly, I do not. Anything that makes for an even distribution of the work and that does not impose an unreasonable burden on the social welfare officer will always have a sympathetic reception so far as I am concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davern mentioned that he thought the volume of work at present falling on secial welfare officers made surveys difficult.  As a matter of fact, during the past two or three years special instructions were issued to officers to deal effectively with noncompliance cases.  A very considerable volume of work has been undertaken in that field.  Many persons, who previously treated the law with the utmost impunity, have now been required, thanks to the vigilance of the social welfare officers, to comply with the law in that respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davern raised the question of the late surrender of cards.  As the Deputy probably knows, the Minister has power to waive the penalty for the late surrender of cards where he is satisfied the responsibility is not the responsibility of the insured person. As a matter of fact, in the great majority of cases that come to me, I waive the obligation to pay the penalty, and permit the person concerned to pay his contributions, even though they are not paid in time, where I am satisfied the insured person is not, in fact, responsible for the delay in surrendering his cards or where, as a matter of fact, he is not in conspiracy with an employer to avoid stamping the card. Unfortunately, we meet too many cases of workers who conspire with their employers not to stamp their cards; but when they lose their employment, or when they are sick and discover the employer will not pay them sickness benefit, they immediately proceed to howl that the employer has not complied with the law, whilst all the time they sheltered the employer against the vigilance and the penalties which ought to have been visited on him for noncompliance <Col N="1690" /> with the respective pieces of social legislation.</P>
    <P>I have no sympathy for the employee who lends himself to that kind of practice.  Where, however, it is clear that the insured person is the victim of the employer's unwillingness or failure to stamp the card, we have to look at the thing in a sympathetic way.  If I would address one word of advice to insured persons it would be that they should make sure that their cards are stamped regularly, because I have seen so many cases where the non-stamping of cards has involved, in a great many instances, loss of sickness benefit or unemployment benefit to insured persons.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Davin will appreciate that it would be undesirable that we should institute as a matter of routine practice an arrangement whereby people need not worry about the later surrender of cards or about non-compliance, because the moment any difficulty arises they would be allowed to pay their arrears or put stamps on cards.  We must keep to the normal practice that the card should be stamped each week and surrendered at the proper time, and the element of collusion, and even conspiracy, in non-stamping must be put down ruthlessly in the interests of the insured persons.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davern spoke of the training of disabled persons for re-employment. I have considerable sympathy with his objective, but I would like to say that that is not my responsibility.  The training of persons in order to rehabilitate them to take their place in industry is more appropriately a matter for the Department of Industry and Commerce, which has its associations with employment and industry and commerce generally.  My functions do not permit me to go into that domain, but I would like to see the question of training disabled persons to take their places again as workers in the community dealt with sympathetically and with a view to rescuing many people from something which will only lead to a life of inactivity and being compelled to exist on rates of benefit which never do justice to their original means of living.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1691" /> The question of the amount of home assistance granted by local authorities was raised by Deputy Davern, mistakenly, I think, on this Vote, because I have no function in the matter of the granting of home assistance generally or in any particular case.  Under the 1939 Act, that function was reserved to the local authorities, but it has been exercised since then through the county managers.  In future, county managers will not exercise that function.  It will be exercised by a committee of the local authority on which members of the local authority will be represented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an unofficial arrangement.  A sagacious county manager might adopt a device of that kind, but, under the Local Government (County Administration) Bill, the function will be the function of a committee of the council, and the ordinary members of the council who are elected in the local elections will have cast upon them the responsibility of deciding the scales of home assistance generally and the amount of home assistance to be paid in any particular case.  I hope, with Deputy Davern, that that will result in a more humanitarian approach to the sufferings of people who are compelled to rely on home assistance as a means of livelihood. I share his view that the present scales payable in many areas are in need of a substantial step-up.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGrath raised the question of what I might describe as the strike and lock-out section of the Unemployment Insurance Act.  I will repeat now an assurance I have already given, that I have informed the trade union congresses that if they have any suggestion to make to me of what they think represents hardship in the existing Act, I will be prepared to examine the matter sympathetically.  I invited them to submit proposals to me.  I have not yet received the proposals, but what I said before still stands, namely, that if they submit the proposals I will consider them sympathetically with a view to obviating any hardship or possible cause of hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1692" /> Deputy McGrath referred to the devolution of authority from the central headquarters of the Department in Dublin to local employment exchanges.  I share the Deputy's desire in that respect, namely, that we should as far as possible give to people, according to their official status, responsibility which can properly be put on their shoulders.  I do not want to see any kind of shuttle service under which all cases are sent to Dublin when they really can be decided locally.  That matter is being considered.</P>

I hope it will not be long until we can place in the hands of responsible local managers the responsibility of deciding cases locally without any need for reference to a central headquarters.  The Deputy also referred to the delay in investigating cases.  I think he was referring to old age pension cases.</P>

When we undertake an investigation, it is the same as an old age pensions investigation or a widows' and orphans' pensions investigation.  I do not think there is any delay so far as we are concerned in investigating these cases.  When we are asked to make an investigation we make it and then send it to the Department of Defence. If the Deputy will let me have particulars <Col N="1693" /> of any one case, I will undertake to check those particulars to see if there was any delay.</P>

We investigate it and furnish a report to the Department of Defence and it is considered there.

Although we are now paying more old age pensions than were ever paid since 1908 when the Act came into operation and are now dealing with more appeals than ever before, the number of appeals on hands to-day is the lowest in the history of the old age pensions section.  If any Deputy questions that, let him put down a parliamentary question and I will get the actual figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me deal with Deputy McGrath's case.  He raised the case of a person claiming a contributory widow's pension.  In a lot of these cases, the difficulty in deciding the matter is because the husband's insurability is obscure.  He may have been a person who had employment intermittently with one employer and then another employer and then somebody else.  There may be a gap in his insurance where he has not returned a card for a certain period and because of that he has not the required number of contributions, with the result that there is a doubt as to whether the widow qualifies for a pension.  If the Department are to decide that on the facts before them, they will decide it and I am sure will be glad to decide it on those facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>In the particular case I referred to there was one stamp short.  That was fixed up by some employer by whom he was employed. Then, after considerable delay, it was found that there was not the average number of contributions up to a certain period&mdash;I think three or five years&mdash; that the contributions were not sufficient.  That was the result of the investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the Department is concerned, in these cases. where entitlement is doubtful because of a deficiency in insurance stamps, if the Department were to decide the matter on the evidence before them in the first instance they could give a speedy decision.  What they do in a lot of these cases is to admit at once the right to a non-contributory pension and to pursue the investigations to establish entitlement to a contributory pension.  That often involves a considerable <Col N="1695" /> amount of work so far as the investigating officers are concerned. These are most troublesome cases.  The chief difficulty is that the person who could give valuable evidence is dead, namely, the insured person, and if an employer knows that his previous employee is dead and he did not stamp cards at the time, he is going to be very reluctant to admit that for a year or two years he did not stamp cards for that man.  There is no witness available to question his word.  All kinds of difficulty of that sort arise.  I must say that that section of my Department deals with all those difficult cases in the most sympathetic way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The object in the long run is to try to establish entitlement. The experience in that respect is the very reverse of what people sometimes mistakenly allege is the function of civil servants, namely, to deprive people of pensions.  In the widows' and orphans' section they display patience and care to try to establish entitlement to a pension.  While it may be vexatious to have to wait a long time for a final decision, speaking for myself I would prefer to wait for that time in the hope of getting a favourable decision which will last for the rest of the person's lifetime instead of getting an unfavourable decision on perhaps insufficient evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a law of averages and the Deputy's ship may come into port the next time.  While I am on the question of delay, and this applies to the point raised by Deputy Burke&mdash;I do not know what view the House will take of this&mdash;I think one of the causes of prolonged investigation in old age pension cases is the existence of local pensions committees. A local pensions committee may meet once every two months.  If the committee meets on the 1st of the month and a person makes an application on the 2nd, the application will be in the officer's hands for two months until the <Col N="1696" /> committee meets again.  Some committees may not meet even as frequently as that.  If there was any machinery for filtering an application through the committee, it would be investigated much more quickly.  It is a matter for consideration whether in fact the pensions committee is of any real use whatever to old age pension applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask whether it would be possible for the Department of Social Welfare to sanction the payment of the full pension where there is no question of dispute or doubt; whether the Minister could arrange that only cases where there is a likelihood of dispute or doubt will be put before the old age pensions committee instead of putting all cases, including those where there is no question, before the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case, that would require legislation.  It is not possible to consider it as a practicable proposition to-day.  From my experience of these matters, I would say that going before the local pensions committee does not add anything to the applicant's claim.  Firstly, the local pensions committee reports on the maximum merits of the application; secondly, it does not matter to them if they give the full pension because they have not to pay it.  Neither has it to be paid out of the rates.  They have the idea that it does not matter what they give.  They say to themselves: &ldquo;The fellows in Dublin will have to find that and therefore it is all right.&rdquo;  In fact, the very existence of the local pensions committee often necessitates an application being held up for consideration by the committee for as long as two months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As against that, let us see what we do in respect of widows' and orphans' pensions.  If a widow claims a widows' and orphans' pension, it does not go through any local committee.  It goes to the Department of Social Welfare, and an officer immediately proceeds to investigate the case.  There is no committee, and the result is that he can immediately investigate the claim for a pension.  In the case of old age pensions, the application has to go to <Col N="1697" /> the local pensions committee.  Frankly, I think a scheme by which old age pension applications would be dealt with directly by an officer of the Department of Social Welfare without the delay of having to send it to a pension committee would be a better way of dealing with the matter, as the officer can decide whether or not a pension should be awarded.  If the pension is awardable, the person gets the pension.  If, in the view of the officer it is not, the applicant can appeal and the appeal will be heard by the central pensions committee, which will give a decision on the merits of the case as they appear to the committee.  Frankly, I think that is a more speedy method of dealing with applications for old age pensions. However, I do not come down on one side or the other, but it is a matter that the House might consider and discuss perhaps at greater length on some other and perhaps more appropriate occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister bring it more fully to the notice of intending applicants that they are entitled to apply four months before they attain the age of 70?  Then this talk of delay would not be heard in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought there was no widespread doubt on that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the ordinary method of bush telegraphy we have in the country is not sufficient to make it known, I will certainly cause that information to be relayed so as to make it known more fully.  Deputy Burke said he came across cases in which there was delay in paying national health insurance benefit, the delay amounting to three or four weeks.  It is very easy to make general statements and indicate that all the delay is on the part of the society.  I will undertake that, if any Deputy sends me a case where he thinks there has been unreasonable delay, I will have the matter specially investigated.  In 98 per cent. of the cases which I have <Col N="1698" /> investigated, the delay has been due always to causes usually within the control of the insured person&mdash;he has not put in his card for a particular period, there is a card missing, his employer has not stamped his card, there is a discrepancy in the age, he has changed his address, or he has quoted a wrong number.  A whole pile of these causes contribute to the delay. If any Deputy thinks&mdash;this is a standing invitation&mdash;there is unreasonable delay, I will have the case investigated.</P>
      <P>Following the discussion on this Estimate last year, I asked the society to send out a special circular to the agents, telling them of my desire that claims for benefit, when received, be submitted expeditiously and that the benefits be distributed with the same expedition.  My idea and that of the society was to ensure that there would be no delay in the treatment of claims and the payment of benefits.  Considering the very large number of claims and the number of cases in which benefit is paid, I think the society is a remarkable efficient organisation.</P>

      <P>I am sorry Deputy Davin has left the House, as it seems to me that he made what I can only regard as an intemperate attack on the deciding officers who deal with old age pension cases.  Deputy Davin described them as dealing with cases in a callous manner&mdash;to use the Deputy's own phrase.  I think that is an unfair attack on officers who are not in this House to defend themselves.  Deciding officers in regard to old age pensions have no easy job.  They are expected to do a very distasteful job in a responsible way.  If they wish to curry popularity, they could give the full pension in all these cases, but that is not their function under the Act.  Their function is to investigate the circumstances and if satisfied that the circumstances merit the grant of a full pension, to grant it; if there is any doubt, to give the benefit of the doubt to the applicant; and only in cases where they are satisfied that the means amount to a certain sum, to adjust the pension accordingly.  So <Col N="1699" /> far as I know&mdash;and I have intimate contact with these officers&mdash;they do that work in a conscientious way.  What pains me more than all that is that a Deputy with Deputy Davin's long service in the House and long experience of the old age pensions section, should describe the officers in such a manner. I think it is unfair to them.  It is particularly unfair that they should be criticised in that manner in an Assembly where they have no chance of replying.  From my experience of them and my knowledge of their work, I am obliged as a matter of duty and as a matter of conscience, to say that I do not think they deserve the criticism which was unjustly levelled at them to-day.  They do their work conscientiously and no one can complain as long as they do that.  I leave it to the experienced Deputies here to say whether that is not the invariable experience of anybody who has had to interview these deciding officers.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan raised the question of a single man with dependents who has become unemployed and is entitled to unemployment insurance benefit. He instanced the case where such a person was offered turf work and deprived of benefit because he did not take it up.  So far as the Department is concerned, its function in the matter is as follows.  Employment on turf work away from home is offered only to single persons.  Married men are not offered employment away from home on turf work.  The employment is offered to a single person, provided he is suitable for turf work and that his knowledge of the work is such that he is likely to make an efficient worker.  In these circumstances, the person is invited to take up work in a Bord na Móna turf bog.  The Deputy mentioned that he might have no money to pay his way there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBrennan" hpid="Mr. T. Brennan Mr. T. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The particular type of individual I refer to is the single man who is placed, in my opinion and in the Minister's belief, in the category of a married man, inasmuch as he has a widowed mother and other members of his family to attend to.  I believe that man should be in the category of a married man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1700" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy made the point that the person would not have money to travel the 40 or 50 miles.  If he is offered and accepts Bord na Móna work, he is given a free travel voucher to get there.  He has this yardstick before him: is it better for him as a single man to accept this turf work where, after a week, he will have some income, or remain at home depending on unemployment insurance benefit? That is the test which he has to put to himself.</P>
      <P>The Deputy makes the case that he has a widowed mother and a number of brothers and sisters and therefore, in relation to the family, he is in the same position as a father.  I cannot decide whether that is so; neither can the Deputy; and clearly the officer in the employment exchange is not to have absolute discretion to decide whether it is so.  What happens in a case like that is that if the officer in the exchange thinks that this is a case where a person could take the employment, if he wished to, and does not take it, he fails to satisfy the condition that he is unemployed and genuinely unable to obtain suitable employment.  In that case, the person ceases to qualify for unemployment benefit.  But he has an appeal against that decision: he can go to the Court of Referees, which is constituted of three elements&mdash;one, the employers' representative; another, the workers' representative; and the third an independent person not responsible to me or to the Department for his decision, but perfectly free to decide anything he likes within the law.  To that tribunal, to that person in the position described, the applicant can go and can say: &ldquo;In view of my domestic circumstances, which are here set out, I think it is unreasonable to ask me to go into a turf camp.&rdquo;  If they say: &ldquo;Yes, we think it is unreasonable,&rdquo; the person will continue to draw benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasBrennan" hpid="Mr. T. Brennan Mr. T. Brennan">

In any reference I made to the particular individual, I stressed that he may not have money to carry on in the intervening period before his appeal is heard.  That may be a matter of three, four or five weeks, <Col N="1701" /> and he would be without any money in the meantime.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>What happens if benefit is paid to him for three or four weeks and the Court of Referees then say: &ldquo;You are in no sense a married man; your brothers and sisters are well able to look after your mother in your absence and it would do your mother good if you went down and cut turf and sent your mother home some money.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have paid benefit for four or five weeks illegally because the Court of Referees, which is the statutory body set up under the Act, decides that the particular individual has not fulfilled the conditions which would entitle him to benefit.  It is a difficult position and the only way out that I can see is by making a reasonable, independent body examine the position and decide can he go, or should he be allowed to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving it to a much more independent body, namely the Court of Referees.  I come now to the forms which employers are required to complete under the Wet Time Act.  These forms were revised about two years ago in consultation with the secretary and members of the employers' federation and the present forms are based upon what was then agreed with them.  If, however, the passage of time has given the builders' federation any new ideas which will enable more simplified forms to be adopted, all they have to do is ask for a further conference and we will discuss the matter with them to see if <Col N="1702" /> still greater simplification can be secured.</P>
      <P>Deputy Alfred Byrne (Junior) raised the question of the grant of vouchers or the payment of moneys to enable Irish workers in Britain to return home on holiday.  He suggested that I should get in touch with the British Ministry of Labour on that matter. That is a matter that will have to be taken up with the Department of Industry and Commerce rather than with the Department of Social Welfare. Normally, we do not deal with the British Ministry of Labour; we deal there with the Department of Social Insurance, and this matter properly comes under the Ministry of Labour in Britain.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davern and Deputy Brennan raised the question of the attendance of social welfare officers at meetings of the old age pensions committee.  It has never been the practice for these officers to attend those meetings.  To do so would seriously interfere with their ordinary work and make the discharge of their duties more troublesome if their time was taken up at meetings of these committees.  The officer has a right to attend these meetings and speak at them.  It is on instructions issued by the Department that he may attend such meetings, or if requested to do so by the committee. If their other duties permit them, social welfare officers generally will be glad to attend such meetings. My own view is that if they are available they ought to attend, but one does not want to see them detained at a meeting for many hours, to the neglect of other important investigation work. So long as we have pension committees I think there is a case to be made for close contact between the pensions officer and the pensions committee and I am sure a reasonable request from the committee and adequate notice given of such meeting to the social welfare officer will ensure that the officer will put in an appearance when his attendance is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one other Deputy who raised matters to which I must now reply; that is Deputy Dr. Ryan.  His contribution on this Estimate was the most remarkable contribution to <Col N="1703" /> which I have ever listened.  Six Estimates are served up here for discussion and examination.  Last night Deputy Dr. Ryan opened the debate, and made a speech lasting three-quarters of an hour without once referring to any matter of administration affecting the Department of Social Welfare, a Department of which he was at one time a Minister.  Having, apparently, no constructive criticism to offer and not being able to belittle the achievements of the past year or the programme for the next year, Deputy Dr. Ryan secured a document issued by the Labour Party under the title, &ldquo;Labour Party Proposals on Social Security,&rdquo; and spent three-quarters of an hour quoting from that document issued in 1947.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That must have been most embarrassing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall come to the embarrassment in a moment.  He spent three-quarters of an hour quoting from a document issued in 1947.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>It was very relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>And he successfully managed to avoid saying a single word about the administration of the Department of Social Welfare for the past year or its proposed administration in the coming year.  At the end of three-quarters of an hour he sat down, evidently feeling that his was a responsible contribution as an ex-Minister to a serious examination of the work of the Department of which he had previously been in charge. Deputy Ryan proceeded to quote what the Labour Party believed could be accomplished in the field of social security in 1947 if the Labour Party were elected to office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage I do not think we need go into all the possibilities of that document.  There was a fair amount of vision in the document.  There was a courageous approach to the problem of social security and, since that time, a fair amount has been done in travelling along the road which that document mapped out.  At all events, it makes much more cheerful reading than does <Col N="1704" /> the miserable bleating of Deputy Dr. Ryan on a motion in this House in October, 1947, when the Government of the day was asked to modify the means test for pension purposes and when Deputy Dr. Ryan came in wistfully pleading that he could not possibly find another penny to modify the means test; that the motion in question must be defeated; that the Government could not find the £500,000 necessary to do that; and that, consequently, all the people then dependent on pensions subject to a means test would have to continue to put up with that means test which the Fianna Fáil Government did not propose to alter in the slightest degree.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan might have been introspective yesterday evening and, if he was critical of some people's high hopes in the realm of social security, he ought to have remembered the miserable picture he painted on the 22nd October, 1947, of the field of social security.  If the people have to make a choice between the understanding and the hopes in the Labour Party document of 1947 and the miserable bleatings of Deputy Dr. Ryan in October, 1947, and the future he carved out for the people dependent upon low rates of pensions, I will back every time the document issued in 1947 by the Labour Party.  I think it represents some approach towards dealing with the claims of people affected by the motion which Deputy Dr. Ryan rejected on behalf of his Government in October, 1947.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan wants to know what has the Government done since in the field of social security.  I do not know whether Deputy Dr. Ryan is suffering from amnesia or whether it is that he cannot read the achievements of the Government in the field of social security.  While he could not make available £500,000 to modify the means test for old age pensioners in 1947, we made available £2,500,000 the following year to modify the means test and to increase old age pensions.  As the Deputies on the opposite benches know quite well, over 100,000 persons, who were then getting old age pensions at the rate of 12/6 <Col N="1705" /> a week, are now getting them at the rate of 17/6 a week.  In other words, within 12 months of taking office, this Government gave those people an increase of 5/- per week in their old age pensions, while in the previous 32 years they only got an increase of 2/6.  Was that doing something for old age pensioners?  Is it not a fact that, to-day, we are paying more old age pensions than ever were paid in the history of this country?  It is easier to-day to get an old age pension, because of the considerable modification in the means test.  For industrially employed and blind persons we have revolutionised the means test, and for widows and orphans, in receipt of non-contributory pensions, we wiped out the former four zones in which pauperised rates of non-contributory widows' and orphans' pensions were payable, and we substituted two new areas.  In each of these two new areas, the pensions are much higher than they were in any of the other four.  Not only did we raise the rates of benefit, but we substantially modified the means test there again.</P>
    <P>What was the position under Deputy Dr. Ryan's administration?  I shall give the House one or two examples. Under the means test, which was in operation during Deputy Dr. Ryan's régime, if a widow, receiving a non-contributory pension, earned 1/-, that 1/- was taken off her pension.  If that widow had a son or a daughter who gave the mother 2/6 a week to help her on the low rate of pension then payable, she could keep the 2/6 but if the son or daughter decided to give the mother 3/- instead of 2/6, then the 6d. came off the widow's pension.  That was Deputy Dr. Ryan's means test. What is the position to-day?  A widow to-day can get as much as 10/- per week from a son or a daughter and there will be no reduction in her pension.  A widow can now earn 10/- a week, and there is no reduction in her pension. Compare that with the position under Deputy Dr. Ryan's régime when if she earned 1/- for a day's work, it came off her pension.  The fact is that she is now entitled to earn 10/-, and to keep it all; that her son or daughter can give her another 10/- and that she <Col N="1706" /> can keep it all, and still there is no reduction in the pension of that person; while her pension, on top of that, is substantially higher than it was under Deputy Dr. Ryan's régime.</P>
    <P>These facts are incontrovertible.  Yet Deputy Dr. Ryan last night, as if everyone was as politically blind as himself, wanted to know what the Government had done since 1948.  Not only have we spent an additional £2,500,000 on old age, blind and widows' and orphans' pensions, but we have substantially improved, by legislation, the maximum amount of compensation payable under the Workmen's Compensation Act.  The Deputies on the opposite benches thought that we would not be in office long enough to modify the means test or to increase pensions.  We have shown that, not only have we been in office long enough, but that we have increased pensions to a level which was never previously attained, and that there are very many more people getting better rates of pension than ever got them under the Fianna Fáil régime.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's last criticism was that we promised to produce the White Paper but that it would be shelved; that there would be a row between certain members of the Cabinet about the White Paper, and that it would never appear.  Even in the <i>Irish Press</i> we had a leading article which appeared while a Labour Party conference was being held saying that the White Paper had been shelved.  Its impetuosity was such that it could not wait until the conference was over to see would there be any announcement made about the White Paper.  The next day the announcement was made that the White Paper would be issued before the Dáil reassembled.  Those on the opposite benches said that the White Paper would never be seen. There, again, the editor of the <i>Irish Press,</i> or the Dáil Reporter, or some of the numerous legendary characters who are interviewed by that paper said that we would never carry the White Paper any further.  We have carried it further to the extent that we have now decided to integrate the National Health Insurance Society in the Department of Social Welfare.  We have now got the basis on which to <Col N="1707" /> rear a wide scheme of social security, and we have introduced into this House a Bill which will provide a scheme of social security based on the provisions of the White Paper.  That will be done just as relentlessly and as remorselessly as the other things which we have done in the sphere of social security.</P>

It is the only document on social security which the former Minister put his signature to so far as I can discover, and I presume all the documents were left in the Department.  I think we are entitled to say to Deputy Dr. Ryan: &ldquo;Put down on one side of a sheet of paper what we have done during the past two and a half years and on the other side your own masterly, magnificent inactivity during your year of office in the Department of Social Welfare.&rdquo; If that is done, then I think that intelligent people will realise that the past two and a half years have been fruitful years so far as the Department of Social Welfare is concerned, and so far as its work on behalf of the weak, the needy and helpless people is concerned. So far as Deputy Dr. Ryan is concerned, his one year in that Department was associated with a magnificent inactivity.  The Department might as well not have a Minister at all.</P>

I think, therefore, I would be in order on this Estimate to ask what has happened the economy policy. Has it been abandoned, was it found impracticable or was it ever seriously intended?

It was the Minister for Finance who advocated a reduction of expenditure and announced that it was the policy of the Government now in office to carry through a campaign of retrenchment. What has happened?  Is that not a reasonable question to ask when we find a Government that proclaimed its intention to reduce expenditure, to eliminate services and sections of services which involved expenditure, in the interests of economy and in the interest of reducing the total cost of Government to the taxpayer, presenting to the Dáil a Book of Estimates which shows a substantial increase in expenditure in the majority of Departments and which cannot show in respect of any single Department one item of reduction which could be described as an economy.  We have more civil servants now than ever before in the history of this State; these civil servants are being paid more money than ever they were paid before.  Deputy Captain Cowan may be right in suggesting that it is wise policy to increase the number of our civil servants or to increase their remuneration.  He is entitled to that view.

What has happened to the declared intention of the Minister for Finance to secure retrenchments? Have there been any economies?  Have there been any retrenchments? Can the Minister point to a single Department where the total cost was reduced as a result of his intervention in the interests of economy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three possible explanations of the failure of this economy campaign.  Either the Minister was never serious when before or after the general election he was speaking about economy and retrenchments and the need of them.  He was talking here <Col N="1715" /> possibly with his tongue in his cheek and having convinced some Deputies and some members of the public that he was serious in his desire and intention of securing economies and carrying out retrenchments he retired to the privacy of his office and there in the presence of his own cronies had a good laugh at the mugs who believed it.</P>

      <P>If you want evidence of the fact that some are mugs it is to be found on the benches opposite.</P>
      <P>That is one explanation.  The Minister all the time was having a good laugh in private at those who believed in his intention to effect economies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other explanation is, of course, that he personally believed in the practicability of that policy but could not get the co-operation of his colleagues in carrying it through.  I think that that is possibly the right explanation; that at some stage early in his <Col N="1716" /> ministerial career the Minister for Finance had to take a decision between honouring his personal pledges to the public and to this House and falling out with his colleagues, and deciding that his personal pledges did not matter as against the political need of keeping on good terms with certain ministerial colleagues who disagreed with his viewpoint.</P>
    <P>It may be that the Minister, on his getting control of his Department and getting an opportunity of examining the matter, came honestly to the conclusion that he had previously been wrong; that there was neither scope for economy nor justification for it; that his denunciations of the alleged extravagance of his predecessors were unjustifiable; and that he has not now either the frankness or the humility to admit that much to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>These are the three explanations. Which is the right one?  Nobody will now seriously pretend that the economy policy is still alive.  Certainly the type of economy that can increase the cost of Government administration by 20 per cent. in a couple of years is of little benefit to the taxpayers of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lehane does not realise that he is now arguing in favour of the point of view I expressed in 1947 and 1948 when this was an issue before the people.  I did not tell the people that economies were possible.  I did not tell them that they would benefit as a result of any indiscriminate application of a policy of retrenchment.  I argued in favour of intelligent expenditure. It was the present Minister for Finance who said then that the burden of the cost of Government exceeded the capacity of the country to bear it.  It was he who argued that irrespective of the purpose for which expenditure was necessary the most useful contribution that could be made to the national welfare was to bring down the cost of Government. He pledged himself to do it; he got himself elected on that undertaking; in the first speech he <Col N="1717" /> made as Minister he promised to fulfil that pledge, and subsequently he ran away from it.  Why?  It is a matter of no great interest but it would round off the records of the Dáil if the Minister would tell us now why and in precisely what circumstances he decided to jettison that policy and break his pledges.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare will not disagree with the point of view that the efficiency of his Department would be substantially increased if they were located in a new building properly designed for their accommodation.  I think that they would be better off in a new building than in a bus station.  I am not one of those who argued that it was good policy to house Government Departments in converted tenements in various parts of the city.  I became Minister for Industry and Commerce, as I have told the Dáil on previous occasions, to find my Department located in 14 different buildings and so organised that if I wanted to see any senior officer of my Department I had to give him 24 hours' notice of the fact so that he could arrange to leave the building in which he was working with somebody else in charge of it and travel over to meet me at a time convenient. There is a building in Kildare Street which represents my personal contribution to the increased efficiency of the Department of Industry and Commerce. I know, of course, that Deputies are making a dishonest sort of campaign on the strength of various plans that were made for the longterm development of Government buildings over a period of 50 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me express a point of view. Many a time in the past it was urged by Deputies that the Government should have available a pool of public works which could be drawn upon in times of trade depression in order to maintain employment and commercial activity.  We agreed with that point of view.  It is true that, in the greater part of our time, conditions were such that, if that pool of works had been prepared by our predecessors, we would probably have exhausted it; but we announced here during the war, at a period when works of that kind could not be proceeded with, that we were preparing plans for them, hoping to bring these plans to the point at which work on them could proceed whenever it was decided that <Col N="1719" /> it would be good policy to proceed with them.  It is quite easy for Ministers and Deputies opposite, if they regard it as good politics, to take these plans and to say: &ldquo;That is what the Fianna Fáil Government was going to do instead of building houses for the workers.&rdquo;  They can say that, but they know it is not true.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a historical process and it will go on&mdash;have no doubt about that.</P>
      <P>The next matter I want to refer to is the apparent indifference of the Minister for Finance to the trade problem that will arise when Marshall Aid ceases in 1952.  The Minister for Finance is responsible for the administration of Marshall Aid, for the allocation of available dollars for trade purposes. From time to time, he and other Ministers have issued apathetic warnings that difficulties may be anticipated in the future, but up to date they have given no indication of any serious thought on the problem, much less attempted to convey to the people of the country an outline of a national plan for dealing with that situation when it develops.  We have had a few futile exhortations from the Minister for Industry and Commerce to industrialists to export to the United States. Some limited industrial exports to the United States may be possible, but not even the Minister for Industry and Commerce in his most optimistic moments can expect that they are likely to be developed before 1952 on a scale that will be of the least significance in relation to the trade problem that will emerge in that year after Marshall Aid ceases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had other Ministers giving an indication of a belated realisation of the importance of the tourist trade <Col N="1723" /> in our national economy.  There was a time when the tourist trade was their <i>béte noir</i>, when the policy of Deputies who are now Ministers was to kill that trade by taxing tourists.  We are glad that they have realised the stupidity of that policy and have come, however belatedly, to recognise the potentialities of that trade as a means of redressing our balance of payments, but they are doing nothing else about it.  If there is to be any serious effort to prepare now to cope with the situation which will become acute in two years' time we have seen no signs of it.  If there is to be anything more than vague generalisations in ministerial speeches relating to this matter, there should be some evidence of constructive planning, some evidence that plans made are being carried into effect. Will the Minister for Industry and Commerce tell us why he got recently a resignation from the Tourist Board? More than Deputies on this side of the House are perturbed by the impossibility of getting action in addition to speeches from Government Departments during the past two years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Deputy did not get some resignations during his time as Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly would not have got them on that ground.  It seems to me that the Government is proceeding on the assumption that, after 1952, our plight will be such that somebody else will be induced, out of sympathy with us, to do something for us.  I would like to feel&mdash;I am sure most Deputies would prefer to feel&mdash; that we were doing what lies in our own power to equip ourselves to stand on our own feet at that time.</P>
      <P>That, perhaps, brings up wider aspects of policy than are open for discussion on this Vote.  The Minister for Finance can plead that he has responsibility here only for the defence of the administration of the Department of Finance, but there will be another opportunity before the Dáil adjourns to bring that wider issue before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, of course, I recognise, rather futile to be asking the Minister for <Col N="1724" /> Finance to express opinions upon these matters of general policy.  This time last year we were discussing the Estimate for the Department of Finance and the general situation in which the Minister for Finance had to carry out his policy.  The issue then was the possibility of the devaluation of sterling and Deputies on this side of the House were expressing apprehensions as to the possible consequences of that development and asking for assurances from the Minister for Finance that vigilance was being exercised, that precautions were being taken to protect the nation against these consequences. We had the Minister for Finance expressing his view that it was not going to happen at all.  It happened eight weeks later.  He was so completely wrong in his forecast of the trend of events last year that we can hardly expect him to be right now. When it did happen, and when the Minister had to take action here consequential on it, he offered to explain to the people of the country what it might mean in its effects upon trade and upon prices and he was again wrong, because every forecast he made in that broadcast talk after the announcement of the devalution of the Irish £ has been proved in the event to be wrong.  He even misled some of his Cabinet colleagues.  Notably he misled the Minister for Agriculture into making the most foolish statement of his career, and that is some achievement because the Minister for Agriculture has got many foolish statements to his discredit.</P>
    <P>If the Government have any policy in this matter, should some opportunity not be created for outlining it to the House and to the public?  They cannot hope to fool all the people all the time.  They can, no doubt, hope, for a period, to jolly them along from day to day, distorting facts, making phony prophecies and expressing optimistic forecasts but, sooner or later, that process will have to stop.  Sooner or later, they are going to be brought up against some hard reality that they cannot conjure out of existence with a few trite phrases.</P>
    <P>We are going to have a new loan. According to reports current, it is to be a loan of £15,000,000, and to carry <Col N="1725" /> interest at the rate of 3½ per cent., a higher rate than the Government borrowed at previously.  Then, presumably, interest charges upon advances to the Electricity Supply Board, the Turf Development Board and other organisations which draw on the Exchequer for their capital needs, will have to be increased also and the consequential effects upon the cost of their services will be noted.</P>
    <P>The Government's borrowing programme is almost certain to cause a continuing rise in interest rates against it.  When we were discussing here in the past the wisdom of borrowing for public services which previously were met out of the tax revenue, the public consequences of that policy upon the capital development programme behind which the Government were sheltering were emphasised from these benches and discounted by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>There will be other effects from that spendthrift policy into which the Minister for Finance was driven by the refusal of his colleagues to co-operate with him, if in fact they were asked to co-operate, in economies, and in retrenchments. There might be, probably would be, amongst the public a desire to co-operate with the Government in making possible a programme of national investment, provided they were satisfied that some reasonable supervision over wasteful administration in various Departments was being exercised and that the money was to be expended for productive purposes. Once the Government proclaimed its intention of borrowing to meet political difficulties, of borrowing to meet the increased cost of services because it had not the courage to tax for them, then, inevitably, the public view of the soundness of its policy and, in particular, of its financial policy, changed considerably.</P>
    <P>We have had evidence in the course of the present year that other Ministers are leaving behind, or will leave behind them when they quit office, difficult problems for their successors to handle, complicated situations which will have to be painfully disentangled, but I am quite sure that the record of history <Col N="1726" /> will be that no Minister will have left behind him quite so many problems of quite the same magnitude as those which the Minister for Finance is creating and creating deliberately and cynically, knowing that he is doing it, but preferring to leave these problems rather than risk any political disagreement with people who have come into a coalition with him and whose support for that coalition is necessary to keep him in office.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to reply to a speech of the type to which we have just listened and to which, I may say, we are accustomed from the ex-Minister.  He has described the policy as being that of stupid men.  I think he also argued that it was dishonest trickery on the part of the present Government.  That is all right, you know, for the street corners but I must say I thought the Deputy would have developed a little bit more responsibility by this time.  It is very difficult to answer that type of vulgarity. It is abuse and he can continue at it as long as he likes.  It all stems from the attitude he has displayed so often in this House of a certain amount of arrogance&mdash;that when he speaks let no dog bark; that, after all his experience, what he says should be accepted as being fully informed and as being the last word on the subject which human wisdom can possibly expect. That was all right when the Deputy was standing over here and could prevent a disclosure of what was on the file and what would have given him away. Some of these files have been opened since and they have not enhanced the Deputy's reputation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asked where I made my economies. I would point out that I am not carrying on some of the very glaring follies of the Deputy.  For one thing, we have not made a purchase of Argentine wheat since we came into office. Certainly, there has been nothing like <Col N="1727" /> the magnificence of the expenditure of Córas Iompair Éireann, founded on bankruptey but simply going ahead.  I often feel that it is wrong to blame the directors of Córas Iompair Eireann for the policy they tried to develop.  When the members of Córas Iompair Eireann went to that building they must have thought that their type of megalomania was only in the halfpenny place.  I take very definite credit for having stopped that type of thing.  That was the mood then but there is a much more sober mood here at the moment.  We are going to spend money wisely.</P>
    <P>With regard to the cost of the Civil Service, I have been accustomed for two years to hear quotations from speeches of mine read out on the fact that I always stood for remaking the contract that there was with the Civil Service and which the last Government had so shamefully broken.  These quotations were read out at different times by, I think, nearly every one of the ex-Ministers.  They said that I said that if we were to double the salaries it would not be too much.  Of course, the criticism is that we have not doubled the salaries and that, therefore, I am not doing as much as I am alleged to have promised when in opposition.  I made a certain contract with the civil servants at the end of 1948 and I consider that it was a good arrangement.  It was not entered into in any great spirit of haggling.  An arrangement had been made which enabled them to approach me on the basis that there was something like a contract made by my predecessors in office.  I honoured that.  When I came to Dáil Eireann with that particular arrangement Deputy Aiken said that under that arrangement the civil servants had been given too much.  I suppose that is the view of the Opposition. I do not think it was too much. I have never been able to understand the attitude of the previous Government towards civil servants as a whole.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass said something about dishonesty and trickery in our approach to the people.  Perhaps it might be relevant here to remind Deputy Lemass of a speech made by his <Col N="1728" /> Leader, Deputy de Valera, in Ennis on one famous occasion.  In that speech he made a long appeal to the civil servants and he announced that whereas at one time he thought that the bonus system was bad and evil he had come to the conclusion, having observed the working of the system from the inside, that it was a really good system.  He then appealed to them to hang on to the bonus system. He said that it would be their safeguard when there would be an increase in the cost of living.  At the time the cost of living was going down and so long as the cost of living was going down the bonus system was going against the civil servants. Deputy de Valera reminded them that the cost of living was going to rise and he said that the bonus system would then be their safeguard.  Well, the cost of living did rise and, automatically, the contract was broken.  A Wages (Standstill) Order was put into operation.  The lives of these people have undoubtedly been very greatly distorted for the six or seven years during which that situation lasted.  To start off with, I thought it was an illegal performance and I described it in this House as immoral.  The Government took hold of the people who were nearest to them and who were most easily coerced&mdash;people who had no method of defending themselves or of explaining their attitude except the futile one of approach through letters. It was a highly disgraceful performance.</P>
    <P>If my information is correct I understand that certain members of the Church addressed the Government, through some of its members, and pointed out that they did not see how the matter could be justified on moral grounds.  However, the immoral attitude was persisted in.  It was left to us to try and make some rectification in the matter.  We made an arrangement with the Civil Service which I think was good for both sides, and, in addition, we have now established the machinery of arbitration.  Civil servants ought never again be put in the completely abject position in which they found themselves under the last Government.</P>
    <P>I have no excuse to make with <Col N="1729" /> regard to the cost of the Civil Service in so far as it means that civil servants are getting increased emoluments.  We have done our best to make their pay bear a better relationship to the increased cost of living than ever before.  In so far as there has been an increase in the strength of the Civil Service, I regret it.  I have been making endeavours to get the numbers of civil servants reduced.  I think it would have been possible to do so by going out in a ruthless way and simply insisting on the numbers being cut down, but it might not have been economy in the end.  Overtime rates certainly do not make for economy. Unless the work could be collapsed there would not be much sense in artificially and arbitrarily reducing the numbers in the Civil Service.  It is rather a long process, I have discovered, to get the numbers of those who are in the Civil Service, whether established or unestablished, reduced. In addition, there is the human aspect of the matter.  Even if I found that in some magical way work could be so completely reduced that it would be possible to get rid of 2,000 civil servants, I do not think the Government would stand for the immediate dispersal of 2,000 civil servants.  I think their attitude would be to let those who are in occupation of certain posts remain on, even if they should be redundant and allow, instead, the ordinary process of wastage and nonrecruitment to bring about the reduction. I think that is the course humanity would dictate and that that is the course we would follow if work could be reduced.  It is very difficult to get it reduced because certain habits have grown up and because there is a certain system.  It may well be that at a later period I will approach the Public Accounts Committee and ask them to make a change in their methods so as not to impose on Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries the same degree of responsibility as is at present demanded to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, through the Public Accounts Committee.  I will make that case on the basis that I believe we can get all the necessary safeguards in order to ensure there will be protection of the public with <Col N="1730" /> regard to the expenditure of the money taken from them.  At the same time, I think we would cut out certain matters which have grown up in connection with Civil Service work and which, I think, involve the duplication of effort here and there which is really not of great value.</P>
    <P>That matter has been examined and is being examined.  Certain inspections are going on with a view to striving towards a reduction in the numcrical strength of the Civil Service.  I may say that if I have not achieved what I wanted to achieve it is certainly not for want of trying.  So far as apologising is concerned, I take some pride in having been able to restore something like the old time association between moneys paid and the purchasing power of moneys, and that I have not carried on the programme of the last Government.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of cutting Government expenditure but not in the Civil Service.  We felt that waste could be eliminated and we have eliminated that waste.  Deputies on the Opposition side of the House may preach as long as they like any propaganda with regard to the cost of Government.  If one were to emphasise a particular thing, the thing, I suppose, of all things, that beat the Fianna Fáil Party out of Government and put us into Government was the taxation imposed in 1947.  The taxes that most definitely annoyed the people of the country were the tax on beer and the tax on tobacco. We remitted those.  Deputies over there can talk until they are black in the face, they will never be able to persuade the people that we did not reduce those taxes.  We took them away. It meant, speaking from the angle of the Department of Finance, a loss of £7,000,000 in revenue&mdash;£6,000,000 to £7,000,000.  In addition to that, the rate of income-tax was reduced.  That looked as if it would mean a loss of £1,000,000.  In any event, individuals throughout the country know that the income-tax rate has been reduced.</P>
    <P>Owing to the buoyancy of the revenue, the fact that there is more money around and that people are earning more, there was no actual loss but the tax reduction was effective all <Col N="1731" /> the same.  There were other reductions effected.  I calculated that if we had not decided to increase the pay in the Civil Service, in the Guards and in the Army, and if we did not make certain other alleviations to people getting money from Government sources, the remission of taxation that could have been given would have amounted to £11,000,000.  We gave between £7,000,000 and £8,000,000 in the remission of taxation, and we switched £3,000,000 to other purposes.</P>
    <P>I do not mind how long Deputies may talk about various items in the Book of Estimates, and I do not mind the references to the dishonest device of borrowing; the one thing they cannot succeed in doing&mdash;they are really in this connection trying to achieve the impossible in their propaganda&mdash;is to convince the people that taxation has not been lowered.  I say it has been, and all the gamecock crowing by Deputy Lemass will not affect that issue at all. The people are aware of the facts.  The man who drinks, the man who smokes, and the man who pays income-tax, is aware of the facts.  When you say those three things, you have covered a very numerous section of the community. Every individual in that category knows about the reduction of taxation, and they all appreciate it.</P>
    <P>The Deputy says there was a time when I was keen on retrenchment.  I was and still am.  He started off by indicating three possible excuses or pleas that might be made for what he describes as my failure.  He suggested I might be serious about two of them, but I was not serious about the third. I was quite serious and in relation to it I was beaten only by my colleagues. The Deputy suggested that I was aware that in that respect no economies could be made&mdash;I presume that was his point, that there were no economies there to be made.  I was quite serious about it.  I have indicated the position with regard to the beer and tobacco taxes. The Deputy raised a technical point, that it should not be done by Order, and he boasted that it was a short time before the 1948 Budget would be introduced and then we would see.</P>
    <P>Again, speaking with his usual arrogance, <Col N="1732" /> he said there were only two or three channels for the purpose of obtaining revenue and these included beer, tobacco and income-tax.  There was I faced with a loss of £7,000,000 in respect of beer and tobacco.  We could not go back and resume taxation on beer and tobacco and, therefore, according to the Deputy, income-tax would have to swell.  But we got along all right without increasing income-tax; in fact, there was a reduction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking now of the position up to last year and I am making it clear that there was a reduction in taxation.  Later on I will deal with this year.  Let the Deputy ponder on what I am saying.  When he considers the position in 1948-49 and in 1949-50 I wonder what answer he will give to his people?  The Deputy seemed very sure at the time I speak of that taxation would soar.  Can he demonstrate that?  I assert the contrary and I think the Deputy must admit that certain taxes were lowered. How, he could ask himself, were we to level up?  I was not beaten.  My colleagues were with me in agreeing to certain retrenchments which were wide enough to give us £11,000,000. We switched £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 of that and remitted the rest.  I personally believe there are still further grounds for economies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy referred to one other thing and there, too, we had a glimmer of what was meant in the old time argument, if he only had pursued it. He said that taxation was reaching a level which was beyond the capacity of the country to pay.  The point is that the national income&mdash;and I am speaking now of real income&mdash;has grown. The capacity of the people to pay has definitely increased since 1948 and that is the answer to this apparent contradiction and this query as to where is the money coming from if it does not come out of taxation.  The Deputy should remember that prosperity now and again is inclined to pay dividends. An increase in prosperity, an increased standard of living, has been found to pay dividends.  That has been my experience <Col N="1733" /> as the individual for the time being associated with national finance.</P>
    <P>The Deputy said that a sum of £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 is now being put into the erection of public buildings in excess of what was spent in 1948.</P>

      <P>The Deputy was made to say something about £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 as a result of Deputy McQuillan's interjection. Therefore, the Deputy is back on the argument about increasing expenditure on public buildings.  It is not easy to <Col N="1734" /> pin the Deputy.  Let us get back to the £11,500,000, which is a figure we can talk about.  The last time I was speaking on this, I found there were three answers to the £11,500,000 project. One was that it was never meant. A second was that it was really only meant to provide against a period of unemployment so that there could be a scheme of public works.  The third, for which I think Deputy Aiken was responsible, was that we had no great public buildings and it was time that we started building.  Deputy Lemass has taken the second of these excuses and is back on that&mdash;that the Government at that time, in its wise foresight, decided to prepare a scheme of public buildings against a time of depression. The argument will not hold any water.  On the file there is the statement which I read out and if Deputies repeat again that I am taking extracts from the file to suit my purposes, I offer to publish the whole file as a White Paper.

The Deputy should not generate more indignation than he can contain.  It is on the file that this would inevitably mean a postponement of the housing of the working classes.

      <P>It was gone on with up to 1935,1936 and 1937.  Is not that right?  It was gone on with despite the warning that proceeding with that meant the postponement of the housing of the working classes.  In face of that, how can it be said that this was a plan to provide against a period of depres sion?  The file is full of statements that the building trade was fully occupied at the time.  It was contradictory. You cannot have a scheme and say it was against a period of depression when in fact the builders were fully occupied at the time and when it was said that it meant the postponement of everything in connection with the housing of the working classes.</P>
      <P>I am told now that it was to be a plan scaled out over ten years or so.  I do not think that occurs in the file.  I have reviewed the file many times. I will review it again to see if that phrase occurs.  I do not remember it. I do remember that the analogy which was taken was the Stormont building in Belfast.  I am certain it is recorded on the file that Stormont was built inside three years.  I think the area which was going to be devastated by this scheme ran to over 70 acres in the heart of Dublin.</P>

That scheme, it was stated, could only be described as a scheme for the palatial housing of civil servants, and the warning was given that it would be quite impossible to get money from the public for such a scheme considering the depressed condition of the country.

      <P>All I will say is that is typical of the projects that proceeded from the grand building which the Deputy got erected to house his dreams in Kildare Street.  It is typical of what came from that place.  An £800,000 building was erected by a company that was in the position that it was not able to pay its debts and had to put its cheques into the safe and could not release them.</P>

There is one other argument which I thought I had countered sufficiently so that I need not refer to it again.  Apparently, however, it is necessary to say a word about it.  When Deputies on the other side of the House speak about tourists it is suggested that I spoke of their stupidity in connection with tourists.</P>

      <P>That is not this time.  There was a time when I spoke somewhat enthusiastically and warmly against tourists.  These were days when we had very scanty supplies of foodstuffs here.  So far as I remember, I generally introduced my argument against tourists into the context of what I referred to as the Government's treatment of civil servants.  I asked over and over again questions as to what it would cost to give civil servants their old emoluments based on the then cost-of-living figure.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is in better humour than his chief.  I will come back to the sterling assets.  I certainly produced this argument in this context: &ldquo;Why do you not pay civil servants what you owe them ?&rdquo; The answer was that it would cost £1,000,000.  I was asked to think of all the inflationary difficulties there would be if civil servants were given £1,000,000 to spend.  I remember my answer to that being&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That sort of assumed anger does not go down any longer in this House.  We all know where we are with the Deputy.  We know what the vehemence and the pretence to be angry means.  I argued against the attitude of the Government towards civil servants and I was told it was really on the ground of inflationary difficulties.  I asked: &ldquo;Why is £1,000,000 in the hands of tourists not inflationary when spent here and why will £1,000,000 in the hands of civil servants be inflationary ?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I was led by the development of that argument to object to their coming here.  It was a right and proper objection in those days. We had very limited supplies and were severely rationed, with nothing over and above.  We had experienced inflation and signs of worse inflation, and in those circumstances the Government of the day had set out to encourage a lot of people across the Border to come down here to go into competition for the limited amount of food stuffs and other articles, including wearing apparel, that we had here.  That was the suggestion round Ireland at the time, and in those circumstances the encouragement of a big tourist traffic was just lunacy.</P>

      <P>Surely the plans in regard to tourists are not a matter entirely of making speeches.  Deputy Lemass thinks that the whole thing is perfect if one talks about tourists. That is not what we believe in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am told here again that the usual resort is had now to the device of borrowing for the capital and other services.  I am sorry I have not the quotations from Deputy Lemass which I read before, the one where he talked about the chances here for great development&mdash;when he thought the present Government had a policy of austerity and was trying to have recorded everywhere the magnificent schemes for which Fianna Fáil had made plans, all requiring capital moneys because they were capital development and covering all the landand he added a few in, like merchant shipping and defence.  These were plans for great schemes, only requiring courageous, adventurous, enterprising people and we were to be denied that because of this small amount, what he called himself a pretty subterfuge avoiding a chance offered to us of putting this country on the high road to success.  Let him read that speech and relate it to what he calls more recently the device of borrowing.  I have challenged Deputies right through the whole Estimates&mdash;in the Seanad I put it in as vigorous a way as I could-and I asked not merely people in the House but economists and others outside to show to us any single scheme not suitable for the idea of borrowing. I asked if they would take this in detail and go down through the total of £12,113,000 and pick out any heading or sub-head on which they could say it was wrong to borrow. <Col N="1741" /> Deputy Lemass later said any such items he could find would not be more than £1,000,000 and when we got down to an analysis of that £1,000,000, I think his argument disappeared.  He has a point of view but he cannot hold his point of view so strongly as to believe that anyone who does not agree is either stupid or malicious or else is being dishonest.  We think that again on this occasion, and if Deputy Lemass examines that £12,000,000 in detail I will stand over the sub-heads and over any amount under each sub-head.</P>
    <P>I am told that I erred grievously last year with regard to devaluation. The matter of my Estimate came under discussion last year and the question of devaluation was thought of so little importance that it came in at the end of a rather lengthly debate, on the point as to why I did not pay certain solicitors' costs in a certain famous case.  It was tagged in at the end of that, when Deputy Little said a few words about devaluation.  Deputy Lemass says to-day that I was entirely wrong, that I said it was not going to happen.  I did not say that at all.  I do not find it recorded here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did you not read out what was there?  At that time I first of all referred to Deputy Little &mdash;as given in column 902 on 21st June, 1949&mdash;who had spoken, to use Deputy Little's own phrase, about the difficulty we would have in getting out of the strait-jacket of sterling.  I asked in an interjection who put us into it.  It is given in column 902 as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Little: . . . All these things would seem to suggest that the country is entitled to a statement from the Minister as to his attitude and how he is going to get out of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Mr. McGilligan: Out of what?</P>
      <P>Mr. Little: &mdash;&mdash;the strait-jacket of being attached to sterling.</P>
      <P>Mr. McGilligan: Who put me into it.</P>
      <P>Mr. Little: We did not put you into it.</P>
      <P>Mr. McGilligan: Who did?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then he got off on to the war, that it could not be changed until after the war.  Later I referred to that, and said, as given in column 917, in relation to the Central Bank, that there was a bit of a strait-jacket there.  After an interruption by Deputy Aiken, I said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Is the situation as bad as that? I thought Deputy Little might have given some advice and made known how near this danger of devaluation was to us and what he would do in order to minimise the danger if it came nearer.  I do not know how near the danger is.  I have read the comments made and I know the matter has been the subject of comment among various international gatherings.  I know that there has been a definite attitude, so far as England is concerned, that she will not allow sterling to be devalued. There are certain forces which, in times to come, may make it necessary to allow sterling to be devalued, and then there may be a revaluation of currencies&mdash;possibly, our own included. But that is a matter which <Col N="1743" /> is a considerable way off in the future, thank goodness, and I do not think I should be questioned as to my attitude in a whole variety of circumstances that might arise.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Little, I said, was entitled to ask if we were watchful.  I said that there was watchfulness here.  What I have quoted now is given here as if I said devaluation was going to happen. I never said that, of course.  The Deputy also said that protective action should be taken.  One of these days he will change from his present mood and tell us what protection could have been taken from June until the date in September when devaluation occurred. You cannot change Currency Acts in that time.</P>
    <P>Even if there were a warning of more devaluation a year hence, I doubt if we could get rid of the shackles of the Central Bank Act in that time. Those are circumstances which have to be changed over a number of years and, if there is protective action that might be taken, the Deputy might address me some day on that.  Finally, I am told my forecast was wrong.  I made no forecast.  I expressed certain views and gave certain indications as to why the views were mine.  That is all I said on the matter.</P>

If it is wasteful expenditure, then a great deal of the money which we voted yesterday under the External Affairs Vote, and which we have voted in the past under other votes, is also wasteful expenditure. The position is that nothing has been done about this work on place names and the Minister, after his accession to office, fastened on the point that in fact this commission had not been set up until 1946.  If we were to take the Minister seriously, and most of us do not because he simply makes debating points, then no new development ought ever to be attempted in the sphere of culture or research in respect of the Irish language or anything else. Because some Government at some time in the past had not taken the necessary steps to set up such a commission as this, then that is an argument in the future against ever doing anything in that respect.  Nobody will believe that that argument is anything other than throughly absurd and preposterous. Everybody knows that in every civilised State more and more money is being spent upon cultural work and upon research work and educational work generally.  This Government has advantages under Marshall Aid and in other ways of doing a great deal in that respect.  They boast of what they are doing.  In his first Budget statement the Minister, when announcing his policy of economy and retrenchment was careful to introduce some phrase about cultural matters, and cultural objects.  He said that cultural institutions <Col N="1746" /> would not suffer.  The only reason why the Minister is keeping this commission on in the ridiculous position in which it is at present &mdash; he has not the courage to abolish it completely and merely leaves it there in this idioticstate &mdash; is because it was set up by his predecessors.  I can see no reason why money should be given to other commissions and I can see no reason why the Government should be able to increase very substantially the provision for other commissions of a somewhat similar character and then comealong and say this is wasteful expenditure. If it is wasteful expenditure the Minister should take his courage in both hands and do away with it altogether.  We know what the Minister's attitude is with regard to the Irish language.  I shall deal with that matter on another occasion.  Now, I want to register a protest against this attitude, I want to know whether it is typical and whether it is a general indication of the Government's line of approach with regard to the revival policy of the Irish language and the institutions and movements connected with it.</P>

      <P>It is amazing the amount of heat that can be generated over a small point.  I referred yesterday to the fact that this commission had been set up in 1946.  Let me be more precise about the date now; it was set up on the 24th October, 1946 I used that as an argument in answer to Deputy Donnchadh O Briain who seemed to be getting a bit bothered over what he considered to be a slur on the Irish language.  My attitude is that if the matter was of so little importance that the Government in power from 1932 onwards did nothing about it until the last week of October, 1946, it cannot be said now to be a matter of terrific urgency.  I also said that I was not doing away with the commission. I had it suspended, but the director is still there.  He has an assistant and they are doing certain work in connection with compilation.  I also said that we would have this more definitely looked to when we had a correlated scheme with regard to the development of the language.  Deputy Derrig might reserve the appearance of anger, which <Col N="1747" /> is so very easily produced, until he sees what we propose to do about the language as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to direct the attention of the Minister to the activities of the Valuation Office over the last 12 months particularly.  It will be recalled that, some years ago, the question of a general revaluation in this country was contemplated.  But that question had to be abandoned because it was regarded then as political dynamite.  I am going to submit to the House that, in recent years, the Commissioners of Valuation have, in effect, being trying to bring about what this House has certainly not given legislative sanction to.  A study of the Dáil Order Paper over the last three months gives one an indication that the activities of the Commissioners of Valuation are causing widespread hardship. I know a property in this city where houses of identical character show an increase over the last couple of years of 20 per cent. in valuation. These houses are occupied by artisans and by clerical workers, individuals who, obviously, are not in a position to be burdened with extra taxation in this form.  May I say that the grievance which I complain of is heightened by the fact that electricity charges are anchored, in very many cases, to the valuation of a house.  I want to know if the Minister is in a position to indicate to the House why it is that property of an identical character in one area has shown a variation within the last two or three years, or within the last four or five years, as high as 20 per cent.  On what grounds can that variation be justified?  I submit to the Minister that the results of the activities of the Commissioners of Valuation are certainly inequitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extraordinary thing about it, and this seems parodoxical, is that the commissioners can justify their attitude because of the basis of valuation generally.  The main consideration in <Col N="1751" /> valuations is the letting value of property.  It is true that the letting value of property at the present time is at an enhanced figures.  In fact if the commissioners were to give effect to the law as it now stands you could have fantastic and prohibitive valuations. In effect, what the Commissioners of Valuation are saying is that, while at the present time the letting value of a house is say, £100, they could, instead of putting the figure at £30, make it as high as £70 or £80.  The anomalous position we have at the present time is that the Valuation Commissioners are acting within the law by making these heavy increases in valuation.  I suggest that there is something here which, because of its widespread character and of the undoubted hardship which it is inflicting, calls for a remedy, and for the personal intervention of the Minister himself.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of it which concerns local housing authorities.  We all know that the valuations enter very largely into the fixation of rents.  Here again the operations of the Valuation Commissioners are having very serious effects so far as local authorities are concerned.  I noticed that, in reply to the parliamentary questions which were addressed to him on this subject over the past few months, it was possible for the Minister and quite justifiably to say that these increases in valuation had, in fact, been initiated by the local authorities.  So far as the questions that were addressed to the Minister were concerned, that was so, but I have been in touch with a particular phase of valuations which is outside that category altogether, and that is in regard to the building of new houses.  The only liaison there is between the local authority and the Valuation Office in these cases is that a notification is sent to the Valuation Office that the building of a house is completed, and thereafter, the valuation put on it is within the absolute control of the Commissioners of Valuation. The local authority does not come into it as such.  Therefore, the steep increase of from 20 to 25 per cent. in valuation that has taken place in recent years in the case of houses newly-built is not due to the initiation <Col N="1752" /> of the local authority, but to direct action by the Valuation Commissioners themselves.</P>
    <P>I want to say again that, in my opinion, the system that is in operation at the present time is inequitable. The answer to that may be, why not raise existing valuations and bring them all to the same level.  I certainly am not advocating that, nor do I think any member of the House would advocate any such thing.  I would say that the valuations in, say, Dublin 20 years ago were reasonable, but as I have pointed out they have been moving up steadily from that position in recent years, until at the present time they have reached a stage where, in my opinion, the intervention of the Minister is called for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no control over the Valuation Commissioners.  I can make inquiries and can give the results of those inquiries to the House, but I do not control the Valuation Commissioners.  I would not be entitled to stop their activities except by the introduction of legislation.  I want to stress again that the initiation in connection with revaluations rests with the local authorities, and that it would require a change in the law to have a new system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to a question yesterday, I said that the whole matters had been under review, because undoubtedly there had been a number of complaints in this connection since 1948.  I certainly have been making many inquiries. I said yesterday afternoon that I was having the matter specially attended to, with a view to seeing whether any better system could be adopted and I did not rule out the possibility of amending legislation. Again I want to correct a wrong impressions that is bound to be created by speeches such as we have just heard.  There is no doubt that the volume of complaint in regard to revaluation is growing and it is possible that that may be due to the state of affairs to which Deputy O'Sullivan referred, that you may have two properties adjoining and the rate collector is moved to get the valuation of one of the properties reviewed because some repairs or additions have been <Col N="1753" /> carried out and that property is revised upwards by a good percentage.  That gives a good deal of the picture but it is in the over-all picture I am interested.  I got a return recently and it showed that as between the years 1938 and 1939&mdash;I wanted to get the pre-war years&mdash;the increase in valuation&mdash; I am only speaking of buildings because it is buildings only that matter &mdash;came to 2.3 per cent.  The year 1938 showed a rise over the previous year's level of almost the same extent &mdash; 2.2 per cent.</P>
    <P>The move upwards as a result of revaluations between 1948 and 1949 was 3.8 per cent. and from 1949 to 1950 3.7 per cent.  It should be remembered, however, that there was very little done in the way of revaluing during the years in which the war situation had developed.  It should also be remembered that there has been a very big increase in building in recent years which would itself account for the increase shown in valuation even if there had been no revaluation.  These figures make one conclude that although there is a good deal of clamour about special injustices, there has not been anything like a jump in the general revaluation percentage.  When you compare the pre-war percentages of increase&mdash;2.3 per cent. and 2.2 per cent. &mdash; with the post-war increase of 3.8 per cent., it represents nothing like an approach to a new valuation.  That is all I want to say about the matter.  I have nothing to do with the initiation of these valuations and I have not control over the commissioners who go out to revalue.</P>
    <P>There is one matter to which I want to refer which just shows the point to which this thing can be brought, even to the point of the ludicrous.  A most ingenious gentleman, who decided to move in the matter of revaluation, cut out 414 pages of Thom's Directory and sent it to the commissioners saying that he wanted the valuations of all these properties revised.  I am glad that the City Commissioner decided that was not a proper or legal approach to him and that he would not operate on it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £14,650 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge <Col N="1757" /> which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1951, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Department of the Taoiseach (No. 16 of 1924; No. 40 of 1937; No. 38 of 1938; and No. 24 of 1947).</P>
    <P>A sum of £7,320 has already been granted for the Department of the Taoiseach by means of the Vote on Account which was passed on the 23rd March last.  The sum of £14,650 now asked for is required to complete the total of £21,970 which is the estimated expenditure for the Department in respect of the current financial year.</P>
    <P>The provision in respect of the last financial year was £21,650, so that this year's Estimate shows an increase of £320.  This increase falls entirely under sub-head.  A of the Estimate, namely, the salaries sub-head, and is due to normal increments in pay and to other minor changes in the sub-head.</P>
    <P>Last year in introducing the Estimate for my Department, I referred to some of the reasons which impelled the Government to have the Central Statistics Office transferred to the Department of the Taoiseach and I spoke about the importance of having accurate and reliable statistical data as up to date as possible.  Without comprehensive statistical information the results of economic policy cannot be effectively assessed.  The Government have, therefore, instructed the Central Statistics Office to advance the time schedule and generally to improve official statistics, and have given the office the means to accomplish these ends.  In connection with the setting up of the office, the Minister for Finance and I stressed that the office would be independent.  By placing the office aloof from ordinary departmental administration, the Government were attempting to ensure that the compilers of our national statistics would be given the greatest possible degree of freedom and independence has That principle of independence has been rigidly respected and the office is entirely responsible for the manner in which its work is carried out, and for the thousands of figures which have been prepared during the past year <Col N="1758" /> and which have been published without alteration or delay.</P>
    <P>Irish statistics, and the experts who prepare them, have over the years achieved high repute.  Even with the rapid advance of international statistics standards I am confident that Irish statistics will continue to remain in the front rank.  The office is, however, well aware that its statistics require still further improvement and development and are taking all reasonable steps to achieve those purposes.</P>
    <P>That office is now approaching the completion of its inquiries into national income, national expenditure and related matters during the period 1945 to 1949 and it is hoped that the full results will be published later this year.  I shall have occasion, however to refer in the course of my observations to some of these results.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are probably aware, the ordinary activities of the Central Statistics Office include the day to day recording of trade statistics; the compilation of the various Census returns, reports on agricultural production, yield and output and industrial production; the carrying out of price inquiries; the preparation of the cost of living index number, and so on.</P>
    <P>During the past year the office has speeded up by six months the preparation of the important Census of Industrial Production.  The scope of the quarterly inquiry into industrial production has been extended to include more industries and to provide quarterly statistics of employment, earnings and hours worked in manufacturing industry.  As a result of this it is hoped that it will be possible to provide up-to-date statistics of the volume of output, of output of important individual commodities, of employment and productivity well in advance of the more complete Census of Production figures.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall the introduction of the system of sample passenger card inquiry initiated last year and will be interested to know that this inquiry has been a conspicuous success during its first year.  It was designed principally for the purpose of estimating tourist expenditure by visitors to <Col N="1759" /> this country and Irish tourist expenditure abroad.  It has also yielded valuable information about the true volume of migration to and from Great Britain revealing, for example, that the movement to and from jobs between the two countries is of far greater frequency than had heretofore been known.  On the basis of the inquiry it is estimated that tourist expenditure by visitors to Ireland in 1949 was about £34,000,000 and that Irish tourist expenditure abroad was about £6,000,000, yielding a net figure of £28,000,000.</P>
    <P>The Central Statistics Office is about to embark on a national farm survey for the improvement of statistics of agricultural output and incidentally for those of national income and expenditure. Schemes are being prepared for a census of distribution and for a family budget inquiry.  Vital statistics have been taken over from the Department of Health as from the first of this month, and that Department is in consultation with the office with a view to the substantial improvement in these important statistics.</P>
    <P>A census of population will probably be taken in April, 1951.  Mainly as a result of printing difficulties, only one volume of the Census of 1946 has so far appeared, but Deputies will be aware that the main results of the Census are being published in preliminary form in the <i>Irish Trade Journal and Statistical Bulletin.</i>  I expect that all the volumes of the 1946 Census will be published before the end of the present year.</P>
    <P>Recently, the Central Statistics Office has been strengthened by the return to it of two statisticians who, through the generosity of the Economic Cooperation Administration, have been training in the United States for some time past.  The experience they have obtained will, I have every hope, be a very valuable addition to the resources of skill already possessed by the office and enhance its abilities to carry out the important work with which it has been charged.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Finance, referred briefly in his Budget speech to certain of the statistics of national income and cognate matters <Col N="1760" /> which were then available and, as I have already said, the full statistics will be published in due course in a report which will generally be on the lines of the Special Statistical Survey issued last year.  I should emphasise that the statistics, which I shall now quote, are not quite final and they may differ in some respects from those which will ultimately be published; I do not think, however, that the differences will be material.  The figures which I shall quote for the year 1938 differ somewhat from those printed in the White Paper for the period 1938-44. The reasons for this will be explained in the new publication.</P>
    <P>The national income of 1949 is estimated at £352,000,000 as compared with £338,000,000 in 1948, £323,000,000 in 1947 and £156,000,000 in 1938.  The increase of £196,000,000 between 1938 and 1949 was, of course, due mainly to increases in prices.  The real improvement in the standard of living since before the war has been experienced for the greater part, if not entirely, by the agricultural section of the community where, as it will presently appear, the improvement was most needed.</P>
    <P>In 1949 private savings were about one-tenth of private income and capital investment was considerably in excess of these savings.  This capital formation included replacements, and there is no doubt that there was in it a large element of investment postponed since the years of emergency.  As I have frequently stated, the Government regard as desirable the repatriation of such part of our external assets as may be necessary, in the national interest, to push forward the programme for productive domestic investment.  We cannot, however, regard in a complacent spirit a progressive drawing upon our external assets which must continue unless this country can attain a higher level of savings on current income and greatly increased production. Current savings can only be attained by reducing expenditure on consumption goods.  Production can be increased only by improved efficiency, greater skill and hard work.  At all costs, we must not entertain the delusion that repatriation of external assets is a unique and self-sufficient solution of <Col N="1761" /> our investment problem.  It is not. Leaving aside the considerable difficulties of rapid repatriation of these assets, the fact is that, at the end of 1946, our gross external investments amounted to about £450,000,000 and, in consequence of drawings since then, they cannot now be more than £400,000,000 which though large, is not much more than a year's national income.  A man with only one year's income in the bank may feel himself in a comfortable personal position, but he cannot afford, however much he would like, to entertain exaggerated notions about capital expansion.  In simple terms, we are now spending so much on current goods and services that unremitting attention must be directed to increasing the volume of saving if we are to achieve the level of productive capital investment necessary to raise substantially the real value of the national income and so to provide all sections of the community with a better standard of living.</P>
    <P>We shall also require to give close attention in the future to the nature of these investments.  Of these investments, housing is of high importance and urgency.  Statistics to be published in the next issue of the <i>Irish Trade Journal and Statistical Bulletin will</i> indicate a very considerable improvement in housing during the 20 years period 1926 to 1946, despite the fact that these years bridged the period of the war.  The proportions of the population badly housed, that is, living in dwellings with housing density of more than two persons per room, in the three census years 1926, 1936 and 1946 were respectively 27.2, 22.5 and 16.8.</P>
    <P>Since 1946, after these improvements had been recorded in the statistics, there has been a further prodigious increase in the building of dwelling houses.  In fact, in the first four months of the present year, 3,666 new houses were built under State-aided schemes, just ten times as many as in 1947 and 15 per cent. in excess of the average for the corresponding months of the years 1937-1939, namely, 3,186. The Government is aware that an acute shortage of houses still exists and is determined that this genuine shortage will be made good.  It is also aware <Col N="1762" /> of the vital social implications of the housing shortage, that it is not conducive to an improvement in the marriage rate, which, in our under-populated country, is the lowest in Europe and one of the lowest in the world.</P>
    <P>While determined to spare no effort in pressing forward the housing and hospital building programme and to provide adequate accommodation for all sections of the people, we must constantly keep in mind that the main justification for housing expenditure is a social one.  The very fact that so much of our resources must be directed to the housing campaign must be taken as a warning of the urgent necessity of ensuring that as many as possible of other investment projects are directly productive in the limited economic sense of the term.  To sum up, national savings must be increased and a larger proportion of these savings must be devoted to directly productive capital investment.</P>
    <P>In 1949, income from agriculture and fishing amounted to £100,000,000, as compared with £96,000,000 in 1948, £94,000,000 in 1947, and £35,000,000 in 1938.  These figures represented about 29 per cent. of the national income in the years 1947-1949 as compared with 23 per cent. in 1938.  This increase in the share of agriculturists in the national income was due entirely to the greater rise in agricultural prices compared with the rise in prices generally, since the volume of agricultural production was in 1949 about equal to the pre-war volume.  Since the agricultural community numbers something less than half of the population, the relative improvement in income is a fact of great social importance.  Here, as in certain other countries, agriculture was a depressed industry in the inter-war period.  The average earnings in agriculture in Ireland before the war were extremely low perhead in cash and kind, so that the improvement since the war was from a very low level.  Since the war, a better balance has been struck between the agricultural and non-agricultural sections of the community.</P>
    <P>The acquisition of purchasing power by the agricultural community during the last few years is likely to continue <Col N="1763" /> to have profound effects on the whole economy of the country.  Before the war, when the national income was about £150,000,000, the cash available to the agricultural community from their agricultural activities, after paying for the expenses of their industry, amounted to only about £20,000,000 per annum.  It should be emphasised that this £20,000,000 cash income was derived only from the agricultural activities; in addition, the agricultural community had fairly considerable other receipts earned and unearned by way of emigrants' remittances, old age pensions and other social payments. Since the war, this £20,000,000, the net cash income of the agricultural community, has increased between three and fourfold.  The spending of this increased cash income should have a vitalising effect on the country towns and villages which, except in so far as they participated directly in the considerable industrial development of the period, were in a state of chronic depression before the war.  Many authorities hold that the greatest hope for the economic future of the country lies in the improvement of the agricultural income, especially when this is the result of increased output.  Much remains to be done, since as I have already stated, the latest figures indicate merely a recovery to the pre-war volume of agricultural output, after being as much as 7 to 8 per cent. below pre-war during the war and immediate post-war period.</P>

      <P>I propose to take the second part of the Deputy's question first.  Non-manual workers employed at a rate of remuneration exceeding in value £250 but not exceeding £500 a year were brought within the scope of the Unemployment Insurance Acts by sub-section (1) of Section 25 of the Social Welfare Act, 1948.  The date from which this sub-section operated was fixed as the 4th October, 1948, by Order made by me on the 9th September, 1948.

      <P>The rules and regulations for national schools provide <i>inter alia</i>, that in the case of vested national schools grants may be made by my Department for sinking wells and erecting pumps subject to the condition that an adequate supply of drinking water can be provided at a reasonable cost.

      <P>I am advised that if a water supply is needed for the people of the district as well as for a school the duty of providing a water supply devolves upon the local authority.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>(1) The number of licensed bacon curers is 39.  (2) The average ex-factory price for leanest Wiltshire sides on 29th May was approximately 256/- per cwt.  (3) The prices charged by curers showed increases for a period after 29th May but most curers have now reduced their prices below the figure ruling on that date.  At least one curer has reduced the price for lean Wiltshire mild cure bacon to 240/- per cwt. with proportionately lower prices for medium weight and stout.  My statement here on 28th June in this matter was based on information supplied to me about projected price changes, which I am glad to say have since materialised. These reductions in the wholesale prices warrant a reduction of not less than 3d. per lb. in the retail price of bacon which should not now exceed 3/3 per lb. for best back rashers unsmoked, and which I believe are available for from 3/- to 3/3 per lb. at present from reputable retail provision merchants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>My reference was certainly not to all retailers.  It was to all reputable retailers.  There is a distinction.  I can only confirm the information. <Col N="1774" /> I have now given the Deputy.  I understood his question to refer to an observation made by me to Deputy Childers in the course of whose observations I interjected as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Childers: I should like to ask the Minister how far he has got with his promise to reduce the price of bacon within 48 hours.</P>
      <P>Mr. Dillon: 10/- a cwt. and another 10/- I hope next Monday.</P>
      <P>Mr. Childers: So far as I know, in one town in Ireland, at any rate, the price of bacon has gone up.</P>
      <P>Mr. Dillon: The curers brought it down by 10/- a cwt. and any grocer who has not taken down the price of bacon proportionately is a rogue.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely my point.  I want to know if the Minister satisfied himself before he made that statement that the price to all the retailers in Dublin, was, in fact, reduced on that date.  The reason why I ask that question is that I have documentary evidence to show that in Dublin none of the wholesalers reduced their prices before 30th June&mdash;which was after the date on which the Minister made that statement referring to all retailers.</P>

      <P>May I assure the Deputy that I have no desire to give him a short answer?  However, I cannot undertake the duty of teaching all the retail provision merchants in Dublin their own business.  Their only justification for their existence is that they shall seek out the best market, there purchase the best merchandise at the lowest price and promptly pass on the advantage to their customers.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state with reference to the Collins-Griffith-O'Higgins memorial at Leinster Lawn, and the forecourt of Leinster House, the total cost of the granite work, and the estimated cost of doing this work in (a) precast slabs, and (b) Portland stone; and further, if he will state the various advantages of doing the work in granite rather than in either of the other materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The total cost of the granite work in the Collins-Griffith-O'Higgins Memorial at Leinster Lawn and in the forecourt of Leinster House is £12,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of using precast concrete slabs in the forecourt would have been approximately £1,500 as against £2,600 for granite, but they are <Col N="1778" /> regarded as quite unsuitable for this type of work or for the memorial.</P>
    <P>Portland stone would have been suitable for the shaft of the memorial and the cost would probably have been about the same as granite.  This material would be unsuitable for the pavement surrounding the memorial or for the forecourt and no estimate was made of the cost of using it.</P>
    <P>On artistic and practical grounds granite was selected as the best native material for the memorial.  Native limestone was also considered, but the requisite sizes of stones were not available. Granite, as used for the forecourt is considered to be the most suitable native stone for paving.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">

      <P>As the Dáil was informed on the 28th June last, in reply to a somewhat similar question, I am not yet in a position to say what steps will be taken as regards the restrictive practices alleged in connection with the sale of petrol.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.D. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the considerable increase in petrol consumption in the country, due to the increase in the number of cars and tractors, and the fact that the Motor Traders Association are saying they are not stopping any licences being issued, and the petrol companies are anxious to give these licences if the motor traders will permit them and will not have a boycott on the particular company, will the Minister of the Department undertake the distribution of petrol to areas and villages that are now without supplies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will <Col N="1781" /> give me particulars of the villages that have not supplies, I will have that matter looked into.  I can assure the Deputy and other Deputies that this is a matter of very grave concern.  I should say these restrictive practices are not confined to the motor trade and this matter is under very close consideration. We have got a certain distance with it and I hope we will be able to make more rapid progress, which will enable us to go to the Government with very definite proposals.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot, because the Deputy will appreciate that it is a very difficult matter.  There are restrictive practices which are not confined to the motor or the petrol trades, but extend to many other trades.  They are very wide and, therefore, it takes quite a considerable time to collect the necessary information and have it properly sifted.  I can assure the House that whatever steps the Government may take, there will be no avoidable delay.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the dissatisfaction referred to by the Deputy, nor am I aware that the differential rents scheme will lead to excessive rents being demanded in view of the fact that such rents, while based on ability to pay, will be subject to a fixed maximum rent for each type of dwelling.  The scheme of differential rents gives special concessions to members of the family other than the principal earner by providing that the first 5/- of the incomes of such other members shall be disregarded in the assessment of the combined family income and by limiting the maximum income to be taken into account in such cases to £2 a week.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any evidence in support of the Deputy's contention that the corporation's differential rent scheme will alter considerably the method of preparing the cost-of-living index figures.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the differential rents scheme was adopted by the corporation's housing committee and, in the circumstances, I cannot accept the suggestion made in the last part of the Deputy's question.</P>

Will the Minister not agree, in regard to the administration of that scheme in Offaly, that the giving of an average loan of less than 50 per cent. is not effectively putting the scheme into operation?</P>

      <P>Following on the receipt of 11 tenders, the Kerry County Council, at a meeting held in April last, passed a resolution recommending the acceptance of a tender which was not the lowest, but at a further meeting held on the 12th ultimo, the council decided to readvertise for tenders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that no money has been provided <Col N="1789" /> in the Estimate would not preclude the council from proceeding with the preparation of major works, as it it is unlikely that any expenditure in respect of them would come in course of discharge in the present financial year.  I shall continue to impress on the local authority the desirability of determining a reasonable programme of such works for execution over a period of two or three years and of concentrating on the bringing of the programme so determined to fruition. Waterville sewerage scheme is in course of preparation and the county council have submitted proposals for the appointment of consultants to prepare water supply schemes at Dungeagan, Ballinskelligs, Farranfore, Milltown, Annascaul, Ballyheighe, Fenit, Newtownsandes and Tarbert, as well as sewerage schemes for Annascaul, Ballyheighe, Ballybunion, Ballylongford, Brosna, Sneem, Milltown and Rathmore.  The Department has suggested that the appointments should be limited to the schemes likely to be carried out within a period of two to three years and it is understood that the manager is reconsidering the matter accordingly.</P>

The planning of the hospital had reached sketch design stage and the matter of revision of the sketch design, on the basis of the suggested economies, is now one for the local authority's architect.  When these proposals are received in my Department, they will be examined as expeditiously as possible but I am not in a position at this stage to give any indication as to when work on the hospital will commence.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the extent of the accommodation available for mental defectives falls far short of what is desirable.  In the seven years hospital building programme, provision is made for accommodation for an additional 630 males.  This was the maximum number for which I felt justified in making provision, having regard to the competing claims for increased and improved accommodation in general hospitals for acute surgical and medical cases, in maternity hospitals for maternity cases and for the neonatal care of infants, in sanatoria in the interests of curtailing the spread of tuberculosis and the treatment of persons already suffering from it, in mental hospitals in the interests of providing an improved standard of treatment for mental patients, as well as a number of other very desirable projects; but I feel that the provision I have mentioned to cater for additional mental defectiveness should go a considerable distance towards relieving the situation.</P>

      <P>In 1949, the contribution of industry to the national income was about 20 per cent., distribution and transport about 16 per cent. and all other activities (public authorities, professional and personal services, personal rent, net income from abroad, etc.) was about 36 per cent.  With regard to the proportions borne by employees remuneration on the one hand and profits, rents, etc., on the other, it will be convenient to consider these items in relation to non-agricultural income produced at home, i.e. excluding net receipts from abroad.  On this basis, wages and salaries represented about 67 per cent. of non-agricultural income produced at home in 1949, as compared with 67 per cent. in 1948, 64 per cent. in 1947 and 62 per cent. in 1938.  Thus the share of employees remuneration in non-agricultural income has increased since before the war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisional index for the year 1949 of the volume of production, (taking the base 1938 as equivalent to 100), of industries producing transportable goods was 142.9.  The annual index for 1948 was 132.0 and 120.5 for 1947.  These figures represent an increase in the volume of production of 18.6 per cent. between 1947 and 1949 and an increase of 8.3 per cent. between 1948 and 1949.  This remarkable growth has since continued.  In fact, the quarterly index for the first three months of 1950, which was 150.4 shows an increase of 14.6 per cent. over the figure of 131.2 for the corresponding period in 1949.  It is a tribute <Col N="1797" /> to all concerned in industry in this country that, after the difficulties of the war period when there was a decline in volume of output of about 20 per cent. as compared with pre-war, there should have been such an extraordinary recovery.</P>
    <P>The increase in the index of the volume of production have, of course, been accompanied by an increase in the total number of persons engaged in industries covered by the Census of Industrial Production from 166,000 in 1938 to an estimated total of 206,000 in 1949.  All this growth has, in effect, taken place since 1946, when the total of 167,000 was almost at the pre-war level.  In 1947 the volume of output per wage-earner was 7.4 per cent. above the pre-war level in the case of transportable goods industries and 5.7 per cent. up in the case of all industries.  The 1948 figures show a further rise, the index for transportable goods industries being 12.6 per cent. and that for all industries and services 11.2 per cent. above pre-war.  While great credit is due to Irish industrialists and Irish workers for such a considerable advance in so short a period, it is well to remember that these figures show that, in relation to the whole period since before the war, the increase represents a growth in industrial production of only about 1 per cent. per annum.  In an expanding economy this is not, by international standards, an altogether impressive achievement and there should be no complacency among either employers or employees, particularly since an important contributory cause was improved equipment and improved availability of materials of suitable quality after the stringencies of the war years. A further great effort is needed in the industrial field, not only to increase production but to make it more efficient. Big improvements are called for in organisation of industry, in management skill, in improved standards of work by employees, all of which will contribute to improve industrial efficiency. In pursuit of these aims, we hope to secure some particularly useful help and advice from the Industrial Development Authority and from the Economic Co-operation Administration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1798" /> It must be emphasised that these figures for productivity which I have given are based on the data provided by the Census of Industrial Production returns and that these are far from ideal for such a purpose.  They are useful as a rough measurement but special inquiries in the nature of costings for individual industries would be necessary to produce accurate measurements of this very difficult concept.</P>
    <P>It is too often assumed that a growth in the physical output per worker will of necessity produce an equal increase in the amount available for distribution between the factors of production. In fact, however, there has been since pre-war a fairly considerable decrease in the net output of industry when expressed as a percentage of gross output. In 1938 in the industries producing transportable goods net output was 34.1 per cent. of gross output, in 1947 it was 31.1 per cent. and 30.7 per cent. in 1948.  For all industries and services between 1938 and 1948, gross output increased in value by 136 per cent. while net output increased by 110 per cent.  There is accordingly, as compared with pre-war, relatively less for everybody concerned in the gross output.</P>
    <P>Net output represents the value added by processing to the materials of industries and is the sum available for distribution in wages, salaries, profits and other miscellaneous costs.  While between 1938 and 1948 the total output increased by 110 per cent., wages and salaries increased by 116 per cent., profits and miscellaneous costs having increased by 102 per cent.  The actual increased in wages was 120 per cent. and in salaries 98 per cent.  Expressed otherwise, wages and salaries constituted a somewhat larger proportion of the net output in 1948 than in 1938, namely, about 61 per cent. as compared with 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>Agriculture too, has shown a striking and encouraging improvement.  From its very nature agricultural production is slow both in its rise and fall.  Due to the efforts of our farmers, despits all the wartime shortages of fertilisers, equipment and so on, the volume of gross agricultural output never fell <Col N="1799" /> more than 7 per cent. below the 1938-39 level during the war years.  Last year the gross volume of agricultural output was back to the pre-war level and the net output volume showed a gain of 2.2 per cent. over 1938-39.</P>
    <P>While the increase in industrial production has been accompanied by an increase in the numbers engaged, the pre-war level of agricultural production has been attained despite a fairly considerable fall in the numbers of workers in agriculture.  Much though this is to be regretted, it must not be forgotten that the implication is that a smaller number engaged in agriculture have had a larger share in the return.  In this context it must be emphasised that before the war there was chronic underemployment on Irish farms.</P>
    <P>If we are to succeed in stemming the tide of emigration, we must do so by providing work for our people at home.  Not only must there be a further considerable increase in industrial employment but the output of agriculture must rise too.  Our industries are unfortunately very largely dependent on the import of raw materials and these we must pay for.  It is, of course, quite legitimate to use some of our accumulated sterling assets to purchase capital equipment and materials for capital development but it would be questionable policy deliberately to use them for the current purchases of other raw materials.  We must, therefore, if our industry is to develop, expand our exports to buy the increased quantities of materials needed.  Improved agricultural production and exports are therefore a fundamental need of our economy not only for the expansion of the home market but also to provide the wherewithal to enable our industry to continue to forge ahead as it has been doing in the recent past and continues to do.</P>
    <P>The transfer from agriculture to non-agricultural employment within the State is proceeding at a strikingly rapid rate.  In this connection I would like to indicate in a very general way the extent of the change in the distribution of the working population between 1936 and 1946 as shown by the <Col N="1800" /> Census of Population.  Fairly detailed statistics of the distribution of the population at work will be published in the September issue of the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> and <i>Statistical Bulletin.</i> The Census statistics show that between 1936 and 1946 the whole population at work declined slightly from 1,235,000 to 1,228,000, the number in agriculture falling from 609,000 to 572,000, the number in industry increased from 205,000 to 212,000, and the number in other employments (distribution, transport services, public services, etc.) increased from 421,000 to 444,000.  These changes are highly significant but far less so than the changes which have been occurring during the last four years.  Since 1946, the Census year, it is roughly estimated that the number at work in agriculture has fallen by a further 50,000 while the number in industry has increased by 40,000 and the number in other employments has increased by 20,000, the overall increase being 10,000. The percentage of the working population in agriculture is now but 42 per cent. of the total as compared with 49 per cent. in 1936, the proportions in industry 20 per cent. as compared with 17 per cent. in 1936 and the proportions in other employments 38 per cent. as compared with 34 per cent. in 1936.  Though agricultural output has been increasing during the last four years, the decline in the agricultural population is to be deplored, but there it is.  It would be far better if a much greater increase in agricultural output could be obtained, the workers remaining on the land.  The endemic underemployment in agriculture before the war in now taking its toll.  It is highly significant that between 1936 and 1946 the numbers of &ldquo;relatives assisting farmers&rdquo; declined by 41,000 accounting for the total decline in the agricultural section of the national economy.  This is the class which was formerly underemployed, and which is now becoming absorbed in productive industrial employment.</P>
    <P>A measure of the magnitude of the problem facing the country in trying to lessen, if not to stop, emigration is that, despite the fact that the agricultural population was never so prosperous <Col N="1801" /> as it is now and non-agricultural employment and earnings were higher than ever before, emigration continues. In the four years 1946 to 1949 and in the 12 months ended May of this year, the net passenger balances by sea (probably the best indication of the volume of net emigration) were as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>I do not wish to make political capital from the fact that net emigration has shown some tendency to decrease in 1949-1950.  This problem is not only the responsibility of the Government but of the Oireachtas and the country. There is no guarantee that the recent decline will continue.  One can only hope that potential emigrants in the future will consider their personal interest and the interest of their country, and that the favourable economic environment will have the desirable psychological effect of keeping them at home in well-paid employment. In this connection, however, I should like to repeat what I have already said, that since 1946 the number of persons engaged in non-agricultural employment has increased by the remarkable figure of 60,000.</P>
    <P>A guiding rule in Government policy has been and continues to be the desirability of maintaining a satisfactory equilibrium in the balance of payments. This must not be taken to mean that all other considerations must be sacrificed to achieve a strict balance between the values of exports and imports. It does mean, however, that in formulating economic policy the Government gives careful consideration to the possible effects on that policy of both the balance of trade and the balance of payments.  There are times when a temporary disequilibrium in the balance of payments is fully justified. There are times when the implementation of a particular economic policy requires the conscious creation of a deficit in the balance of payments. <Col N="1802" /> Such a deficit is inevitable, for instance, if a policy of repatriation of foreign assets is being undertaken. What is necessary, however, is to ensure that fluctuations in the balance of payments are not left to the blind arbitrament of chance.</P>
    <P>In 1947 the deficit in the balance of trade was £91.8 millions; in 1948 the deficit in the balance of trade was £87 millions; in 1949 it had fallen to £69.3 millions.  The substantial reductions achieved over these years in the unfavourable balance was in the main due to a very substantial increase in exports.  The comparatively high level of imports in each of the years 1947-1948, inclusive, as compared with pre-war years, was due mainly to the general increase in prices.  It was also partly due to the better availability of supplies which permitted considerable restocking in the home market to meet arrears of demands since the shortages of the war years.</P>
    <P>One of the healthiest features of our economy since 1947 has, however, been the striking increase in exports.  In 1947, the value of exports and reexports was £39.5 millions; in 1949, the figure had risen to £60.5 millions. The main items responsible for this great increase in the value of exports during 1949 were cattle and beef, eggs, poultry, raw wool, chocolate crumb, ropes, jams, marmalades, beer, whiskey, paper and cardboard.</P>
    <P>In 1949, the volume of imports was 27 per cent. over the 1938 volume; the value of these imports was about three times the corresponding figure for 1938. The value of exports in 1949 was two and a half times the pre-war level, but the volume in 1949 was 90 per cent. of the pre-war level.  The significance of this encouraging feature in our trade position is underlined by the fact that the volume of exports in 1949 increased by about 20 per cent. over 1948.</P>
    <P>In 1948 the import price index was 259 as compared with 100 in 1938.  In 1949, despite devaluation, it had fallen to 248.  In 1948, the export price index was 273; in 1949, it rose to 279.</P>
    <P>For the first five months of 1950 our imports have shown an increase in value of £9.9 millions (or of 18 per cent.) as compared with the corresponding period last year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1803" /> The increase in volume has been about 11 per cent. and the remainder of the rise is attributable to price increases. The total value of our exports for January-May, 1950 is £1.6 million greater than for January-May, 1949, an increase of about 7 per cent.  In the case of exports the increase in volume was about 6 per cent. and the rise due to prices relatively small.</P>
    <P>The question of the composition of our imports is just as important as that of their total value or volume.  In 1938, out of a total of £41.4 million, we imported £2.9 million worth of producers' capital goods ready for use or 7.0 per cent. of all imports.  In 1949 such capital imports totalled £13.5 million or 10.4 per cent. of all imports. It is very difficult to classify the materials imported for industry as to whether they are required for the production of capital or of consumers' goods.  An attempt has, however, been made to do so and, using the same basis in 1938 and in 1949, it is estimated that the total value of the imports of capital goods ready for use and of materials for home produced capital goods was £9.1 million in 1938 and £33.5 million in 1949.  Such imports constituted 22.0 per cent. of the total in 1938 and 25.8 per cent. in 1949.  The corresponding percentages for imports in the first four months of 1949 and 1950 have been estimated as 25.8 and 25.5 respectively.</P>
    <P>It is of the utmost importance to realise that in a year such as 1949 when we drew on our accumulated sterling balances to the extent of somewhat less than £10,000,000, we at the same time imported £13,500,000 worth of capital goods ready for use as well as about another £20,000,000 worth of material for the production of capital goods at home.  Thus, by far the greater portion of these capital imports were financed by our earnings on current accounts.</P>
    <P>The deficits in the balance of payments in 1947 and 1948 amounted respectively to £30,000,000 and £20,000,000. These were financed by drawing upon external assets and the aggregate drawing represented about one-third of the accumulation of sterling assets <Col N="1804" /> during the preceding seven years when current receipts could not be fully spent owing to the acute difficulty in obtaining supplies from abroad.  Notwithstanding higher imports in 1948, the over-all deficit on current account declined by £10,000,000 as compared with 1947 as a result of higher invisible earnings as well as increased exports. In 1949 the balance of payments was brought considerably nearer full equilibrium, the provisional Estimate showing a deficit of approximately £10,000, probably less than £10,000 when final figures are available.  This position has been achieved mainly through increased exports.</P>
    <P>The problem of the deficit in the balance of payments with the dollar countries, which had continued since the war to overshadow all the other economic problems of the sterling area, was greatly aggravated during the early part of 1949 by a temporary falling-off in U.S. purchases of sterling area materials, at the very time that imports from North America by the members of the sterling group were increasing. Throughout the first eight months of 1949 the position of sterling continued to be critical.  Certain sterling area countries curtailed imports from dollar sources.  But the obvious inadequacy of that step alone, the withholding of foreign orders for British and other sterling goods in the expectation of an alteration in exchange rates, and, to a lesser extent, concern over the volume of indirect transactions financed in open markets through so-called &ldquo;cheap sterling&rdquo;, all contributed to the announcement by the British Government in September, 1949, of a 30 per cent devaluation of the £ in terms of dollars. Britain's step in devaluing was promptly followed by similar action on the part of all the other countries of the sterling area except Pakistan, and by a 9 per cent. cut in the Canadian dollar.  The great importance of this group of countries in world trade soon forced most of the countries of Western Europe and several overseas countries to devalue their currencies as well.</P>
    <P>Following devaluation, the value of exports to countries that did not devalue required to be increased by 44 per cent. in terms of Irish currency, <Col N="1805" /> in order to earn the same amount of foreign exchange as before.  The same was true, in a modified degree, in the case of exports to those countries which devalued only partially with reference to sterling.  As Irish exports go mainly to Britain and other countries which also devalued their currencies, the effect on our export trade of the alteration in the exchange rate of the £ could not be appreciable. In the case of Britain, devaluation of the £ was calculated to stimulate larger sales to the Western Hemisphere through a reduction in the dollar prices of British goods.  In Ireland's case, the prospect of developing exports to the United States is not likely to be influenced immediately to any substantial extent by devaluation because the types of products which Ireland has available for export are not, in general, such as to command a sizeable market in the United States. Similar considerations apply in the case of Canada, to which exports at present are small.</P>
    <P>Belgium and Switzerland are such highly competitive markets by reason of their liberal import régimes, that they are unlikely to provide scope for any large expansion in our exports of manufactured goods, as we have to compete in these and other markets with the many countries which have devalued their currencies to the same extent as ourselves.</P>
    <P>In view of the many unpredictable factors involved, it is extremely difficult to give a considered opinion on the probable long-term effects of devaluation on trade and prices.  One of the immediate and automatic effects was, of course, that imports from dollar sources were rendered 44 per cent. dearer in terms of Irish currency than previously.  However, apart from the mechanical adjustments in the relationship between the two price series, the ultimate effect of devaluation must inevitably be an increase in sterling prices and a decrease in dollar prices.  Prices of various commodities in the U.S.A. have already shown reductions, by reason of a certain fall in demand and for other causes.  The import prices of raw materials and food stuffs originating in the dollar area have risen by widely <Col N="1806" /> varying margins, ranging up to the full extent of 44 per cent.</P>
    <P>Irish import prices have risen on average by 2 per cent and wholesale prices by 1 per cent. between January and May, 1950.  The index number of retail prices at mid-May, 1950 (Base: mid-August, 1947 = 100) was 102.  Agricultural prices dropped seasonally by 1 per cent. during that period.  The terms of trade, that is, the ratio of the export price index to the import price index remains favourable to this country, on the 1938 basis of exchange.</P>
    <P>The comparative stability of Irish prices since devaluation is probably due to the fact that supplies of many commodities have been obtained at pre-devaluation rates from producers' stocks, and, in particular, from forward purchases in Britain.  The comparative steadiness of British export prices, which increased by about 5 per cent. between April, 1949, and April, 1950, is reflected in the relatively small increase in Irish import prices.</P>
    <P>The increases in the British index numbers for import, wholesale and retail prices between April, 1949, and April, 1950, have been relatively much greater than in the corresponding Irish price index numbers.  During this period, British import prices rose by 13 per cent., wholesale prices by 10 per cent. and retail prices by 4.6 per cent. Significantly, the rise in British import and wholesale prices represents mainly increases in costs of raw materials and of goods in which the passage of raw materials to the finished article is rapid.  A second phase is now in process of completion, in which the substantial increase in the cost of raw materials since devaluation (prices of imports have risen on average by over 25 per cent.) is spreading its effect throughout the whole structure of industrial costs and prices.  The effects of this second phase, in so far as this country is concerned, are likely to be reflected in an advance in Irish import prices in future months.  Owing to the relatively high ratio which imports bear to the total supply of goods and services, an increase in import prices would undoubtedly be reflected in both wholesale and retail prices generally.</P>
    <P>Heretofore Ireland's traditional products <Col N="1807" /> have not been such as to command a significant market in North America and even yet the contribution which commodity exports can make to increasing our dollar earnings is of very limited dimensions.  The most valuable part which Ireland can play, and is playing towards closing the European dollar gap consists in exporting to the other member countries of the O.E.E.C. the commodities, mainly animal products, food and drink, which these countries would otherwise have to obtain from dollar sources.  Energetic efforts are nevertheless being made to increase Ireland's direct exports of commodities and services to North America.  The most anxious attention is being given to the tourist industry, our most important potential source of dollar income, and the recent establishment of the Dollar Exports Advisory Committee is evidence that the Government will spare no effort to devise the most effective means of expanding the volume of our commodity exports to dollar countries. During the past twelve months steps have been taken to exhibit samples of Irish goods in North America.  There was an exhibition of Irish products in a large store in Boston in the early part of 1949, and a similar exhibition in New York towards the end of last year.  The Government have decided to participate in an international trade fair to be held in Chicago in next month and are providing financial assistance to enable Irish firms to take part.</P>
    <P>The Government have been giving very active attention to the development of an export trade generally in Irish manufactured goods.  In negotiations which have led to the conclusion of trade agreements, not merely with Great Britain, but with France, Western Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden, the greatest importance has been attached to the necessity for securing entry to the markets of these countries for the products of Irish industry. These trade agreements, by securing the right of entry for Irish goods, enable our industrialists to plan ahead with confidence in the knowledge that for a wide range of goods a market is available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1808" /> The 1948 Trade Agreement with France was renewed last year.  So too was the agreement with Sweden. A very satisfactory trade agreement with Western Germany has been signed this week, which guarantees a considerable increase in the volume of trade between Ireland and Germany for the next 12 months.  Preliminary arrangements are at present being made for the extension of other trade agreements or for the negotiation of new ones.</P>
    <P>During the past 12 months unemployment has continued to decline.  The percentage of persons insured under the Employment Insurance Acts who were registered as unemployed averaged 9.0 in the year 1949 as compared with 9.4 in 1948, 9.3 in 1947 and 15.0 in 1938.  In the first six months of 1950 the figure averaged 8.7 per cent., substantially below the 10.3 per cent. in the corresponding period last year.  Actually the 6.6 per cent. for June, 1950, is by far the lowest on record.  These percentages cover the whole State.  In cities and towns, where unemployment is usually more severe in its incidence than in rural districts, where it is sometimes mitigated by earnings in kind, the number in the period January to May averaged 28,000 in 1950, 32,000 in 1949 and 43,000 in 1938.  The decline in actual numbers must be considered against the background of a substantial increase in the working population to which reference has already been made. The difference in trend as between skilled and unskilled reflects, of course, the present great demand for skilled industrial workers.</P>
    <P>While, in general, this country cannot be regarded yet as enjoying a condition of full employment, there are serious shortages of skilled labour and, for this reason, the Government has been campaigning to induce skilled workers to return from Great Britain to assist in the industrial expansion of their homeland.  On this point Deputies will be interested to know that between January, 1939, and January, 1950, while the number of unskilled industrial workers unemployed declined by 24 per cent., the number of skilled workers unemployed declined by much more, namely 52 per cent.  Between January, 1949, and January, 1950, the <Col N="1809" /> percentage declines in unemployment were respectively seven and 19 for the unskilled and skilled unemployed.</P>
    <P>Having presented the House with a brief and necessarily sketchy survey of the various sections of the country's economic activities, I should now like to refer in a general way to the economic policy of the Government.  There has been an attempt in some quarters to suggest that the form of this year's Budget and the financial policy underlying it represented a radical departure from the financial policy enunciated by members of the Government during the first year of its existence. I think it is not merely my right but my responsibility to express a comment on these suggestions.</P>
    <P>In my first public statement as Taoiseach in a broadcast on the 24th February, 1948, I summarised as follows the economic policy which the Government would pursue:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In existing circumstances efforts must be concentrated on measures to increase the national income so as to provide within the limits of our resources for adequate health and social services; so as, within the shortest possible time, to increase agricultural and industrial production and thereby provide some hope of easing the pressing burden of the high cost of living.  Our export trade must be increased so as to lessen the serious gap between the volume of exports and imports which is causing disorder in our balance of payments. The real wealth of the nation must be increased.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It will, I think, be admitted from the statistical evidence I have given the House that many of these aims have been achieved.</P>
    <P>Speaking in Dublin on the 26th May, 1948, in an address to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have stressed the necessity for saving.  But having done so it is necessary to give equal emphasis to the necessity for productive investment of savings.  It will be generally agreed that this country has for many decades been suffering from chronic under-investment. . . .  It can scarcely be questioned that our <Col N="1810" /> national income per head is far too low for a country so rich as ours which has the potential to be very much richer.  Unless national capital is increased, there is no hope for any real increase in the national income. . . . There is no reason why this country, which is comparatively under-developed, should be satisfied with a normal rate of increase in national income.  We should aim at a rate of increase much above the normal, and the Government is determined to use every effort to secure the acceptance of that which must be regarded as a fundamental truth of Irish economics.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These observations were made, I repeat over two years ago.</P>
    <P>The Government have been using every effort during the past two and a half years to secure the acceptance of the truth contained in these observations by encouraging productive investment and by creating conditions favourable to productive investment.</P>
    <P>Speaking in this House last July, in the course of introducing the Estimate for my Department&mdash;Dáil Debates. Vol. 117, No. 16, col. 1368&mdash;I repeated that the policy of providing productive work and thereby increasing the wealth of the nation was the underlying principle of all Government policy.  I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That policy is indicated by the high level of capital expenditure which is provided in the Budget this year.  Most people regard the annual Budget which is introduced to this House as something which either imposes taxation or which they hope will decrease taxation.  That portion of the Budget which deals with taxation, with the housekeeping element in our country's affairs, in fact, only brings within its scope something like one-fourth of the country's economic activities.  That portion of the Budget is important in itself.  You might refer to it as the budget of expenses, the housekeeping portion. However, to get a comprehensive over-all picture of our national economy and activities, you must look at the really important portion of the Budget which deals with the employment <Col N="1811" /> of public moneys, the capital schemes and capital expenditure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it will be agreed from these extracts and from other statements I have made on the Government's economic policy since I assumed office, that the principle of large-scale capital investment has been, from the beginning, a most important feature of Government policy.  The recent Budget did not introduce that principle for the first time.  The form of the recent Budget and the form of the Estimates for the current financial year merely presented that principle in a manner which made it perfectly clear to every member of the public that, in practice as well as in theory, the Government's economic policy was founded on the principle that, in a modern State which aims at providing productive employment for its citizens and for its national resources, budgetary policy must be based on the national income as a whole and not on the limited sector of that national income which enters into what might be called the ordinary current or housekeeping Budget.</P>
    <P>The size of the national income is the only real indicator of economic development. Increases in productivity and increments in national income combine to provide a dividend of progress in an expanding economy.  Only through an expanding economy can we provide the better living standards for our people which must be the ultimate aim of all Government policy.  It will be generally agreed by people who accept this principle that the dual Budget system which we have now adopted is the best way of indicating clearly to our people the measures which are being devised to reap, through increases in national income, the dividend of progress to which I have referred.  In this way alone can policy be framed so to achieve such a level of productive national activity that full employment may become a reality and avoidable emigration unnecessary. Emigration and under-employment have been endemic in this country for so long that the disease cannot be extirpated overnight.  <i>Laissez-faire</i> methods will not provide a cure; only <Col N="1812" /> the deliberate creation of satisfactory social and economic conditions will eliminate it.  Much has been achieved to reduce unemployment and the work is going on.  Throughout the world, chronic unemployment has become in this century the greatest threat to free institutions.  We are convinced that only by vigorously pursuing the policy of capital investment upon which we have embarked can Irish democracy survive the requirements of this century and serve the greatest good of a people whose traditional way of life has been built on thrifty enterprise and personal effort.</P>
    <P>We want to encourage enterprise from employers and from workers, from local bodies, chambers of commerce, vocational groups and trade unions. We want to stimulate a spirit of local initiative and inculcate a greater sense of responsibility in our people.  Our economic policy has been aimed at creating conditions in which this progress by the community may be possible. To maintain a high level of employment of men and national resources is more than a mere political expedient.  It is an essential condition of democratic survival.  Since introducing the Budgetary policy about which I have been speaking, members of the Government have invited constructive criticism from all sections of the people and from all sides of this House.  We welcome constructive criticism which may have the effect of improving the plans we are putting into operation.  I regret that very little constructive criticism has been offered by members of the Opposition, but such as has been offered suggests that, instead of pursuing an expansionist policy at present, the Government should restrain its borrowing for capital investment to the minimum, so that resources might be available to meet a cyclic depression which pessimistic prophets foresee.  This attitude was summed up by the statement that we were &ldquo;using resources that might be needed for use when depression and deflation came&rdquo;.  The reference is to the Leader of the Opposition, Volume 121, No. 3, column 391, of the Official Reports.  This attitude displays a misunderstanding of the economic <Col N="1813" /> policy which we are pursuing and ignores the economic realities of the external world.  This country has not been affected to any extent by cyclic depressions.  Our problem is one of continued under-unemployment of natural resources.  We do not have to wait for a world depression before having to mobilise our resources by borrowing for the purpose of maintaining a high level of employment.  Private investment alone is not sufficient to maintain in Ireland a high level of employment.</P>
    <P>Ever since the formation of the State, throughout the terms of office of successive Governments there has been a high level of unemployment, a high volume of unemployment, a high volume of emigration and a great part of our land inadequately developed or left unfertile.  In circumstances such as these, it is the sheerest mockery of economic theory to suggest that no drastic action should be taken to improve the conditions of our economy until such time as a chronic depression descends upon Europe.  In circumstances such as exist in Ireland, with men and natural resources unemployed, the employment of these idle resources must be secured through investment which, if it cannot come from private effort, must be supplied by the State.  This country is not materially affected by cyclic depressions after the manner of complex industrial societies where there are great fluctuations in demand.  Our problem is not an acute depression but a constant, long-sustained level of undeveloped and unemployed resources.  We do not have to import a chronic depression before taking action.  The level of our unemployment and emigration during the past quarter of a century is ample testimony that in a very real sense some pernicious economic illness has in the past held the Irish economy in its paralysing grip.</P>
    <P>It has been observed that the policy which we are pursuing involves a danger of inflation.  The Minister for Finance has gone to great care to point out the risks of inflation which exist in the present situation.  The fact, however, that the danger or the risk of inflation exists is quite a different thing from the actuality of inflation. <Col N="1814" /> As mortals, we all face the risk or danger of sudden death, but we do not have to act as if sudden death were already upon us and the risk and fear were actualities.  To refuse to take a risk in a good cause is a sorry admission of feeble timidity, particularly when, as in the present context, there is so much more to justify the effort than the comforting thought that in the long run we will all be dead.</P>
    <P>Nor is there any truth or any substance in the suggestion that the capital investment programme involves the use for the benefit of the community of more resources than it can afford.  It is perfectly evident that there are resources of men and material available for productive use and I am sure most members of the House will agree that what is physically possible is financially possible.  I do not say it is always desirable.  The danger of inflation becomes imminent only when an attempt is made by financial means to achieve that which is physically impossible. We are a long way from that point in this country and I can assure you that that is an experiment which this Government will never undertake &mdash;in times of peace, at any rate.</P>
    <P>It has become the fashion in some quarters to criticise in a sweeping way the general policy of the capital investment programme and to criticise vaguely the schemes covered by that policy.  Such criticism is valueless.  If critics can point to the undesirability of executing any specific scheme as a capital investment project they are being helpful.  But if they condemn in mere general terms, without indicating which scheme they would reject, their criticism becomes merely irresponsible. In this House, this afternoon, the Minister for Finance repeated the challenge to the Opposition to give him details of any of the £12,000,000, of the projects for capital expenditure, which are specifically stated in the Book of Estimates, to which they object, and he will deal with their objections.  As a feature of this irresponsible criticism I would refer to a statement made on one or two occasions to the effect that the national debt of this country has increased by 50 per cent. in the <Col N="1815" /> past few years.  The real position is quite otherwise.  In March, 1950, the gross liabilities of the State amounted to £157.3 millions of which over £21,000,000 represents the liquid proceeds of the Marshall Aid Fund, which are available for use and which are being used for the benefit of the community. The gross national assets of the State amounted to £43.9 millions in 1947.  On the 31st March of this year they had increased by £45,000,000 to a figure of £88,000,000.  In speaking of the national debt it is necessary to consider both sides of the national balance sheet; to take both national liabilities and national assets in conjunction to get a clear picture of the true national debt position.  When this is done it is easy to appreciate the nonsense of the suggestion that the national debt of the State has increased by 50 per cent. in the past few years.</P>
    <P>Speaking to Clonmel Chamber of Commerce on the 24th April of last year I made a reference to public debt which I think I should repeat here.  It is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is a close analogy between the national debt and the debt of a private corporation.  A private corporation, like the nation, does not expect to die.  A corporation debt is treated in the balance sheet as the counterpart to the plant and equipment and other assets that the debt represents. An increase in outstanding debt is regarded by the directors as the counterpart of expenses of equipment and plant undertaken to deal with an increased volume of business. That firm, therefore, is debt-free only when it is bankrupt.  No accountant would be so absurd as to report to his directors a deficit of £9,000 in a year in which his business earned a profit of £1,000 and in which the firm was able to spend £10,000 on building a new factory.  Yet that is precisely the mistake made when speaking of a national deficit resulting from capital investment by the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The aim of the Government's economic policy is to secure a more buoyant and expanding national income, which will, in real terms, increase substantially the <Col N="1816" /> standard of living of our people and solve the problems of emigration and unemployment.  The up-to-date statistics which I have quoted indicate the progress which has been made and which is being made to that end.  The Government will spare no effort to accelerate that progress.  For far too long Ireland has been a country of unrealised social and economic potentialities.</P>
    <P>Dealing with this Estimate last year, I stated that it gave an opportunity to Deputies to look at the over-all picture. In the course of the discussion on Estimates for individual Ministers, Deputies had an opportunity of dealing with the details of Government expenditure and Government policy.  This Estimate gives an opportunity for dealing with over-all Government policy and of having a look at the over-all picture.</P>
    <P>Although, this year, the picture must be looked at in the rather more sombre background of the present international scene, nevertheless, some of the tints in the picture to which I referred last year as being bright are brighter still this year.  Some of the tints which were grey last year are brighter this year.  There are still some dark spots but, looking at the picture as a whole, I think we have solid grounds for a reasonable satisfaction as to what has been achieved and have considerable justification for prudent confidence in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration. When I was listening to the first portion of the Taoiseach's statement I made up my mind that I would begin by complimenting him on the refreshing change from the flamboyant statements to which we have become accustomed from the opposite benches to a sober statement of fact. We could not possibly digest all the figures and see the implications of the figures which he gave in the rather long statistical survey of the economic position of the country.  I was about to suggest that on occasions like this it would be desirable, if he wished any properly informed discussion upon the figures, that he would supply them to <Col N="1817" /> us in bulletin form so that, before the debate, we could study them, see their implications and ask ourselves what is their real significance.  I do not think anybody who listened to the reading of these figures could have grasped them so completely or even written them down, so as to use them properly in the debate.  There was not, however, anything astonishing in the picture that was revealed by the figures in so far as we could grasp them from the mere listening to them.  Most of us have been informed already in regard to the figure of the national income and the figure representing our external assets.  We have learned from statements made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the progress in industrial production and in employment in industry, and so forth.  Therefore, in so far as one can comprehend the statement in general, it did not reveal anything which, I think, was not already known to the members of this House.  At the same time I do not say that a close study of the figures, which will be possible when we see them in printed form, will not reveal aspects which do not appear at first sight. Before I leave the question of statistics I should like to say that I am very glad that we got a survey of this sort from the Department and glad to note that that Department is acting independently. I presume that any time members of the Opposition want fundamental facts the information will be made available to them just as it would be made available to the Government Deputies.  Perhaps the method would have to be by way of parliamentary question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to say that all the information in my Department will be available to Deputies any time they want it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be a great advantage.  I do not know whether I could go a step further in suggesting a scheme such as that which they have developed in the Congress of the United States of America whereby there is a Department to facilitate private Congressmen and private Senators who may want to make investigations. I mention that matter so <Col N="1818" /> that it will be looked into in an effort to see whether any help can be made available to the Opposition on such lines.  If our discussions here are to be of real value the information which is necessary to enable us to form proper judgments should be available to us. A great deal of our time here is very often wasted in arguing at cross-purposes.</P>
      <P>I should like also to say, in connection with the Statistics Department, that if it is to be of real value two things are essential.  The first of these is that we should have a sufficiently adequate staff to ensure that these statistics are available quickly.  I would point out that statistics lose their value to the public and become useless from the point of view of trying to regulate Government or national policy if they come late.  They become what almost could be described as of historical interest only.  If they are to be of real present-day value it is necessary that they should come quickly.  I hope that the Government, and the Taoiseach in particular, will see to it that a sufficient number of persons will compose the staff so that may be done.</P>
      <P>One of the most valuable of our statistical publications is the <i>Statistical Abstract.</i>  It is the book to which anybody will go in the first instance to get general information.  Unfortunately, it has been late in its publication up to the present.  I hope that that book will be produced every year immediately the statistical bases for it become available.  It deals both with the calendar and with the financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to another point which I should like to have considered by members of the Government, namely, the question of making the financial year coincide with the calendar year.  From the point of view of the work that would be done in the House, and from the point of view of the staffs and the members of the House, it would be very much better if the summer season were largely free. In that way a great deal of the discussion could take place here on matters that only begin seriously to be considered after March.  Though I ask <Col N="1819" /> that that should be considered I realise that there are some difficulties in the way.  However, I was never completely satisfied that these difficulties were sufficiently great to prevent the idea of the two years corresponding from being adopted.</P>
    <P>In addition, having a sufficiently numerous staff, it is necessary that they be of first-class quality.  You will not get a staff of first-class quality unless you pay salaries which will attract men of the highest ability.  It was a complaint of mine, when we were in charge of the Government of this country, that the technicians in every Department were not paid sufficiently well in comparison with the administrative staffs.  I realise the importance of the work being done by the administrative staffs but, as a rule, when civil servants enter an administrative Department they have chances of promotion. The trouble is that when you get into a specialised or technical section, such as a statistics section, it is composed, as a rule, of only a small group of persons and the possibilities of promotion are not great.  That helps also to deter people of the quality that should be available for services of this kind from pursuing their studies to enable them to qualify, and they go on to other lines of activity.</P>
    <P>It is customary in the debate on the Taoiseach's Estimate to deal with some of the major points of policy to which the Opposition want to direct attention. The increase in Government expenditure is obviously one, particularly having regard to the statements made by the members of the various Parties who support the Government.  If democracy is to be a reality, if there is to be real confidence in it, the statements made at election time ought to be of such a kind that the public can put some confidence in them.  If people are elected to office, and if when they get to office, the policies which they pursue are directly at variance with the policies which they professed when they were looking for election, it is quite clear that that strikes at the root of any confidence in democratic Government.  I think it is right, therefore, <Col N="1820" /> in the interests of democracy generally, that when statements are made at election times, those who make those statements should constantly be reminded of what they have promised.</P>
    <P>It is in that context that one naturally approaches the consideration of Government expenditure at the present time.  The next question that one would naturally think of is the question of the cost of living.  There, too, the facts and the promises are vividly in contrast, and those who expose that are doing a right and proper thing in the public interest.</P>
    <P>There is, too, the fundamental question of emigration.  The Taoiseach, in part of his statement, has referred to it.  I, as Taoiseach, made a fairly long speech on that matter.  It is a speech that I think I could repeat to-day, and anybody else interested in the question who wanted to tell the truth could repeat it to-day without very much change.  It is very easy to take a sentence and twist it and put one phrase in one part with another phrase and give a completely wrong impression as to what was said.  The Minister for Finance was guilty of that, and the Taoiseach, by singling out a phrase which I used here&mdash;it was on the occasion on which the use of external assets was in question&mdash;took it out of a long speech in such a manner as would not indicate the argument to which it was a reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not from a long speech.  It was a summing up of what someone else said, the summing up of an argument.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It had reference to some particular statement made from the Government side of the House, where the suggestion was that you could regard these moneys as a hindrance instead of being of value, as if external assets were things to be dissipated just for the sake of dissipating them.  Now, with regard to the Taoiseach's statement that we have no cyclic depressions here, of course we have not cyclic depressions here of the type that you have in industrial countries, but we do have depressions here.  We had, for instance, an agricultural <Col N="1821" /> depression from 1929 onwards, and that was due to outside causes. By 1932, before we got into office, you had got into a very deep agricultural depression, and everyone knows that.</P>

      <P>Most of the policy the Taoiseach has been talking about is the policy that was brought in by us, despite all your efforts to prevent it.  It is a policy that was based upon decent social ideals.  It is the policy for which we stand to-day, just as strongly as we stood then, and our whole history, the history of our Government during the period, was a history of trying to get out of the <i>laissez faire</i> position which Fine Gael wanted to preserve.  I well remember the speeches that used to be made from that side of the House when I was in opposition and before our Party got to be the Government.  I was delighted to hear the expressions of Republicanism from that side, when they were brought to make them, and so was I delighted when I heard the Taoiseach giving expression to ideals which were always our ideals but which he now wants to pretend are his and his Party's and that they are ideals to which we were opposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the taking out by the Taoiseach of a sentence from a statement of mine with regard to the possibility of depression and suggesting all round that our attitude towards national development was of the type that he characterised.  The position is this, that the greater part of the aims that have been set down in the Taoiseach's statement as his aims <Col N="1822" /> have always been our aims and we are not converts.  We have criticised statements with regard to what is called capital development and, when we did so, we were criticising statements made on the other side of the House with regard to the use that should be made of, and the manner in which you could bring back, our external assets.</P>
      <P>We always wanted to see that these assets should be used productively but we felt there was an obligation to prove that they would be really productive, that if you put £100 in you are going to get £100 out or, if you did not, that you should ascertain what fraction you would get and judge if it was adequate. The duty of showing that would be the duty of the Government, but they have not done it.  They have said: &ldquo;We will do this and we will get certain results,&rdquo; but they have never attempted to estimate the percentage of the results or the extent to which capital assets would bring in something in the new circumstances which they would not have brought in in the old. We were always for the use of the capital resources of this country for the development of the country, and any suggestion by the Taoiseach that we had a different point of view is quite incorrect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We have opposed two things, first, the use of borrowing where it was quite clear that borrowing should not be used, and secondly, we have questioned in many cases whether the use of our resources would be productive to an extent which would warrant the use of the assets in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask to be allowed to develop my points.  Anyone who wants to speak later will have plenty of room and ample opportunity to do so.  As I pointed out on the Vote on Account, we have not been against the use of national resources for national development and the use of national <Col N="1823" /> capital that is employed elsewhere being employed here, provided we are satisfied that it will be productive.  If you have capital producing an income of £100 at the present time and you employ the capital in such a way that you will only get back half of that, it might happen that the half will be more satisfactory for certain reasons. Surely it is the duty of people to examine and satisfy themselves that the investment will be profitable?  We say to the Government that they have not been doing that; that they have not been applying any test.  They simply say: &ldquo;We will be able possibly to get more out of the land,&rdquo; but they have not estimated how much more.</P>
      <P>If we are to deal with these economic and financial questions, we ought to deal with them on some basis of that sort.  What is the use of the figures the Taoiseach is presenting if, when we begin to apply them, we throw them completely aside.  That has not been our attitude; our whole history when we were the Government proves the contrary.  Before we left office we had a large scheme of development.  Part of the attack upon us was that it was an extravagant scheme.  It was a scheme for construction of various kinds in which the building of houses played a most important part, because it was and still remains the most important and urgent public need.  I have said these things because I think that, when we are dealing seriously with matters of this kind, it is not right to try to make petty debating points by picking out a sentence out of a long speech divorced from its context and using it to build up a picture of an attitude of mind which is not ours at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter that naturally comes up for consideration is the question of the cost of living.  People on the opposite benches went before the country with all sorts of ideas and promises as to how they were going to reduce the cost of living and blamed us for being chiefly responsible for it.  The cost of living was going to be reduced at any cost, huge subsidies were to be given in order to diminish it.  We know now that the cost of living has gone up, again exposing the fact that <Col N="1824" /> those who are in office at present went to the electorate and were elected on a programme which they have failed to carry out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The next matter of importance which you will naturally like to consider at considerable length is the question of emigration.  When I was listening to the Taoiseach's statement on the question of employment, I was wondering how his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, was taking it.  When they were on these benches the attitude of the present Ministers on this question was that it was only necessary to have the will to do these things and they could be done overnight.  Deputy Morrissey, as he then was, said that anybody who wanted work in this country could have been provided with work within 24 hours.  We are now informed by the Taoiseach that the matter has not been solved yet.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of full employment.  You mentioned full employment, at least I think so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>When the present Ministers were on this side of the <Col N="1825" /> House they spoke as if the questions of full employment and emigration were things that could be dealt with if the Government had the will to do it. There is very little difference between members of this House with regard to general aims.  Every one of us would like to see a number of things done in this country if there were means available by which they could be done. There is nothing for the Taoiseach to boast about in saying &ldquo;we want to do these things and we want to increase production&rdquo;.  Of course, we want to increase production.  We know that the more production there is the more will be available in one way or another for our people.  It is not a question of wishing to do these things; it is the method we ought to be dealing with.</P>
      <P>Everybody would wish to increase production.  Everybody would wish that our people would be able to find a livelihood at home instead of having to leave the country.  Perhaps it would not be right to say that everybody would wish that more of our rural population would be able to remain on the land, because some people might not.  I have met some people who think that the ideal society would be to have the people congregated in the cities where all sorts of amenities could be easily provided, and then have a rural blank space worked with tractors and all the rest of it&mdash;huge ranches with very few individuals on them.  It certainly would not be my idea for a social system in this country.  We might not then, perhaps, agree as to how exactly the people should be distributed.</P>
      <P>I should like to see the greatest possible part of our population remaining on the land.  I discussed that on previous occasions from the opposite benches.  It was from a speech in which I was discussing that particular problem that the Minister for Finance chose to take out certain sentences and string them together irrespective of what the whole argument was about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the position on the land is concerned, I pointed out that the first thing was to divide it as quickly as we could into as large a number of <Col N="1826" /> economic holdings as would be reasonably possible.  There were certain limits to the extent to which that could be done.  The next thing I pointed out was that, when you had people placed on the land, having formed a rough estimate of what would be an economic holding, you would find that the present number on the land would not be greatly increased.  At any rate, when you had it done, you then had the problem that out of a family of four or five people only two on an average could remain on the land.  Therefore, if you want to keep them in the country, you have to find occupations for them in pursuits other than farming.  Let us take a family of five.  Three of these will have to get an occupation away from the land.  They would naturally go into commerce or industry or into the professions.</P>
    <P>We have always held that the real way to set about solving that problem is to build up our industries as quickly as possible.  If there is a big increase to-day in industrial production, it is an increase that naturally arises from the foundations laid before this Government came into office.  I remember the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. Lemass, pointing out in the early part of the year that in the year 1947 all the industries were hopeful. From the point of view of industrial development, everything pointed to rapid recovery and rapid extension, the moment the raw materials and capital equipment became available.  What has happened is what was anticipated by Deputy Lemass at that time.  The development is due to the fact that the foundations were properly laid.  It is not surprising or astonishing to us that there should be this industrial advance, as we expected it.  Whether it has been more than we expected or not in certain details, I am not able to judge, or whether some of the increase was due to special activities of the Government at the present time.  The real truth is that, in so far as there have been successes in several lines of development, those successes are mainly due to the fact that you are building on foundations and plans which were already made.  When we were originally in opposition, we believed that our policy, this policy, was a lasting policy, <Col N="1827" /> not a policy for a day but one which would continue because, seeing the advantages which were accuring from it, the people would insist upon it, just as in the political sphere, we knew that the changes we were trying to establish would last because of their soundness and the same insistence.  We knew that these changes corresponded with the natural aims and ideals of the Irish people.  We knew that any Government coming after us, whatever they might do about going ahead from that base, could not reverse from that advance. We are happy to see that that is so.</P>
    <P>The only thing that we resent is that the suggestion should be made that these policies are now the exclusive property of the Government and that we should be put in the position as if we were opponents of the policies for which we have been standing all our lives.</P>
    <P>Emigration is a problem which we all recognise as serious and dangerous. It has to be solved by definite steps. The keeping of people on the land must be solved by providing some of the amenities for country people which the city people have and which make city life attractive.  The distribution of electric light and power in our rural areas is one of those amenities. Another inducement is good country roads, which would enable a man and his family going to Mass on Sunday to avoid having to plough through mud. The supply of running water is another thing.  These would help to make country life more attractive for some of those people who are at present disposed to leave it.  If you wish to keep people in the rural areas, you must develop the industries in those areas also.  When we were in office, we tried to bring about decentralisation of industry, to bring it into the smaller towns.  Under voluntary systems we found it very hard to induce some of the manufacturers to do that, but we did our best.  When leaving office, some of us had come to the conclusion that one of the most effective ways to begin that process would be to try to develop the smaller cities.  This city is growing in many ways&mdash;much will always have more.  For the manufacturer <Col N="1828" /> there is an attraction in the large centre of population.  One must try to combat that by building up some of the secondary cities in size. There is Cork, Limerick, Galway, Sligo, Kilkenny and Waterford.  I have named them without any special care in selecting size and may have omitted some I would ordinarily mention, but I am giving these only as examples.  It should be our object to send industries as far as we can to those areas.  As a first step, that is the nearest we can get in regard to any large industry.  If we can get smaller industries to go into the smaller areas, all the better.  Methods like that, pursued steadily, will achieve certain results.</P>
    <P>These are the type of remarks which were distorted by the Minister for Finance.  Noting the general tendency of people in every part of the world to go away from the land, you cannot be sure at the start whether these things will or will not be successful. I never suggested, however, that it was a thing we should throw up our hands at in surrender, saying that we could do nothing about it.  We ought to try to do these things and try to get over the difficulties that present themselves. I do not think many in this House would disagree with that as an objective, but there is no use in having statements and aims of that sort alone. It is the method by which we achieve the aims that is the important thing for us to discuss.</P>
    <P>The next question naturally coming up here is one which we have discussed already on the Vote for the Department of External Affairs, the question of Partition and the methods we should use.  Everyone is agreed that we want to bring about an end to Partition as quickly as we can.  What I have objected to always is statements such as those made frequently by members of the Government as to its nature and the ease with which it can be dealt with. It is doing infinite harm to the morale of our people generally to state that it is a problem which could be solved overnight and that if Fianna Fáil had the will to solve it it could have been done.  The truth is that it is an extremely difficult problem.  One of the main aims of our general strategy, <Col N="1829" /> as far as Fianna Fáil was concerned, was to clear the ground in order that we might achieve a certain unity in other things which were disturbing our national economy so that it would be possible ultimately to tackle this most difficult of all our problems as a united people.  We wanted to achieve a situation in which these lesser problems could be put aside, as it were, so that we might all combine to bring about a solution to this problem by whatever means seemed to us to be the best means of achieving our objective. Now, in order to solve this problem, the most obvious step is to inform right-minded opinion, first of all. Naturally that is a matter that we would have to discuss here under other circumstances.  As I have already said, I do not propose to discuss it now nor do I want to add anything to what I said yesterday in the debate on the Estimate for the Department of External Affairs.</P>
    <P>There is another fundamental problem in which there would probably be agreement, too, as to aim; at least, I hope there would be agreement on it, though I have never had evidence of any real test of opinion on it.  I know that an odd Deputy here and there might not agree, but I believe that the vast majority of the members on both sides would agree that every effort should be made to restore the native language in order to make it once more the spoken language of our people.  Just as in the case of Partition, it is no use shouting at the Government, whether it be the present Government, our Government or any other Government; it is no use shouting at the Government and expecting that the Government can itself restore the language.  Naturally, the Government can do a great deal to help in moulding public opinion in coping with difficultes that may arise and, above all, by leadership.  I can assure the Government that in anything they will do towards the restoration of the language as the spoken language of our people we, on this side of the House, will do everything in our power to help.  I understand that the Government had a deputation recently from Comdháil Naisiúnta na Gaedhilge.  I was <Col N="1830" /> approached.  I understand that certain proposals were made to the Government by that body.  In the discussions with me certain suggestions were made.  I hope the Government will examine very carefully the suggestions that were made.  One of the suggestions made was that a special board should be set up to deal with the Irish-speaking areas in particular and that a certain sum of money should be made available to that board for that purpose.  The primary aim of that board would be to assist in keeping the language alive as a spoken language in those areas.  In order to achieve that, it would, of course, be essential to provide employment for the people in those Irish-speaking districts, so that they might be able to make their living there and thereby ensure that neither the language nor the Gaeltacht would be endangered.  In order to restore our language as the spoken language of our people it is essential that that area in which it is the traditional language should be preserved.</P>
    <P>If the Government comes forward with any policy designed to achieve that object they can be assured of the support of this side of the House.  I think that here, again, our aims would be the same.  I do not believe the Government would be niggardly in providing money for this purpose any more than our Government would have been niggardly in that regard. Naturally, that money would have to be spent in such a way as to bear fruit satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>There was a further suggestion made with regard to <i>An Gúm.</i>  That might have been more appropriately discussed, perhaps, on another occasion, but, as I am speaking in particular now to the head of the Government, it is not out of place to suggest certain steps to him.  One proposal put forward is that <i>An Gúm</i> should be organised outside Civil Service control altogether.  I think that would be desirable.  I think very valuable service can be given towards the restoration of the language by <i>An Gúm</i> through the encouragement they give to authors by the publication of their books.  I think a good deal could be done if <i>An Gúm</i> were given more <Col N="1831" /> freedom than they have at the moment as civil servants.</P>
    <P>I merely put forward these suggestions so that the Government may know that there are a number of matters in which we have a common aim and, in so far as the Government tries to solve any of these fundamental national problems, they can be assured of our support provided always, of course, that we are satisfied with the methods adopted and that we think the methods will be effective.  There was also the question of the use of the cinema.</P>
    <P>But it was not, however, upon these matters that I mainly intended to address the House.  I am drawn to speak principally because of the nature of the concluding portions of the Taoiseach's address.</P>
    <P>I want to deal primarily with the problem of our national defence.  We have been urging the Government to appreciate that there is a dangerous situation ahead.  That danger has been threatening for a considerable time.  I do not know whether the Taoiseach has changed the complacent attitude he adopted in this matter in the past or whether he still thinks that the situation is not a serious one.  I do not know whether he still regards us as being unduly alarmist.  I do not know whether he does not consider the matter a serious and an urgent one and whether he still believes that he can go on legislating for peace just as if there were no dangers threatening. Most householders hope that their premises will not be burned down and, in case their efforts to safeguard their premises should not be successful, they insure in some measure against complete loss.  Since U.N.O. started and since the attitude of some of the Great Powers in it has been revealed, it is quite obvious that we are not approaching real peace.  We are in a completely different situation now from that which obtained after hostilities ceased at the end of the first world war.  The moment it became obvious that these two groups of States were splitting apart and that one <Col N="1832" /> group deliberately, as it seemed, was setting itself out not to co-operate and to frustrate all the efforts of the other group at co-operation, it became equally obvious that we were, unless some miracle took place, moving from bad to worse.  What will be our position then in circumstances that one does not find it very difficult to envisage as ultimately likely to arise. The fact that one looks at these dangers realistically does not mean that one is unduly alarmed.  If one does everything in one's power, one can then face a crisis just as bravely as the person who pretends that the situation is one to which attention need not be paid.  I do not know whether the Government has been shaken out of its complacency as a result of what has taken place in recent times in the Far East.</P>
    <P>One has only to look at the map to see what possibilities can lie within it. You can see there the Western States &mdash;I am speaking of one group&mdash;engaged now in a conflict some thousands of miles away from their natural bases. You see in the rear of the United Nations forces, mainly the United States forces, some 70,000,000 to 100,000,000 Japanese people who have been recently defeated and people that one would naturally expect to be resentful. You see in front, not merely the Northern Koreans, but you see behind them a country that has become Communist with some hundreds of millions of a population.  Behind them again you see Russia with its manpower and industrial power to provide equipment for all.  One can easily see that this is not a war&mdash;unless by some miracle or for the reason that one side might feel that they were not quite ready for the conflict&mdash;that is likely to end quickly. If this conflict should go on for a certain period of time it is quite obvious that one side or the other will lose patience about it and will say: &ldquo;It is much better for us to try and bring it to a speedy end by using every method and every weapon we have got.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>You have, therefore, facing you the prospect of a conflict far more terrible than the conflict through which we have recently passed.  Are we just to sit down and depend absolutely on God's <Col N="1833" /> providence and do nothing more about it?  We know that we cannot stop the conflict.  The only question that can concern us is to try and see what measures we can take ourselves, so that we can survive as a nation through it. I do not think the Government is taking any steps at all.  The first step that would naturally be taken is to see that the standing Army, which was necessary to develop and to be the core of the manpower of this nation, was brought up to the limit that was thought to be essential.  I have many times repeated that, having gone into it with great care, a force of, I think, 12,500 was regarded as the minimum standing Army which could expand, take control, train and organise and take charge generally of what might be regarded as the available manpower. From the figures that we have got I do not think there has been any effort to bring the Army up to that strength.</P>
    <P>That ought to be one of the first steps that should be taken.  The Minister for Finance, or somebody else, will say &ldquo;look at the expense.&rdquo; But when you insure yourself you naturally ask yourself the question, &ldquo;Well, what is the premium, what is the expense?&rdquo; when there is a serious danger, and you have something that you regard as of great value.  What could be regarded as of greater value than the maintenance and integrity of this State, the maintaining of our independence here and our way of life, what could be more important than that?  If we really believe that that is important, nobody should say that the one, two or three million pounds which might be involved was too big a price to pay for security.  It will be argued, of course, that the expenditure of that sum of money would not guarantee security.  I agree that it would not guarantee security.  Neither in the last war, nor any other period of time anywhere, can a small nation be sure that by the expenditure of its own resources, it will itself be able to ensure absolutely its continued existence. I never felt, for instance, in the last war that if certain forces were brought against us that they could not defeat us militarily.  What I believed <Col N="1834" /> was, that if defeated militarily and having done our best to preserve our independence, that that would not be the end of it.  We had existed for seven centuries with the sovereignty of the people taken from them.  While we should do everything in our power to see that similar conditions would not exist again, I felt that even these would not mean the end of our nation. But we must face the necessary expense.</P>
    <P>The first thing which, in my opinion, the Government should do to meet the present situation is to bring up recruitment as quickly as they can, and to bring up the standing Army, in the first instance, to the number which we would regard as the minimum which could handle the manpower of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Was that a peace minimum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the minimum that was required to organise and to officer an army that could be made available on the occasion of dangers such as the present.</P>
      <P>We urge on the Government, in the first place, to deal with that and to set that right.  I speak with some knowledge about this because, at the beginning of the last war, I found that we had not at all anticipated the tremendous difficulties that were going to be involved in building up an effective force rapidly.</P>
      <P>The next thing is to see what is the extent of our reserves, to what extent we have reserves that are to a certain degree trained, and then behind them we ought to build up our F.C.A. forces so that they will be available for further training in case of necessity. We should give them the best training we can so that they will be available as they were in the last emergency for defence.  The defence problem now is not of facing one line of troops with another.  At any time now you can have troops landed from the air, and part of the general policy of defence ought to be to provide for a situation of that sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Next there is the organisation of civilian defence.  A good deal of work <Col N="1835" /> is being done elsewhere in making provision for a possible new war.  We have something that we can learn from that.  What is the type of defence that is regarded as being most effective?  I do not think that anything is being done.  We have no indication, anyhow, that anything is being done, and I do not see that the existing forces are sufficient to enable any work of that sort to be undertaken.  We do not know that there is anything being done in that regard, or that organisations are being set up which would be able to instruct the civilian population in the methods of defence and the methods of security which would be the best to take in case of attack.</P>
    <P>Over and above these military measures, we have the question of the provision of supplies of various kinds. I know there is an argument that can be used, particularly by the Minister for Defence, against the suggestions I have made as being altogether ineffective to meet the danger.  I shall deal with that before I conclude, but for the moment let me pass to the other question of seeing that we have food. In the last war we were very fortunate. Our people were on the up-grade so far as increasing cultivation and growing the cereals we required were concerned. We want to get back that mentality and the people will not get it overnight, particularly if we have suggestions from the Government that this is unnecessary. Even those who think that the next war will necessarily involve co-operation with other people, should remember that even though we should be co-operating with other people, these other people will not be as interested in seeing after our people as we ourselves would be.  If we want ships, for example, for some reason or other they may not make them available. The important thing for this country is to see after our food supplies, particularly bread.  I saw a stupid leading article in a newspaper some time ago, with regard to this matter, suggesting that we had plenty of cattle and plenty of potatoes.  You know perfectly well that bread forms a very important part of the ordinary diet of our people and while we possibly could <Col N="1836" /> exist on potatoes and meat, it would so upset our whole economy and mean such sweeping changes in various ways that it is a thing that should be only thought of as a last resort.  If by some chance we were deprived of bread, we would revert to a very primitive existence. So long as we can provide bread ourselves we ought to see to it that it is provided.  I do not see that the Government are giving any leadership in informing the people as to the policy of this country with regard to the growing of certain cereals but now, at any rate, so long as this serious danger is there, we ought to see to it that we maintain supplies such as were maintained during the last war and we should try to work up again to the 600,000 acres of wheat we had before.</P>
    <P>Next to food, there is the question of fuel.  We had to improvise in the last war.  The late Mr. Hugo Flinn&mdash;go ndeana Dia trocaire ar a anam&mdash;who was then in charge of that Department, tried to organise supplies of fuel for the city.</P>
    <P>Why cannot we now think of that possibility and see to the arrangement we should make&mdash;how we can improve methods and equipment, in other words, have some plan for providing fuel in the case of necessity?  Talking about plans, I do not know whether the Taoiseach is aware that during the last war one of the most valuable sources of information for us was a book indicating what another country, which had experience of war, would do at the outbreak of an emergency. There were certain indications of certain steps of every type that had to be taken.  That was studied by our officers during the emergency.  When the war was coming to an end, one of the things that I urged should be done&mdash;I do not know whether it has been done because we are inclined to go on to the work of the next year rather than look back upon the work that was done a few years ago&mdash;was that our experience during the time of the emergency should be crystallised in the form of a book which would be ready should ever the occasion arise again as a source of instruction in the vital steps that should be taken for the safeguarding of our people.  I do not <Col N="1837" /> know whether that work has proceeded to any great extent, but that was the direction I gave.  If it has not been completed, I would urge upon the Government very strongly that one or two of the officers of the Government Departments in charge of that should bring it up to date, so that the various steps that will have to be taken in case of the recurrence of an emergency will be taken and in the order in which they should be taken.  I say that that is a work which would be of lasting value because I suppose we have not come to the age of universal peace yet and, so long as we have emergencies of this sort, there are certain steps that will require to be taken to meet such emergencies.  Returning from the digression, food and fuel are the two most essential things to have.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of shipping. We did develop our shipping reserves to some extent during the emergency. We were looking abroad for ships from various places.  I do not know that I could say exactly that we found stony hearts, but we found people, anyway, who were preoccupied with other problems which were more important in their view than any question of what would happen to us.  I should like to urge strongly that measures should be taken to bring necessary supplies from outside&mdash;not food, because I think we could make ourselves relatively safe as regards food&mdash;but I think we should have the necessary shipping to bring us other essential supplies.</P>
    <P>These are the sort of steps which I should like to think were having the attention of the Government, but I see no indication of that.  In fact, it seems to me that the Government are more or less gambling as to whether their view is right or ours is right.  It would be some satisfaction&mdash;I assure him he would be welcome to it&mdash;if there was no war for the Taoiseach to say: &ldquo;Well, these are the people opposite who were telling us there would be war and see now, there is none.&rdquo;  That would be a splendid position if there is no war; but if there is a war, the Taoiseach and his colleagues will be held responsible by the Irish people for failure to take the reasonable steps which should be taken and which we <Col N="1838" /> at any rate are urging them to take. If it does involve expense or extreme measures, we shall back them.  There is no fear that they will find an Opposition which will oppose them in these things.  We know only too well the need there will be for them if a crisis should come upon us.</P>
    <P>I have said that I know there would be some arguments that would be used against the suggestions I have been making about building up, first of all, the central core of the Regular Army and then seeing that our reserves are made as efficient as possible.  We shall be told that we have very few arms. That is too true but, even to-day, the rifle, if all comes to all, is a useful weapon.  We ought to see that every rifle and every round of ammunition that is in this country is capable of being used in case of necessity and if we have to defend ourselves.</P>
    <P>When I am urging that, the Minister will say: &ldquo;Do you not see the immense powers that are arrayed against you and what chance have you, a small Power, against these?&rdquo;  I say that if either of them were concentrated to attack us that would be true, but that is not exactly going to be the position. There will be two mightly Powers fighting each other.  The side that matters to us will be very glad to see that there will be no gap in the defence in this country.  People will say: &ldquo;We have no chance of defending ourselves.&rdquo; I remember how Bernard Shaw mocked at our idea of trying to be neutral in the last war.  There will be people who will say that we are attempting an impossible task.  One of the things that made it possible was that during the earlier parts of the last war Britain was afraid of attack upon herself.  This country could have been attacked at that time and they were very glad that we were prepared to defend ourselves.  They would have given us arms at that time very gladly, I think, if they had arms to spare.</P>
    <P>Another occasion may come when a similar set of circumstances may arise and when the fact that we are prepared to defend ourselves and to prevent this island from being used as a basis of attack against other countries will make these other <Col N="1839" /> countries glad to give us arms for that defence.  But there is no use in putting arms in men's hands if they have no training and experience.  If we can get even samples of these weapons we should do so, so that our people could be trained to use them and continue their training and so that, in case of necessity, if arms did come our way, we would be able to use them properly in defending ourselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence pointed out very rightly here on some previous occasion that if we here were not distracted with the problem of Partition it might be very easy for a Government to prepare a line of national defence policy.  Even though it might not get agreement from everybody, they would be able to put forward a definite line of national policy which they, as representing the majority here, would put through.  I can understand that.  He is quite right in saying that if we had not this problem of Partition, which is a paralysing problem under present circumstances, paralysing practically for everybody who is thinking in terms of national defence, then it is quite possible that, although there might be a division of opinion in this House, a policy could be put forward by which this country would take the line of action which is taken by other small countries of combining with other people for defence.  But that is out of the question for us now.  Still, there is no use in throwing up our hands completely at the situation or in saying that we can do nothing.  I think we can.</P>
    <P>If common sense should prevail, if some of these people who are talking as if our problem were a petty problem were really to regard it as a petty problem for themselves&mdash;it is not so for us&mdash;then the paralysing situation would end as far as we are concerned. If we had a united Ireland, obviously the Parliament of a united Ireland would have to decide how the people of this united island could best be defended in the circumstances, and if there was a question of choice what course our people should take; but that cannot arise under present circumstances. <Col N="1840" /> What I am complaining of is that the situation being what is is, we appear to be completely giving up and making no attempt at all.  I think that is bad national policy and I would urge with any powers of persuasion I have to bring to bear that the Government should go all out in preparation.  If it does mean expenditure of certain money you will have to regard that money simply as you would regard an insurance premium.  I have explained my point of view sufficiently to make it possible for me to pass on to another point, but I am dissatisfied with the Government because it is not dealing with that situation as I think it should be dealt with and as I think the national interest demands that it should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which I raised by way of question with the Taoiseach a short while ago and I regard it in principle as being of fundamental importance.  There are people in this country who are misreading Irish history.  It is true that when we had an English Government here it was possible to pursue at the same time two lines of policy.  You had one line in which parliamentary representatives were trying to fight, as Parnell said, &ldquo;within the Constitution&rdquo;. It was the only thing they had. You had, side by side with that, a number of people who were using other methods.  That was fundamentally possible as long as you had no native Government here, as long as you had a Government which was a foreign Government against which all action was being directed.  They were all being directed in the same way against it, but even at the time there were complaints by those who were called constitutionalists that those who were adopting physical force methods were interfering with their progress and that they were frequently embarrassing them when success seemed in sight, when it was very awkward for them to be embarrassed. You had, on the other hand, those who stood for physical force saying: &ldquo;What is the use of all this talk? There has been talk and talk and talk in this country for so long and we are getting nowhere with it.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>There is no use in blinking it.  If you say that, you must say that this is not a sovereign Parliament and that it has no rights. You cannot have it both ways.  You must say either that this is the legitimate Government of this part of Ireland based on the Constitution that was passed by the Irish people or that it is not.  You cannot deal with this Government and with this Parliament in the same way as you would deal with a Westminster Parliament.  You cannot have it both ways, and with our history it is a dangerous doctrine to preach.  One of the things we, in Fianna Fáil, set before ourselves was to clear the ground here by having a Constitution derived from the people of this part of Ireland as representing the Irish nation and the leadership of the Irish nation here or elsewhere was to remain in this House.  This House will have to be jealous of its leadership and should not permit anybody else to usurp it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1842" /> I think that the Government, in not calling attention in specific terms to this business, is pursuing a dangerous line.  I know that the excuse is that the danger has not yet come, but there is a question of principle in it.  A very good rule is: resist the beginnings and, if you do not resist these beginnings, you will find that a situation will develop in which many lives will be lost, because the Government will have to assert its authority ultimately and cannot allow the Irish people to be dragged into escapades against their will.  I am not saying anything with which anybody on the opposite Bench will, I think, disagree. The only point is that they imagine, for some reason or other, that this had best be handled by ignoring it.  I do not think it can be ignored.  Under cover of that sort, you can get people organising and getting ready, and, when the time comes, when they are led to believe that they are sufficiently strong to defy you, they will do it.</P>
    <P>Do we want a recurrence of that sort of thing?  I do not think we do, and the Government, therefore, ought definitely to state, for the information of everybody concerned, that any attempt to organise young people here into a military force to take action which would be a usurpation of the authority of this Dáil will not be allowed.  If, as Deputy Boland said, it should happen that the law is not sufficient to enable that to be done. they should see to it that the law is made strong enough to enable it to be done.  I believe it is strong enough and that no special powers of any kind are necessary, that the legal powers are already there to implement the Article of the Constitution to which I referred in my question to the Taoiseach.  If they are not, I think it desirable that the powers should be taken.</P>

There is nobody in this Assembly who is not just as interested as the Deputy in solving Partition, but the Deputy ought not to be allowed to mislead people, to bring them on to a wrong track, and the Government, from the very first day, should tell him so and should warn parents and the young people of the country not to be led by any talk they may hear on the hustings into an organisation of that sort.  If there is at any time any force to be used on behalf of the Irish people, that force must be the Constitutional force under the authority of the legitimate Government and Parliament of this part of Ireland.  That must be clear to everybody, and the slightest departure from that principle is going to involve us in troubles which will be many indeed&mdash;Deputy Cowan can organise a force for one purpose; Deputy Somebody else can organise a force for some other purpose.</P>

      <P>It is in times of crisis that we have these difficulties, and the fact that such appeals can be made to our people is one of the serious dangers of the whole position.  Appeals can be made on account of this wrong of Partition persisting, appeals which will lead young people, who can be induced by various devices, and led into organisations of that sort.  It is at times of crisis that these activities naturally show themselves, so I ask the Government to make it clear that it is a matter of principle and that it is <Col N="1845" /> something which could not possibly be tolerated by this State.</P>
      <P>I have dealt with the two matters with which I intended to deal: the question of defence and the question of the authority of this Assembly. Other matters may be dealt with by other speakers, but, in view of the fact that the Government does not seem to be alive to these two very important responsibilities, I am moving that the Vote be referred back.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Minister for Defence (Dr. O'Higgins) Thomas Francis (Jnr.) O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Dr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sometimes puzzled by the statements of the Leader of the Opposition. From his speeches sometimes we appear to be going the same road and sometimes we appear to be going completely different roads.  When it comes to a question of national security, even though we might be very incompatible companions and very unhappy comrades, so long as we are going the same road in a common interest, that interest being the safety of the country and the security of its people, I will put up with that incompatibility and try to iron out the unhappiness and go as a good comrade along the same road.  But the Deputy at the present moment happens to be in a position of comparative political irresponsibility and we over here happen to be in a position of grave responsibility.  From that position of grave responsibility, we have, of necessity, to balance up in an unsettled and turbulent world the advisability of keeping our country and the minds of our people calm and concentrated on their job of work, on production of food, production of goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even facing the possibility that the time may come when goods will be in short supply and when man-power will be demanded not in hundreds but in thousands, for the Defence Forces of the country, we have got to balance up in that way and time our stroke as to when it is advisable to lock up the man-power of the country, not to occupy them in knocking sparks out of a barrack square, and to the greatest length of time that is possible, to occupy them in the field and in the factory, producing the goods to which the Deputy refers that may at any <Col N="1846" /> moment be in short supply.  That is a matter of balancing and that is a matter of acting according to the advices and the information you can get.</P>
    <P>No Government in the whole world to-day, not to speak of any individual Deputy or member of Parliament, can claim to be able to look into the future. That is reserved for the Almighty.  It may be said that one man's guess is as good as the next, but the opinion of a Government that has representatives scattered throughout the globe is at least of as much value and as much weight as the opinion of an individual Deputy or an individual member of any Parliament in the world.</P>
    <P>We know there are dangers.  We know we are living in an unsettled world.  We know that the future is doubtful.  But we were not brought up in the breed of pessimists.  We still believe there is a Providence up above, and we still believe that the best injection to instil into our people is the injection of hope and confidence and of looking to Providence.  At the same time, when Providence is looking down upon the whole lot of us, we are quite aware of the fact that Providence expects each one of us to do his job and to face up to his responsibility.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition was only two months out of Government when he started preaching war at home here and from far-away America.  For two months before that he had been blasting down air raid shelters and disbanding the Army and cutting down his Army Estimate and providing for the same Army as I have to-day.  He probably sent those messages from America and made those speeches at home in good faith and in honest conviction but, thanks be to God, so far, he has been wrong, and, with the help of God, he will be wrong for the next few years, at least as wrong or as right as he has been for the last few years.</P>
    <P>He and his lieutenants frequently compare and attempt to contrast the position of the Defence Forces to-day with the position of the Defence Forces at the outbreak of war in 1939. Even within the last 20 minutes, he referred to the use of the rifle and to the fact that the rifle is still a valuable <Col N="1847" /> weapon.  So it is, and even if there were no heavier arms than a rifle, it is a defence weapon and a formidable weapon in the way of protection.</P>
    <P>The position in this country is very, very dissimilar to-day from what it was in 1939.  In 1939 you had a tiny Army and you had a fairly adequate First Line Defence Force, and you had nothing else.  Your manpower capacity for putting arms into the hands of people trained in arms was confined within those two bodies&mdash;the Army and the First Line Defence Force.  What happened since?  It is a thing that Deputies opposite ignore.  We mobilised during the emergency an Army that swung between 35,000 and 50,000 men.  We were never engaged in war. We never had a casualty in war.  We never fired a bullet in anger.  They were all demobilised and we have at the present moment up to 40,000 of the best young men that this country ever produced, soldiers by inclination, soldiers by their very blood and upbringing, who sprang into the Defence Forces during the emergency years, who served for those five years, who are completely accomplished and trained soldiers.  We have every one of these in the country still.  We have 2,000 odd officers of the same calibre, completely trained.  There is no necessity to pull these men back into barracks, as was the case in 1939.  They are in the field; they are in the factory; they are in their offices; they are in their shops, they are in their professions; but they are all standing by as trained men.  It would be nearly bankrupting the manpower of the country in the days in advance of war if we were to be piling training on training on top of those men, teaching them what they learned years ago, how to form fours, to brighten their buttons and to salute an officer.  Every one of these is a trained soldier.  Every one of these ex-soldiers is a trained and potential officer.</P>
    <P>We have that immense army of men out there as reserves, not paper reserves but human reserves.  On top of that again, we have the vast numbers of young men in this country who, during the war, were trained, trained <Col N="1848" /> not only in the theory of war but in the practice of war, in other armies during the late war.  They have come back to their motherland and every one of them is as Irish as any of us.  If war crashed on us to-morrow we have that immense reserve of our own, trained by ourselves, and we have the big reserve that were trained elsewhere.</P>
    <P>There is no fear on our minds, none whatever, that we will be short of trained manpower if a war crashed on us to-morrow.  Those are the things that we as Government and myself as Minister for Defence, reckon up when we are looking at the defence, security and safety position of this country. Am I not entitled to reckon up all those good Irish lads as people who are game enough to fight for their country if and when the time comes that it is necessary to fight?</P>
    <P>Do you think I would be doing any national service, any good to the country or making for the greater security of the country if I banded and corralled all those trained men into barracks and taught them how to use an army cup and to form fours?  I want to know, in connection with this type of criticism that has been lately launched by the Opposition, supported by their powerful Press&mdash;I want to know and I am entitled to ask&mdash;to what extent it is necessary, to what extent it is honest and to what extent it is stimulated by patriotic motives. I put that question with a note of interrogation in my mind.  The alternative question is to what extent is it stimulated by purely sordid political motives merely because the Government is doing well, the country is going ahead&mdash;let us panic the people, let us capitalise on fear.  I ask that question for the reason that, 11 years ago, when a war was coming, when a war was imminent, the very first proposal that the Leader of the Opposition, who was then the Taoiseach, brought in here was a complete shut-down, a complete censorship, a complete black-out on any information with regard to Army strength, Army equipment, arms or armaments.  That was considered wise in the interest of the security of this little country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1849" /> To-day, he says war is around the corner; war is imminent.  He himself, his satellites and his Press are attempting, by question, by speech, by newspaper articles to extract every bit of information down to the last bullet in the armoury.  Every line of the Deputy's speech in Cork, in Ennis, in Dáil Éireann, every third column that appears in his Press, is trying to expose to the world the weakness of this country in the field of defence.</P>

      <P>Now we come to the question of equipment.  I inherited an Army and I inherited a supply of armaments from a Government that had been in office for 16 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>And that dismissed some of the finest officers just before they went out of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not go into that.  They had been in office for 16 years.  During eight of these 16 years arms and armaments were in ready supply.  Half the countries of the world were selling and it was a case of looking for buyers.  There was an unlimited world market there in the way of arms and armaments.  That Government was in a position to buy them.  They bought a certain quantity year after year.  A very great quantity of the supplies coming in from year to year were still there and are still there. To the maximum extent that the supply was available&mdash;not to the maximum extent that money was available but to the maximum extent procurable&mdash;since I took responsibility for the Minister for Defence, I have increased the supplies there.  Has the Deputy any <Col N="1851" /> fault to find with that policy?  We have never been at war.  We are not bragging or blowing as to what equipment we have, but we have a considerable amount accumulated through the years, expanded in the last three years, and none of it wasted in war.  The equipment is there; the man-power I have dealt with.</P>
      <P>The Deputy comes on, then, to refer to the whole question of civil defence and the inadequacy of our efforts in that direction.  There again much, very much, has been done.  It has been done, however, without disturbing the mental ease of the population, without agitating them, without making them nervous.  We were only two months in office when a sub-committee of Ministers was appointed to view all this situation of the possibility of war.  The compilation of books from the different Departments, based on their experiences during the last war, the compilation of legislation in the event of its being required&mdash;all that is being done and has been done.  But it is being done unostentatiously, quietly and without disturbing the mind of the woman of the house, of the man in the field or of the man in the factory.  Is that not much better than being noisy about it and turning our people into a population of jittery persons&mdash;not knowing whether to lay down the foundations or to postpone the whole building because war might come?  We believe that, if war is to come, the maximum amount of building we get done before war comes the better for our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the line we are taking and which we have taken not recently but since 1948.  We have not been blowing bugles or parading or strutting the stage but the work has been going on quietly and steadily.  It is with reluctance that we state these facts even now and we do so only because of the provocation from the other side and because of the deliberate campaign of the past three months to try and put this country weak in the knees through fright.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1852" /> You have a Government at the moment, a people's Government, a broad representative cross-section of the people.  Does the Deputy think that Government is in any way either unnational or anti-national?  Does not the Deputy know that, in the complements that go to make up this Government, you have as broad and complete a cross-section of the Irish people as it would be possible to get, a Government conscious of its responsibility, a Government careful of the people, a Government fearless with regard to an outsider and a Government determined to leave behind it a better State than it took over, if it is possible to do it?  That is our attitude.</P>
    <P>We do not work all the time in the limelight.  Most of the hard work is done in the dark.  Most of the real work is done behind doors, but the hard work and the real work has been going on all the time.  It is nonsense to be showing men into uniform before they are required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to auxiliary services.  I have a point of view with regard to auxiliary services.  A skeleton of those auxiliary services has been kept there all the time.  We know we are a little island here, that we are remote from the great world and, thanks be to God, to an extent removed from the warring world; but we have got continuously, over the past three years, all the information, all the instruction, all the intelligence and all the guidance that we can get from that greater world across the sea.  We have all the time been sending people for courses of instruction, for informative courses across the sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know what others are doing.  We are getting weekly the material, the instruction, the advice of people who are closer to war than we are.  We have been saying nothing about it, and it would not be in the national interest if we had been bleating all that kind of stuff for the past few years when we wanted people to get back to work and <Col N="1853" /> to work all the harder.  Does it serve any national purpose to have the kind of speech that we heard to-day, to have people mentally disturbed, agitated, uneasy and perhaps fearsome with regard to the future?</P>
    <P>Do you think that kind of speech brings solace to any woman in her home?  Do you think that kind of speech is likely to make any man bend his back harder to the task he is supposed to be doing?  It is unsettling everybody, male and female.  It is bad for the adult and unhealthy for the child and the responsibility that is on the Government is to stand as a shield and a barrier not only between the people and danger, but between the people and anybody who wants to upset or unsettle them.</P>
    <P>We are doing our duty and we have been doing it in the past.  If war comes we will do our duty even better in war than ever we did it in peace.  The fact that we have left the people alone in their occupations, peacefully employed, will ensure that if war comes, please God the response of the nation will be a response of gratitude that we have left them undisturbed so long that when we want soldiers we will get them in greater numbers than ever they were got before.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of following some of the hares that were introduced into this debate by Deputy de Valera.  I want to deal, as I intended to deal, with the Estimate presented by the Taoiseach.  I want to compliment him on his excellent review of our economic position, as contained in the very informative statement he made to the House.</P>
      <P>This Estimate each year gives us an opportunity of taking a broad view of our national affairs and of seeing where there should be acceleration, where there should be a marking of time and where, if necessary, there should or ought to be a change of direction.  The Taoiseach has asked us to look at the over-all picture.  I think every Deputy who is honest must admit that the overall picture is a satisfactory one.</P>
      <P>This Government has been in office for a period of two and a half years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1854" /> That is a very short period, and we must realise that those Ministers who form the Government had, first of all, to familiarise themselves with their Departments, with their responsibilities, statutory duties and ordinary everyday administration, and they had to get to know their higher officers, the civil servants on whom so much of the successful running of a Department and of the country depends.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding those difficulties, which are considerable difficulties and which take some time to overcome, if we look at the volume of legislation that has been passed and the work that has been done in those two and a half years, I think it will be agreed that we have reason and grounds for congratulating ourselves.</P>
    <P>We have a Housing Bill before the Dáil which fills a very necessary need and which has been welcomed by every Party in the House and by the leaders of public opinion outside.  The Local Authorities (Works) Act is operating in every county in the State, giving, as it was intended to give, necessary employment and doing very valuable work for the people generally.  Our arterial drainage programme is being pressed on with vigour.  To-day, in reply to a parliamentary question, we have been told the amount of work that has been done and the numbers employed on the biggest of these schemes at present in operation.  The land reclamation scheme has been launched, again giving valuable employment and, what is more important, giving heart to the land and rehabilitating the land so that it will be able to provide the food we would need in an emergency.  Deputy de Valera talked about providing food in an emergency and taking steps to ensure that it would be available.  What better preparation could have been made than by the land reclamation scheme?</P>
    <P>Through the Department of Social Welfare we have made it possible for the old age pensioners, for the blind, for widows, for that very large section of the people, to improve their conditions of existence.  Salaries have been increased for all State servants <Col N="1855" /> and pensions have been provided.  In the Department of Education, a matter which has been before this country for a considerable time and which helped in a way to bring down the last Government, namely, the grievances of the teachers, has been faced and very substantial increases in pay have been given, and very important improvements in conditions of service have been made.  The health of our people has not been neglected.  A magnificent hospitals programme has been carried out with energy, enthusiasm and efficiency.</P>
    <P>That is the picture which I want this House to see, a picture of work which has been done in the short period of two and a half years by a Government composed, in the main, of Ministers who had no previous experience of departmental or ministerial responsibility. If we look at that picture, I think we are entitled to congratulate ourselves and are bound to congratulate the Taoiseach on the magnificent work done by the Administration of which he is the Head during that period.  A Social Welfare Bill has been introduced which will revolutionise the social services in this State and, before this Vote comes up for discussion again in less than a year's time, that Social Welfare Bill will be in operation.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding what Deputy de Valera may say, we have a condition of internal peace which we have not known in this country for many years, due to the wise and judicious way in which the Department of Justice has been administered by the Minister for Justice (General MacEoin).  In the sphere of industry, the Minister for Industry and Commerce stated recently that 60 new industries have been established. I asked the Minister to give me particulars of these industries, the number of people employed, and where they are located and, in a reply a couple of days ago, the minister stated that that information would be furnished to me within a very short period as soon as it is available.</P>
    <P>Another matter of considerable importance in connection with which due credit must be given to the Government, <Col N="1856" /> and one which is vital if our industrial programme is to be carried out, is that there should be unity in what is known as the Labour movement. The first steps to bring about that unity have been taken by Ministers of the Government.  I think every patriotic citizen was delighted that these steps were being taken.  All of us would, I think, regret the statement we read in to-day's newspapers in which a Fianna Fáil Senator sets out to sabotage the efforts which are being made to bring about that unity.  Those are the things that are important.  Yet we have had from the other side of the House sabotage by individuals, sabotage by the Party as a whole, obstruction, delaying tactics, filibustering, a six-hours' speech on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture which leaves us in the position now that we have to hurry very vital business in order to get it done in a couple of days at the end of the session.  We had a Land Bill introduced which does the Minister for Lands great credit and which is very important from the point of view of the division of land and the abolition of slum tenements of land in the seaboard areas of this country. That Bill was held up as long as it possibly could be held up by an obstructive and malicious opposition.</P>

      <P>Those are the things which ought to be dwelt upon in this House, but we have Deputy de Valera in this House and in the country talking about the Defence Forces, their state of preparedness and everything else.  That comes very well from the Head of a former Administration which, the moment the emergency was over, dismissed out of the Army some of the finest officers that ever served this State.  Men who had given their services for many years, who were competent and efficient, were forced to go out under an artificial age limit and were deprived of the opportunity of further serving this State.  Why did he do that?  While he was Taoiseach and Head of the Administration, why did he allow conditions in the Army to be such that every soldier was <Col N="1857" /> anxious to get out of it?  Why would he not listen to the rumours that must have reached into the fastnesses of his mind about the conditions in the Army, that there was a state of dissatisfaction and discontent right through the Defence Forces during that period?</P>
      <P>The Minister for Defence has not refused any recruit.  Recruiting for the Army is open and has been open all the time.  Every person who presents himself for enlistment and is within the age limits and complies with the requirements as to physical standards is recruited.  But our Defence Forces are not up to the strength because those soldiers who served during the emergency were treated very badly by the Administration in which Deputy de Valera was the Taoiseach.  These are important matters which must be considered by this House. During this year, 1,250 small holdings have been raised to economic level by the Land Commission. Is not that something of which the Government must be proud?  Seven tons of seeds have been sown in the State nurseries for our forestry programme. Let the tally of constructive work done be put against the obstruction and the people of the country will have regard and appreciation for those who are endeavouring to work.</P>
      <P>Let me say this about the team of Ministers as a whole.  No one will suggest that any one Minister in the Cabinet is neglecting his work, that he is not devoting every minute of his time, day and night, to the work of his own Department.  Any Deputy can walk down the corridor and go in and see any Minister and discuss any problem that he thinks he ought to discuss in the interests of his constituents. Not only is that permitted, but it is encouraged.  That is a very big change from the days of a couple of years ago, when the Fianna Fáil Administration was here and when a private Deputy dare not go down to see a Minister unless he had an appointment made a fortnight in advance.</P>

They are afraid to talk, even to some of their own ex-Ministers. There has been a change brought about in this country that Deputy de Valera and the Fianna Fáil Party do not yet understand.  There is real democracy in action now.</P>

      <P>Deputy de Valera, or rather the Party that he leads, faces political extinction, political oblivion for a long period.  He clutches at these straws, the straws about war and about defence, and he issues a warning here as to what will happen any individual who may attempt to do anything constructive in regard to the abolition of Partition.  Deputy de Valera was 16 years in charge of the Government and during that time he did nothing in regard to Partition.  When he attacks me in this House, he attacks me because he sees certain ghosts rising up before him, ghosts of individuals that he sent to their death, and he is trying to justify that action by his declarations against me and against the volunteer movement that I am very proud and happy to be organising.</P>

      <P>Let me say this to Deputy de Valera.  Twenty-eight years ago I was defending the Constitution of this country.  I defended it as an officer of this Army from 1922 to 1946. I held a commission granted to me by the first Government of this country; I held a commission granted to me by Deputy de Valera as head of the Fianna Fáil Government; I held a commission granted to me by Dr. Douglas Hyde when he became President.  I understand the responsibility of a citizen and Deputy de Valera will not teach me that responsibility now.  I hope that Deputy de Valera will compare, in that period I have mentioned, his actions and his record with mine.</P>

      <P>The Constitution we have to-day is a Constitution enacted as a face saver.  The Minister for External Affairs has written a pamphlet on liberties, in which he has shown that, in the old Constitution, which was overthrown by the new, there were greater safeguards for individual liberties than there are in this Constitution.  It is because there are not adequate safeguards for personal liberties, in this Constitution that Deputy de Valera talks about, that these ghosts stand up in front of him in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that Deputy de Valera will give an opportunity to young, energetic people to do the things he did not do during the long period he was a Minister of State and Taoiseach.  Instead of the speech he made here this evening, he should have stood up in that seat and congratulated Deputy Costello, the present Taoiseach, on the marvellous work that has been done <Col N="1860" /> during the past two and a half years, by an untried Government but by a Government that set out to honour their promises and do their best for the Irish people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to get back to the temper of the debate and to the frame of mind that was in the House when the Taoiseach introduced this Estimate, and I would like to make particular reference to the remarks of the Taoiseach.  He gave a very detailed and valuable analysis of present economic trends and of the future developments that we might expect in those trends.  My only purpose in rising is to address to the Taoiseach a few questions and to make a few references to matters which the Taoiseach did not cover in his opening statement.  I would have been glad to have had from the Taoiseach some indication that consideration was being given to remedying the position which exists at the moment whereunder our currency is tied to and must fluctuate with the £ sterling.  On the 18th September last when Britain decided to devalue, as I understand the existing state of the law, we had no option other than to follow suit.  If I am wrong in that, perhaps the Taoiseach will deal with it when replying.  But that is the position, as I see it.  I would suggest that that is an undesirable position for this State.  It is undesirable that we, having the means to achieve complete economic freedom, are not availing of those means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach made reference to the export position and to the necessity for stepping up production and exports to Britain and the United States of America.  I would be glad if the Taoiseach could&mdash;perhaps it is unfair to put it to him, but it was not dealt with specifically on the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce&mdash;deal with the question of the setting up of an export authority charged with the responsibility of underwriting normal export risks and with the responsibility of making available to our manufactures information as to market trends and the data necessary to them if they are to compete effectively with the manufacturers <Col N="1861" /> and industrialists of other countries.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to the fact that 38 per cent. of those in employment are engaged neither in industry nor agriculture.  In other words, there are 38 per cent of our people engaged in distribution, administration, transport and the professions.  I would suggest that is a figure which should give the Government some food for thought.  In my opinion, that percentage of people employed, engaged in what one might describe as non-productive work, is an unduly high percentage.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach did not make any reference to afforestation.  I would be glad if, when he is concluding, he would give some indication of the Government's attitude.  I hope I am not doing an injustice to the Taoiseach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cowan, in the course of his speech, touched on the question of trade union unity.  It is with a good deal of apprehension and a certain timorousness that I make the suggestion to the Government that consideration should be given to the establishment of a fund which would make it possible to assure to those who were formely members of non-Irish controlled unions that they would suffer no loss by reason of their adhesion to completely Irish controlled unions; in other words, that they would not be at the loss of such services and benefits as they had expected to secure unto themselves by contributions made to the funds of foreign unions.  As far as I can recollect, this matter was examined by the previous Administration, and I understand that a tentative figure as <Col N="1862" /> to the probable cost was arrived at. If we could achieve unity in the trade union movement and if we could get rid of the foreign control in the trade union movement by such a step, then I think the money would be money well spent.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would endorse what Deputy de Valera said with regard to the Irish language.  I believe there should be the same approach to the question of the language as there is to the question of Partition.  I believe that one of the most effective steps that could be taken would be to give a lead from this House and, as in the case of Partition, to set up an all-Party committee charged with the responsibility of seeing that the drive to restore Irish as the vernacular of our people is not allowed to slow up, charged with the responsibility of ensuring that the Gaeltacht areas are served and charged with the responsibility of ensuring that we will build a nation which will not be free, merely, but Gaelic as well.</P>

      <P>I take, first of all, Government policy in regard to industry. Like Deputy Cowan, I am wondering where these factories are that have been established during the past two and a half years.  I am sure that my constituents down in the towns of Fermoy, Youghal, Midleton and Cobh are also anxious to know where the new factories established by this Government are situated and why a single one of these factories did not come down to the towns I have mentioned. I have been urging in this House on the Minister for Industry and Commerce during the past one and a half years to finish, or at least to go another step in regard to that splendid industry in Cobh which was set up by his predecessor, Deputy Seán Lemass. I allude to Irish Steel, a factory which was only barely pulled out of the fire&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My question is not in relation to the situation of the factory, but to the policy of a Government which talks about starting industries and the giving of more employment in this State.  While it talks like that, it leaves threequarters of the machinery in that factory at Cobh idle, machinery that was brought in in 1939.</P>

      <P>I raised it on the Vote on Account, on the Budget, on the Vote for Industry and Commerce, and I think I had about 15 different questions down asking why 300 of our people in Cobh have to leave this country while that factory is waiting to be opened. That is one very definite charge that I am making against this Government. Our principal industry, agriculture, has been turned into a position of absolute uncertainty and chaos by this Government so that the producers of wealth, who were referred to a moment ago by Deputy Lehane, find themselves the worst paid people in this State to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>They are the worst paid people in the State to-day.  The agricultural industry is in such a position of uncertainty that no man producing a crop knows whether or not he is going to find a market for it, or if he will get a price for his produce which will cover his costs of production.  This Government has a series of fixed prices which bear no relation to the costs of production which have gone up by some 25 per cent since 1947.  The position of the <Col N="1864" /> producers of the wealth of the nation is that they are receiving for their produce to-day the same as the figure that was there in 1947.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is just what I am doing.  The policy of the Government, so far as agriculture is concerned, is to send out dollars, which have been borrowed or got otherwise, to foreign countries to bring in what our own agricultural community should be producing. The refusal of the Government to give a guaranteed price to the agricultural community for their produce or for what they were producing, has put the Government in this position that it is in the hands of every foreign extortionist that can sell it muck.  I have seen what this Government was compelled to bring into this country. I have seen the dockers in Cork refuse to go into the ships and unload that muck for which £500,000 of our money was paid to the foreigner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>A very vigorous ghost all right, a ghost supplied by the nigger, supplied by the Formosans, by the Argentine, by the Cubans and the Department of Agriculture in this State remains inactive.  If that is the lifeline on which we are to depend for our food supplies in a period of crisis, I can well understand the attitude and the mentality of the people who were sitting on these benches in 1939 who said: &ldquo;Why produce wheat when we can get plenty of it in the American market to feed our people during the war?&rdquo; I can quite understand that attitude and the frame of mind here to-day as one who had to sit over there and listen to them in former days.  I can quite understand the reason why one of those who advocated that policy loudly during those days is put in charge of agriculture to-day.  I can quite understand that, but where is it going to lead us? Where are we going to find food for our people facing that condition of affairs to-day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago, I had to issue a warning that you cannot turn on a tap and get a crop put into the ground and produced in a day, that there would be very little use trying to set a few thousand acres of wheat in the months of June and July, that you were not going to get 12 months' notice of the next war.  Apparently that fell on deaf ears.  The Minister never concealed what his intention was, namely, that the people of this nation in any emergency of that description would pay for their food by the life blood of our <Col N="1868" /> young men fighting for the foreign grabber.  That was the attitude then and that is the attitude to-day.  Does the Taoiseach consider that that is a right policy?  I take it that he must consider it is a right policy when he is allowing that Minister to continue in charge of the Department.  For the life of me, I cannot put any other complexion on it.  If that is the mentality with which we are facing another emergency, the mentality that we are to get all the food we require brought in in American or British bottoms, I think the fallacy of that argument was more than proved from 1939 to 1947. I have endeavoured to the best of my ability, by example and otherwise, to induce the people, my fellow farmers&mdash; I considered it a patriotic duty&mdash;to produce in this country all the food required for the Irish people.  I did my utmost in that line, but we are up against a condition of affairs to-day where it is hard to believe that the Government want home production of that kind.</P>
    <P>I should like at this stage to issue a fair warning and it is a warning that should be considered when we talk here of a flight from the land and things of that description.  The worker on the land to-day has only his four bones to sell, the same as every other man in the country.  He is going to sell them to the man who will pay him most for them.  If you find, as I find and as my neighbours find, that in any other industry that man's labour is calculated at double the value it is in agriculture, then you cannot, on that basis, build a prosperous State.  You cannot, on that basis, increase production. There is no use in pretending that we can.  On the Agriculture Vote I appealed to the Government of the day to take what by rights should be the first step in this matter, namely, to get to work to fix the minimum wage in agriculture at least as high as that of the unskilled labourer employed in any other industry.  All over the country, in the different counties, the Government have at their fingers' end the means by which they can ascertain what the costs of production would be on those figures.  Professor Murphy of Cork could give them on any day.  Let <Col N="1869" /> us have fixed prices on them and then let the Taoiseach stand up and say: &ldquo;I not alone ask for, but demand increased production.  I demand that this nation will produce here at home all the food it requires for its people&rdquo; and let us, in God's name, be independent, in the food line anyway, of any foreign nation.  Let us do that in a courageous way and approach it on that line and not in this cheese-paring fashion of putting one section of the community up against a target, putting them up against the wall, putting them up against increased salaries for civil servants, increased pensions for some other tribe, increased something else for another tribe and increased social services for all.  One section of the population is set up against the wall to be scourged and robbed in this present condition of affairs.</P>
    <P>That is my objection to the way in which this present Government is working and this present Government have got the results of it; they have got a proof of it and they can see it for themselves.  It is not with any pleasure that this State has to go away to the foreigner and pay out the dollars that are needed for other things for food and for stuff that could be produced here of far better quality than is produced by the foreigners.</P>

      <P>There was nothing. 46/- a barrel was paid for it and the poor unfortunate old farmer was begging the Minister to get him 20/- a barrel in 1948.  As a result, the agricultural community is no longer foolish enough to go on producing stuff when they have no guarantee as to what they are going to do with it.  That is why I am here making what I consider to be a last appeal to this Government, and if there is an emergency within the next 12 months or two years in this country, Deputies will have reason to remember <Col N="1871" /> that appeal of mine, and sore and bitter reason, because when the condition of affairs which has brought about that position is made known to the people of this country it will take more than Deputy Cowan's army to save the boys.  That is a fair warning.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the House. I have been prevented from dealing with the subjects that, in my opinion, should be the first and most important subjects to be discussed by a House of Representatives in this country who, after all, must consider the main industry of the country, agriculture.  I am sorry that I could not enlarge on that matter, but I must obey the ruling of the Chair on that.  You can talk about armies and you can talk about defence, but there is an old saying of Napoleon's that an army marches on its stomach and if you have hungry bellies among the army of the future you will have very little use in asking that army to fight.  They will have very little humour when their backbones are tied to their bellies and they get a feed of Iraq barley instead of decent Irish wheat.  I am telling you that it is not fighting they will be thinking of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the position that is being created, and I regret that we have not got an opportunity of discussing the matter more fully.  I wonder if the Minister for Industry and Commerce could tell us the amount of oatenmeal got by the ordinary process from a ton of Irish oats and the amount got from a ton of imported foreign produce of the Argentine brand.  These would be rather interesting figures for the Irish people.  I have got samples of both and have sent them to the millers for test in that respect.  I hope that, when we reassemble in October, I will be able to give the House the results of my explorations in that line.  I am sure they will interest the Minister as well.  It is time some effort was made &mdash;and I have offered the Government full co-operation, as, I am sure, they will have the full co-operation of every Deputy, regardless of Party&mdash;to get produced in this country the food that the Irish nation will require and not have this drain on our people in peace-time involved in our having to rush <Col N="1872" /> abroad for foreign produce, and being in the position, in time of emergency, that there is no food to feed the people, unless it is paid for, as the Minister for Agriculture hoped it would be paid for from 1939 to 1946, with the lives and blood of our young people.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate if Deputy Corry or any other representative of the agricultural community feels that the Taoiseach's Estimate should not afford him a full opportunity of dealing in general terms with what has been universally described as the main industry of the country.  We got a great number of statistics from the Taoiseach, but it was impossible to note even the most important ones with the accuracy that would be required, but I think he mentioned that there were 50,000 fewer persons in employment on the land during the past four years than formerly and that a larger number than 50,000 had found employment in industry and other spheres; but it is not merely a question of finding employment assuming&mdash;which the emigration figures seem to contradict&mdash;that the whole of the 50,000 who left the land found employment at home.  From our knowledge of what has been happening in the rural areas and from the exodus that took place after the hand-won turf scheme was closed down, it must be clear that a considerable population has left the country.</P>

    <P>The fact that the Taoiseach's statement seemed to regard the national economy more from the industrial and from the Dublin point of view than from the point of view of the man who must view our economy as a whole and place the agriculturist in the premier position is, in itself, a very significant fact.  He pointed to the striking improvement in the position of the farmers and it may be true that, as compared with pre-war, the farmers are in receipt of larger incomes, but, as was pointed out recently, if we have regard to the fact that the £ of 1939, in relation to present retail prices, is the equivalent of only 10/9, we have to ask ourselves whether the £100,000,000, which the Taoiseach says the agricultural community is receiving now by way of income, is, in fact, going to <Col N="1873" /> purchase for them the same amount of goods which they have to purchase outside their own economy as in 1939.</P>
    <P>If there is any truth&mdash;and I suppose it is a truth that is generally accepted &mdash;in the statement that the land of this country must have suffered severely in the matter of fertility through over-cropping during the war period and that the primary purpose of Government ought to be to restore that fertility, and even to give the land a higher level of fertility than it had previously reached, there is surely a strong case that the opportunities which the Government now has at its disposal of making the moneys available through Marshall Aid available to the farming community generally and not merely to the owners of marginal land, or land which, in a time of scarcity of food and comparatively good prices, it may be profitable to cultivate, but which later on may go back to its original state.  It is a matter for the Taoiseach as much as, and more than, it is for the Minister for Agriculture to make at least some reasoned reply to the case frequently made from these benches and from his own benches, and to which no reply has been forthcoming, except the usual scornful epithets from the Minister for Agriculture and that there should be a concerted drive on the Government's part to make fertilisers available to farmers at reasonable rates, since it was due to their efforts that this community was able to carry on without the aid, which, even in the first world war, was available to us from outside and the aid which, in another crisis, if it should occur, may be even more urgently necessary.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to under-production and under-employment on the land.  We regard this matter of our agricultural economy as a social question and it does not matter what strides are made in industrial development or technical efficiency, the man on the land has the safeguard in a world crisis that he will always have enough food for himself and his family and will be able to supply his neighbours.  The only good book I ever read on unemployment, the only book that made any impression on me, was a book in which <Col N="1874" /> the author said that the best form of economy, in the long run, was the economy of the food producer who had some other craft or employment of a part-time character to help him out. There is no use in blinding ourselves to the fact that the economy and mass production methods of the United States of America, which are now being forced upon countries which have an entirely different economy, will not succeed here.  We prefer to approach this question from the point of view of having the largest number of families on the land.  The provision of whatever is necessary in the way of guaranteed prices or State assistance to enable those food producers to meet costs of production and have a decent margin should be the primary object of Government policy.  Any policy of investment, of repatriation of assets, or other, that does not have that in the forefront and that does not regard that as the primary objective in national policy, is not likely to succeed.</P>
    <P>We cannot apply the prairie methods of the United States of America to the small farms of this country.  We have to accept, as most countries have, the particular characteristics and the particular economy that we have.  It would take a very long time for us to adapt ourselves and to inure ourselves to the changes that would be necessary if we were to attempt to move in step with prairie countries.</P>
    <P>I suggest that it should be the policy and duty of the Government to have regard to the needs of the small farmer. The surplus from his land when he has maintained his family and himself will be limited assuredly.  The Commission of Inquiry into Agriculture that we set up agreed that improved education was the fundamental and most necessary improvement of all in regard to agriculture. They did not say, but I think they might have said, that no other improvement is worth while or that there can, in fact, be no other improvement until education is brought up to date and modern technical methods applied.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke of the country towns.  Our opinion is that the <Col N="1875" /> country towns are not thriving, are not prospering.  Everything is being sucked up into this octopus of 500,000 people. At the rate the population of Dublin is increasing, it may in our time reach 700,000 or 800,000.  That is not a very good position.  It is a very difficult problem.  Surely it would be better for the Government to try to decentralise industry to the maximum extent even if the assistance which has had to be given elsewhere must be given, in the way of providing free sites, certain relief from rates and even grants. Under another Government not very far away, grants are being given to people to establish industries and the Government is actually building the factories.</P>
    <P>The terms of trade are undoubtedly favourable to agriculture at the present time.  I am in thorough agreement with the advice that farmers are getting to make the very most of the opportunities that present themselves. I should like to see rural electrification and rural water supply schemes carried on with somewhat the same intensity as housing and the provision of other amenities for the City of Dublin and other large centres and with the same desire that apparently exists among the Parties supporting the Government for the provision of these amenities in the City of Dublin and the other large centres.</P>
    <P>If other people can organise and secure advantages for themselves, the agricultural interest in this country is not by any means so backward or unintelligent as not to grasp the moral for itself.  If the present trend continues, and if we will have the position that the population on the land which we used to hear was roughly 50 per cent. of the total population, decreases to 40 per cent. or even lower, it will mean that the preponderance of influence, which is already too great in the case of this metropolis, in the political, economic and every other sphere, will be so great that, unless the rural community is organised and regimented in a way that has not happened before and that has not been possible, they will not be able to maintain <Col N="1876" /> their interests against all the other interests that are organised to get more than their share of the national cake.</P>
    <P>According to the Taoiseach, we have an increasing number employed in industry, but that number, of course, is altogether below the number we ought to have if the policy of industrialisation was being carried on in an active and progressive way.  According to the Taoiseach, the bulk of those described as being in the industrial category are only distributing goods. Therefore, instead of 20 per cent. in industrial occupations we ought to have a much larger percentage in the actual production of goods which we are at present importing.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has said that there is some £60,000,000 worth on which we could try our hand.  We could do so if the Government would only give the necessary direction and set in motion the necessary organisation and direct that industrial effort with the necessary energy and capacity.</P>
    <P>I was rather amused when I heard the Minister for Industry and Commerce interrupting Deputy Corry to say that we had more food in this country now than ever we had before.  So far as the consumers in the City of Dublin are concerned, it is not very noticeable to them that we have more food if the price of food is any criterion as to the supply.  When the Minister for Industry and Commerce told us recently that there was, in fact, an increase in the cost of living, he tried to excuse himself by telling us that, if conditions had remained the same as they were when the promise to reduce the cost of living was made, there would have been a very substantial reduction.  Of course, if the conditions of 1947 had obtained in 1948 and 1949, the progress that has been made in industrial production, increased employment and general improvement in many spheres, would not have been possible.  When the Government are quoting 1947 as a base figure for comparison to show improvements that have been effected since then, for which they would like to take credit and to attribute to themselves, they fail to make allowance for the particular <Col N="1877" /> conditions and circumstances of that year.</P>
    <P>If we want to be honest about it and to ask ourselves whether we are making progress nationally or not, and economically or not, in fairness, we ought to compare the figures, as the Taoiseach has done in a few instances, with the position in the pre-war period. Then we shall see, as I have indicated, in respect of agriculture that, even though there is a big improvement in certain respects, particularly if you regard certain figures of output and so forth from the monetary point of view, when you look at them from the point of view of value, the position is entirely different.</P>
    <P>It is admitted that in the sphere of agricultural production we have only now reached the pre-war level.  It is admitted, also, that instead of a vast increase, having regard to the improvements in equipment and methods to which the Taoiseach referred, we have only an improvement of about 1 per cent. per annum in industrial output, if I got the figure correctly.  I think that in a State which was being geared up to a proper level of industrial activity and not still in low gear, so to speak, a greater increase in our output ought to be possible. It is not as if we had reached such heights of industrial production that 1 per cent. more would be regarded as a very big thing.  The fact is that we have been starting, of course, from a comparatively low position after the war situation and, therefore, the 1 per cent. per annum is all the more disappointing. If it is to be taken as a pointer that the Taoiseach is indicating signposts of advance, and so forth, I think, as he indicated himself, 1 per cent. can only be regarded as very disappointing.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also stressed, I think, with regard to the volume of our exports, the increased value of our exports.  We know that the terms of trade are in our favour; we know that there is a shortage of food in the world and, no doubt, exports have gone up to a very great extent.  Nevertheless, as I understand the Taoiseach, the volume of our total exports is only 90 per cent. of what is was pre-war.  If <Col N="1878" /> you take these three figures&mdash;the 1 per cent. per annum improvement in industrial production, the fact that our total volume of exports is only 90 per cent of pre-war and the fact that we are only now reaching the pre-war level in agricultural output generally&mdash;I do not think there is any room for the complacency that the Taoiseach seems to show.  I should imagine, if we are serious about this matter, we ought to set before ourselves a target of achievement for the future.</P>
    <P>If we want to reach a position that we are going to make our agricultural effort such that we can contemplate the future with equanimity and go out to meet all competitors in the international market; if we are going to face the position that, as far as possible, we will try to provide for ourselves and our own requirements in such a way that many of the things we had to go short of during the last war will now be available; if we are going to tackle agricultural production and industrial development in that spirit, I suggest the Government is failing in its task of leadership and direction in not giving us a more definite target as to what exactly the aim is to be-an aim which ought to be kept before all our producers and all our organisations of both employers and employees so that they may cooperate in the general national effort of turning out the greatest amount possible.</P>
    <P>I had intended to refer to the statement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that one reason why the cost of living had gone up, and which he claimed it was beyond his capacity or power to control, was agricultural produce.  &ldquo;Agricultural produce,&rdquo; he said, in the course of the Estimate on Industry and Commerce, &ldquo;is about the only article in consumption that I cannot control.&rdquo;  That statement was made in respect of this agricultural and food-producing country where rationing is still being maintained and where it looks as if we shall be the last civilised State in the food-producing category applying rationing to fats.  The Minister went on, on that occasion, and said, as an additional reason for the increase in the cost of living, that protection leads <Col N="1879" /> to an increase in the cost of the protected article in most, though not in all, cases.  That certainly, if it is true, is a strange commentary on the Industrial Development Authority, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, on the Minister's prices control organisation. The third point, of course, was one to which the Taoiseach referred and that was that the full effect of devaluation has not yet been felt. As the Taoiseach's statement pointed out, while it had shown itself clearly in the prices of raw materials, it is only now that the increased prices are working themselves out towards the consumer in the way of increased prices to wholesalers and retailers and, finally, to the public generally.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to the national income and pointed to an increase.  He said that there has been an increase in the national income from £338,000,000 in 1948 to £352,000,000 in 1949.  I was rather anxious to hear from the Minister for Finance, and perhaps the Taoiseach will tell us when he is concluding this debate whether the principle that the Minister for Finance laid down in his Budget statement last year that we had reached the absolute limit of taxation and that the people could not be taxed further still holds.  &ldquo;Taxation,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was £27 per head of the population and that was roughly, if we include both the national taxation, local taxation and insurance contributions, about 25 per cent. of the total national income.&rdquo; It is quite true that there has been no increase this year in the rates of taxation, but it will be seen that the sum of money which the Exchequer is expected to collect in one way or another of £75,000,000 to £76,000,000 is a very substantial proportion of the total national income.  That is only a result of the failure of the Government, as has been pointed out in other directions, to make good the promises which were perhaps not very sincere but which were made, at any rate, that they would, as well as reducing the cost of living, reduce the cost of Government. The Taoiseach told us, when the Government came into office, that the country was overtaxed.  The fact is <Col N="1880" /> that the cost of Government, which was about £65,000,000 in the last year of the previous Administration, has gone up to about £87,000,000 in the present year&mdash;and, of course, the retrenchment over a wide field was only applied to certain schemes which the present Administration regarded as grandiose schemes but which seem very much on the small side in comparison with the huge expenditure and huge schemes we now hear of.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach will give us some information as to whether the Government is now definitely abandoning the mandate the Minister for Finance claimed he had in 1948 to carry into effect a policy of retrenchment over a wide field, or whether, on the other hand, the idea of keeping the cost of government as low as possible is to be put on one side and the new policy of meeting expenditure hitherto met out of revenue is going to be the main feature of Government administration. When the Minister for Finance asks us what item of the £12,000,000 we would cut out, we say that is the job of the Minister for Finance.  I suggest it is the task either of the Minister or the Taoiseach to explain to the country why, when the Minister borrowed a mere £600,000 in his Budget in respect of these items in the preceding year, he can now turn round and pretend it is the same policy that is in operation when he is borrowing £12,000,000, 24 or 25 times as much as during the previous year.</P>
    <P>It would be unfair of me to go through the items, but I think I may, to this extent at any rate, repeat what I said already, that when we are borrowing this £12,000,000 a year which, apparently, we are going to borrow permanently, we will have to pay for it, and the fact that we have to pay £665,000 a year for the next 30 years is sufficient proof of the heavy nature of the charge that has to be met.  It is no wonder that the Taoiseach, in his statement, which was interlarded, like the Budget statement of the Minister, with qualifications and suggestions and advice as to the danger of pursuing this policy to an unnecessary degree, or to an alarming extent, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1881" />&ldquo;Let us have regard to the earning capacity; let us put the money, if we are going to repatriate it, into enterprises that will pay.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This £400,000,000, as he said, is only one year's income, and, viewed from the 1938 point of view, or the present value of money, it is not anything like £400,000,000.  If you compare it with the pre-war figure of our sterling assets, and ask yourselves how much more we would get if we go outside the country to purchase our requirements as compared with what we would get at that period, then I do not think we would get very much more.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach now tells us we should be careful about this.  Are we to agree with the Taoiseach in regard to this money, the yield from which the country is going to lose, and the whole capital of which it could also lose in a very short period under an improvident policy?  Are we going to follow the Taoiseach's advice about putting that money into productive enterprises which, as well as giving employment, will add to the national wealth and will help to pay for themselves, or will we take the other line of spending the money on socially profitable schemes, as suggested by the Minister for Finance?  If the criterion is to be whether the scheme is socially profitable or not, where will we stop? If we are to borrow for school buildings and housing grants, why not borrow for other services?  Socially or otherwise, they are closely allied.</P>
    <P>I cannot see where you will draw the distinction.  The moment you pass away from the fundamental idea that, if you represent the people's interests truly and want the best return for the community, the investment should be one that will have a reasonable prospect of paying for itself&mdash;if you depart from that to any great degree&mdash; then we know what will happen.  We know that, after a short time, such an improvident policy will have to come to an end.</P>
    <P>I have, I fear, taken up more time than I had intended to take.  With reference to the spending of $129,000,000 to which the Minister for Justice referred recently down the country, our <Col N="1882" /> information is, so far as I have been able to gather from Deputies in this House, that they are not prejudiced against the land rehabilitation scheme. They would like to see that, and other schemes calculated to benefit the country, prospering.  We should like to see in operation schemes of such a character that all the farmers will benefit by them, particularly those whose lands are in need of rehabilitation because of necessary over-cropping during a period of emergency.</P>
    <P>To that extent Deputy Cogan put the position pretty clearly in so far as it affects the ordinary farmer and, whether we agree politically with Deputy Cogan or not, we must admit that in this matter he has put up the attitude and the feelings of the great majority of the agricultural community. His suggestion was the suggestion of anybody who would have the temerity to make a suggestion to the present Minister for Agriculture, and that is that the whole of the agricultural community are entitled to consideration under this scheme and are certainly entitled to a more courteous, a more reasoned and a more worthy reply than the Minister gave.</P>
    <P>There is another point about it.  That scheme applies to all the rural areas, even though it is only to a limited extent, and when the Minister for Finance is sneering, backed by his satellites in the Labour Party, reunited now, at the Fianna Fáil scheme for Government buildings, I would remind him that that scheme, reference to which he has made, and the extracts he has purported to quote about it, go as far back as 1935.  That is a very long way back.  That scheme had not even reached the stage that it was brought before this House or before the Government for any decisions which would bring it into effect or which would even bring the preliminary plans into operation.</P>
    <P>What I said before I will now repeat. If you want to provide an unemployment scheme for the large mass of unskilled labour in the City of Dublin or anywhere else, when your ordinary housing programme has reached a point of saturation, you will have to fall back on some large constructional scheme of <Col N="1883" /> that character.  It is a serious defect in the Government's policy that, although they have received this huge amount of money which, apparently, according to the Minister for Justice, they do not ever expect to be asked to repay, they are not making proper provision for it.  It is a serious defect in their handling of that if they have made no provision for increasing productivity in non-agricultural enterprises with the aid of that money.  If they are doing it, members of this House have not heard what they are doing about it.  We have not heard it from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  We are told the Industrial Development Authority is sitting, but we do not know what they are doing. There is no report from that body and, in fact, it has not yet received the sanction of this House by legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the Taoiseach in the compliments which he paid to the Statistical Section of his Department for the good work they are doing.  That section of the Taoiseach's Department have collected and are collecting and collating information which is of use to this Government and will be of use to every future Government in preparing policy and coping with national economic problems.  I should also like to support the views of those who have pointed out how grave is the present economic situation of the country, having regard to world affairs.  Unless some miracle occurs, a war involving the entire human race will take place in a very short time. Faced with such a prospect, there is a terrible obligation upon any Government to make provision for that situation, for the feeding of our people, for carrying our people through that emergency with the least possible loss.  I know that any Government which undertakes the unpopular task in peacetime of stock-piling for war is taking a very grave risk of being laughed at, scorned and ridiculed in time to come if a war does not occur.  But that is a risk which must be taken and every possible effort should be made to ensure that the raw materials for our vital and essential industries are procured so far as it is possible to procure them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1884" /> So far as agriculture is concerned, that industry, if placed on a sound basis, can support our present population without any outside aid.  But during whatever period of peace is left to us we must set ourselves to provide additional raw materials for that industry to strengthen it so that it will carry us through that emergency period, if it should occur.  The first thing necessary is to speed up and accelerate the pumping into our soil of the necessary lime, phosphates, potassic and other manures that are essential to make the land produce its maximum.</P>
    <P>In words dripping with venom I have been assailed for urging the Minister for Agriculture to undertake a policy of speeding up the restoration or the fertility of our poorer soils.  I admire the work that has been done in regard to the reclamation of bogs and mountains, but there is another form of reclamation and rehabilitation which must be pushed forward with the utmost speed, and that is the restoration of the fertility of land which is potentially sound but which has been drained of its fertility in one way or another.  I hope that no effort will be spared to get from every part of the world where they can be got the raw phosphates which are so essential for this nation.  I hope that no effort will be spared to help our farmers to put into their land all the necessary manures that can be put into it during the time that may be left to us.  I hope also that whatever can be done to produce additional nitrogenous manures in this country will be done, and that all essential fertilisers will be procured.  These are essential and urgent tasks that cannot be left in abeyance.  They must be pushed forward with the utmost speed.</P>
    <P>I do not feel complacent about our industrial and agricultural output.  So far as agriculture is concerned, we have succeeded in getting back to our pre-war output, but that is not enough. We must push forward very much further.  All experts are agreed, and amongst experts I include practical farmers, that our land is capable, with proper treatment, of producing possibly 50 per cent more than it is producing to-day.  I know thousands <Col N="1885" /> of farmers who realise that they are not putting into the soil all the manure that it requires.  They would like to be able to do so, but the majority of the farmers are limited so far as capital is concerned.  We have heard a good deal from the Taoiseach about chronic under-investment in regard to home development.  There is no industry in which there is such under-investment as in agriculture.  During whatever time is left to us, I hope the Minister will bear in mind the necessity for strengthening our agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>The statistical survey issued last year by the Taoiseach's Department revealed one interesting fact.  The figure for net volume of agricultural output for 1939 was given as 100.  In 1942 it was given as 112.  In 1945 it also reached the same figure.  In 1947 it was back to 97 and in 1948 it was 98. It has now reached 102.  But the important point to remember is that we are still 10 per cent. below the figure of output for 1942 and 1945.  We are also below the average figure for the whole emergency period.  I want to know why that should be.  It may be suggested that it is due to the inclusion of turf with agricultural products.  I have not been made aware by any Minister that there has been such a substantial decline in turf production.  I had the feeling that with intensive mechanisation we are keeping up the volume of turf production.  If we are not, I think we should be.  Modern machinery for producing turf ought to be capable of bringing the turf output up to the highest level ever reached during the emergency.  It is desirable from a national point of view that that should be done, thus saving us from sending money out of the country for essential fuel.</P>
    <P>With regard to the possibility of an emergency, it is also essential to ask if the Government have considered arrangements for carrying on industries and transport.  We are turning more and more to the elimination of the horse and the mechanisation of the agricultural industry.  That will take a good deal of the drudgery and hard work out of agriculture and it will appeal to the farmers generally.  Everyone <Col N="1886" /> likes to carry on his work in the most modern and up to date conditions and the farmer is no different from anyone else.  The young farmer naturally is attracted by every form of mechanisation of his holding, but it does raise a problem of supplies of tractor fuel which should be considered very carefully.</P>
    <P>In the recent war, mechanisation had not reached the pitch to which it has been pushed forward during the past few years.  The number of agricultural horses was much greater three or four years ago.  If the process of mechanisation continues, the number will be greatly reduced and a serious problem will arise in regard to the maintenance of our food supply in an emergency.</P>
    <P>I do not want to enter on the contentious matters that have been raised.  I think the Taoiseach would be well advised to discourage the formation of an army by an individual Deputy.  I know that it might be a great asset to every Deputy to have an army of his own, particularly at election times.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a shocking liability.  How would you pay for it?  It is hard enough to pay election expenses, without having to pay for an army.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no harm often to treat matters of this kind in a jocose way, but there is often the possibility of something serious developing out of a complete departure from principle. There ought to be an accepted rule that there is to be only one Army, the Army controlled by this House.  I can see very grave dangers arising, perhaps not from Deputy Cowan or anything that he may do or say, but from others who may be inclined, having regard to the leniency with which he has been treated, to follow his example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach is entitled to ask for co-operation from the Opposition and is entitled to expect it, particularly in times as grave as the present.  He is entitled to expect co-operation in regard to national problems and serious economic problems.  He is also entitled to invite them to come into the Government, so that they might have representation in the Government in proportion to the representation which they have <Col N="1887" /> in this House.  I have frequently made that appeal, both here and outside.  I have no use for an Opposition Party. I believe that every Deputy should be independent to a great extent, in the sense that he should be free to criticise Ministers or Governments.  I believe there should be no definite &ldquo;ins&rdquo; and &ldquo;outs&rdquo; in politics.  That is an old British system, which should be dispensed with.</P>
    <P>An all-Party Government, representative of every section in this House, would carry the country much more safely through any grave danger that may face us in the future, and if no danger does arise it would carry this country much better to times of peace and provide for our people a much better living than we get by having half of the population set in opposition to the other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Defence approached the problems presented to him by the Leader of the Opposition in the wrong spirit, I think.  He started out by trying to find out who was wrong and who was right, rather than by trying to find out what was wrong and what was right.  He can hardly suggest that there is a lack of sincerity on this side of the House, or of earnestness in facing up to a problem which at the moment is making the whole world anxious.  For that reason, it would have been fairer if he had dealt with the suggestions made by Deputy de Valera on their merits, without suggesting wrong motives.  He said that Providence was going to look after us, but &ldquo;God helps those who help themselves.&rdquo; We cannot leave things to be prepared at the last minute.  He said that even two years ago the Leader of the Opposition had been suggesting to the Government that they should give very special attention to our defence problems.  Well, if they had done that at that time and had laid their plans then, we would be in all the stronger a position to-day and we would be all much easier in our minds and less prone to be carried off by any panic which might occur owing to outside causes over which we have no control.</P>

      <P>The Minister's general approach was one of trying to persuade us to go in for a hush-hush policy.  You cannot carry on parliamentary life on those lines.  We must have facts before us, or we cannot form the proper judgements.  There is no use in trying to bluff on the situation.  People outside the country who are interested in the defence position here know that there are no secrets with regard to our defence policy.  There is nothing which can be told in this House which is not very well known already to those who are interested.  The Taoiseach said that vague criticism is of no value.  I want to say that vague statements from Ministers are equally of no value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach was very interesting in his whole statement and approach to the question of investments.  He said that we had not sufficient investments in the country.  That is perfectly true. He said that private enterprise cannot deal with the situation entirely.  A <Col N="1889" /> considerable amount of criticism has come against the independent corporations established in this country.  Are we to assume that the Taoiseach will follow the line he has taken with regard to Córas Iompair Éireann and go in for a code of socialistic propositions of industries supported by the State?  Or will he pursue the line of having independent corporations to deal with the big sources of production?  It would be interesting to have an answer to those questions.</P>
    <P>I shall not attempt to interpret the statistics he gave us, as they would require very close study.  I think I can say that the trend of the statistics showed a strong advocacy of the policy of developing our exports.  The Taoiseach pointed out the incalculable factors in the American market and he led on from that to the tourist traffic.  But he did not tell us what plans he had with regard to the tourist traffic.  That traffic has become bigger than our actual cattle trade.  It requires close attention.  Already the Government has been two years in office and should have been trying to consolidate that traffic by proper planning. We are very anxious, indeed, to know what plans they have for developing the tourist traffic.</P>
    <P>There is a tremendous potential attraction in the country and I think our soundest line of approach would be, first of all, to develop these attractions for our own people in order to, shall I say, &ldquo;exploit&rdquo; our traditions and bring our people to a proper appreciation of them.  The American expert on tourism pointed out that one of our unique features was our national monuments.  Other nations have scenery and attractions which are more or less common to all.  Our national monuments are, as I say, unique.  These monuments require great care.</P>
    <P>This is a problem that cannot be solved by any one Department.  It is natural that it should arise on the Taoiseach's Estimate because there are several Departments involved.  The Department of Industry and Commerce, for instance, deals with development.  I do not want to go into details, but I can instance Tramore as a typical example of gross neglect.  In <Col N="1890" /> my constituency the whole coast-line and into Lismore should be developed. However, to come back to our monuments I want to point out that the right kind of plaques are not put up in order to inform visitors about these. We have not the right kind of guides, such as one finds in other countries, to take our tourists round.  The Department of External Affairs is also involved because it forms a link with outside.  That Department has done something but a great deal still remains to be done in order to develop our natural attractions and our cultural institutions.</P>
    <P>Fisheries are involved, too.  I was amazed at the number of Deputies on the Government Benches who pointed out recently how impossible it is to get fish in country towns.  Whether or not that is due to the irresponsible remark of the Minister for Agriculture that he does not like fish, I do not know.  I know plenty of people who would be delighted to get fish in these out-of-the-way villages.  I believe that if the supply were there the demand would come and I think that demand would help to create a healthy population in the most depopulated areas.</P>
    <P>When we criticise the Government we are immediately told that we are indulging in sabotage.  Are we to behave like dumb, driven cattle?  Are we to be mute as mice?  Are we to do our duty by taking notice of every form of political corruption, deceit and misrepresentation in order to ensure that these things are nipped in the bud?  I suggest we do not indulge in sabotage. Our criticism, if severe at times, is always constructive.  We believe the life of the nation must go on no matter what Government is in power.  In one sense we are in a very awkward position because we are embarrassed to some extent by the success of Fianna Fáil policy.  We get Fianna Fáil policy hurled at us now in an attempt to destroy us.  From the point of view of the nation, that is a good thing.  I could not help feeling, when the Tánaiste was pontificating upon his Department to-day, that, after all, he was just building on the foundations we had laid and that, if we had not built up what he built on, he would not be able to do what he did.</P>

      <P>First of all, might I have the temerity to ask the Taoiseach to examine a matter brought to his <Col N="1892" /> notice by the Leader of the Opposition to-day when he referred to the possibility of making available to the Oireachtas a staff, which would be an addition to the staff of the statistics branch, under the control of the Taoiseach?  The staff of the statistics branch has quite deservedly received the highest praise since it has taken up duty in its new Department.  The Leader of the Opposition referred to a body of men in the Congress of the United States who are referred to, so far as I understand, as economic analysts.  These men make available to the members of both Houses there all information, statistical and otherwise, in such a form as to leave it untinged by a political approach either one way or the other.  I would ask the Taoiseach to examine that suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In approaching this Estimate this year I have a very clear recollection of the statement made by the Taoiseach in introducing his Estimate last year. In that statement he took a certain amount of credit for having brought about what he described as good housekeeping. He indicated that through the good housekeeping of his administration the adverse balance of trade had been considerably reduced.  On that occasion I drew his attention to the position which could arise as a result of a misinterpretation of the monetary situation as it might affect us.  I indicated that devaluation could come and that, if devaluation were to come, what appeared to be good housekeeping then could, in fact, turn out to be the reverse. To-day, the Taoiseach gave us a new set of analyses and comparisons to some of which I want to refer.  He gave us, among other things, a comparison of the liabilities and assets of the State, and gave one very peculiar explanation.  He told us that, in the liabilities of the State, of some £150,000,000, there was a liability of £21,000,000, being the receipts from the economic co-operation fund.  At the same time he stated that some of that money, while taken as a liability and as an asset had in fact been utilised for certain purposes.  I suggest that if a certain amount of this money has been devoted to certain schemes what <Col N="1893" /> has been produced by it should be valued as an asset and not reckoned just as if it were taken from one pocket and put into another.  It has been put into circulation and will create something. The value of what has been created as an asset can be calculated at some later date.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the Taoiseach that we should examine the capital liabilities of the State to-day.  We should have some regard, in assessing the value of these items, not to what they cost in the past, but to their real value to-day in relation to the value of money.  If we took out a balance sheet we might find that some of the assets, included in that list of assets, would bring our assets to-day, with regard to the value of money, almost to, if not over, the value of our total liabilities. I mention that for the purpose of pointing out to the Taoiseach that we must not lose sight of the fact that, when we are given figures in relation to assets and liabilities, whether they are composed of money on the one hand or of institutions, they do not portray a proper picture.  In the same way, when we are dealing to-day with money, from the point of view of its world value, we should remember that we are dealing with something that is fluctuating in value.</P>
    <P>I said last year that I had grave apprehensions as to the stability of the nation.  Again, I say there is every evidence that we can be faced with a further devaluation of the £, not in the distant future.  One may ask what has led me to that conclusion.  In the free markets of money, not the control exchanges, the £ to-day can be bought cheaper than at its controlled rate.  The £ sterling, instead of being sold at the equivalent of two dollars 80 cents is being sold at two dollars 40 cents, which is a drop, in world opinion, of the value of the £ note of another 14 per cent.  I suggest that, when we come to consider the position of the affairs of the State we must bear in mind that the £ note, or the coinage we use, is no longer static.  It is a fluctuating commodity.</P>
    <P>On a previous occasion I attempted to make a reference to the Coinage Act.  I was ruled out of order then <Col N="1894" /> because the Coinage Bill was not before this House.  It has since been passed by the Seanad and is now on our Order Paper.  With the permission of the Chair, I would like to make a short reference to it and a suggestion to the Taoiseach.  When that measure is passed by the Dáil, it will become the Coinage Act.  According to the Minister for Finance, the purpose of it will be to call in silver coinage and substitute for it what is called cupro nickel.  The Minister for Finance indicated in the Seanad that, as a result of doing that, the State Exchequer would benefit to the extent of £1,000,000 by selling the silver bullion and by using the new form of cupro nickel.  I want to suggest to the Taoiseach that we should keep that silver in our Central Bank as a commodity which will have an international value.  It will not fluctuate downwards if our coinage falls.  If we sell it for 1,000,000 £ notes we may find, in time, that these will have only one-third or half the value of their present rate.  I suggest that it would be a good thing to start keeping that silver within the control of the nation as a backing for the paper money issued.  It is a commodity which will have a value.  In time to come it will be a form of guarantee for our paper money if, at any time in the wisdom of those who are in control, it is decided that we should break the link with sterling and have our own independent currency.</P>
    <P>I make that suggestion to the Taoiseach and would ask him to pass it on for examination.  We hear a lot of talk about the repatriation of money from abroad.  If that is ever accomplished, I believe we will have reached the position when we can afford to anchor our own currency to whatever sort of backing we decide on whether it is with regard to our earning capacity as a nation, to our trade, or to whatever we have in the shape of commodities.</P>
    <P>From time to time we hear a great deal of talk about the repatriation of capital from abroad.  It was discussed to-day.  It is a question that is greatly confused by some people with what they call breaking the link with sterling &mdash;in other words having our own currency.  As regards the arguments in <Col N="1895" /> favour of the repatriation of capital, a question arises as to how it will be employed.  What the Leader of the Opposition said to-day is quite obvious, that you just cannot take it back and leave it no longer a dividend earning investment.  You cannot just dissipate it, and have it disappear.  It is obvious that it has to be done on the basis of where and how it can be employed for the benefit of the nation, for the development of industry and so on, but without the destruction of it, from the point of view of its existence, because it belongs to the great number of people who have credit balances.  In that connection, I have come to the conclusion that where the State to-day seeks to get large sums of money made available to it for State purposes, it finds itself in competition with private enterprise which is also seeking to attract capital for the development of larger industrial enterprises.</P>
    <P>In the manner in which we are going on to-day, a position has been reached in my opinion where money, when it is available for investment, is attracted either to the Government for Government schemes or to private enterprise for other schemes, to the extent to which either the State or private enterprise is prepared to pay in the shape of interest, which some people call a tribute, for making that money available. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has made it clear, without any reservation whatever, that he is anxious to see industrial development in this country continued at as rapid a pace as possible with all the benefits that will accrue to the nation from it&mdash; the reduction of the adverse trade balance, the production in this country of all the goods this country needs and so forth.  We have reached a stage where apparently there is a unanimous acceptance that that is a desirable development.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear the Taoiseach say in connection with that matter and in connection with the blessing, if you like, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has given to the development of industry, that what has been said in the past will no longer be <Col N="1896" /> repeated, that those who start these industries will not be described, if they become successful in industry, as racketeers, buccaneers and all the rest of it.  The industrial development of this country is of great importance from every point of view.  I think the time has come when an indication should be given that it is no longer considered an evil thing and that those who were prepared to establish industries and conduct them properly, under whatever controls are thought necessary, are entitled to have the benefits of the profits which accrue to them as a result of their ability to make such profits.</P>
    <P>Some cross-talk was indulged in here to-day about what had been promised in pre-election times and what had been accomplished.  I think all of us on this side of the House would join with Deputy Little in congratulating the Government and the Parties that make it up, in having adopted to a great extent what we regard as the Fianna Fáil policy.  I think the time has come when we should cease from this side of the House producing all the pre-election promises of the different Parties, pointing out all the different promises that were made by these Parties which they said would be put into effect if any one of them became the Government, and we should concentrate on considering, not the pre-election promises but the post-election promises made by the combination of Parties.  In that connection I should like to refer to the ten points on which they came together and I think it would be fair to launch a criticism with regard to the extent to which these ten points have been achieved. I can remember only a few of them. Certainly, one of them was a reduction in the cost of living.  Well, that has not been achieved and I do not think it can be achieved.  I am prepared to admit that since the devaluation of the £ we all have to agree that No.1 can be crossed off and the inter-Party Government is then left with nine points.</P>
    <P>We have a variety of items in these nine points.  As I say, I can remember only a few of them and I do not want to deal with them in the same manner as I have dealt with No.1.  We were to <Col N="1897" /> have increased production in everything. In that connection, the Taoiseach gave us some very interesting figures.  It is quite true that none of us could write down these figures quickly enough.  I was in for only part of them and we probably will not be able to examine the figures until we get them eventually in the Official Report. In connection with production, does the Taoiseach not agree that whenever a statement is made as to so many million pounds' worth of goods produced or sold that we should get side by side with that the quantities?</P>

      <P>I am very glad to hear that.  It will be very interesting to read because it is something of which I wanted to make a study.  Furthermore, in connection with production, I should like to make this suggestion to the Taoiseach and to the Government as a whole.  I thought that the Minister for Health had gone a good distance towards being reasonable in introducing his Estimate and in replying to the debate this year, as compared with previous years, because he did say that were it not for the plans which he had found in his office which were left there by his predecessors, a great deal of the work which he had accomplished would not be accomplished at this moment.  Would it not be possible for the Government now, after two and a half years in office, to say: &ldquo;We have also reached a stage where we agree that while we claim we have brought about increased production, that increased production has been brought about in a great many of the industries started by our predecessors.&rdquo; It is all very well for Deputies <Col N="1898" /> opposite to say that there was a danger of closing down our boot factories because a big quota had been given for the importation of British manufactured boots some few years ago but when we took office in 1932 we were not self-sufficient, so far as the manufacture of boots and shoes was concerned.  We are to-day.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  The fact is that that over-sufficiency will bring greater competition amongst manufacturers and the most efficient will survive. The country will get the benefit of that competition.  In a great many other industries, increased production would have been possible if there had been a similar approach to this problem. A great deal of the arguments in this House could be avoided if there was a greater degree of concession from one side of the House to the other on what could be regarded as just simple plain facts.</P>
      <P>I would also say in that connection that there is at this moment the danger of a world conflict, the danger of another emergency, and requests were made for co-operation.  I think everybody in this House, irrespective of Party, will agree that where the interests of this country are affected from outside, the Government, whatever Government it is, can always rely on the fullest and absolute co-operation not only from every member of this House but from every section of the community.  In time of emergency, in time of war, the fact remains that it is the country that is involved and that political differences must take second or third place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a comment to make on that matter.  I have heard that when certain of the elected representatives have been outside this country, they have discussed matters concerning the welfare of the nation and on occasion personalities were indulged in.  I am glad that the Minister for External Affairs is here because he probably will be the first to appreciate what I say. I have heard from America, for instance, that on occasions when certain representatives of this country were <Col N="1899" /> over there a debunking almost of the Leader of the Opposition was attempted.</P>
    <P>I was at a function in Paris some years ago and I met the leader of the opposition of a certain little country where there was great bitterness between the opposition and the Prime Minister's Party.  In the course of a toast to him I heard him asked to give the assembly some indication of his opinion of his Prime Minister and his answer was: &ldquo;Any differences between the Prime Minister and myself are differences which exist in my country when I am at home.  When I am abroad, he is the Prime Minister of my country.  He is the elected representative of the people and he is the Prime Minister to whom I give my respect when I am abroad.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Can we not talk in the same way of either the present holder of that office or the Leader of the Opposition?  Can we not keep our political differences here among ourselves and when we go abroad add to the dignity which this country deserves by not discussing our domestic affairs but rather our national affairs?  Abroad, wherever we may be, we are all agreed that one of the things that concerns us and that we must do is to push the question of the abolition of Partition.  On that we are all in full agreement and that is the question that should concern us when we meet people outside.</P>

If people are encouraged to get into the production of items that have taken a sudden steep rise there can be the danger of the opposite happening when a reverse takes place.  To take credit as if these benefits had accrued to the people as a result of Government policy instead of as a result of circumstances entirely beyond our control is to use an expression that the people know how to assess.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The final thing I come to is the discussion we have had on taxation.  I think it was one of the ten points that taxation should be reduced.  In this country we have a direct form of taxation in the shape of income-tax, surtax and excess corporation profits tax, but we also have a form of indirect taxation such as the excise on cigarettes, tobacco and drink.  It is true that income-tax was reduced by 6d. in the £ but when it is stated that taxation has been reduced, I think we must bulk the lot together and recognise that since greater revenue has accrued to the Exchequer we must find some cause for it.  Is it not a fact&mdash;and I am sure this must interest Labour Deputies&mdash; that one of the causes is that, due to increases in wages and salaries, a greater number of people have reached the income-tax paying level?  Whether the over-all rate of 7/- has been reduced to 6/6, or to whatever figure it stands at, the fact remains that there are many thousands paying income-tax now who never paid it before, so that taxation has not been reduced.  It has been spread over a wider number of persons. Taxation is whatever the Exchequer receives, whether by direct or indirect taxation, and, in addition, we have to remember that there is such a thing as local taxation.  If we are to have discarded by the Government its responsibility for certain payments from the Exchequer, or if there are to be reductions in these contributions by the Exchequer, and if these responsibilities are to be imposed on the ratepayers, it is again not a reduction of taxation but a change in the incidence of taxation from one shoulder to another or a change from one method of payment to another.  I do not understand how people outside are expected to believe it when they see a great increase in the income of the State being expressed as lower taxation.  In some cases there seems to be such an opinion of the public intelligence as to <Col N="1903" /> amount almost to contempt, but I think the people are able to size the situation up and I think they will in time come to indicate what they regard as right.</P>
    <P>I say to the Taoiseach that we have reached the time from the point of view of a possible national emergency at which we shall have to conduct our housekeeping for the next few years not on the lines we thought of a few years ago, when we seemed to be heading for permanent peace, but on the lines of looking forward to a situation in which we could easily have to undergo great hardship and suffering as a result of what would then be regarded as bad housekeeping for the nation.  In addition, the question of our financial arrangements with the outside world is also involved.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to the need for examining whether our defensive measures are up to requirements, or whether a greater effort should be made in that regard.  I think the people as a whole would be pleased to see the most extraordinary provision made in order to enable us to defend ourselves, both from the point of view of nourishing ourselves and defending ourselves physically if attacked.  If the danger passes and all these measures prove to be what might be called wasteful, we on this side will be the last to point the finger at the Government and to say: &ldquo;Your insurance expenditure was unwise.&rdquo;  The Taoiseach need not worry about political capital being sought to be made on this side because there may be a residue of unused arms, ammunition, fuel or any commodity the State may have thought it necessary to provide for its people.  The nation will back the Government in taking every measure possible to make the people feel that security measures have been provided, and if, in time to come, they are found to have been only an insurance premium, from what I know of the members on this side and of the people who support this Party, they will applaud rather than abuse.</P>

      <P>I would not have intervened in this debate were it not for the speech delivered by the Minister for Defence.  I have been a member of this House for 20 years and I have listened to many heated debates, but of all the exhibitions of vindictiveness, of <Col N="1905" /> spite and of viciousness I ever listened to, the speech of the Minister for Defence was the worst.  It seemed to be deliberately intended to prevent anything like co-operation in the matter of the defence of this country and it seemed to be intended to kill any inclination towards co-operation or unity.</P>
      <P>The Minister, by innuendo, accused the Opposition, and particularly the Leader of the Opposition, of disclosing the strength of our defences, and then, in direct contradiction of that idea, went on to explain in minute detail the resources we had in the shape of what might be called trained men.  He talked about all the supplies he had and sought to create the impression that huge quantities of military supplies were coming into the country without the knowledge of the people.  We are living under a constitutional Government and I always thought that, under the Constitution, money could not be spent by any Department of State, unless this House voted it.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWalsh" hpid="Mr. R. Walsh Mr. R. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach will allow me to make my speech.  I do not usually interrupt him or any other speaker.  My contention is that, having gone to all that trouble, after a vicious harangue and making every spiteful statement he could make, he proceeded, as I said, to disclose, if it could be called a disclosure, the military strength of this country.  After all that, he proceeded to disclose, if it could be called a disclosure, the military strength of this country, while his major accusation against the Opposition was that we were doing so.</P>
      <P>The Minister then referred to the numerous trained men that there are in the country and told us that they would spring to arms.  I have no doubt at all that the men who entered the Defence Forces, either the Regular Army or the auxiliary force, will answer the call if necessity arises.  By the way the Minister spoke, it looked as if he had a secret understanding with Joe Stalin or some other body that when an emergency would come Joe would kindly send him word to the effect: &ldquo;We are going over Dublin to-morrow night with our planes.  Tell the people to go to the Phoenix Park so as to be out of the way.&rdquo;  He ridiculed the idea of mobilisation&mdash;no matter how critical the situation became, it would not be right to mobilise these men; it would be a waste of labour.  He forgot that thousands of men are leaving this country every year.  The Government has not taken any steps to stop them.  If an emergency arises, those men will be sorely missed.  Now we are told that it would be bad policy, bad tactics, to mobilise the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, as I have said, we were told a fairy story about fabulous shiploads of munitions that are coming into this country, pouring up secretly to somewhere in this city.  It brings the minds of some of us back to days gone by when we smuggled a revolver or something of that description.  I repeat that of all the viciousness and spitefulness and vindictiveness I have ever heard, I heard the worst exhibition of <Col N="1907" /> it that could be given in this House to-night by the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like if the Taoiseach would tell us which of his sMinisters we are to believe in respect to policy, especially in regard to the policy spoken of by Deputy Walsh. After the passing of the Ireland Bill the Taoiseach said in O'Connell Street that they would hurt these people in their pride and in their pocket.  On 3rd March, in Cork, the Minister for Defence said that they would appeal to that &ldquo;lion-hearted statesman, Winston Churchill.&rdquo;  As far as I can gather from replies to questions in this House about the defence of this country, I am coming to believe that it is on some people like him that the Government intend to rely.  Of course, it would not be the first time that some of the members of that Government relied on the same gentleman.  I quote from the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of 4th March:-</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dr. O'Higgins, who concluded with an appeal to Mr. Churchill to use his &lsquo;immense influence and unquestioned prestige&rsquo; towards a settlement of a question of &lsquo;farreaching importance to the democratic world in its stand against the Communist menace,&rsquo; pointed out that in a great defence line from Iceland to the American continent, there was a vacuum in the centre, a vacuum represented on the map of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I wonder what does the Minister for External Affairs think of that policy. Is that the policy that he would adopt, of appealing to the man who helped to create Partition to do away with it now, or, does the Minister for Defence realise that he is making a laughing stock of himself in the Six Counties and in England by appealing to a man who did everything in his power to injure this country?  Is that the attitude we are going to take up to defend this country against any foreign invader or anything else?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we had two other Deputies, Deputy Giles and Deputy Collins, whose attitude was that, it did not matter what happened the Six <Col N="1908" /> Counties, we were going to join the Atlantic Pact.  That happens to be the attitude, as far as I can see, of the Fine Gael Party in this Government and I want to know does the Taoiseach stand over the attitude that we should be appealing, at this stage, after all our talks of republics and everything else, to Winston Churchill to finish the Border.  I think it is a very sad reflection on all the boastings and fireworks we had in the Phoenix Park.</P>

      <P>This evening, when the Taoiseach was introducing his Estimate, he reminded me of the many occasions that he was in court with a client who had a bad case.  By the time he was finished appealing for the client, the jury were practically convinced that the case was a sound one. Certainly, this evening, he tried to make a very good case out of what is a very bad one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach did not always convince the jury.  The Taoiseach tried to do with figures what the Minister for Agriculture tried to do for the English with eggs.  He tried to drown us in figures without anyone having time to examine them and to know exactly how they worked out. The difficulty that is facing the Taoiseach is that the team he is relying on are not a reliable team.  If the Taoiseach is to carry out any programme for the betterment of the country he must have beside him Ministers upon whom the country and the Taoiseach himself can place reliance, whatever about the propaganda they might be prepared to make in order to have themselves returned to this House at any future date.  They should put the interests of the country first and Party politics after.  Unfortunately I am afraid that is not being done.  I have listened to most of this debate. The only Deputy who made a very serious effort to come to the Taoiseach's rescue was Deputy Cowan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cowan complimented the Ministers and pointed out the numerous difficulties they encountered as new <Col N="1909" /> Ministers who took office without having had any departmental or administrative experience.  It is because of that and because of the way they have tried to bluff in their offices and here day after day that the policy which the Taoiseach so often announced could be, but is not being, put into effect.  I listened to Deputy Cowan tell us that the health of the people had improved and tell us of all the things which this Government had done.  Of course, he did not omit to tell us that the Fianna Fáil Party, despite all their years of office, did nothing and that now they are making every effort to sabotage this country and adopt a policy of obstruction. He said that we obstructed when the Local Authorities (Works) Act was being put through this House.  Every Deputy in this House will remember that before that Bill was introduced we were informed that it would be a four line Bill: actually, it turned out to be a Bill of, I think, four sections. We offered amendments and we criticised the Bill in an endeavour to make it a Bill that would be workable.  There is not a Deputy sitting on the Government Benches who can deny that by the time the Bill passed through this House in all its stages the Minister had not alone added a number of sections but there was very little comparison to be found between it and the Bill as it was originally introduced.</P>

      <P>If the Ceann Comhairle will pardon me, I should like to point out that we have been charged with obstructing.  Our criticism of the Local Authorities (Works) Act on its different stages is referred to as an example of obstruction by us.  I contend that any time we criticised either that Bill or the Land Bill or any Bill it was for the purpose of improving the Bill in question. I may say that the Land Bill was improved time and time again and it was a better Bill when it was passed by this House than it was when it was introduced.  If we criticised any piece of legislation it was for the purpose of ensuring that it would be useful to the people of this country and I think the facts prove conclusively that our criticism was fruitful.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowan told us that he joined the Army in 1922 and he then proceeded to challenge the Leader of the Opposition regarding his activities since then.  He joined the Army in 1922 for the purpose of establishing a Treaty which recognised the unnatural Partition of this country and to-day he is trying to establish an army to try to remove that boundary.  If that is not jumping, I should like to know what is.</P>

Deputy Cowan went further than that. I suppose he sort of let the cat out of the bag.  Whenever any of the members on the Government Benches get up on any platform in the country they always talk about our Constitution and say what a great Constitution it is They impress upon the people that it is their duty to obey the Constitution and to stand by it.  This evening Deputy Cowan described our Constitution as a &ldquo;face saver&rdquo;.  I wonder if the Taoiseach agrees with him in that statement.  If the Taoiseach agrees with him in that statement he must agree also that the Bill which was <Col N="1911" /> brought in here to establish the Republic was also a face saver.</P>

I consider that credit should be given in this House for work well done no matter which Government may have done it and credit should be given to the Fianna Fáil Party for all it did while it was the Government of this country.  No matter what this present combination of Parties who constitute the Government have in mind, the speople of this country are quite satisfied that, despite the statements which are made in this House day after day by Deputies on the Government Benches to the effect that nothing was done by Fianna Fáil during the 16 years it was in office, Fianna Fáil was a good Government for this country. I think the people are well aware that even now the present Government are working on a Housing Bill that was produced by Fianna Fáil.  I would point out, too, that despite the boasts of the Minister for Lands, legislation <Col N="1912" /> regarding the division of land was produced by Fianna Fáil.  Even the boasts made by the Minister for Agriculture regarding his work for land reclamation ring some what hollow when we remember that the headline was set in that respect by Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>I will give them full credit.  I think that the Taoiseach must realise that if Ministers and Deputies who sit on the Government Benches make statements throughout the country to the effect that representations made to Government Departments on behalf of individuals throughout the country are useless unless they are made by individuals on the Government Benches, they are doing a grave wrong and that such statements should not be made.  In any event, when a Deputy approaches a Department to make representations on behalf of a constituent the Department gives the same attention to every Deputy no matter to what political Party he may belong.  I think I am quite right in saying that, and I believe the Taoiseach will agree with me.  Therefore, it is very wrong of Government Deputies and Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries to try to create any other impression.  The behaviour of Deputies opposite, with their grunting and snorting, reminds me very much of the family to which <Col N="1913" /> I would suggest they belong&mdash;but I will leave the rest unsaid.</P>
      <P>The last item that I have mentioned is one, I think, that the Taoiseach should make a statement on when he is concluding the debate.  I have never met with discourtesy myself in the various Departments.  In every Department I have gone to I got the greatest courtesy from the officials, whether on matters relating to old age pensions, the Board of Works or any other Department.  I do not want the impression to be created outside that if a Fianna Fáil Deputy goes in person to make a representation, it might be much better for any other person to do it.  That impression has been created and I would like the Taoiseach to indicate whether it is right or wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene in this debate for the purpose of registering an emphatic protest against the treatment meted out by this Administration to the people in the congested districts, and particularly the people in Connemara. It is true that at the best of times the people in that area have a rather precarious existence.  It is equally true that under the Fianna Fáil régime, with the development of turf schemes, with bog development and road development and with extensive grants under the minor employment schemes, there was work available to the people.  The Fianna Fáil Government provided South Connemara, anyway, with a glasshouse scheme which, if allowed to develop, would be of tremendous economic advantage to the people in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present position there is very bad.  There is wholesale unemployment and one consequence of that is wholesale emigration.  Any Deputy can go down to meet the western trains at any time and he will find plenty of people on their way to England.  The Commission on Emigration cannot settle that problem.  What the people require is work.  I should like the Taoiseach to tell us what he intends to do for that particular area.  Is it the policy of the Government to get out of its difficulty simply by letting the people emigrate?  If that is the policy, then it is succeeding.  It would be a very grave indictment of an Irish Government <Col N="1914" /> if it were to allow conditions like that to continue.  I make the appeal now that some attention should be given to the problems in that particular area, and that the Government should proceed with schemes there, particularly in relation to turf and bog development and the improvement of roads, so as to give much needed employment.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which affects the people of that area, just as it affects the people of Dublin City, and that is the operation of the dual price system. It always seemed to me to be a terrible thing, in a Catholic country like this, that you should have two prices, one for the man who is well off and another for the man with only a small amount of money.  It is also a terrible indictment of the Labour representatives here that they ever stood for that.  The people most affected by it are the poor, the working man with a large family who has to depend on bread, butter and tea.  It is very easy to understand in a place like Connemara where they have not much of the world's goods and where they are happy in having large families that they have to buy food outside their rations.  It is all right for the Minister to say that the rationed goods are sufficient.  That may be all right for people in the cities who can afford a better table, who can have varied commodities on the table, including plenty of fresh meat and vegetables.  In Connemara the people have to depend mainly on flour, butter, tea and sugar.  To me it is a scandalous business that you should have this dual price system in operation.  At least it can be said of Fianna Fáil that during the war years they maintained an equal price for all the citizens.</P>

      <P>Your Government was the first to let the offenders out&mdash;we all know that.  Another matter to which I would like to direct attention is housing, and particularly the financing of housing schemes.  The position is very disturbing to people who examine what is happening in relation to housing.  The Minister for Finance, in his Budget statement, said it was the purpose of the Government partly to <Col N="1915" /> relieve the Exchequer of the charge in respect of housing by the introduction of the differential rents system, but that tends to make the worker pay a higher rent; that is really what is happening.  By a very devious method, the Minister for Local Government has sent a circular to local authorities advising them to adopt the differential rent system, and the whole purpose behind it is that if such a scheme is economic&mdash;that is, if the rents accruing do not warrant a contribution from the rates&mdash;then the Central Fund is relieved of its contribution and also of its contribution to the Transition Development Fund.  The result is that the rents on the working classes will go up. There are schemes with rents ranging from 31/4 for a working-class house to a minimum figure of 11/4.  Under the Fianna Fáil régime the Central Fund paid 60 per cent. of the cost of houses. Those figures can be vouched for.</P>

      <P>They did not say they would refuse a grant under the Transition Development Fund, which your own Minister said.  At the present rate, even taking in the Transition Development grant and the two-thirds subsidy, it is less than 50 per cent. as against Fianna Fáil's 60 per cent.  With the introduction of the differential rent system the effect will be that workers will have to pay higher rents and every increase the worker will get one-sixth of it will be represented in his rent. I do not know what the workers' representatives are doing if they allow such a position to develop.  If they come to Galway soon they will be told what is what.  It is a terrible thing that they continue to support a Government which does that to the workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>Grow up and be your age.  I advise the Deputy not to say too much about that or he might get a reply he would not like.  The Government should face its responsibilities and in the matter of housing fix a definite contribution from the Central Fund that will enable the local authority to let houses at a rent which the workers can pay.  The Minister for Finance has said that the Transition Development Fund will be wound up this year and merged in the Local Government Vote.  He also qualified it by saying that the subsidy for workers' rents would be reduced&mdash; which means that those rents will be higher.</P>
      <P>I would also like to protest against the action of the Government in raising the rate of interest to local authorities. It is true that that has not been done purely for the superstructure of housing, but the rate of interest is increased for the acquisition of land, for development, sewerage work, and so on.  We heard a lot about cheap money, but it is extraordinary that it was the Fianna Fáil Minister who in 1944 brought in the policy of giving loans to local authorities at 2½ per cent. while one of the first actions of the present Government was to raise it to 3¼ per cent.</P>
      <P>I would make a slight reference to rural electrification.  While very good work has been done in our constituency, it would appear from the Vote that there has been a falling off in the moneys voted for that.</P>

      <P>Tá cúpla ceist agam don Taoiseach.  Bhíos ag éisteacht <Col N="1917" /> leis an cheist a chur an Teachta de Valera air, ar cheist na mbóthar fan dtuaith agus ar cheist an airgid, agus chuir sé in iúil dhom an Meastachán a scrúdú.  Dúirt an Teachta de Valera go mba cheart go ndéanfaí iarracht i dtaobh na daoine fán dtuaith a bhí in a gcomhnuidhe ann agus a bhí ag imeacht agus ar siubhal as na feirmeacha. Dúirt sé go mbeadh siad ar siubhal chomh fada is nach mbeadh slí beatha maith acu.</P>
      <P>I want to reiterate what Deputy de Valera said about conditions in the rural parts, that if the people are to be kept on the land they must have the same amenities as the people in the towns and cities.  They must have good roads and good boreens into their residences.  They cannot be asked any longer to go through muck and slush on those boreens on their various occupations. The maintenance of the country roads has been evaded by this Government. They or their successors will have to face the responsibility.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach was speaking about the financial position of the State and it reminded me of the note that the Minister for Finance has in the Book of Estimates for the current financial year.  In the latter portion he is dealing with the segregation of capital services and current expenditure and he states:-</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For a full account of capital outlay financed by borrowing, regard must, of course, be had not only to the capital services included in this volume but also to the direct issues from the Central Fund for advances to the Electricity Supply Board, the Local Loans Fund, etc., estimates of which appear in the White Paper of receipts and expenditure published prior to the annual Budget.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been an attempt all along by the Government to mix up current expenditure with capital expenditure. In this segregation the Government takes, for instance, the question of grants to local authorities for the execution of works under the Local Authorities (Works) Act of 1949, £1,750,000.  Since I have become a member of this House, there has been current expenditure, under the heading <Col N="1918" /> of minor relief schemes, for this work.  That will occur every year. How that can be put under capital expenditure confuses me altogether.  It is current expenditure and it is falsity to put it under another head.  Not only will these works have to continue but, as I have advocated here on the Estimate for the Office of Public Works, there will have to be a State scheme for their maintenance when they are done.  Consequently, it is wrong for the Government to put that particular item down as capital expenditure. It is an annual expenditure and should be treated as current expenditure.</P>
    <P>In the same way, housing grants were always made out of current expenditure.  Any person examining the rural needs for housing knows that the back of the problem will not be broken for the next ten years, even at a conservative estimate.  In my own county, which is a go-ahead one and which the Minister for Local Government will admit is a go-ahead country, I have seen elaborate schemes formulated and drafted for solving the rural housing problem; but no matter what we do, the progress is not all we desire.  The same applies to a greater extent to other southern counties about which I have read, where they have not gone on with housing at the rate we have done.  In my county, I estimate about 800 rural houses will be needed.  We are building only about 80, notwithstanding the introduction of direct labour methods.  I cannot see how this money for housing can be treated as capital expenditure.  It is a current expenditure and the problem of the housing of the farmers will become more and more pressing and will have to be faced up to by this Government or the Government that succeeds it.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the Gaeltacht. Anyone conversant with the Gaeltacht and the congestion there knows the number of houses on uneconomic holdings there that need to be pulled down and replaced.  The back of the housing problem in the Gaeltacht, with the best intentions, will not be broken for at least ten years.  How you can treat that as capital expenditure is beyond me.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1919" /> From my knowledge of history, it strikes me that any country which keeps on borrowing, instead of taking its courage in its hands and taxing the people to their bearable capacity to meet current expenditure, cannot advance in the national interest.  They are only biting off their noses to spite their faces.  We have to-day the example of France where one Government after another collapses and where the value of the franc depreciates every six months.  The Minister for Finance has stated that excessive borrowing leads to inflation.  If there is inflation, then the cost of living&mdash;which this Government promised to bring down&mdash;goes up. In two years the interest and sinking fund of the national liabilities has gone up from £3,250,000 to £6,500,000.  I have read out a number of items which I said should not be treated as capital expenditure.  These items will recur next year and the year after and the increase in the redemption of capital will go on at such a rate that deflation must follow, the cost of living will go up and the Government that succeeds the Coalition Government will find itself faced with no enviable task.  It is time the Taoiseach and those responsible examined the state of the Exchequer. The Minister for Finance made reference in his statement to the fact that in one year there has been an appreciable rise in the national debt. At column 1638 of Volume 120 of the Official Report the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The gross State debt on 31st March, 1950, stood at £151,000,000 as compared with £116,000,000 on 31st March, 1949.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is it not time that those responsible should take cognisance of this matter? Scoring political points is all right, but we should have a national outlook on these matters.  That outlook does not appear to exist on the Government Benches at the moment.</P>

I never thought I should have to listen to such a bitter speech as that delivered by the Minister for Defence to-night. It was brimful of hatred.  We care very little about that.  We care very little about the man who on one occasion referred to the immense influence and unquestioned prestige of Winston Churchill.  We care very little how he denounces Fianna Fáil or shows his hatred for the greatest leader Europe has produced, Eamon de Valera.  Were it not that the times are so dangerous, we would let these speeches pass just as we have let many speeches of that kind pass before this.  This is not the time for preaching hatred.  This is not the time for dividing the national forces.  Possibly in weeks or months this same Minister for Defence may be appealing to the people to defend our independence.</P>

      <P>The defence of this country will be primarily one for the Minister for Defence.  Nothing short of a revolution in Russia will stay the tide of world war so that democracy may be saved for another 100 years.  Is it by preaching hatred that the Minister will find his volunteer Army?  On the last occasion when this country was threatened we had many men with military experience, members of the Old I.R.A., who were anxious and willing to defend our independence.  They may not be available to help in organising another defence force.  The Minister will have to retrace his steps and cease this policy of bitterness if he hopes to meet any threat to our security, with a united front.  Let nobody be foolish enough to think that other nations will not demand our ports or air bases.  We must be in a position to answer that demand, we must take every step to ensure that this country will not be brought at a low price, or even at a high price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see the F.C.A. reorganised on a war basis.  I think it should be possible to do that.  We have <Col N="1921" /> patriotic young men who, if they were given facilities for training, would from the nucleus of a very effective army.  The Minister for Defence has failed to carry out the promises he made with regard to establishing halls throughout the country for the use of the F.C.A. so that they could be trained in military strategy and the art of war for the defence of the country's independence.  Our agricultural position should be strengthened so that, in the event of war, we would not have to cave in because of the want of the necessaries of life, particularly of wheat.  If the Minister for Agriculture pursues his present policy of grass we will soon be back again to ranching, pandering to the ranchers who farm from their hall-door steps. We do not want that position.  We must remember that it was the working farmers of the country who kept us in food during the last emergency, and they are the people who will again come to the rescue of the nation if the necessity should arise.  I want to refer briefly to the dilatory methods of the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>I said that if the Leas-Cheann Comhairle did not deal with them I would.  I take it the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will.  That is his duty.  The Taoiseach, and the Minister for Defence, should have dealt, I think, in a better and in a clearer manner than they did with Government policy in view of the present world situation. The Minister for Defence laid down, as Government policy in relation to defence, that he was going to sharpen the sword when the drums beat for battle, but not before that.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Defence was going to leave every man at the plough or to look after bullocks if the Minister for Agriculture has his way; he was going to leave every man in the factory until war broke out.  That would be all fine and dandy, as the Americans say, if the other fellow would do the same, but we know that the situation in one part of the world in recent weeks was that, while one Government was acting on the thesis of the Minister for Defence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; the other Government <Col N="1924" /> was acting on a completely different one, and that five years' training told inside a couple of weeks.  We know of course that one of the reasons why Deputy Cowan praised the Taoiseach so much and praised the Minister for Defence, was that he would like us to continue to act on the principle that we sharpen the sword when the drums beat for battle, but he does not act in that particular way himself.  Why does he not apply that in his own case?  He wants the rest of us to be disarmed, and he will sharpen the sword and tell us where to get off.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowan wants the present Government for his own particular purposes, which I do not think he has disclosed very frankly either to the House or to the country, to continue in that fashion.</P>
      <P>While the Government have been carrying on as they have in regard to the Army for the past couple of years, other countries of Western Europe have been devoting 25 per cent to 30 per cent. of their national energy to defensive purposes.  The Minister for Defence recently complained that, owing to a certain situation, this country would be a vacuum in case of war.  We all know that war, as well as nature, abhors a vacuum and if we do not fill the vacuum, if there is a vacuum in the Western World, it will be filled by somebody else.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowan would like it to be filled by a certain section and the Minister for Agriculture by another section but I do not want it to be filled by either of their friends.  I want to see it filled by Irishmen.  Before the last war, we had to consider the question as to whether it was right and proper that we should expend a fair proportion of our national energy in trying to organise to keep all sides out. In spite of great opposition at that time, we did succeed in so developing our resources, in so training our young men and inspiring them with a correct sense of duty, that we were able to keep <Col N="1925" /> all sides out&mdash;both the gentlemen whom the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Agriculture would praise and the people whom, perhaps, Deputy Cowan would praise.</P>

      <P>We want to put it to the Taoiseach that it is his duty, in the present world situation, to base Government policy, not on any likelihood of a continuing world peace, but on the assumption that we may be launched into a world war before we wake up some morning, whether it is to-morrow morning, in two years' time or five years' time.  If we spend a reasonable amount of our national energy in taking ordinary precautions, in the training of our Army and the procurement of stores, we can make good use of the money earmarked for that purpose, but if we let the Army drift, if the Taoiseach continues to allow the Minister for Defence to sneer at everybody who goes into the Army as a person who is shirking an honest day's work, as one who is going to kick his heels and knock sparks out of the barrack square, we are not going to make a reasonable use of the Army. If it were true that the right policy for defence is that outlined by the Minister for Defence, that we should not take any more men into the Army and that <Col N="1926" /> we should keep all our young men at work until the drum beats for battle, why do we not dispense with the 7,000 or 8,000 men we have already in the Army and put them to work until the drum beats for battle?</P>
      <P>For these last few years the Fianna Fáil Party has had to do the work that the Government should have been doing in relation to national defence. It is the Government's duty to face unpopularity, if there is unpopularity involved, in asking the people to support a reasonable defence policy under all circumstances.  Other Governments do it and the Fianna Fáil Government were forced to do it.  We were forced to do it in 1938 and 1939 and we were denounced here as spendthrifts, as people who were draining the life blood of the nation when we were making a very modest preparation for the war which then seemed to most people inevitable but which the Minister for Agriculture told us was never going to come.  It is the Government's duty at the present time to ask the people to support a reasonable defence policy.  It was their duty for the last couple of years if they had fulfilled it, but, to avoid the unpopularity of collecting money to pay the soldiers and to pay for arms, they neglected to carry out their duty in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the atomic bomb exploded in Hiroshima, the next war was dated. Everybody who realised the consequences of that explosion, knew that it was dated unless the Russians were prepared to open up and allow other countries to inspect their munition factories and assure themselves that the atomic bomb was not being made.  We know that if war comes, it is going to be a pretty savage affair.  The one hope our people have to keep out of it is to make certain that no outsiders will come in here unless the Dáil has decided that they should do so.  If we are going to create a vacuum here, that vacuum will be filled by somebody. Troops nowadays do not have to cross water on the surface, or under the surface, in order to get to an island.  One of our fears in the last war&mdash;one of the danger points in my opinion always&mdash; was at the beginning that the Power which seized the Continent might easily come in here by air when the tide of <Col N="1927" /> war was flowing with them and the second danger was that they might have attempted it as a last throw.</P>
    <P>It is our duty to do what we can to make certain that this defence vacuum, as the Minister for Defence called it, is filled by Irish troops.  We would not have to mobilise the whole of our population in order to do that, but we have to make the reasonably modest demand of our people that they support as a maximum another few thousand men in the regular forces so that we can add to our regular Defence Reserve and also provide cadre and a stiffening for the Volunteer Forces and our Local Defence Force.  We would not have to draw into the Army or attempt to draw into the Army the people that were outlined by the Minister for Defence, all who were trained here during our own previous wars or in foreign wars.  It is useful that our people have such experience but that experience will be of no value militarily unless the people who have that experience are armed and trained to work together before the drum beats for battle.</P>
    <P>Our F.C.A. should be getting very much more attention than it is getting at the present time.  If airborne forces were to come on this country they would have to be hit quickly, and we must ensure that every weapon we have at the present time is in the hands of a trained man.  One trained man is worth 20 half trained men when it comes to repelling an attack.  Without any warmongering, and praying to the Almighty God that war may never come upon the world and that this thing that has started in the East will not lead to war upon an unprepared Europe, we should at least take steps and the Taoiseach should at least take the very small preliminary step of saying that his policy, the policy of a Government in a world in which every country is increasing its armament as quickly as it can, is no longer based upon the assumption that world peace will continue.  His instructions to his Ministers should be that they should make reasonable efforts to organise the Departments of State and bring to bear on the people the influence of those <Col N="1928" /> Departments so as to secure reasonable defence precautions.</P>
    <P>Without very much expenditure we can produce an A.R.P. service, the ordinary ambulance service of the Red Cross and other such organisations. That will not cost us a lot of money; all it will cost is that the Government should say that it is our duty to prepare to defend ourselves and to prepare to succour anybody who may be hurt or wounded in such an eventuality.</P>
    <P>With regard to agriculture we could without any expenditure&mdash;indeed with the saving of dollars&mdash;set ourselves to grow the minimum of our cereal requirements particularly of wheat. If we are going to do that next year we cannot leave it until the Dáil comes back.  If our farmers are to go in for a programme of increased tillage next year sufficient to meet our reasonable requirements for man and beast, they will have to know that now so that in a month's time when they start to cut their oats they will be able to get ahead and prepare for the following year's tillage.  It will take a couple of months to get our farmers around to that point of view.  Surely from any point of view our farmers owe it as a duty to their own people, a duty which they will fulfil if they are asked by the Government, to till as much of their land as will secure our people from starvation or from the threat of anybody pushing us around because of the fear of starvation.  We all know from recent disclosures that that game was tried on us in the last war but we were not vulnerable to such an attempt.  If tillage continues to fall as it has been falling during the last few years, however, we will be vulnerable. There are a number of Deputies, I am perfectly certain, on the Government Benches who are as little anxious as I am that we should be vulnerable in that regard.  To produce merely what is necessary to protect our supply of bread will actually save us dollars and it will give farmers who are facing a price of a couple of shillings for eggs instead of 3/- a dozen something to compensate them.  The change from our present policy with regard to wheat growing is a change that will be welcomed <Col N="1929" /> by our people next year.  I think that the Government would gain in kudos, would gain somewhat in popularity if even at this late stage they were to say: &ldquo;It would have been foolish to follow Fianna Fáil policy for this last couple of years but now under present circumstances it is our national duty to go out and get all the wheat we can.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from owing it as a duty to our own people to prepare ourselves in a reasonable fashion to fill that vacuum about which the Minister for Defence spoke, I think we owe it as a duty to civilisation.  The one thing that will stop aggression in the world is that free peoples should be prepared to defend their freedom to the last breath.  One of the things at which I am disgusted at the present time is <Col N="1930" /> that certain of the Powers who prate about the coming fight for freedom and democracy are not prepared to carry out in their own regard the rules of conduct they have laid down for other Powers.  I would be prepared and I hope our people will be prepared to make them do it in our regard before they ask us to go gunning for those principles elsewhere.  I think it would be a good contribution to the cause of Christianity and western civilisation if we were prepared to fill our vacuum and see that nobody will get in here except with the concurrence of our people.  I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 14th July, 1950.</P>
