      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he is aware that the statutory deduction of £26 per annum made from the earnings of a widow for the purpose of calculating her pension is not made when she qualifies for the old age pension, and that, as a consequence, a Balbriggan widow with a widow's pension of 12/-received only 5/- per week when she qualified for the old age pension; and, if so, whether he will take steps to have the position rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the statutory position is as indicated in the first part of the question save that the relevant provision refers to &ldquo;income derived from personal exertions&rdquo; and not to &ldquo;earnings&rdquo;.  In the majority of cases widows get an increase on changing over from widow's pension to old age pension.  It may happen that where a widow has an income derived from personal exertions her old age pension would at the outset be lower than the widow's pension previously paid.  Her old age pension would, of course, be increased according as her income decreased or disappeared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should, perhaps, point out that the basis of computing means under the old age pensions and widows' and orphans' pensions codes is essentially different and the statutory deduction to which the Deputy refers was intended to encourage widows to take <Col N="1096" /> up some form of employment if they were in a position to do so.</P>
    <P>I think that the number of cases in which a reduction occurs in switching over from widow's pension to old age pension is negligible, but I will have the question examined when amending legislation of the relevant Acts is next being considered.</P>

Some companies have the national colours painted on the fuselage; others use a civil air ensign. The nationality of Aer Lingus aircraft must be obvious to everyone, as they carry the Irish registration letters E.I., the name of the company, which is Irish, is painted on the aircraft, there is the name of an Irish saint painted on each aircraft, and there are green stripes and shamrocks on the aircraft.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that Bord na Móna showed very little initiative in their business system down there?  Is it because of that fact that this scheme is going to be closed down? Will the Minister make inquiries as to why Bord na Móna allowed that turf to remain on their hands for a considerable period when local turf producers who produce hand-won turf were able to find a market for it in Kerry and outside while this board, with the organisation of a State Department behind it, fell down on the job?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not at all agree that the board fell down on the job. The facts are that in the years 1948 and 1949 Bord na Móna produced on these two bogs approximately 4,400 tons of turf.  In the two years they succeeded in disposing of only 1,200 tons and there are roughly 3,200 tons of turf there which up to the moment remains unsold.  The board are now endeavouring to dispose of that 3,200 tons at a very low price which will increase very substantially the loss on the production of those two bogs.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the cash allowances payable under the Infectious Diseases (Maintenance) Regulations, 1948, to persons suffering from tuberculosis.</P>
      <P>On framing these regulations, it was decided to fix slightly higher rates of allowance in the case of beneficiaries resident in the four county boroughs in recognition of the fact that the cost of living generally is somewhat higher in these areas than elsewhere in the country.  As the disparity between the rates of allowance payable in county boroughs and those payable elsewhere is slight and as health authorities have discretion as to the extent to which maintenance allowances should be abated in respect of income from other sources, there should be no hardship in the type of case mentioned by the Deputy.  If, however, he is aware of any specific case in which there appears to be any hardship in the circumstances he describes, I shall be glad if he will bring it to my notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>At present all the pollard produced by the mills is allocated to manufacturers of compound feeding stuffs.  The basic allocations are fixed on the output of these manufacturers in 1948.</P>
      <P>Additional allocations are being granted within the limits of available supplies to meet the requirements of compounders whose basic allocation is insufficient to meet the present demand for the foods produced by them.</P>
      <P>There is no difference in the system of allocation as between Dublin and country firms.</P>
      <P>I have already indicated my reasons for the allocation of pollard to manufacturers of compound feeding stuffs in reply to questions on this subject on 15th and 21st February last, when I explained that in order to provide for calving cows, etc., all available bran is being allocated for retail distribution.</P>

    <P>* The grants offered to Counties Carlow and Cork Committees of Agriculture in 1949/50 were later increased to £2,800 and £12,000 respectively; the additional amounts to be provided out of savings on the scheme in other counties.</P>
    <P>(iii) The total amount paid in subsidies under the lime subsidy scheme in the year 1947-48 was £57,415 2s. 3d. (inclusive of amounts contributed by the county committees of agriculture).

From what date will the market value be paid?  It may be possible, if certain officers of the Minister's Department had a grudge against a person, from the date the Minister announced that this new provision was about to be inserted, that any such officer who had authority might take certain proceedings against an individual whom he did not like, if this provision was to apply at some future date.</P>

      <P>The retrospection which the Deputy has in mind is covered by amendment No. 2, which I moved.  The best we could do in that case to give a chance to those whose land, so to speak, is in the process of being taken over or was taken over from the 1st of December last&mdash;on or after that date&mdash;is that, while the price will be fixed or may be fixed under the old system, they have a chance to appeal and to have the price redetermined under the amendment.  That will cover approximately 108 cases.  While I do not think it will go back all the way to the date which some Deputies desired, I think it will cover most of the cases and give most of them a chance.  There was a complete cessation of work by the Land Commission from February, 1941, down to the revocation of an Order imposed by the last Government which took place, I think, in March or a short time after this Government took office.  The result was that very little land started to come into our hands until the fall of last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not particularly clear to me but even taking it on the basis that the Minister puts it&mdash;that it arises out of Section 7&mdash;I understood from Section 7 that it was considered by the Land Commission that it was intended to deal with certain charges that might be outstanding on holdings of the Board of Works or drainage authority or some such other people. I certainly did not understand that the whole basis, evidently, is being changed under this present amendment which has been moved by the Minister and that we are going to substitute this method and wipe out whatever the position was.  Incidentally, the Minister refused to tell us last night the method of arriving at a standard <Col N="1121" /> purchase annuity, because a standard purchase annuity was provided for under the law as it stood.</P>
      <P>I have not the particular section before me now but it was provided in a certain way in connection with the amount of money expended by the Land Commission in relation to a particular estate.  That is quite clear and was quite clear under the law as it stood.  We are now evidently, under this section, completely wiping out the previous basis of arriving at the standard purchase annuity.  We now find, under sub-section (5) of the proposed new section, that evidently the old basis will be completely wiped out, and that a new type of purchase annuity will be substituted.  If that is so, surely we are entitled to ask the Minister what is going to be the basis on which this new purchase annuity will be fixed.  If the old basis has been wiped out, and some new type of annuity is going to be substituted, the House is entitled to know in what way the Land Commission proposes to arrive at the new standard purchase annuity.  If it is going to have any relation whatever to the amount of money expended by the Land Commission in acquiring particular lands, well and good.  If it is going to be some rule of thumb, well and good also; but I think that, in view of the legislation formerly in existence for the purpose of arriving at the standard purchase annunity, the Minister should tell the House how the new annuity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would allow me to intervene for a moment.  Under the old system as it obtained, and as it will obtain until this Bill becomes law, the law prescribed that the vendor of the land or the person from whom the land was taken should, in the case of vested farms, redeem the purchase annuity so that the land would come to the Land Commission free of rent.  The Land Commission could not take over possession from a man who still owed money in respect of the original purchase money and he could not know the market value until the purchase money was redeemed.  Therefore, before we could legally take over possession of the land that man would have to discharge his liability by freeing the land from rent.  Now, under this Bill we are not asking persons from whom land is acquired to discharge the land from rent.  We are doing that ourselves now.  In other words, the burden will not fall on the shoulders of the person from whom we are acquiring the land.  We are asking the State to shoulder the burden.  Sub-section (5) merely sets up certain machinery for the guidance of the Minister for Finance and has nothing whatever to do with the new annuity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>That certainly clears the air.  If that is the intention behind this sub-section, of course, we are satisfied with it.  There is just one other matter which arises under this section particularly under sub-section (3) which reads: &ldquo;A deficiency in the Local Loans Fund, Purchase Annuity Fund or Land Bond Fund arising out of the cesser under sub-section <Col N="1124" /> (1) of this section of any payment shall not be a charge on the Guarantee Fund.&rdquo;  I want to direct the Minister's attention to this because it certainly came as a surprise to me quite recently to discover that the redemption value of annuities varies in accordance with the price of land bonds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That has always been the experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like on this sub-section to direct the Minister's attention to this fact.  In one particular case a certificate of the redemption value of a holding asked for away back in 1938 showed the redemption value to be £236 and we discovered ten years later, in 1948, that the redemption value of the same annuity amounted to approximately £40 more.  Everybody, every farmer, understood that so long as he was paying his annuities the amount should be getting less each year; but it would now appear that this amount varies.  It is very strange to find that after a farmer pays his annuities for ten years the amount of the redemption value of the annuity, after the ten years, is £40 or £50 more than it was.  It came as a shock to a particular farmer I have in mind, and I am sure it would come as a shock to the general public.</P>
      <P>The Minister might consider this matter before the Report Stage.  There should be some method whereby, when the annuity is fixed and the redemption value is fixed, the amount paid by the tenant farmer should go towards reducing that annuity and the farmer should not find himself ten or 20 years afterwards having to pay a bigger redemption value.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), paragraph (d), lines 49 and 50, to delete &ldquo;(other than any determination arising in or being part of a rearrangement scheme.)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In various discussions I think we have all been very emphatic, and the Minister has been more emphatic than any of us, that the Minister should not interfere with the work of the Land Commission in deciding what land should be acquired or to whom it should be allotted.  These are functions which have been reserved to the Land Commission and I think there are very strong reasons why they should continue to be reserved to the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the Order Paper to-day, I think it will emphasise how necessary it is to have this protection for the Minister for Lands.  If the Land Commission were to withdraw from deciding to whom land is to be allotted or from whom it is to be acquired, the Minister would be in the position of a slender, weak reed in a storm; he would be buffeted from every side, not only by Deputies but by would-be Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>They would demand that every political opponent's land should be acquired and given to the political supporters of those making the representations. The Land Act of 1933 provided some protection for the unfortunate Minister and it is desirable that that protection should, if possible, be preserved.  In this Bill the Minister seeks to discard some of the protection with which he has been surrounded, and is taking upon himself the direct function of performing certain work in regard to the determination of persons to be selected for the allocation of land.  Now, I quite recognise that his purpose in this particular section is <Col N="1128" /> limited, and that he only seeks to acquire a direct power in regard to what is known as a rearrangement scheme, but even in regard to that I think the Minister should be very careful to safeguard himself from avoidable pressure.</P>
      <P>I have put down this amendment in order to ensure that the Minister will come into this discussion and defend the step which he has taken in resuming certain powers which are at present assigned to the Land Commission.  It may be that the Land Commission, in dealing with such matters, have been too slow and too inefficient.  If that is the case to be made, there may be ways of smartening up the Land Commission rather than by the Minister taking power into his own hands.  The small-holder who has acquired land or to whom land has been allotted, as well as the ordinary farmer who is working his land, should have reasonable security.  He should not be exposed to attack by political opponents because of his political views or of people who are prejudiced against him on personal grounds.  Therefore, it is essential in my view that the Land Commission should retain the powers which they have at present.  I can see nothing but chaos, similar to that which we had on the Order Paper to-day, arising from any diversion of the powers which the Land Commission have directly into the hands of the Minister. I am, therefore, asking that the Minister should take the House fully into his confidence in regard to this matter and give us the reasons why he proposes to make this change.  If satisfactory reasons are given, or if there are adequate safeguards that this power will not be abused or that the Minister will not be abused in the exercise of that power, then I am sure the House will be reasonable with the Minister and will accept the change in the existing law.</P>

      <P>I thought that I would be put into the position that I would not have anything further to say. Politics makes strange bedfellows. The Minister need not be surprised when he opens Saturday's newspaper to see myself and Deputy Cogan ensconced on an O'Dearest mattress <Col N="1129" /> except that Deputy Cogan, as some other person did, may take a libel action against the <i>Irish Times.</i>  The acquisition and allotment of land, in the words of the Minister himself, are important functions and should be entirely divorced from the domain of politics.  Paragraph (d) of sub-section (1) empowers the Minister to select the allottees in connection with a rearrangement scheme, and the final paragraph of the sub-section describes a rearrangement scheme &ldquo;as a scheme for the rearrangement of lands held in rundale or intermixed plots whether with or without the distribution of other lands to facilitate the said arrangement&rdquo;. That, to my mind, does not confine the Minister merely to the rearrangement of a rundale holding. Any land acquired by the Land Commission, if we except those specified in certain words, may be dealt with by the Minister directly or by his agent.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman said that I made a deliberate attempt to misrepresent the views of the Minister and the intentions of the Bill.  That sounds very like a very grave charge until one examines it, and then one sees that there is nothing in it but bluff.  We are not concerned with the views of the Minister or the intentions of the Bill.  We are just dealing with legislation which may be tested in court.  The lawyers here may tell me that, in getting a decision in court on any matter relating to the Bill, the judges will not take any cognisance of the intentions of the Bill or the <i>obiter dicta</i> of the Minister. They will decide on what the Act says and nothing else.  I have just stated what the Bill says.  If the main purpose of this Bill is to relieve congestion, is not the allottee being handed over body and bones completely into the hands of the Minister?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read it.  There is no good in Deputy Sweetman telling me about intentions or good wishes. All that we have got to be concerned with is what is in the Bill.  The Bill says: &ldquo;The determination (other than any determination arising in or being part of a rearrangement scheme)... relating to lands held in rundale or intermixed plots, whether with or with out the distribution of other lands to facilitate the said arrangement.&rdquo;  With or without.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister who dealt with the 1923 Act described a civil servant as an agent of the Minister.  The Minister made a slip in this debate, I think, when he stated that the commissioners are civil servants and that they will carry out the orders of any Government.  The commissioners are not civil servants.  The point is that they are completely distinct from civil servants and, therefore, cannot be the Minister's agents.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said: &ldquo;We do this for the purpose of speeding up the solution of congestion.  There are only five honest men in the Land Commission, according to Fianna Fáil, and all the rest of us are rogues.&rdquo;  It reminds me of Falstaff, who said: &ldquo;There are but six good men unhanged in England.&rdquo; We do not argue that the inspectors or officers of the Department of Lands are dishonest.  We do, however, argue that the commissioners are not civil servants, that they are a judicial body and that they are not the agents of the Minister.  I am not trying to prove the Minister is dishonest.  I am trying to protect him from himself. Every one of us who has had any experience of office knows the tremendous pressure that we always had to resist, and the Minister, if he insists on getting this power, will be unable to resist the pressure placed on him because he has the power.  He will be unable to carry out the work which this House has put him in the Department to do.</P>

      <Col N="1131" /> What about speed?  Some time ago I read somewhere that an ambassador in a country is nowadays not as important an individual as he was before the days of rapid communications.  Nowadays he can be reached by his Minister at the end of a telephone or he can be ordered home by plane.  In the horse and buggy days, an inspector of the Land Commission had to have certain qualities, perhaps certain authority, that are not needed now in these days of rapid communications.  If an inspector down in Mayo has a problem to which he wants an immediate solution, he will find the commissioners at the end of a phone in Merrion Street and, unlike the unfortunate Deputy who has to suffer for the sins of the various Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs, he will get priority and he will get a solution.</P>

      <P>I really want to save the Minister from himself.  He is doing something that is wholly undesirable and which will create difficulties.  When I was in the Land Commission, the only difficulty that arose about swift solutions was in relation to the question as to whether the budget estimate of the Land Commission might or might not be utilised.  Every commissioner and many of the civil servants in the Land Commission had views on the budget estimate and some of them did not like it.  But, at least, those who liked it believed that it was the one solution for the cutting of any Gordian knot that might exist.  If the advisers of the Minister in the Land Commission&mdash;I am sure he has listened to some advice&mdash;had the view that the budget estimate would speed up any difficulty in relation to the relief of congestion, have they suffered some sea change lately?</P>

      <P>The Minister is in a difficult position already, being a Mayo man living in Mayo.  I think the Minister is very unwise trying to seek powers which have been in the hands of the Land Commission away from politics and political pressure.  The most definite attack that was made in this House on Fianna Fáil in relation to lands was that the secretaries of the Fianna Fáil clubs dictated to the inspector.  Everybody said that.  Now, if there are any Clann na Talmhan clubs and they have secretaries it will be said and can be said with much more truth, with real truth, because the Minister is taking this power into his own hands.  A Minister under the Fianna Fáil regime had no authority <Col N="1133" /> of any kind to suggest to the commissioners what they should do in relation to any farm.  I have never seen any association of Fianna Fáil club secretaries waiting as a deputation on the Land Commissioners here or anywhere throughout the country.  I have never seen any dictation of any kind.  Now the dictation can be used because the Minister is going to take into his own hands certain power, the misuse of which he cannot avoid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Moylan is very fond of quotations.  He is especially fond of quoting Shakespeare. I would suggest that his last speech might be described as &ldquo;Much Ado About Nothing&rdquo;.  He wonders that himself and Deputy Cogan are together on this issue.  That is not extraordinary because I think they could both be suitable bed-fellows.  I have no hesitation whatever in saying that. Conservative is a very gentle description of both their outlooks.</P>
      <P>The idea behind the power the Minister is getting under this Bill is, in my opinion, necessary.  Deputy Moylan put his finger on it when he said the need was to speed up the work with regard to rearrangement schemes. There is no doubt that the power the Land Commission had in this respect in the past was not a sufficient power with regard to speeding up the work and bringing the problem to an end. Some of these rearrangement schemes have gone on for 15 or 20 years.  We have experienced the position where an inspector arrived, had a chat with the local people concerned in the scheme and more or less obtained their consent to a certain plan.  Before anything could be done, that had to be vetted at the top by headquarters and, by the time it came back down again, the people who were concerned in the scheme had fallen out between themselves and refused to continue with the rearrangement.  We had the inspector coming on the scene year after year with no hope of getting a solution to the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is now taking steps to ensure that an official of his Department can strike while the iron is hot. In other words, when that official gets people to arrive at a decision, they can sign on the spot and must be prepared <Col N="1134" /> to abide by it.  I think that is an admirable solution.  It relates only to rearrangement schemes.  There is no general principle laid down with regard to ministerial powers.  The proof that it is necessary is the fact that it has taken so long to arrive at a decision in relation to rearrangement schemes. Neither Deputy Moylan nor Deputy Cogan can put forward any alternative solution.  Both realise that the machinery in use up to the present was inadequate and too slow.  Deputy Moylan brings up the old question of speed.  He says we should go slow. That, of course, was the propaganda put out by the Land Commission Moguls themselves.</P>

His predecessors were definitely hiding behind the powers of the Land Commission and they were prepared to go on indefinitely saying &ldquo;I have nothing to do with it&rdquo;.  We do not want a Minister like Deputy Moylan and his predecessors if they are prepared to shelve all responsibility.  The list of questions that could be put down in the Western Counties alone with regard to rearrangement would fill the Order Paper any day.  Deputy Moylan should at least know that.  He said he had no function in the matter.  Is it not a good thing to know now that these problems can be solved once and for all? It is no good saying we are going too fast.  We must remedy what has been described as a social evil.  The longer people are here in this House, the further they seem to get away from the ordinary man and woman.

      <P>Might I say a few words at this stage?  This amendment relates to a departure from the procedure or practice which obtained in the past.  On the Second Reading, I said it was a big departure.  The land law of the country is very tangled because of all the rights of land owners, big, medium and small, and so on.  I want to direct my remarks for a moment to Deputy Moylan in particular.  When he was Minister, was he satisfied with the statutes dealing with rearrangement?  I think Deputy Moylan, whatever about his predecessors, was perfectly genuine in trying to find some solution to the relief of congestion.  The relief of congestion is tied up with rearrangement. Rearrangement is necessary wherever people are overcrowded and where holdings are either in rundale or badly intermixed.  It is a social evil that we must set right.  It is no use burying our heads in the sand like ostriches. To refuse to see the problem will not get us anywhere.  I would ask Deputy Moylan does he disagree with the principle of this or is it the mechanics of it to which he takes exception?</P>

      <P>When paragraph (d) of sub-section (1) specifically gives to a judicial body the determination of the persons to be selected as allottees of any land, it seems to be a peculiar enlargement of the powers of the Land Commission and a peculiar definition of their powers to say &ldquo;other than any determination arising in or being part of a rearrangement scheme.&rdquo;  It seems that there should be a minus sign rather than a plus sign.  The White Paper sets out to deceive everybody. This is not an enlargement of the commissioners' authority or power.

      <P>The rearrangement scheme is an improvement on the previous holdings of the tenants.  Otherwise it would be a complete waste of the Land Commission inspectors' time and of good money.  We are asking for power for the senior inspector, not the inspector who prepared the scheme, not the inspector in charge but power for the senior inspector to sanction a rearrangement scheme on the spot that is agreed on by the tenants.  A rearrangement scheme is not a Land <Col N="1137" /> Commission scheme.  It is solely the scheme of the tenants in the townland that is being rearranged.  Until you get agreement from every one of them, the tenants themselves, whatever you do would not be worth an ounce of energy.  Once you have the agreement from the tenants it does not matter who sanctions it.  Remember, the tenants themselves are the most severe critics that either I or the commissioners or the inspectors or this Dáil could have.  We must wait until they are agreed that it is the time to strike.  It is their scheme not ours. All the inspector can do is to offer something.</P>
      <P>I see the Leader of the Opposition laughing.  I hope that this will not be torpedoed.  God knows, I do not want to speak harshly but it is all very fine for us to sit and laugh here.

      <P>The Minister is powerless until he gets agreement.  Why did some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies who come from congested areas not put down an amendment in this connection? They did not do so because they were too wise.  I want to free the machinery of the Land Commission.  I <Col N="1138" /> do not want to have a situation similar to that on the McDermot estate, on the borders of Roscommon and Mayo. I do not know the locality very well but I know that the position since 1940 is that something like 13 different attempts have been made to rearrange it.  Each attempt has failed because the matter had to go through the hands of many different people, from the Grade 2 inspector who proposed the scheme right up to the commissioners, for sanction.</P>
      <P>Take the Patten estate, which is right beside Deputy Moran's doorstep. Suppose Deputy Moran had to rearrange that estate.  Would that be Deputy Moran's scheme or would it be the tenant's scheme?</P>

      <P>If this Bill becomes law in its present shape I hope to be able to have a reasonable solution to the problem.  I do not promise the tenants there, or any tenants, that I will be able to give them 40 or 50 acres, and so on, but I shall do my living best to ensure that the land will be in one block and that it will not be like the case of a man who is the proud possessor of seven acres divided into 33 unfenced plots, no two of them touching.</P>
      <P>I see Deputy Moylan's point.  I want to go further along the road towards improving the position.  I have done my best to word it but if the Deputy can suggest better wording, and provided he can show me that this is foolish, I shall be only too glad to meet him so that there will not be any doubt.  All I want is the O.K. for a rearrangement scheme to be in the hands of the inspector for the sake of speed and so that, for instance, a mischief-maker will not have an opportunity of getting in among the tenants &mdash;sometimes a public man&mdash;and making trouble.</P>

      <P>I have some slight knowledge of the conditions which the Minister described, though it is not as extensive as the Minister's.

      <P>They may not.  I think it is necessary that that type of work should not just become a matter on routine procedure, that it should be a matter that would be tackled by some person and settled, as the Minister says, on the spot.  The powers that the Minister seeks relate only to particular parts of the country, what are known mainly as the congested areas. These congested areas have been a source of trouble for many years. Every time a Land Act was introduced, whether in this House or the British Parliament, claims were made for it that it would deal with this problem of congestion and help to solve it.  I think the only real practical solution put forward is that which has been put forward by the Minister in this section. If we were to accept the amendment proposed by Deputy Cogan and Deputy Moylan we would be going back to the system that was there.  In other words we would be saying: &ldquo;The machinery and the procedure are quite good. They have worked satisfactorily and there is no reason to change them.&rdquo;  I think that if Deputy Moylan or Deputy Cogan want to help they must realise <Col N="1140" /> how serious this problem is.  They must realise that the present methods and machinery are unsuitable.  If they have any suggestions to make to help in easing the problem, then they should have put it forward by a reasonable amendment, but simply to put down an amendment to deprive the Minister of the powers he asks from the House to deal with this problem, is not progress; it is reaction.</P>

      <P>I hope that when this section is passed it will be operated in a realistic way by the Minister and that the putting of the Minister into this Bill will not simply mean that he will leave it entirely to his officials to draw up schemes.  I would ask nothing better&mdash;and I do not think there is anything undignified or wrong in it&mdash; than to know that the Minister for Lands had taken his car down to Mayo for one fortnight and there engaged himself with the local people in settling these problems and giving his decision on the spot.  I do not see anything wrong in that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The operating machinery given in the section gives the Minister power to do that.  The amendment tries to deprive the Minister of the power to do it, either by himself or through his officials.  Even though we give this power to the Minister and even though it is operated with all the energy and drive that we know the Minister will put behind it, even though his officials act with all the enthusiasm they can to solve this problem, it will not be solved to-day or to-morrow.  It is a tremendous problem and it would be very helpful for us here if, when the Estimates come round or in the annual report of the Land Commission, we are able to see mapped <Col N="1141" /> out the sections of the country in which this vital and necessary rearrangement had been carried out.  We should be able then to see what progress had been made and was being made.</P>
      <P>I think that probably Deputy Moylan's purpose in associating himself with Deputy Cogan in this amendment was probably to have a clear explanation from the Minister as to what in fact was intended by the section.  Deputy Cogan has clearly stated that he knows very little about the problem, that he is not acquainted with it.  It is not a problem in his own area.  Now that the Minister has given his explanation and that it makes it perfectly clear that no person's rights, outside the particular areas in which rearrangement is necessary, are affected then I think both Deputy Cogan and Deputy Moylan should withdraw their amendments and wish the Minister God speed in the very essential and vital task that this section imposes on him of making a real effort to solve such a serious social problem.</P>

      <P>The last few remarks of the previous speaker would indicate that he views this amendment only in so far as it affects the holdings or patches immediately concerned in any given rearrangement scheme.  If the Minister were taking any powers whereby he could bring in other lands to operate these rearrangement proposals, then I personally would look more favourably on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The acquisition of land is reserved to the commissioners but I am sure that if the inspectors report that it would be advisable to acquire certain lands to facilitate a rearrangement scheme, the commissioners would consider it provided they were not infringing the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event the Minister says that he is going to settle the allottees, where the problem is one of any determination arising out of or being part of a rearrangement scheme. I cannot see where the Deputies find any hope in that statement that rearrangement is going to be speeded up. In my opinion it is going to be retarded and confusion and chaos worse confounded <Col N="1142" /> will arise out of any attempt to operate this.  It is all right if you have two people and the problem of rearrangement concerns only these two.</P>
      <P>Any wise Solomon of a Land Commission inspector can come along and say: &ldquo;Here, Tom, you divide the holding and, Jack, you will have the choice of the division.&rdquo;  We all know it is not so simple as all that.  If it were, the Minister would not have to take these powers.  The rearrangement scheme has got to go on in the way we have been acquainted with heretofore; in other words, the ordinary machinery of the Land Commission goes ahead with the rearrangement schemes.  I have no objection to the work of the Land Commission in the matter of rearrangement or in any other work.  I have only one objection, and that is that it is too slow.  The quality of the work was sound.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing I found wrong was the slowness of the work. The quality was sound.  We all know the joke that appeared in <i>Dublin Opinion</i> about the Land Commission inspector going away after doing his work in a district.  One local person says to the other: &ldquo;Well, Jack, he must have done his work very fair because there is no one in the town satisfied.&rdquo; That joke will not appear any more in <i>Dublin Opinion</i> because henceforth the dissatisfaction will be placed, entirely as a result of this, at the Minister's door.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, if it is not too late, to withdraw this because it will lead to all sorts of confusion.  It is much better that the Land Commission should take whatever blame there is in relation to the division of land or rearrangement.  Now it would appear it is going to become a political football. The Minister will find that he <Col N="1143" /> will have retarded the work and confused everybody who has any interest in it&mdash;retarded it much more than has been the case up to the present.  Does not everybody know that people interested in land will find out that under Section 10 the Minister will have all the say?  It is all very well for the Minister to say that he will nominate an inspector to do the job, but the people will get a spokesman to get the Minister to influence that inspector, seeing that the work will be done directly on behalf of the Minister.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The following matters shall be excepted matters for the purposes of this section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(d) the determination (other than any determination arising in or being part of a rearrangement scheme) of the persons to be selected as allottees of any land....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is excepted, except in so far as it arises out of rearrangement and the obvious inference there is that where rearrangement is concerned the Land Commission no longer have an exclusive right to handle it.</P>

      <P>The Minister put his finger on it when he said that these schemes are not inspectors' schemes.  If the people agree to the rearrangement this right of naming allottees does not come in at all.  If there were only two or three holdings the thing would have been all right.</P>

      <P>If the Minister had an opportunity of looking up representations he would find out that when Fianna Fáil was over there the Fianna Fáil T.D.s concentrated on getting speed into the job, getting the work done.  I challenge any Deputy to produce a letter from the Land Commission files in my writing objecting to the work of the Land Commission or to the people to whom they gave land or to the quality of their work.  All my representations were to get the work speeded up.  That is all I want to see done now.</P>
      <P>We know the work was suspended from 1939.  That was a great grievance so far as we in the West were concerned. But we accepted the assurance of the Government, who had the job of conducting the country through the war period, that it was a necessary suspension.  We accepted it, although it was for us in the West politically unwise.  It will be easy to get allottees if you can rearrange a scheme that is generally accepted.  You could put the names into a hat and draw them out.  The main thing is to get an acceptable scheme and I suggest the Minister does not aim at doing that in his amendment.  I appeal to the Minister to shed these powers and leave things as they were.  Above all, let him speed up the work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has admitted he was not satisfied with the speed of the Land Commission.  Do not mind the letters or the representations. Did you ever have a serious conference with a view to helping your Minister for Lands to limber up the machine and get the work done more speedily?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1145" /> In case any other Deputy would follow the mistake that Deputy Bartley fell into, I would like to make some points clear.  Deputy Bartley seems to be confusing two things which are as diametrically opposed as the two Poles.  One is the rearrangement scheme and the other is the allotting of a farm by way of giving it in additions to farmers at a distance from their own holdings.  That scheme of dividing farms into small allotments and giving these to farmers with uneconomic holdings in some cases did more harm than good.  You might give a man a few acres perhaps at a distance of four miles from his own holding, with the result that for his lifetime and possibly the lifetime of others after him practically all their time would be spent on the road going from one small place to another.  In those cases you were really recreating congestion instead of relieving it.  This is not to be confused with the rearrangement schemes.</P>
    <P>In the case of allotments, giving them out, I do not propose to interfere. I would be the first to take up the cudgels to see that no Minister grabs that power for himself or takes the power to allot holdings to particular friends of his.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">

      <P>I am trying to point out to Deputy Collins, who does not know, for his information that this particular section purports to give to the Minister power, again in the words of the section for &ldquo;the determination of the persons to be selected as allottees of <Col N="1147" /> any land&rdquo;.  Surely, that is clear in the section.  That is what Deputy Moylan objects to; that is what the Opposition objects to and what I think Deputy Cogan objects to.  In connection with the rearrangement of estates, the Minister well knows that the first difficulty is that some of the lands are good and that some are bad.  If the Minister is going to be in the position that he will be under the section, to give, for instance, Clann na Talmhan supporters the best portion of the estates that are taken over&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, it is not gone, and that is why I object to this. He is in a position to do that.  He deliberately purports to take that power by the legislation of this House. Then, I think, the House and Deputies, no matter what side they sit on, should oppose giving that power to any particular Minister.  This opens wide the door to all kinds of political corruption and the Minister well knows it.  If the Minister is going to be in the position to determine who are going to be the allottees of any land, surely there is no hope for the Minister's political opponents, and they may be people who may be entitled to a portion of that land.  The Minister is taking unto himself this power which up to this was exercised by the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I certainly cannot see any reason why the Minister should take this power except for that one purpose&mdash;to ensure that where the Minister is dealwith an estate, he will be in a position to look after his own because this particular section gives him specific power so to do.  Even under existing rearrangement schemes very many questions have been agitating the minds of the public in regard to how the Land Commission have been acting, and particularly in one rearrangement scheme with which the Minister is very familiar.  It is in the immediate vicinity of the town of Castlebar&mdash;the Lucan Estate.  It seems to me to be extraordinary that an industrial worker who had been sub-letting his land for twenty years and from whom the Land <Col N="1148" /> Commission took the land because he was not using it&mdash;he was working the whole time as an industrial worker in the town of Castlebar&mdash;should suddenly be made a present of portion of the Lucan Estate, a very valuable building site.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The intervention of the last speaker was not very helpful to this discussion.  This is a very serious matter and a very serious problem.  Do those Deputies suggest that, in putting down this amendment, I was in any way unsympathetic towards the people living in the congested areas, and particularly those on rundale estates?  I have deep sympathy with those people and I believe there is a problem there which has to be solved.  I believe that something definite must be done, apart from what has been done in the past, to solve that problem.  I am not convinced that the Minister is going the right way about solving the problem. The main difficulty, as far as we can gather, is the fact that when an inspector succeeds, with the co-operation of the people concerned, in carrying out a rearrangement scheme and in getting complete agreement, there is a delay in giving that agreement legal effect. When delays occur the whole agreeement is upset.  That, apparently, is the Minister's case.  I want to ask the Minister if there is not some other way of settling this matter than by taking power out of the hands of the commissioners. Should not the Minister and his officials be able to act speedily in a matter of this kind?</P>
      <P>As I said at the outset, it should not be impossible to compel the Land Commission to act speedily.  I think it was Deputy Cowan who suggested that the Minister should be prepared to go down to the congested areas and remain there until the problem was solved.  I would be prepared to go further and suggest that the whole Land Commission should be taken down there in lorries and should remain there until the problem was solved.  They should be dumped on the spot to deal with this serious difficulty and be compelled to remain there until it was solved.  I think there is no excuse for long delays in a matter of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know what the feelings of the rural people are in the matter of fighting for their rights.  They have had a hard and a long struggle.  Naturally, they are determined to make the best possible deal they can when it comes to a rearrangement scheme or to the exchange of little bits of land which they <Col N="1150" /> have on their small portions.  When they do make an agreement it happens that it can be broken if it is not completed and given legal effect at once. Surely some machinery could be set up under which the agreement could be confirmed without any unnecessary delay.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the Land Commission, if they were compelled to do it, would act as quickly as the Minister could act.  I am satisfied that they would be in a position to act more impartially. Deputies have borne witness to the fact that there has not been any serious complaint as to the manner in which schemes have been carried out by the Land Commission.  There have been, of course, certain complaints from various people, but, on the whole, an impartial observer cannot find any scheme which is altogether wrong. There is always a reasonable attempt made to solve the problem on the spot. But the whole complaint is in regard to the delay which causes agreements to be upset completely and the work done by inspector with the co-operation of local people to be completely frustrated.  That is what we want to avoid.  That is the problem we want to solve.  It will not be solved by heated exchanges across the House or by accusations of one kind or another.  It will not be solved by restricting the power of the Land Commission and giving additional power to the Minister who is, after all, subject to political pressure of every kind from which the Land Commission could be, should be, and, I believe, to a great extent is immune.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is one of considerable import and I think it should be widely appreciated that this is a very objectionable form of legal drafting.  In the first place, when it works out in fact, ministerial undertakings in the House as to the effect of legislation are of no value, for this reason: that the document will be construed and given effect to in a court according to its tenor in law and any outside undertakings given are of no effect.  I am sure that very many people have experience in the past of constructions of documents contrary to the indications given at the time of <Col N="1151" /> the passing of the Bill.  Therefore it is absolutely useless to consider as beneficial to the community any such assurance.</P>
      <P>The plain fact is that this document, as drafted, by means of a dodge or trick, if you like, an exception to an exception, leaves complete power in the hands of the Minister which can be abused&mdash;I am not saying it will be abused.  It is one of those things in regard to which it is undesirable that the Minister should take power, because, by not taking power, he hedges himself from political pressure.</P>
      <P>For these reasons, I think it is objectionable. Let us accept Deputy Cogan's invitation and parse it and see where we are.  Section 10, as it stands in the Bill, enacts in the first sub-section what are to be excepted matters.  The first sub-section provides for exceptions. Then the important and operative part of the section, so far as we are concerned, is sub-section (2).  Note the purport of sub-section (2), which states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Any power or duty for the time being vested by law (including this Act) in the Land Commission or the lay commissioners may, save in relation to excepted matters, be exercised or performed by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That sub-section says nothing more or less than this: that all the statutory powers or duties which heretofore the Land Commissioners or the lay commissioners had will be exercised by the Minister.  That is general, subject only to the explicit exceptions mentioned in the first sub-section.  In other words, we are dealing with a provision which says, in effect, so far as all these matters are concerned, that where the public were heretofore protected by a statutory independent body, a body that was protected from political pressure, namely, the Land Commission, which was dealing with these matters, now it is the Minister, a political personage, if you like, who will have this responsibility, because the powers are transferred to him, save certain excepted matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That has nothing to do with what I am saying.  I am trying to bring home the fact that the mechanism of this legislation is first, omnibus and, in the totality, to transfer all the powers of the Land Commission to the Minister, save those exceptions which are explicitly made.  That being the position, you have only these specifically excepted matters outside the Minister's control.  In other words, the presumption in law when this Bill is passed is that, unless the matter in question comes within the provisions of Section 10 (1), then the Minister has complete power, authority and jurisdiction in every other matter that arises.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Let Deputy Collins note what is in that.  He is a lawyer and will appreciate the point.  The point is that, supposing somebody comes to Deputy Collins with a question arising, what will Deputy Collins find himself up against?  He may want to dispute something the Minister has done.  What will he find?  He will find that the onus of proof will be on him explicitly to bring the matter within the terms of sub-section (1) before he can question the power of the Minister to deal with the matter.  That is a very important consideration.  I am emphatic on the objective principle, not on any question of personality or of any Minister or Party in power.  I would lean further in that direction than many other Deputies.  It is fundamentally objectionable to take more powers of such a nature, involving equitable distribution as between citizens, into the hands of the Minister or of the Government than are absolutely necessary for the benefit of the community.  It is objectionable from the point of view of the citizen, because those powers leave the citizens with very little redress against the State and with very little power of enforcing their rights against the combined machinery available to the State.  That is one reason why it is objectionable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already given the second reason&mdash;that it puts the Minister in the position of exercising functions that <Col N="1153" /> will to some extent embarrass him as making him the arbitrator between individuals in individual matters.  In other words, you are, in giving a Minister powers such as these, removing a hedge or a protection which is a great help to him in discharging his duties to the public and which protects him from either accusations of corruption or from pressure by individuals on individual matters which might prejudice his judgment in the performance of his duties for the good of the community as a whole.  For that reason, any section framed in this particular form, no matter where it is or what aspect of administration it deals with, should be suspect by the House and should be subjected to the closest scrutiny possible. Here we have a section which says that all power is transferred, all the powers and functions of the Land Commission are transferred to the Minister except the excepted matters. In other words, the Land Commission and the lay commissioners are also for all purposes, save the excepted matters&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not matter.  The principle is still important because they are restricted to very definite sub-heads; and all residual power and jurisdiction falls into the Minister's hands for use or abuse as the case may be.  Let us come now to the excepted matters and we find something more objectionable still.  We find that allocations relating to rearrangement schemes slide into the Minister's power by way of an exception to an exception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, the Minister takes complete power out of the hands of the Land Commission and the lay commissioners into his own hands save in regard to these excepted matters. But everything that cannot be brought under the heading of the excepted matters goes into the Minister's hands. One of the excepted matters is (d) &ldquo;the determination (other than the determination arising in or being part of a rearrangement scheme) of the persons to be selected as allottees of the said land&rdquo;.  A reserved matter then is the determination of the persons to be <Col N="1154" /> selected as allottees except where the determination relates to a rearrangement scheme.  All that is excepted there is the determination of the allottees provided that a rearrangement scheme is not in question.  The effect of the exception to the exception is that where allottees are to be determined in reference to a rearrangement scheme, then the Minister has complete power and jurisdiction to the exclusion of the Land Commissioners and the lay commissioners by virtue of sub-section (2).  I submit that is the legal position.  I would object to it on many grounds.  I object to it particularly on the ground that this appears as a device to give a Minister power by way of an exception to an exception.  He takes on certain powers and then explicitly excepts them; and then, by excepting once more from these explicit powers, he takes power back again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not care whether it ever arose before.  We are dealing here with a particular matter now.  It is my personal opinion that this is objectionable.  It is objectionable to take more powers than are necessary in this particular case.  I have given reasons why it is objectionable on <Col N="1155" /> broad grounds, without reference to personalities.  It is objectionable to take these powers.  Apparently there is a case on certain grounds as to why rearrangement should not rest in the Minister's hands.  But I am dealing with the form of this and I object to it on the grounds that it is the taking of power by a Minister by way of an exception to an exception.  The position is that the Minister is taking omnibus powers.  He then says there are certain excepted matters which thereafter become the sole function of the Land Commissioners and the lay commissioners. By this further exception, powers in relation to a rearrangement scheme then come back into the hands of the Minister.  The Minister will have complete power in determining the allottees of lands under a rearrangement scheme.  That is the legal position. Without any offence to the Minister, it does not matter a thrawneen what undertaking the Minister gives in the House.  The law will be there and the law will have to be complied with.  One can even go further and say that if any question of allocation comes up in regard to a rearrangement scheme, the Land Commission would have no function and could not deal with it.  Not only is the Minister's assurance no good from the point of view of safeguarding the situation, but that assurance is itself to a certain extent misleading because the Land Commission, having no power to deal with the determination of allottees under a rearrangement scheme, it not being an excepted matter, the Minister would be forced by Statute to deal with it.  There is no other alternative.  The Minister will be in the position that, if allottees have to be dealt with under a rearrangement scheme, he will have under the section as it stands a statutory duty cast upon him and he cannot avoid dealing with the matter.</P>

      <P>To resume, with reference to what Deputy Sweetman said, I quite concede his point but I have no intention of going into it at the moment.  Even if the Minister, and I mentioned this as a danger, had concurrent powers with the Land Commission, he nevertheless would have power, in other words, he &ldquo;may&rdquo; and, if he may, one can use one's own judgment as to whether he will or not. Again, by reason of a device of having an exception to an exception, the Minister will have complete power under the section as it stands to deal with the allocation of land where a rearrangement scheme is concerned. Many Deputies, particularly those on the Opposition Benches, think that objectionable.  Under the amendment before the House, they propose the deletion of the exception to the exception so that the matter will be straight, namely the Minister will get his powers with the explicit exception without any further exception to bring back the powers again into his hands.</P>

      <P>I must confess I find myself rather amused at the hysterical legal argument of my colleague on the Opposition.  I do not think Deputy Major de Valera can have seriously studied the land code in view of his contribution here this evening.  His argument must inevitably fall to the ground on the basis that the situation which exists is that the general power he is complaining of vests in the Minister and under this new Act the Minister in fact is shedding infinitely more of the power he had before.  It goes further.  It removes, definitely and specifically, out of the hands of the Minister certain avenues of exploitation that Deputy de Valera thought might lead to political preference or to overpressure in any direction.  The Deputy cannot even be honest in reading what is the exception to the exception. He suggests that the Minister takes all power then releases certain facets of that power from his own grasp and tries to slide back through an exception to an exception and regain this power.  Read the little piece in brackets and co-relate it with the definition section.  Deliberately you ran away from the limitation because it did not suit the purpose of your argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy de Valera went further by suggesting that there is some new sinister grabbing of power, which you may deem absolute, by the Minister that was never there before. How could the Land Commission be run at all if the powers he is lamenting about were not vested in the titular head of the Department, the Minister? I want Deputy de Valera to get away for the moment from the legal society debate atmosphere and get down to the practical reality of what is being done in this Bill.  I will tell you what is being done.  I have a fairly intimate knowledge of the Land Commission, having had the good luck to have a revered <i>pére</i> there for a number of years.  I will tell you what the Minister is doing.  He is tidying up a bit of the mess, not as tidily as I would like to see it done, but at least he is certainly giving the Land Commission <Col N="1158" /> an opportunity of belying many of the statements made in this House that it is a groaning outworn machine incapable of any new impetus to solve this problem.</P>
      <P>I regard this particular section as one of the most significant advances yet made in our land code.  With regard to Deputy de Valera's worry about the exception to an exception, I have none, because I think that if the Deputy, and certainly Deputy Moran, addresses his mind to the problem that this exception to the exception deals with he will realise that it is a conscientious decent effort to meet that problem that cannot be met in any other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am approaching this from the point of view of the section as it stands.  I have expressed my views and I have pointed out that they are largely personal views.  We can relate this section as it stands to the 1933 Act.  In Section 6 of the 1933 Act you have an exception.  However, these two sections are similar, but Section 6 of the 1933 Act operates by way of giving the Minister all powers and then an exception.  But that sub-section does not go as far as to bring that power to the Minister's hands by way of an exception to an exception. Read Section 6 (1) of the 1933 Act. We have as one of the excepted matters sub-paragraph (d): &ldquo;the determination of the persons to be selected as allottees of untenanted land&rdquo;.  I would emphasise &ldquo;as allottees of untenanted land&rdquo;.  Here we have two changes.  I will admit that the first is favourable, and that is one of the reasons why this section is an advance, if the objectionable clause in parenthesis were removed.  Instead of &ldquo;persons to be selected as allottees of untenanted land&rdquo; it is &ldquo;any land&rdquo;.  I congratulate the Minister on the change from &ldquo;untenanted&rdquo; to &ldquo;any&rdquo;. The words in parenthesis to which we object give the Minister complete powers in regard to a rearrangement scheme and the rearrangement scheme, according to the sub-section, means &ldquo;a scheme which is framed or approved by an officer by virtue of sub-section (2) of this section for the rearrangement of lands held in rundale or intermixed <Col N="1159" /> plots whether with or without the distribution of other lands to facilitate the said rearrangement&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fail to get precisely Deputy Collins' point as to the exact force of that definition of &ldquo;rearrangement scheme&rdquo; on the argument which I made.  The real effect is that where a rearrangement is concerned and defined the powers will be out of the hands of the Minister.  I shall leave other Deputies who represent country constituencies and who are, therefore, more intimate with the matter to voice their objections on that.  I can see good theoretical reasons why it would be preferable to leave it in the hands of the statutory body, both from the Minister's point of view and from the public point of view.  But, dealing with this matter as it stands, I think it is objectionable.  Deputy McQuillan has talked about speed.  Let us ask ourselves seriously whether you will get very much speed through a State Department which has to deal with a multitudinous amount of affairs, nominally in the Minister's hands, or, as against that, through the deliberations and mechanisations of the Land Commission, which is also, as far as the Minister is concerned, a State Department. Are you going to get any great advance in speed by going to a Government Department under one head, so to speak, rather than to a Government Department under another head? There have always been and I think in all countries great complaints about delays in Government Departments. This arises because of the administrative machine and that applies equally to the Minister's Department and the Land Commission machine.  I do not know that the question of time is involved in this amendment; if it is solely a question of time I think the suggestion already made by Deputy Bartley is a good one, that the machinery heretofore has been satisfactory and that it has the advantages which we have mentioned. As to the suggestion of getting it speeded up, it would be better for the Minister to direct his attention towards lubricating, so to speak, the works of the Land Commission and providing facilities for getting the work <Col N="1160" /> done quickly rather than taking the power and the odium &mdash; because the Minister will appreciate there is odium attached to this&mdash;into the Minister's own hands.</P>

I said a short time ago that it is not my desire, nor should I like to see it in this Bill, that the question of increasing allotments, additions or new holdings should be left in the Minister's own hands.  The Deputy knows that the retention of that power in the Minister's hands would probably make life unbearable for him, but I take it that he would be satisfied if it were left in the hands of a senior inspector.  If the Deputy sees any way of amending that, of making it watertight, so that the power of allotment of new holdings or of additions to holdings, would not be in the Minister's hands, but would be an excepted matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is the type of thing which should not be in our legislation.  The Minister has asked Deputy Moylan if he can improve it.  I say it is the Minister's business to ask the parliamentary draftsman to draft the limited powers he wants so that when he brings forward any proposals in the form of a rearrangement scheme he will not have complete power in regard to any offer that is to be made, or any presents that will be made, <Col N="1162" /> arising out of such a scheme.

      <P>I am arguing here against giving to the Minister the power that is given to him in this section. He proposes to take powers which, in effect, mean that wherever he is able to relate his proposals to a rearrangement scheme, he can, in regard to (d) and (e) of sub-section (1)&mdash;in regard to one case it is the question of price which formerly was an excepted matter but it is no longer an excepted matter &mdash;hold that it is a matter for the Minister. He is taking power, if he is able to relate it to a rearrangement scheme, to settle the question of price and to settle the question of who is to get land.  That is a power which he should not seek and it is a power which should not be given to him on principle.  The giving of land to individuals from a pool of land, purchased by public money which was made available for the <Col N="1163" /> purpose, means that you are giving a certain amount of public money to these individuals.  It is the same as if you allowed the Minister to put his hand into the public treasury and to take out money to give to certain people whom he would select himself. I have opposed this section all through and I shall oppose it to the end.</P>

      <P>It does seem to me, from hearing the speeches of both Deputy de Valeras, that the one is confused by lack of appreciation, on legal grounds, of what this section aims at, and the other is confused because he does not know anything about the land of Ireland&mdash;that refers to Deputy de Valera senior.  I could not believe my ears when I heard him talking about the power given by this section to the Minister to give people a present of land.  I represent a country constituency which has a certain amount of congestion and which will, to a certain extent, be affected by the section, but I have not the personal knowledge of the Minister and other Deputies of this particular problem.  I do know that the entire problem to be tackled by rearrangement schemes does not involve the present from the Minister or the State of land to anybody.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether it is the policy of Deputies opposite to repeat things so as to try to convince people of something&mdash;I doubt if they can convince themselves. Here we have a sub-section referring merely to a rearranging scheme which is defined clearly in the section as a scheme dealing with land held in rundale or in intermixed plots.  That is clearly defined there and the section can only refer to that.  If there is any sense in clear words it is in that section. Nevertheless we have Deputy Vivion de Valera working himself up into a frenzy.  He arrived in the House at a late hour.  He sits back to see what the sub-section is about.  He reads it and he thinks he understands it.  The attitude shown by Deputy de Valera, senior, and the other Deputy de Valera is either the result of failure to appreciate this problem or it comes from a far more serious foundation.  I do not know whether either of the Deputies was in the House when the Minister spoke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I saw this particular section I had very definite views about it.  I felt there was something in the section that I might possibly take objection to.  I made inquiries which I considered proper with regard to it and I was satisfied as to the necessity and the urgency for this power.  I am certain that any Deputy who listened to the Minister speaking to-day and showing why these powers were required must have been convinced.  We heard the Minister stating that in one particular case for almost 40 years&mdash;and I am sure for considerably longer in <Col N="1165" /> other areas&mdash;there has been a problem of small holders with their acreage scattered all over a countryside, existing on what must be the very border of starvation.  It is like the case mentioned of the holder with seven acres in 33 different plots, not one of them touching&mdash;and they were unfenced plots.</P>
    <P>Problems like that that have continued for a great number of years can only be solved by the agreement of the parties concerned to a rearrangement, so that each will get an economic unit. Where that problem exists it is perfectly clear to anyone who understands the countryside and our people that when you are trying to get an agreement like that you must get the parties together and convince them that the particular scheme that is suggested is in their interest.  You must get the agreement and you must be in a position to enforce it there and then.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister pointed out satisfied me and would have satisfied Deputy Moylan if Deputy de Valera had not come into the House.  Where you have to have a rearrangement scheme like that, depending on old, creepy Civil Service machinery, where the particular scheme must go up as a proposal right to the hierarchy of the Land Commissioners to receive their sanction after consideration, and then go down again after a certain period of time as a sanctioned agreement, if you have that time lag, it is perfectly clear that what was agreed six months before will become in the interval somewhat upset and there will be disagreement.  I think it is perfectly clear, and I accept what the Minister said, that what I am saying now has been the experience of the Land Commission, and the Minister has been charged with that responsibility for a great number of years.  The proof is that this problem is still there and it cannot be solved because of the time lag and the difficulty of getting an official with plenary powers to deal with the problem on the spot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very surprised when I heard Deputy Bartley's contribution to the <Col N="1166" /> discussion.  Deputy Bartley, like Deputy Commons, Deputy McQuillan, the Minister and others, comes from an area in which there is considerable congestion.  He must be as well aware of this problem as any other Deputy. I am sure he spoke here in absolute good faith and what he said he meant, and it represented his experience. What was Deputy Bartley's contribution? He said that his experience was that the only thing wrong with the Land Commission with regard to rearrangement schemes was that they were too slow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOReilly" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate on this Bill was adjourned on Tuesday night I was discussing the Minister's claim that the increased volume of agricultural exports was an indication of the farmer being able to meet this additional charge.  I was making the point that if in the present year, or in some future year, those exports fell, was that to be an indication that the farmer was not in a position to meet this additional charge, or even to continue to pay the present statutory minimum wage of £3 a week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1167" /> I made it clear at the outset that I was anxious to see the agricultural labourer get a week's holidays, but I am doubly anxious to see that the man who employs him is also in a position to take a week's holidays and to give a week's holidays to the members of his family who work on the farm.  I think no one will dispute that they are as well entitled to a week's holidays in the year as any hired labourer.  They are at least as skilled as any hired labourer.  I claim that they are more skilled.  They give more personal attention to the work and are more anxious that it should succeed.  To say that, is not to cast any reflection on the agricultural labourer.  He belongs to a class that I maintain is more skilled than most other workers in the State, and he is certainly as honest and upright as any other class of worker.  I see no reason at all why the man who employs an agricultural labourer should not be in a position to afford to take a holiday himself and to give a holiday to the members of his own family.</P>
    <P>We now come to the question, can he afford to take this holiday, could he ever afford to take it?  Anyone living in rural Ireland will, I think, agree with me when I say that he could not and cannot, and that, as things are at the moment, he will not be able to do it in the future.  How can he get into the position, first of all, of being able to afford a holiday with pay to his labourers, and, secondly, to take a holiday himself?  It can only be through the prices which he realises for his produce, the net price he gets after meeting all expenses.  Therefore, unless the farmer is guaranteed, first of all, the costs of production and sufficient to guard against the risk of loss in any year, with a small profit for himself, how can he afford to take a holiday?</P>
    <P>If anyone is prepared to assert that he is in a position to do that at the moment, he has only to look at the division list on the agricultural costings motion which was discussed here a year ago, and there he will get the answer. Why did the Minister and those behind him, and his enemies across the House, and Labour almost <i>en bloc</i> join forces <Col N="1168" /> in the Division Lobby to prevent us putting to the test whether it was possible to work a farm profitably on current prices for agricultural produce where that farm was run completely by hired labour?  That was the acid test. If there was any doubt in the minds of the majority of those who voted against that motion that the price we are getting for our produce would not pay the labour, then why should they prevent it from being put to the test?</P>
    <P>We had another fairly good example, on the question of milk costings on the farm attached to the Grangegorman Mental Hospital, in the past week as to what it takes to pay hired labourers. I am not conversant with the system of running that farm, but I assume that it is, and has been, run entirely by hired labour.  The net result is that it cost 3/1 a gallon to produce milk there in 1948, and the estimate for the past year is 2/10½.  If that is so, it is quite clear that the farmer who is producing milk either to supply it to creameries or for sale for human consumption is getting much less than half the cost of production.  That, to my mind, is the test that the farmer himself has not a labourer's wage.  If he has not, are we not imposing an impossible burden on him if we compel him, by law, to pay something that the work of his agricultural worker will not take out of the land?</P>
    <P>Let me reiterate that I do not want to keep down the agricultural labourer or any other class of labourer, but I want to lift the income of the farmer who employs labour, and still more so the man who works his farm entirely with the aid of unpaid family labour.</P>

      <P>I am not going to vote against the Bill.  I do not want to cut down the agricultural labourer, but I want to draw attention to the financial position of the farmer and to his inability to meet this.  I want to refer particularly to the case of unpaid family labour.  The Minister's estimate <Col N="1169" /> of the income from agriculture in the past year is in or about £100,000,000. We have not got the figure of the total national income, but to make a rough guess I suppose it would be in or about £300,000,000 or £400,000,000.  If that is the case, then for £1 which the farmer earns the other sections of the community are getting say £2 10s. Od.  That does not reveal a healthy state in our national economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I need not dwell further on that because these figures reveal a very unhealthy state in the economics of the country.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dunne objected to the proposal whereby holidays may be arranged between employer and worker, and said it should not be tolerated.  He said that the worker should be guaranteed his holidays at the time that other people are taking their holidays which is usually August or September.  Just imagine what would happen if the agricultural labourers, their employers and unpaid family labour all took their holidays in the middle of the harvest.  What would become of the harvest and who would save it?  What would become of the cows, the calves, the pigs and the poultry and so on?  Would you not have an impossible position, and would not that situation create dire consequences for everyone in the State? The thing is so ridiculous that, I think, it does not need consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was another point made, chiefly I think by Deputy Dunne, who I think was joined by Deputy McQuillan. They appeared to represent agricultural employers as heartless individuals who abuse their workers and give them bad housing and bad sleeping accommodation. Deputy McQuillan, in particular, seems to be very keen on that, but I suggest to him that, if he is aware of any instance in which an agricultural employer has his worker sleeping under insanitary conditions or anything approaching them, it is his duty to report the matter to the county medical officer of health, and let him investigate it. If the medical officer finds that the surroundings are bad, let him take action <Col N="1170" /> but, at the same time, let him examine the conditions under which the farmer's family is living and compare them with the conditions under which the labourer is living.  I resent that idea of farmers being tyrants.  Are we to believe, as between employers and employees, that it is a case of sinners on one side and saints on the other?  Common sense ought to teach anyone that one person cannot have a monopoly of virtue and another a monopoly of vice.</P>
    <P>On the question of the desirability of the State interfering in the relations between the farmer and the agricultural worker, it would be wise to consider the report of the Commission on Vocational Organisation.  Nine or ten years ago that commission reported that the case of the agricultural worker was different from that of the industrial worker for this reason: in most cases the agricultural worker had to live in as one of the family and only in rare instances were agricultural workers employed who were living out; the vast majority live in with the family with which they are working and anything in the nature of trying to make hard-and-fast regulations as between them would not be to the benefit of the employer or employee.  Living in the same house and eating at the same table, they had a great community of interests and nothing should be done that would interfere with the family relationship which existed between the agricultural employer and his worker. That commission was not biassed in any direction.  Therefore, I suggest that serious attention should be given to the recommendations of that commistion on that subject.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne made the point that the Agricultural Wages Board was not competent to interfere between the agricultural employer and the labourer and should have no say in the matter of the operations of this Bill because, he said, the Agricultural Wages Board was prejudiced against the labourer. I agree with Deputy Dunne that the Agricultural Wages Board is not and never was competent to deal between the farmer and his labourer, but for a different reason.  I believe that, owing to the method of selection of the personnel of the board, it was definitely <Col N="1171" /> prejudiced against the employer.  I am not conversant with the personnel of the board itself, but my experience of the area committees has been that in the selection of members to advise the Agricultural Wages Board there seemed to be one qualification for those selected and that was that they should have no connection with any farmers' organisation in their area.  I shall conclude by asking if the Minister can give an assurance that the price of agricultural produce will be increased.</P>

      <P>The Minister seems to be anxious to know how Deputies will vote.  I can tell him that I intend to support this measure.  I believe that the farmer and the worker are the greatest assets we have in this country.  I believe that the farmer and the agricultural worker should at least get as decent remuneration as any other section of the community.  I would, however, point out that there are certain difficulties in that regard. There are certain people who want fresh milk of high quality from healthy cows delivered twice a day and they ask the farmer and the agricultural worker to produce that milk and deliver it at a certain price.  If the farmer were in the position of the person who makes lemonade, he could sell his lemonade in a bottle containing a quarter or one-third of a pint at 7d., which works out at about 13/- or 14/-per gallon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A man can make all the lemonade he likes in one day or one week, store it, and sell it when he likes, whereas the person who produces this very valuable commodity has to produce it fresh and deliver it twice daily while getting nothing like the price that this so-called lemonade, composed of water with gas pumped into it and a little bit of flavouring, can command.  I have been <Col N="1172" /> long enough in the world to know that it is an unfortunate thing in this and every other country that the people who produce the essential commodities get the lowest possible prices for them. It is only a fool who will go into the production of these essential commodities. Anyone who wants to make money will go into the business of producing luxury goods.  There is a difference between the farmer and the producer of luxury goods.  I have instanced lemonade to show the difference. If the essential commodity the farmer produces was not produced for even one day grave upset would be caused in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the farmers are not in a position to treat their workers in the same way as can the owners of firms producing luxury goods.  I think that position is wrong.  Certainly the farmers in County Cork do no begrudge for one moment paying a decent wage to their labourers or giving them decent facilities.  They treat the man who reaps and sows the wheat the same as they treat the man who handles it in the mill and who delivers it from door to door.  But they are in the difficult position that in many cases they are not able to do what they would like to do.  They have the will but they have not got the wherewithal.  In the last day or two we have heard what it costs to produce milk on the lands of Grangegorman Mental Hospital.  I presume there is a certain amount of unpaid labour on those lands because I understand that it is excellent treatment for mental patients to put them working in the fields now and again.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dunne mentioned on the last occasion this measure was before the House that in Dublin, an area which takes in Grangegorman, the agricultural workers have half-days, a week's holidays, Church holidays and bank holidays.  To produce a gallon of milk at Grangegorman costs 3/1.  Yet the ordinary farmer is expected to and does produce it at 1/2 a gallon.  I was rather intrigued with the solicitude of the city Deputies for the welfare of the farmers.  No one has a greater regard or respect for the <Col N="1173" /> farm worker than I have.  I believe he and the farmer are the greatest national assets we have.  There is a little bit of the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde about those city Deputies who come in here and crawthump about the agricultural worker.  In one debate they look for all sorts of things for the agricultural worker.  In the next debate they look for cheap food, cheap milk and cheap everything else.  That attitude is not consistent.  They cannot have it both ways and they need not think for one moment that they are fooling either the agricultural worker or the public.</P>

Certain city Deputies referred to many matters and I would suggest to them that they are very inconsistent in coming in here and saying we should give holidays and better conditions to the agricultural workers to-day when they will come in to-morrow saying we should have cheaper food.  The only way in which we can have cheaper food is by cutting down the wages and facilities given to the agricultural worker.</P>

I would suggest to the city Deputies, including Deputy Captain Cowan, that they have plenty of problems to which to apply themselves in the city.  When they have solved those problems they can then come out and speak to the country.  Reference was made here to the agricultural workers as being the depressed class. In my experience&mdash;I speak for Cork, about which I know something, but I am sure the same applies in Dublin&mdash; the depressed classes are the unfortunate typists who work for solicitors for 15/- and 20/- a week and are expected to pay their bus fares and buy their lunches out of it.</P>

      <P>We are in the very fortunate position that the relationship between the farmer and his worker is a friendly one.  The farmer and his worker work side by side. They understand one another's problems. I think it was most unfortunate that on this debate on holidays an effort was made to introduce an unchristian atmosphere of class hatred as between the farmer and his worker. That is something to be deplored.  Both the farmer and his worker will resent some of the remarks that were made in the course of this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.D. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Some city Deputies suggested that a specified period should be laid down during which holidays should be taken.  One brilliant suggestion was the month of August.  Another was the month of September.  Somebody else suggested May.  If they had the slightest idea of conditions in rural Ireland they would know that they might as well come here and propose that the shop assistants in Dublin should take their holidays during Christmas week.</P>
      <P>It shows a complete misunderstanding of the position in the country.  May I cite the example of the postmen? They will not take their holidays in the summer months because they prefer walking around in those months delivering the post.  They want their holidays when the snow is on the ground, when it is raining hard or freezing. That is the time they take their holidays.  Deputy Dunne and Deputy Cowan do not understand the rural mentality.  If they did they would know that what they suggest would not suit the people in rural Ireland.  While they are shouting and pretending to speak on their behalf they are doing something against the wishes of the rural workers in Ireland.  The natural and the sensible thing, if they know anything about conditions in rural Ireland, would be to let the farmer and the farm worker arrange that matter for themselves.  Deputy McQuillan made an outrageous speech.  It was scurrilous and full of misrepresentation. It was the most extraordinary speech.

      <P>I want to refer now to the figures given by the Minister. I have a great respect for him. I believe he is fundamentally right but only occasionally wrong.  He made a good case but he has given figures of increased production to justify his wages&mdash;increased agricultural income. <Col N="1177" /> I think the Minister was a little bit flamboyant in that in as much as he gave the gross agricultural income instead of the net agricultural income. The gross agricultural income really conveys nothing because, as the Minister and the House know, there were considerable quantities of agricultural fertilisers, machinery, maize and other commodities imported in a certain year and to give the gross agricultural income does not necessarily mean that the farmer is so much better off.</P>

      <P>I just want to mention that point to the Minister and to say that, generally, I am glad that an effort is being made to improve the position of the agricultural worker and that I hope that the city Deputies, in future, will at least be consistent in their remarks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would very nearly start my contribution to this measure by saying &ldquo;God Save Ireland&rdquo;.  It is an extraordinary state of circumstances that those leading the company are Deputy P.D. Lehane and Deputy O'Reilly, who is sitting behind me.  But when I see Deputy Corry on the other side with the same type of mentality I think I am very wise to be independent, all alone.  I am not going into the price of milk in Grangegorman.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Or lemonade, for that matter.  But if the figures mentioned by Deputy Lehane and Deputy <Col N="1178" /> O'Reilly are correct it would seem to me that it is not the cows they are milking in Grangegorman but the ratepayers. It is an extraordinary thing that when the Minister has introduced this measure of justice&mdash;because that is all one can call it&mdash;for the agricultural workers, we have Deputies damning the measure with hardly discernible praise.</P>
      <P>For many years the agricultural worker has been endeavouring and seeking to get a short period of six or seven days' holidays in the year, with pay.  It is a very small thing to ask for. Were it not for the development of a trade union, that ensures it in the particular part of the country in which the union operates, the agricultural workers in that area would not have got that measure of justice.  But, even when the agricultural workers by trade union organisation in a small section of the country established that, no effort was made by the farmers in the rest of the country, friendly and all as they were, so that their agricultural workers would get the benefit also.  Some farmers did it, but they are in a very small minority.  It required the Minister to introduce a Bill in this House to make it a statutory obligation on them to give those six days' holidays in the year to agricultural workers and if that Bill had not been brought in, and is not passed, no matter how good the relations are between the agricultural workers and the farmers, the agricultural workers will not get those few holidays in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, it is the height of nonsense when the Bill very properly leaves the period to be decided between the agricultural worker and the farmer, for Deputies to ask: &ldquo;If all the workers went away in the month of September, what would happen to the harvest?&rdquo;  That is not argument.  It is nonsense and nonsense is being advanced here under the guise of argument. I can see these Deputies going down and speaking at farmers' clubs, condemning the Minister for Agriculture for putting this extra impost on them, when he would not give them some increase in the price of milk or in the price of some other commodities they produce.  I ask Deputy O'Reilly and Deputy P.D. Lehane, when this <Col N="1179" /> measure is passed and passed with the aid of their votes, are they going down to farmers' clubs to condemn the Minister for introducing it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked how much does this cost?  If a farmer employs one agricultural worker, and gives him his holidays in accordance with the Act, how is that going to affect the price of milk?  If any Deputy produced any statistics to show that the giving of these holidays with pay is going to interfere to the smallest decimal point of a penny with the cost of production, then there would be some argument to be made.  I am not concerned with the matter except from the angle that farming, and I have always said so, is a very important industry in this country.  We have other industries in this country too and under other Acts those industries and industrialists are bound to provide holidays with pay for the workers.  I do not know that representatives of these industries when the measure was going through this House demanded because of that an increase in their selling prices.  I am not concerned with that, but there is one point that struck me as very strange.  This is a Parliament which is legislating for the people as a whole and there are Deputies here who represent interests other than those of farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If on every occasion that arose, those Deputies got up and advocated their own claims to an increase, I do not think they would be doing the nation's business.  If every time some matter of law arose, Deputy Con Lehane, myself or some other legal Deputy made a demand for an increase in our costs, what would be said about it?  But on every conceivable debate farmers who are Deputies are availing of this House for the purpose of making claims for an increase in their own remuneration. <Col N="1180" /> I do not think that is part of the business of the Dáil.  I do not think it is right.  I think that a Deputy who is sent in here to represent a constituency is bound to represent that constituency and not his own interests in that constituency. I think farmers who are Deputies ought to realise that just as those who are not farmers.  Deputy Lehane speaks about city Deputies What does he mean by a city Deputy? He describes me as a city Deputy.  Am I a city Deputy because I represent a city constituency?  May I say that I am the son of a worker in County Cavan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I think Deputy Giles knows that the farmers of this country never did as well as they are doing now.  I know if I were a sensible man I would be a farmer and not a fool.  We have two types of farmer in this country&mdash;in fact we have several types.  We have the type of farmer whom Deputy O'Reilly knows and he is a very different type from the type Deputy P.D.

They should have said: &ldquo;We are living in the closest co-operation with our agricultural workers; we are delighted to see a law passed by which each and every one of those workers will be guaranteed a week's holidays in the year; we know there will be no trouble between ourselves and the agricultural workers in regard to the time at which those holidays are going to be taken; we are sorry that, as farmers, we could not have combined and unanimously, with one voice, arranged to give these holidays without putting the Minister to the trouble of introducing a Bill to compel us to give them.&rdquo;  That would have been a reasonable and proper attitude, but no matter whether Deputy O'Reilly or Deputy P.D. Lehane or Deputy Corry says he will vote for the Bill or not, the fact will be clear that this little measure of justice, when it is passed, will be passed in spite of those Deputies who say they represent the farmers in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see in the near future a substantial change in the machinery of agriculture.  I can see developing a situation where seven days' holidays, <Col N="1182" /> one week's holidays, will not be acceptable to the organised agricultural workers.  That position will come from organisation on the part of the workers themselves, and it will come from the development of agriculture under the Minister, who is anxious to see farming industrialised in this country.</P>

      <P>Well, mechanised. We are just proceeding by steps.  The union of which Deputy Dunne is general secretary has done a good day's work in opening up this question of holidays for agricultural workers. The Minister has done a tremendous job in proposing to give statutory sanction to that in this Bill.  When the social history of this country is written in the future those things will be considered just as steps on the way and Deputies like Deputy O'Reilly and Deputy P.D. Lehane, whether they call themselves farmers' representatives or not, will and must realise that the time has passed when agricultural workers could be, as they have been, treated as slaves in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to protest against the winding up remark of the last Deputy.  I want to assure him that the agricultural workers in this country were never treated as slaves by the farmers.  The agricultural workers have worked side by side with the farmers and as the farmers' conditions improved or disimproved so did the conditions of the agricultural workers all down the years.  They had the same basis of livelihood as the farmers who employed them.  It must be remembered that 90 per cent. of the farm workers worked on farms where the farmer himself was an ordinary worker.  In the 40 years that I can remember they lived on the same basis as the farmer for whom they worked, whether it was a bad one, a middling one or a good one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People who come from the country and who understand the position must resent remarks such as were made by Deputy Cowan, and Deputy Con Lehane a few days ago, and other <Col N="1183" /> Deputies, who do not understand the problem.  Nobody will deny that over long periods the standard of farm workers, just as the standard of the farmers for whom they worked, was not as high as might be desired.  I can remember quite well the conditions over 40 years and farmers never treated their workers as slaves.  There was no such thing at any time.  It is an unfair libel on the farming community to say so.</P>
    <P>There are different problems in different parts of the country.  Probably you have around the cities, where relations between employers and workers are different from what you meet with in the heart of the country, a certain viewpoint, but it is grossly unfair to suggest that there is a deliberate policy on the part of the agricultural community to treat farm workers as slaves.  They have always been treated by the farmers as well as they could afford to treat them.</P>

      <P>There are workers, single men, who have no homes of their own and they may have had accommodation like that, but they lived in comfortable conditions.  There may be odd ones who are unfairly treated in the matter of their sleeping accommodation, but that is not the fault of the farmer.  Most farmers would prefer to employ married men who live quite convenient to them.  Farmers have to employ them sometimes.  It is not for choice and it is no advantage to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister when he was introducing the Bill was assured of the goodwill of all sides of the House.  It is something nobody can object to.  I cannot see any difficulty in having it operated.  Given goodwill there will be no real difficulty.  There is quite a possibility that a good number of farm <Col N="1184" /> workers will get fewer holidays under this Bill when it is in operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be numbers who will receive fewer holidays in the year.  That is quite possible in the matter of staggered holidays and because of the staggered way in which they are paid&mdash;the days they do not do any work.  I suggest to the Minister that he might improve the Bill as regards the period he allows for broken time due to sickness.  I think that eight days are too short a period.  A man might be out sick for a month, six weeks, or two months.  I think that should not debar him from getting his full number of holidays.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister brings in an amendment I will have no objection to it.  The eight days seem to me to be too short a period to allow for illness. I do not want to see this Bill a cause of friction between farmers and their workers.  I am sure that neither the Minister nor anybody else desires that. This matter about the eight days might be considered by the Minister.  The matter of staggered holidays may give rise to a difference of opinion.  Possibly the proper thing to do would be to give a man all his holidays at the one time.  It would be the simplest way from the farmer's point of view. Otherwise difficulties may arise with men as to whether they got the full number of days or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many men get staggered holidays throughout the year for which they are paid.  That happens right through the country.  It is not correct to say that men on farms work 365 days and never have a day off with pay.  Conditions <Col N="1185" /> in the heart of the country are different from what they may be around a city like Dublin where farming is not carried on in the same lines.  A man near the city who is not a farmer at all may own very big tracts of land. The less regimentation there is in farming life, between farmers and their workers, the better it will be.  Farming is, and always will be, different from industrial life.  Nothing that we do here will make farming similar to what industrial life is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I said openly that I was voting for it.  In connection with the Agricultural Wages Act, or any other Act dealing with agriculture, the less regimentation you have the better.  If there is too much of it you can create difficulties and friction.  At certain seasons of the year there has to be, in the case of farming, a good deal of give and take.  There is that spirit amongst farmers and their workers all the time. They agree to give and take in periods of broken weather and at other difficult times.  That position cannot obtain in the case of industrial workers.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with some of the reasons which the Minister gave for bringing in this Bill.  He gave some figures setting out the increased value of agricultural produce.  I would ask him to take note of this, that the farmer is getting no more for his milk and his beet to-day than he was getting three years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not production higher?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Production fluctuates according to the season.  In respect of milk, beet and wheat, which are three important items of agricultural production, the farmer is getting no more per ton or per gallon than he was getting three years ago under the prices fixed by the Minister's predecessor.  Is that not true?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Minister.  As Deputy Lehane of Cork pointed out a moment ago, the farmer's income is no greater now than it was two or three years ago in respect of many items of agricultural production. The farmer that is not engaged in cattle raising, but is engaged in milk production, is paying more wages and more rates now&mdash;and his overhead costs are higher&mdash;than he was paying a couple of years ago.  His costs of production are higher.  I think no one can deny that.  The Minister may claim that the farmer is getting more for a dropped calf.  I make him a present of that. But the farmer who is depending for the main portion of his income on the beet that he grows is getting no more per ton for it than what the Minister's predecessor allowed him.  There may be an increase in the tonnage from year to year, but tonnage will go up and down according to the seasons.  That depends, mainly, on the seasons, and on the amount of artificial manure that is available, and on some other factors. With Deputy Smith, I want to say that this Party welcomes the Bill, and will do their best to help the Minister to implement it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to put the Minister's mind completely at rest as regards this Bill, I want to say I am supporting it.  I believe it is better that the relationship between the farmer and his workers should be governed by statute rather than it should be controlled by conflicts between big organised unions.  If we have relations controlled by statute, at least there is a chance that reason and commonsense will prevail.  But, if we have the worker controlled and dominated by city men to a great extent, and the farmers' organisations controlled by big employers who may have other interests apart from farming, you can expect nothing but bitter conflict.  Therefore, I say it is better that this matter should be settled by statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, in so far as it will need to be enforced&mdash;and I think there will not be very great need for the employment of sanctions by the Minister to enforce it&mdash;will be enforced by Government inspectors.  It is necessary to say this because, when the Minister first <Col N="1187" /> assumed office, he pronounced with a great flourish of trumpets that inspectors were to be kept outside the farmer's fence.  Under this Bill, a Government inspector will have a right to go on any farm and see how that farm is worked and what are the relations between the farmer and the workers.  He can drive his polished car into the farmer's yard, stop some man who is in the act of ringing a pig or cleaning an outhouse, and ask him if he has had his holidays or when he proposes to take them.  If he finds out that the man he is speaking to happens to be the farmer, he can ask him if he has any men employed, if he is giving them their holidays, and when and how many.</P>
    <P>It is necessary that the lie should be killed once and for all that a farmer is immune from inspection.  The Minister has gone through the country announcing that the farmers were a privileged class whose farms no inspector could dare to enter, and that any inspector who would enter upon a farmer's land without the farmer's consent would have to step across the Minister's dead body, or words to that effect.  It is satisfactory that this position has been cleared up.  From now on people in the towns and cities, who are jealous of the farmer and who think the farmer is specially privileged, will know that the farmer is in the same position as themselves so far as inspectors are concerned.  Business men's premises are subject to inspection; factories are subject to inspection. Under this Bill, the farmer will be subject to inspection.  I am not objecting to that.  We are living in a small country; we are all interdependent upon each other and there is no reason why any section should have the special privilege of being completely immune from inspection.  Our only claim &mdash; I think the Minister will agree with me in this&mdash;is that the regimentation and interference ought to be cut down to the minimum.  I think everyone will agree on that.  So far as the farmers and their workers are concerned, there ought to be the best relations between them; there ought to be friendship and goodwill and co-operation between them.</P>

      <P>The Minister wants the House to believe that this Bill can be enforced without any officers of the Agricultural Wages Board taking direct action or making an investigation.  If that is what the Minister wants to put across the House, he is only trying to deceive himself, but he is not deceiving the House.  I have said that it is desirable that good relations should exist and that so far as the farming community are concerned they will cooperate in carrying out the provisions of this Bill and in making it work through goodwill and co-operation between themselves and the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over a period which those of us who are middle-aged can remember there has been a better standard of living for the working classes generally.  The improvement of the standard of living of the agricultural workers, however, has been much greater than the improvement in agricultural prices. We know that the Agricultural Prices Index shows that agricultural prices have increased 150 per cent. since 1911, but agricultural wages have increased 500 per cent.  Therefore, so far as there was a gap between the standard of living of the farmer and the worker, that gap has been very much narrowed. As a matter of fact, I think it has been wiped out completely, because the Minister quoted a figure which I think will be accepted by the House without reservation, the figure of the net income of agriculture.  I think it was the net income he was referring to. <Col N="1189" /> He stated that the net income last year was £100,000,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  That is the estimated agricultural income.  There is a slight statistical difference between the net output and the agricultural income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that.  I think that figure will be accepted.  So far as I can ascertain, it is reasonably accurate.  It looks an enormous amount of money when you take it altogether but, when you realise that there are over 600,000 people gainfully employed in the agricultural industry and you divide £100,000,000 between 600,000 people, you find that each person engaged in the agricultural industry has a yearly income of £166.  These are the people who, according to the statistics, are registered as working in agriculture.  That has to be divided between them; £100,000,000 is £166 per year for each person, or £3 4s. Od. per week.  I want to amplify that by saying that there are a number of people who help on the farm but they are not included in the statistics because they are under age.  Now £3 4s. 0d. per week is the average income for each person.  We know there are people who have considerably more than that. Since there are people who have more than that there must be a considerable number who have far less.  There must be a considerable number who are working for practically next to nothing.  They are not agricultural labourers because their wages are controlled by statute.  Who are the people, then, who are working for less than the average?</P>

      <P>The Minister cannot take even the mildest criticism from one of his staunchest supporters.  I do not think I should be interrupted like this. The Minister yelled at me for two hours last week for advocating a better price for pigs.  I did not then interrupt him once notwithstanding the fact that he was out of order all the time he was speaking because he was speaking with his back to the Chair.  I would like those Deputies who think barracking is good tactics to listen to what I have to say.  I want to deal with this seriously and I cannot do that if there are interruptions.</P>
      <P>I have shown that all the abuse heaped upon the unfortunate farmer in this debate has no foundation whatsoever. When one realises how low is the average income of the agricultural community one must realise, too, that the farming community is doing its best to satisfy the just claims of its workers and to deal fairly with them. We are not dealing with the big employers here.  We are not dealing with men who drive to work in their own cars and who can sit in their offices all day long.  We are not dealing with men who can have paid officials, supervisors, or charge hands to supervise the work for them.  We are dealing with ordinary farmers.  Each farm is a small unit of production in which the farmer and his men work together.  Any attempt on the part of Deputies to sow seeds of mistrust or ill-will for political reasons between these two important sections of the community must be most emphatically condemned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the greatest tragedy that ever struck the agricultural industry was that in 1922, when agricultural prices collapsed for the first time after the first world war, the agricultural labourers, who were then organised, and the agricultural employers who were also organised, fought between themselves instead of working to secure better conditions for the industry generally.  They engaged in a bitter conflict which ruined them both and smashed their organisation and their industry for many years.  That continued until the last war broke out. <Col N="1191" /> I think we ought to do all we can to improve the goodwill and co-operation between these two important sections of the community.  They can do and are doing good work.  They will do good work if they are left alone.</P>
    <P>This Bill establishes one important principle.  Taken in conjunction with the Agricultural Wages Act this Bill places a floor under the conditions of employment and wages of agricultural workers.  The State has intervened to place that floor under the wages and conditions of these workers and, because the State has done that, it has taken upon itself the obligation to place a similar floor under the wages of the agricultural employer, that is, the net price that he gets for his produce. No Minister in future can ever get away with the suggestion that farmers' prices must be governed by the law of supply and demand or by some external conditions dictated by vested interests.  Because the State has come to the rescue of the agricultural worker the State must stand between the farmer and any injustice imposed upon him from outside by world conditions.  Never again can the pig producer, the milk producer and the oat producer be told to go and take a running jump at himself.  The day for these competitions is passed. Those days are gone for all time.  From now on the Government must take on itself an obligation which it can neither evade nor ignore.  I am glad for that reason that this Bill has been introduced. I am glad that there will now be a decent standard of living as compared with other sections of the community. It is not a very high standard and, indeed, it is a poor standard when compared with some sections of the community.  But it is at least a minimum standard for the agricultural worker.  Progressively the farmer's conditions must be similarly improved. I have only one fault to find with the Bill.  It does not go far enough.  It is a good thing to give holidays with pay to agricultural workers.  What about the farmer's wife?  What about the farmer's son and the farmer's daughter?  This Bill should also embrace those.</P>

Unfortunately the agricultural industry has been carried on in this country for the last 30 years on the labour of the members of the farmer's family.  The Minister knows that.  It has been carried on on the unpaid labour of his sons and daughters and other members of his family.  I am glad that Deputy P.D. Lehane had the courage to suggest that the provisions of this Bill should apply also to employees in solicitors' and lawyers' offices.  I do not think the farmers should be singled out as the only persons from whom it is necessary to extract a statutory minimum wage.</P>

      <P>The Minister may attempt, when replying to this debate, to question figures I have given.  He may attempt to mislead the House to the effect that the income of the farmer is higher than I have stated it to be.  Several attempts have been made, as Deputy O'Reilly pointed out, to put this matter to a test by having a fair investigation.  The county committee of agriculture, of which I am a member, have asked the Minister to sanction the purchase by that committee of a farm so as to carry out an impartial investigation into costs, but, so far, the Minister has not given his consent to that proposal.  Until we have really reliable statistics on costings in every branch of the agricultural <Col N="1193" /> industry we shall be running around in circles and we shall have figures which will be disputed by the advocates of one particular section of the community or another.  It is desirable that we should have an impartial investigation into farmers' costings once and for all and so end the interminable debates in this House in regard to farmers' income and the income of the agricultural industry.  Therefore, I think that having decided to establish a position, below which it will be impossible to lower the paid agricultural workers of this country, it is only right and proper that we should follow the action to its logical conclusion.</P>

As far as I can gather from those who have spoken on behalf of the farmers, the Bill is quite unnecessary; what it is proposed to set out is already given; the Bill is completely unjustified, and it would not be a good thing to try to intrude on the loving farmer and farm labourer with any type of statutory control or anything that would prevent the tender-hearted farmer from looking after his farm labourers.  Even the farmer Deputies themselves cannot make up their minds on what exactly they want.  It is interesting that, although all of them said so in their speeches, they are going to vote for the measure.  Only one Deputy actually commended the Minister for dealing with this matter by statute&mdash;Deputy Cogan.  He then felt that he had a very facile argument to make a further plea for farmers.  But the attitude of the rest of the Deputies who claimed to speak for the farmers has been very simple.  They say that so far as farm labourers are concerned the best friend of the farm labourer is the farmer; that on every occasion, whenever it is possible, the farmers increase the wages, reduce the hours, give them days off in <Col N="1194" /> the year&mdash;they even give them time off to go to race-meetings.  I noticed one gap.  They did not say that the farmers actually give a week's holidays with pay to their labourers.  As far as I can see, judging by the speeches of these Deputies, whatever the farm labourer asks from the farmer will be granted, just merely for the asking.  Is that not codology?</P>
      <P>There are two particular points involved. Nobody in this House&mdash;certainly no one who represents the city constituencies and who speaks on behalf of industrial workers&mdash;has a feeling of unfriendliness or antagonism towards the farmers or towards agriculture. But it is about time that the farmers realised that not merely must they try and avoid a sense of antagonism but that they must try and cultivate friendship, and we do not do that by being dishonest with each other.  We who come from the cities have never posed in this House as being experts in agriculture.  On the whole, I think we have refrained from interfering in a debate where the technical aspects of agriculture were being discussed.  We have not taken an arbitrary attitude towards the matters raised by the farmers in regard to prices and conditions although everybody is aware that any improvement in farm prices must ultimately be met by the consumer.</P>
      <P>We left it to those whom we thought were competent to judge to try and decide the matter.  Everybody knows that it is almost impossible to get two farmer Deputies to agree upon any single matter connected with agriculture, whether it be the technical aspect of agriculture, prices, the type of agriculture this country is engaged in or even the treatment of labourers.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lehane and Deputy Allen say that in fact there is no need for legislation to deal with the conditions of farm labourers.  Yet Deputy Allen is a member of a Party which, because of the conditions in which they found the farm labourers some years ago, had to impose by statute a floor under the wages of the agricultural labourers. Nevertheless he says there is no need for this measure and that if the farmers are left to themselves they will provide as decent wages as agriculture can provide for the farm labourers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1195" /> He says that they will provide holidays and that they will raise their standard of living side by side with that of their own.</P>
    <P>I venture to say that there is not one person here who wishes to deny to farmers an opportunity of raising their standard of life.  The sooner the farmers themselves and their spokesmen realise that, the more progress we can make.  Sometimes men and women have to be driven forward and shaken out of themselves.  It is not the first time that an effort made by a wage earner to try and improve his conditions&mdash;to try and obtain protection for himself&mdash;has been the spur that has driven his employer forward to try and claim what he also, as a human being, is entitled to.  I do not claim to represent and to speak for farm labourers although I have had some slight association with their organisation, but when they seek to improve their conditions they do so, not in a sense of antagonism towards farmers, but in the belief that as human beings they have certain elementary rights, and that they would be only too glad if there could be this friendship and understanding that is claimed to exist to-day.  It may exist between individual farmers and men. It may exist, possibly, in some restricted areas in the country.  However, everybody knows from actual experience over the years&mdash;and let us not go back ten or 15 years but over the last half century&mdash;that any improvement that has been made in the conditions of farm labourers as a class has been made because of the pressure exercised by these farm labourers themselves and by the general influence of the raising of the general standard in the country.</P>
    <P>Go through any farming district where you have a number of farms.</P>
    <P>Go into any farming district where you have the bigger and the smaller farms and where, as Deputy Cogan says, you may see one farmer driving around in a luxurious motor car and another farmer trudging along the road.  Do you find that the prosperity of the gentleman who is driving around in his car is represented by the difference in wages which he pays as compared <Col N="1196" /> with the wages paid by the poorer farmer?  Does the well-to-do farmer recognise the value given to him by his farm labourers and out of his prosperity give them something above the minimum wage?  We are told repeatedly that that is the case. It has never been borne out in practice yet and I have listened to farmers discussing the matter with farm labourers across the conference table on many occasions.</P>
    <P>So far, the farmer Deputies who have spoken on this measure have been completely dishonest in the matter.  On the one hand, they say they are voting for the measure, voting to impose a statutory obligation on farmers, and at the same time they explain that it is completely unnecessary to impose any obligation on the farmers at all in this matter.  Deputy Cogan says that the statutory regulation of this matter would not have come about as between the farmer and the labourer but for what he calls the &ldquo;big organisation&rdquo;. It is a very good thing for a lot of people in this country that the big organisation came into the country. Deputy Cogan, of course, was referring to the trade union movement.  I have, on occasion, listened to spokesmen of trade unions speaking to farmers across the conference table and expressing the view that if the farmers themselves were not prepared to move forward in a progressive manner and deal, as Deputy Cogan has said, as a collective body with the problems of the industry, with the object of trying to provide for the producers in that industry a higher standard of living, then the farm labourers or the organisation would put pressure on them that would make it impossible for them to avoid a decision and would press them forward whether they liked it or not.</P>
    <P>One of the questions to which we must have regard in this measure is that not only is it of benefit to the farm labourers but it can also be a benefit to the great mass of the poorer type of farmers who, as Deputy Cogan says, labour in the same way as the worker and possibly do not enjoy any higher standard of living.  The very attempt by the wage earner to improve his conditions must have a very beneficial <Col N="1197" /> effect on the conditions of the general mass of the people engaged in agriculture.  From that point of view, this Bill should be welcomed by the farmers because it is something that will, in a general way, apart from other advantages, tend to bring about a new outlook among farmers themselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan has also stated that the farm labourer is no more a slave than members of the farmer's own family and that the farmer has passed through a period when he had to contend with very bad conditions.  Everybody is aware that farmers have gone through times that we hope they will never see again.  All of us would be only too glad to assist and co-operate with them in seeing that those times do not return but we should face the actual position that we know does exist, not only in relation to agriculture but in regard to industry as a whole.  I said I have very little experience of agriculture but I have a great deal of experience of employers and I have yet to learn of any occasion where any group of employers of their own volition, without pressure of any kind, out of the increased prosperity that might come from time to time in their business, voluntarily and without pressure, came to their workers and said: &ldquo;Look here, we have had a better year this year than last year and we think it is only right that you should share in the increased profit.&rdquo;  Whether we like it or not, that is not the position. It is because that attitude of mind is not merely peculiar to problems in industry and commerce but is also an attitude to be found amongst farmers &mdash;for which I blame neither the farmer nor the industrialist, because it is a product of the system under which we all work&mdash;that we have to exert pressure to improve conditions and improve wages, to shorten hours and to provide holidays, and where we have to deal with an industry like agriculture, in which the workers are dispersed all over the country, we are obliged to have recourse to the power of legislation to try to effect what is effected in industry by organisation.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister is to be commended on this Bill.  While I have criticised the Farmer Deputies for <Col N="1198" /> some of the arguments they put forward in regard to the atmosphere in which the Bill has been introduced and the feeling that it is not altogether essential, I think we should give credit to them to the extent that they are prepared to support the passage of the Bill through the Legislature. At the same time, having agreed in principle that we should deal with wages in agriculture by statute&mdash;putting a floor under wages, as Deputy Cogan said&mdash;we should recognise that conditions in agriculture make somewhat similar regulations necessary when we come to deal with holidays. Quite clearly, whatever we do provide is not being related to the conditions of the most prosperous farmer, in the same way as when we were dealing with wages, the scales of wages were related to the capacity of the poorer farmer.</P>
    <P>If we provide a minimum of a week's holidays, those farmers who are in a more prosperous condition than the average farmer may, out of a feeling of goodwill towards their workers, give more than a week, but at least, we will have put in this floor for farm labourers as Deputy Cogan said.  I hope that the farmer himself will also see that he takes the same relief from work as we are proposing to provide by legislation for his farm labourer.  Very often a man has to be taught a sense of independence, to realise that he is not some kind of beast to work from dark to dawn and that he should have at least as much respect for himself and his workers as he has for the animals on his farm.  A man can easily lose that sense of proper understanding and sometimes we may have to restore it to him.  I think that in that respect this Bill will be beneficial in bringing about an improvement in the general standard of life in the country.</P>
    <P>There are one or two points in the Bill itself to which I should like to make some reference.  First of all, I think it is a pity that the Minister in drafting the Bill did not keep somewhat closer to the framework set out in the Holidays (Employees) Act, because it will be found later when the Bill becomes law, that that particular type of drafting would be much easier to apply <Col N="1199" /> and would be open to less misunderstandings and difficulties.  However, he has departed from it and we must merely follow his example.</P>
    <P>We should bear in mind that the object of the Bill is to give holidays, not additional pay, and therefore I think that whatever amendments may be introduced on the Committee Stage in order to try to ensure that the holidays will be taken and that as much preference or option will be taken away from both the farmer and the labourer as possible, they should be sympathetically considered by the Minister.  I have had experience of dealing with industrial workers whose sole concern was not to receive the holiday break from work to which they were entitled but to go on working, drawing holiday pay and drawing an additional week's wages for the week they should have been on holiday.  It would be most regrettable if we left ourselves open to the same type of abuse in regard to the farm labourer.</P>
    <P>I can understand the difficulty in regard to fixing a holiday period.  It is true that we have them fixed in regard to industry, but they were fixed by trade union agreement and not laid down in any statute and the attempt to reconcile the holiday period with the legal obligation to give holidays on the termination of 12 months' service seems to create a contradiction it would be almost impossible to solve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a provision that there must be a day's holiday at the end of every two months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak of the granting of a week's holiday within a certain period of the year.  It is a difficulty it is almost impossible to reconcile.  The other point is that if we contemplate giving a rest we should also see that we take away as far as we can within reason the option of either the employer or the worker so taking those days of rest as to be of no value to the worker.  I think it is objectionable that a worker can be given and can elect to take a day here and there. The whole purpose of the holidays is to give the worker, whether a farmer or a <Col N="1200" /> wage earner, a complete break from work at least for one period during the year.  That is the main thing.  I am quite aware that farmers will argue it is not possible to do that.  I frankly do not believe that it is impossible.</P>
      <P>I remember on one occasion listening to a farmer's representative arguing against the granting of a half-day.  He explained his farm was so highly organised and the last second was so well accounted for that it was impossible with the 365 days to take one worker away from his scheduled task without the whole economy of the farm breaking down.  I think it is correct to say that if there is this goodwill on the part of farmers there will be no difficulty within the period of a year to grant to the farm labourer a week completely free from work and not to scatter the days over the year so that they will be of no value to the worker and will be only a cause of annoyance to the employer.  Even in highly organised undertakings there are workers taking a week's holiday in the month of December, so those things do happen occasionally.</P>
      <P>There is one other matter I want to touch upon and that is the question raised here before, a question on which I am still not clear.  I refer to the weekly half-holiday.  I am not directly taking issue with the Minister as to whether it should be in the Bill or not. We in the cities frankly cannot understand why it is not possible by agreement, by statutory regulation or otherwise for a farm labourer to be granted a minimum of four or five hours off in the week.  I have listened to farmers arguing against it and explaining the difficulties and I am still not convinced that it is not a practicable possibility. As to whether they are entitled to it, I do not think any farmer or his representative will argue that a man is not entitled once a week outside of God's day to have a few hours to himself, the same as every other type of worker in the State has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that so far as the workers in the cities are concerned they would have the greatest sympathy and understanding for the suggestion that what they have enjoyed for so many years&mdash; that is, a half-day break either to <Col N="1201" /> spend with their families, for shopping or for any other purpose&mdash;should also be given to the farm labourer.  I do not believe any farmer can argue against the right of the worker to have it.  I am equally not convinced that by goodwill, and making allowance for the types of farming in different parts of the country and by agreement on each farm, it would not be possible to grant that short period to this class of worker.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies objected to the description given when farm labourers were described as a depressed class.  I believe they are.  The man to-day who is asked to keep a family on £3 or £3 5s. a week&mdash;I do not know how he can be anything else but depressed.  The proof is that our main worry in the cities is the continuous drift into them of farm labourers who feel that if there is any outlet from the countryside they should take it to get away from conditions that they feel they cannot any longer put up with.  Farmer Deputies are not entitled to protest when we say that these workers are in a depressed class. Many of the farmers themselves are a depressed class.  The farmers are not all in the same group.  They do not all come up in luxurious American motor cars to the city.  They do not all have big bank balances and they do not all invest in industry.</P>
    <P>There is as great a gap between the poor farmer and the wealthy farmer as there is between the farm labourer and the wealthy farmer and when we make this criticism about a depressed class and about slaves I do not think the farmer Deputies should feel we are saying things that are unjust and that are inspired by antagonism.  There are conditions in this country that we all regret and that we hope we are getting away from and we are all prepared to co-operate in the effort to get rid of those conditions.  But we will not get anywhere by shutting our eyes to the fact that we have 85,000 permanent farm labourers and 50,000 casual workers.  That means that one-third of the total wage-earning class in agriculture is depending upon casual employment. How else could we have anything but depression in that group?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1202" /> That is the situation facing us.  To what extent the Minister has made an improvement in that situation I will leave to others more competent to judge.  But I hope we are getting away from the old, bad conditions and I hope we will not get it by expressions of goodwill and by the feeling that this matter can be left entirely to the desire of the farmer to improve the conditions of his labourer.  There are bigger things than the farmer's goodwill and one is the economic condition under which the people work.  We suggest that the wage earner in agriculture should be given some protection. He has the least security of any section in the community.  If we can spur on the farmer to give his worker better conditions and better wages, that will be all to the good.

      <P>Before the debate was adjourned at 6 o'clock I was saying that the particular provision which has been discussed here at some length was one which caused me some apprehension until I had made inquiries regarding it and until I had heard the Minister speak here this afternoon.  I would like to say that I have satisfied myself in one particular instance&mdash;I am sure there are many others which the Minister can disclose to the House&mdash; where seven holdings were involved in a rearrangement scheme, that the original scheme was lodged for sanction in the month of June, 1939, and that the scheme eventually went into operation last month.  There is a case where a period of eleven years elapsed and in which only seven holdings were involved.  I am certain that it is typical of quite a number of similar cases which have occurred in the Western Province.  In that particular case, seven tenants were asked to agree to a scheme whereby their holdings might be rearranged and their conditions bettered.  One tenant might say that he objected to a right of way <Col N="1203" /> over his land; somebody else might say that he would agree to the scheme if he were given a new hay barn or something else.</P>
      <P>In cases of that sort difficulties are bound to arise.  Everybody who has any knowledge of rural Ireland must appreciate that.  The only way in which such difficulties can be settled is by getting the seven tenants into a room, sitting down with them and discussing with them their individual fears, dislikes and difficulties.  Having done so at length, one could say to them: &ldquo;You are agreed now and we will approve of the scheme here and now.&rdquo;  Until you are in a position to do that, it seems to me perfectly clear that you will never solve this particular problem which we are discussing.</P>
      <P>Under the present procedure the inspector has no powers except to talk to the tenants.  He must meet them and may say to them: &ldquo;Have you got a scheme in your mind and do you agree on such and such a scheme?&rdquo; Perhaps, the tenants may say: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; If they do, he puts that in the form of a proposal to the Land Commission.  It goes before the commissioners.  They will consider it when they have time, and eventually a particular decision is reached.  The inspector's scheme will go back to him perhaps two, three or four months later.  By that time a number of the tenants, perhaps, have blown hot and cold, so that the scheme, which is eventually agreed to by the commissioners, does not any longer represent the tenants' views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest, in all seriousness, that a situation of that kind would certainly justify far more powers than are contained in this section.  I think that the Minister would be justified in circumstances of that kind, and with the history that there is behind all this, in asking the Dáil for far greater powers than are contained in the Bill.  In my opinion, these powers should be given without any question by this House.  I say that in view of the fact that we are dealing here with the type of holder whose position is perhaps far worse than that of the farm labourer earning £3 5s. a week&mdash;with a man living on a few square yards of land scattered all <Col N="1204" /> over the place which has been handed down to him as a legacy through many generations as the direct result of what Cromwell did in this country, we are attempting to-day to solve a problem which goes back 300 or 400 years.</P>
    <P>I do not know, as I said earlier, whether Deputy Vivion de Valera's intervention in the debate was perhaps a preprandial prank or whether he had some humorous notion at the back of his mind.  I do not know whether he is usually given to playing practical jokes in this House.  I would not like to accuse him of that.  Therefore I must approach his remarks as if they were intended seriously.  In doing that we find that Deputy Vivion de Valera has seen in this simple measure some extraordinary new departure that is going to cause a new threat to the individual liberties of the citizens of this country. He read the section on his feet.  I would not like to say he had read it before, but he found that, under this section, the Minister was given all the powers of the Land Commission except the particular reserved powers set out in the section.  He went on to say that that was something extremely dangerous, and that the entire residual powers of the Land Commission were being transferred to the Minister&mdash;and that some fell political motive was behind that, that it was going to be used presumably against his Party, and certainly against the individual liberties of the people of this country.</P>
    <P>I doubt if Deputy Vivion de Valera appreciates that this Land Bill is only one other chapter in the very long story of land purchase in Ireland.  We have had countless Land Acts over many years.  Each separate Act has merely added another page to the chequered history of land division in this country.  If Deputy Vivion de Valera had taken the trouble to consider the matter he would know that the first contribution by his Party to the land purchase code in this country was the Land Act of 1933.</P>

      <P>Under Section 6 of the 1933 Land Act seven particular powers are given as reserved powers to the Land Commission and only seven. <Col N="1205" /> They have seven particular functions which they can carry out without any interference from the Minister for Lands.  Not a single other function or duty can they discharge exclusively on their own authority.  Sub-section (2) of Section 6 of the Land Act of 1933 which was introduced by the Party opposite provides clearly that on and after the appointed day the Land Commission, in the exercise and performance of the powers and duties vested in them by law, except the reserved powers, shall carry these out in accordance with the regulations and instructions of the Minister for Lands.  Now, that was and is the position to-day.  The Land Commission have merely seven exclusive functions which they can perform. Everything else they do they must do in accordance with the policy and the instructions of the Minister.</P>
      <P>What does this section propose?  This section that Deputy Major de Valera says is some new departure containing terrible consequences for the people proposes to increase from seven to 14 the number of reserved functions to be exercised by the Land Commission. It proposes to give to them all the powers and functions which they now have and adds on to them seven additional powers.  If the section is passed into law, the Land Commission, with regard to 14 particular matters set out, matters of considerable importance such as powers to deal with turbary and bogs, are entitled to say to the Minister, &ldquo;You have no functions here; we shall not listen to you.&rdquo;  For that reason, it puzzles me whether Deputy Major de Valera intended to be serious.  If he did, it certainly shows that he had not considered the land purchase code even with regard to the enactment of this Bill and the Land Act of 1933.  The position is that this section considerably increases the powers of the Land Commission and makes far more clear their present independent position, because these are exclusive functions which they can and will exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main criticism of the section has been confined to the provision which gives to the Minister the power of selecting the allottees under a rearrangement scheme.  I deprecate very much <Col N="1206" /> the practice of discussing measures here as if it were a lawyer's day out. I do not think it is helpful.  With regard to the particular power now given to the Minister which has been attacked, may I say that there are people who hold from a legal point of view that that power is already in the Minister, that under the Land Act of 1933 he is entitled to exercise that power because, under that Act, with regard to the determination of allottees, the only reserved power given to the Land Commission is the determination of the persons to be selected as allottees of untenanted land?  With regard to the particular problem we are dealing with here, it could be argued, and indeed has been suggested, that every tenant being dealt with here is already a tenant on a tenanted holding and that the Minister, even with regard to his present powers, is fully entitled to select particular allottees.  I never like having legal quibbles drawn into debates, but by reason of the fact that some Deputies have been tilting at windmills and seeing in this section something which is not in it, it is right to point out that it is possible that that power is already there.  It may not be there as clearly as perhaps we should like to see it, but certainly a strong argument can be made that it already exists.</P>
    <P>Even if the power is not there already and it is necessary to introduce it now, even if it were a completely new departure and something novel, I think anybody supporting the section is entitled to say that the power which the Minister will now have is limited to a particular small number of cases and to a particular problem.  It is limited to holdings held in rundale or intermixed plots, a particular local problem in different parts of the country.  It applies to nothing but to that particular problem and is limited in its application to that problem.  It merely empowers the Minister with regard to that particular problem to exercise a power of approval, not of selecting, a power to sanction the tenants' own choice of the way in which they want their holdings reorganised.</P>
    <P>First of all, this is a limited power; secondly, and this is something that <Col N="1207" /> can easily be concealed under the mass of verbiage which we had to-night, from a practical point of view that power can only be exercised with the full approval and consent of the tenants.  If even one tenant says: &ldquo;I do not agree&rdquo;, the particular scheme cannot be carried out.  To carry out this, the Minister must have the consent, not of the majority, but of every single person involved in the reorganisation.</P>
    <P>That being so, what is the sense of hearing, as we have heard from Deputy Moran, the suggestion that this was some new Clann na Talmhan plot to have the entire western province divided out according to the dictates of political Parties?  If this is a serious deliberative Assembly, let us keep it along those lines without introducing red herrings.  The power can only be exercised with regard to limited cases and with the consent of the people affected.  That is the second point which should be urged by anyone supporting the section.  Thirdly, if there were a danger, and it does not exist, of ill consequences flowing from the exercise of this power, there is the undoubted advantage that the Bill gives the Minister power to cut the Gordian knot in order to bring in a reorganisation scheme on the spot and give us, what Deputy Bartley is crying out for in the West of Ireland, speed in the solution of these particular problems.</P>

      <P>It is nearly 30 years now since the people of Mayo, which is the county primarily affected by this rundale problem, were assured that there was every prospect under the Land Act of 1923 that this age-old land problem in that county would be solved.  With all the energy and enthusiasm of a new Government, the first Irish Government for centuries, a staff was sent down to Mayo composed of the best men the Land Commission could obtain.  They fully realised in Dublin that the real problem existed in that county and that the real test as to whether the problem of congestion could be tackled and dealt with arose there.  In spite of many years of intense effort and very large expenditure, and in spite <Col N="1208" /> also of the exercise&mdash;I presume the liberal exercise&mdash;of the powers for compulsory acquisition of land and increasing powers for the State to enable them to make provision for congests the problem, of course, was very far from solution.  The present Minister has also assured the people of Mayo that this problem of congestion is not very far from solution.</P>

      <P>In his later and more saner moments when he has come close to the problem and has had an opportunity, like his predecessors, of discussing it in full with his advisers he has rather modified his view and he has given now a figure of 12 years.  I presume that that figure of 12 years is the minimum.  The fact is that the pool of land which is available for the relief of congestion by exercising the powers the Land Commission has, even in the most stringent manner, become considerably depleted.  If we were to take up the attitude that we should concentrate on dividing the whole of the land in whatever part of the country it might be acquired for the purpose of relieving congestion in Mayo and west of the Shannon we have not nearly enough land to provide more than a percentage&mdash;I think I might even say a fraction&mdash;of the congests of Mayo with reasonable economic holdings.  I think the Minister has admitted that there are from 20,000 to 30,000 congests to be dealt with and Deputies can calculate for themselves what amount of land would be required to bring these up even to the comparatively low valuation of £20, or thereabouts, which the Land Commission has fixed as a level for economic holdings and which many experienced Deputies, particularly those who had to make their living on the land, consider to be altogether below the level of what an economic holding should be.  In this measure the two contributions that the Minister, with all his boastful statements, all his speeches, all his eloquence and all his oratory in Mayo and elsewhere, has made to this great problem of congestion and of providing these 20,000 or 30,000 people with economic holdings <Col N="1209" /> are, firstly, to fix the price for land which is being acquired at the market value.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the first solution. It is a doctrine of despair and defeatism to turn one's back upon the powers of compulsion which are necessary if the State intends to face up to this job that has to be done in so far as this problem can be solved.  It cannot be completely solved, but it can be considerably ameliorated.  Instead of strengthening his powers the Minister has consigned to himself the rôle of going out into the market trying to get farms of land that will be suitable for potential migrants from these areas; and the State to that extent has shown that under its present administration we are turning our backs on the policy of getting the land by hook or by crook, however we are going to get it, or whatever legislative powers may be necessary to acquire it, to enable us to help to solve congestion.  We are turning towards the easy road of pretending that by paying the market price or giving market value and by going into the open market we will get land. Land was not available at the price current before the war, but we are told now, when everybody wants land in order to get into real estate and when the state of the world means that for many years to come land prices must remain at a highly inflated level, we are going out upon that policy.</P>
      <P>Side by side with that, the second string to the Minister's bow is this wonderful idea of speeding-up, according to him, the solution of the problem of rundale.  One would imagine that no one ever thought of dealing with this problem until the Minister came along.</P>

      <P>Did the Congested Districts Board, in their long years of service to the people of Mayo and other counties, never stripe land?  Why, when we were children, we saw the surveyors of the Congested Districts Board all over Mayo striping land.  It went on under the Cumann na nGaedheal Administration.  It went <Col N="1210" /> on under the Fianna Fáil Administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>With this difference, that under the Cumann na nGaedheal Administration the Congested Districts Board as a separate authority was abolished and its functions were transferred to the Irish Land Commission. The Irish Land Commission was an institution set up for carrying out the necessary processes of transferring the land of this country through the machinery of the various Land Purchase Acts to the Irish tenant farmer. That was its job&mdash;it was largely a legal one&mdash;and the collection of the annuities.  The work of the Congested Districts Board was transferred to the Irish Land Commission.  If the problem had been left to the experienced officers and to the old board representative to some extent of the people of the West of Ireland, no doubt that problem would have received more attention. But, on the other hand, it would have suffered from the serious disadvantage, which the Congested Districts Board emphasised on more than one occasion, that while they had ample powers successively granted to them by the British Government and a certain amount of money available, fairly considerable in the times that were, for the carrying out of work in the congested districts they had no power whatever to acquire land outside the congested districts; and it was quite impossible for them to make a substantial inroad upon the problem of congestion so long as the only lands that they could get into the pool for the relief of congestion were in the congested areas themselves.  Therefore, the Congested Districts Board itself had it remained, while it could concentrate attention upon the problem, would have had the serious restriction upon its activities that it would be confined to the congested districts counties. The Land Commission was dealing not with the congested districts only but with the country as a whole. It was not alone in the West of Ireland that you had land agitation.  You had it, as was stated by a distinguished Irish judge, carried on at the <Col N="1211" /> height of the Sinn Féin movement to such an extent that it threatened to engulf the whole national and idealistic side of that movement in agrarian agitation.  Were it not that steps were taken to set up land courts and some kind of machinery to deal with the problem, it would have created a very serious obstacle in the pathway of national progress at the time.</P>
      <P>The Irish Government had therefore to take over the problem of providing for uneconomic holders in the rest of the country as well as for dealing with congestion in the West.  The Land Act of 1923 was designed just as much to increase the holdings of uneconomic holders elsewhere and bring them up to a proper level as to tackle the problem of congestion in the West.  But during that period, although the staff of the Congested Districts Board&mdash;those who were particularly experienced and who had a particular knowledge of the problem of rundale and the conditions in Mayo and in other such counties generally&mdash;gradually began to disappear this problem was not neglected.  Large areas of land were acquired.  Migration on a large scale was carried out and if there was criticism of the large sums of money that had to be expended in order to enable these migrants from Mayo, Connemara, Donegal, Kerry and wherever they came from to come up and find a living in another part of the country, it was not from the Fianna Fáil Deputies the criticism came.</P>

      <P>We have heard a suggestion from the Minister that nothing was done by his predecessor in office.  I want to say that far more was done than the Minister will ever do and that at the end of all the Minister's posturings this problem of congestion in Mayo will not be solved and that it is only deceiving the people of Mayo to pretend that under this ridiculous clause <Col N="1212" /> about rearrangement you are going to effect a substantial change in the condition of the people.  How can you deal with rundale unless you have additional land to provide for the people?  Does this Bill itself not admit that additional land is necessary?  Do we not know that the problem of the seven tenants of whom Deputy O'Higgins spoke&mdash; whose cases, he said, were held up from 1939 to 1950 because it was impossible to get their consent, presumably, to a rearrangement of their holdings&mdash;could probably have been settled had there been sufficient land available to give them the necessary additions that would persuade them to say to the inspector that they were satisfied with the rearrangement scheme and that they were going to have it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister suggests to us that in order to get the consent of these seven persons, to get them to sign their names to a document in Castlebar or wherever it may be, it is necessary for him to interfere with the judicial functions of the Land Commission and to take away from them powers that they had under all previous legislation up to this time.  If the Minister can find no other way of dealing with this problem, if there is a problem there, of getting a decision on these matters more speedily I think he could not have sought a more awkward or more ridiculous way in which to secure a solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not seek any one at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>We sought a solution when we made it quite clear in the 1933 Act that so far as the judicial or quasijudicial functions of the commissioners were concerned&mdash;and particularly any dealings with the allotment of land, the selection of allottees, the fixing of the price of land&mdash;the Minister would have nothing to do with the matter and even though in the 1933 Act these clauses reserving these particular functions to the commissioners were included for <Col N="1213" /> the first time in legislative form, they were attacked and it was said that the Minister must have had something up his sleeve.  What did the Minister gain by putting down these things in black and white?  We are not taking up the attitude that the Minister should not have complete authority.  He has it under the existing land code, over the officers and servants of the Land Commission, but we have to take cognisance of the fact that these commissioners collectively are a judicial body. The Opposition would be failing in their duty if they allowed the Minister to infringe upon the prerogatives of that body.  Apart from that, when the Minister as senior Deputy for one of the most congested constituencies in this State comes along and coolly tells the Dáil that not alone is he going to trespass upon their prerogative and that in one particular matter&mdash;the determination of who shall be allottees and the price at which land is going to be sold to such allottees&mdash;he is going to take it away from the sphere of action of the commissioners and transfer it into his own hands, it is surely an entirely new precedent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder what our Taoiseach and the other legal members of the Government would think or what they would say if they were sitting where we are sitting this evening and were discussing a proposal of a Fianna Fáil Minister to take away some of the functions in connection with the selection of allottees and the fixation of the price of land in respect of such allottees from the commissioners and to hand over the determination of these questions to the Minister?  The Order Paper to-day has shown and the frequent references in the past to the influence of Fianna Fáil clubs show that whether Deputies believe it or not they were prepared in this House and outside and throughout the country to suggest that the Minister for Lands had power to give land to those whom he considered suitable from a political point of view.  There was no foundation whatever for those allegations. Possibly some of those who made these statements did not realise that.  But those are the gentlemen who come along now and ask us to swallow this beautiful little provision that, instead of the functions which hitherto <Col N="1214" /> were exercised by the Land Commission in respect of the allotment and the price of land&mdash;wherever the allotment was to be; whether in connection with a rundale rearrangement or otherwise&mdash;a definite hole should be made in the barrier which prevents the Minister from interfering in these particular functions of the commissioners and they should be transferred to his own shoulders.  What is very noticeable in the speeches of Deputy O'Higgins and even in the contributions of the Minister himself is that no case whatever has been made to show how this can speed up the question of the settlement of rundale plots.</P>
    <P>We know that additional land will be required and there can be only a very limited number of cases where the Minister, no matter what the machinery at his disposal, can go down and have a reasonable chance of securing agreement. I maintain that in the vast majority of cases additional land will have to be provided, either in the place where the rundale exists so that additions will be given to some of the tenants, or that some of them will have to be transferred elsewhere out of the area altogether and the holdings they leave behind them divided amongst their neighbours.  One thing or other will have to be done.  Is it the position that the question of the provision of additional land does not arise?</P>
    <P>We are asked here to recognise that it does because we are told: &ldquo;the expression &lsquo;rearrangement scheme&rsquo; means a scheme which is framed or approved by an officer by virtue of sub-section (2) of this section for the rearrangement of lands held in rundale or intermixed plots whether with or without the distribution of other lands to facilitate the said rearrangement.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a clear admission that you cannot have, in a great many cases, any prospect of getting the consent of the tenants to a rearrangement plan unless you give them additional land. You are therefore going to acquire land; you are going to fix a price upon it; you are going to decide who is going to get the land and how it is going to be divided amongst different <Col N="1215" /> tenants whose lands you want rearranged. Surely, as Deputy Vivion de Valera pointed out, it is quite clear from the way in which clauses (d) and (e) are worded that the determination of these matters in connection with rearrangement schemes has been determined by the legal advisers of the Government to be included in the terms of the 1933 Act dealing with allotment and prices in the corresponding section&mdash;I think Section 6 of the Act&mdash;and therefore it has been necessary to exclude them in the rather peculiar fashion in which they are excluded here, a matter which we shall discuss later on in another connection.</P>
    <P>Instead of taking the responsibility boldly upon himself and telling the House what he proposes to do the Minister seeks, as has been pointed out by Deputy de Valera, by a process of elimination to get back to himself powers that he had handed over to the Land Commission under the existing code.  My complaint against the Minister is that he has made no effort to show why this abstraction of some of their functions from the Land Commission is necessary.  No effort whatever has been made to show why, in order to secure the speeding up and rearrangement that is necessary, the Minister in this extraordinary way should take this power, hitherto regarded as a judicial power, from the Land Commission into his own hands.</P>
    <P>Is it suggested that the Land Commissioners do not know their job?  In spite of the fact that we must admit that their attention has been directed mainly to land acquisition in other parts of the country, trying to build up a pool of land for migrants and the many other problems with which the Land Commission deals, is it suggested that the commissioners are not capable of dealing with this problem of rundale?  If the commissioners have the capacity to instruct their officers to deal with problems of land acquisition, the inspection of land and the fixing of prices, arrangements for improvements and the building of houses in the rest of the country, is it suggested that the commissioners are not capable of dealing with this problem in County <Col N="1216" /> Mayo?  If it is the Minister's contention that the staff must be strengthened in County Mayo and must be concentrated on this particular problem, that a special senior inspector must be entrusted with this work, is there any reason why the senior inspector should not carry out this work in Mayo in connection with the rearrangement of rundale holdings, as he may be doing in other parts of the country at present in connection with other branches of the work?</P>
    <P>I think I have said enough to establish that no case has been made by the Minister to show that any speeding up is likely to take place.  Even if he can prove that to the satisfaction of the House, I suggest that the Dáil ought to make quite sure that there is a case and that the only possible solution for bringing about the speeding up of the rearrangement problem is by the steps the Minister suggests, and that they can only be effected by interfering with the functions of the Land Commission in this very arbitrary and unprecedented way, taking away from them completely the power and the essential basis of dealing with the problem of congestion in Mayo and other such counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I did not understand this section but the discussion has brought home to me the problem as it affects my county.  Since 1933, when I became a Deputy, I have written in every year recommending people for one farm in my constituency. I know that it is a Land Commission farm.  I know that the Land Commission inspectors went down several times and drafted a scheme to give that house and farm to a certain person.  Under that scheme they went to certain smallholders and they rearranged their holdings.  In one case a farmer living beside one of the smallholders agreed to give the smallholder a bit of his farm in order to make the holding economic.  I have here the records of the Land Commission. There were five or six schemes prepared but that farm is there yet and nobody went into it.  It is set every year.  It is only now that I see what is the cause of that.  On several occasions <Col N="1217" /> I made representations to the Land Commission in regard to the rearrangement of five or six holdings in certain districts in my constituency.  I know that schemes were made out but I understand from the Land Commission that it takes a year or two to fix up all this.  Then when the schemes go back there may be some falling out between the neighbours.  When the inspector went back and everything appeared to be ready, the men who were getting land changed their minds. It is time to bring about an improvement in that connection.</P>
      <P>The Minister is taking power in this Bill to send down an inspector.  When he gets the people together you can imagine what good a scheme like that will do in a congested district like Mayo.  In one case in my county there is a Land Commission house with 30 acres attached and there was nobody in it since I became a Deputy, or some time afterwards.  If you ask the Land Commission inspectors you will find that there were four, five or six schemes of rearrangement laid out and then the people changed their minds and would not come in.</P>

      <P>If the Minister takes power to send down an inspector he may be able to get men of commonsense to sit down and be willing to sign. In that way you will do away with a lot of trouble and you will solve a big problem.  I cannot understand the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition when he says that you will be giving people a present of a farm.  In no case that I know of was there a present of a farm.  This is only a scheme of rearrangement.  I am sick listening to lawyers inside this House.  If the Opposition had any sense at all they would let this section go through because it will do a lot to relieve congestion. Everyone knows that time does a lot of things and changes a lot of minds and when you have an inspector doing things in a commonsense way there is every possibility of a satisfactory <Col N="1218" /> solution of the problem because schemes can be sealed there and then.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Derrig during the time he was Minister for Lands approached the land problem with half the determination he displayed here this evening, and if he used that loud shout of his to more advantage in the Land Commission and awakened some of the officials out of their slumbers there, he would have done a lot more good for the country than he is pretending to do here to-night.  Anybody who is a stranger to the House and who is not familiar with the antics of the same Deputy would think that he was quite sincere and genuine, but I happen to know perfectly well, because unfortunately, I was at one time a loyal supporter of that Party, the way the matter of land division was carried out by the Fianna Fáil Party; I know what Deputy Derrig and other Minister of the Fianna Fáil Party allowed to be carried on without as much as batting an eyelid or taking notice; I know the way things were done, particularly in the Department of Lands.</P>
      <P>Irrespective of what Deputy Derrig or any of the other ex-Ministers of the Fianna Fáil Government have said, the one thing that concerns this House is the speeding up of land resettlement. If land resettlement were tackled properly in the past, if the Congested District Board's powers were extended in its time so that they could take over land in the congested areas, I believe this problem would have been solved long ago and there would be no need in this Parliament for a Department of Lands.  Even if there were such a Department its only duty would be to take charge of the collection of the annuities and look after forestry matters, because land resettlement would definitely be at an end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Something must be wrong when this terrible delay still exists.  The different types of legislation that have been brought in have, to my own knowledge, quite a lot to do with the slowing up to which we have been accustomed for such a long time.  We were told that the 1933 Act contained certain provisions and judicial powers were given to safeguard the people from whom land was <Col N="1219" /> to be taken and the people to whom it would be given and to safeguard also the Minister, and we were assured that there would be no political interference and no political pull used.  We were told one of the main reasons for that Act was the action of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government in giving land to people who were not deserving applicants.</P>
    <P>I have been, I am, and I will be, opposed to the giving of judicial status to any group of men outside those who administer the Department of Justice. While I welcome the power the Minister is taking under this altered section as compared with what was done under the 1933 Act, I believe it is not nearly severe enough, because the determination of everything that is carried on within the Land Commission should be vested entirely in the hands of the Minister for Lands, irrespective of what Party he belongs to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of the powers the Minister is taking over and I feel I should be able to raise this point.  We who live in congested areas know that when the resettlement of a district is set about the scheme is prepared by the local Land Commission inspector.  There is no better judge of the conditions in the locality than the inspector who lives there and who visits each holding and little parcel of land.  He is conversant with the different tenants and landowners.  He knows what should be done and how the land should be rearranged.  He has sufficient knowledge to have the final say in how that land should be resettled. We know perfectly well, and if the Minister will but admit it, he has had experience in the last month of a scheme that was almost broken up because of the delay in giving sanction to a scheme that was sent up to the Department for sanction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the natural instinct of everybody who is to be resettled to work the Oliver Twist trick of old and ask for more.  When a scheme is shown to the people, if they have time to think about it one neighbour may object because <Col N="1220" /> the field he is giving over may be of a better quality than the one he is getting in resettlement.  Again, a pathway or road may not satisfy the needs of another individual, and in many cases if time is given to the people to consider matters there are quite a number of them who would definitely not put their signatures to the scheme and in that way they would hold up something which has caused endless trouble and expense and wasted a lot of time in an effort to bring about a resettlement.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think this is the most useful amendment to the 1933 Act that could possibly be brought in and this determination is something which should definitely be approved and powers should be given to the divisional inspectors in accordance with the provisions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister may be accused of having the final say in this matter.  Of course, the civil servants of the Land Commission are directly responsible to the Minister, but the Minister in turn is directly responsible to the people who put him here and the Government are directly responsible to the people all over Ireland who put them into this Parliament to pass legislation to remedy whatever social evils exist.</P>
    <P>The Minister has decided that he is to have a certain say, that he is to have power to upset this old, creaky system.  I think what he is claiming is perfectly right and just.  I know from my own experience that he is doing something which will be appreciated by the congests in Mayo and along the western seaboard where so much congestion exists.</P>
    <P>The most amusing part of this debate was the contribution made by Deputy de Valera, senior, and by Deputy de Valera, junior.  Anybody who listened to Deputy de Valera, senior, speaking on this could not but come to the conclusion that he did not know what he was talking about.  He told us about some gifts which were going to be given to people for nothing, and of a rearrangement scheme as if it were one for people who had no land to offer in return.  His speech reminded me of a statement that he made many years <Col N="1221" /> ago when he suggested that every farmer, no matter what the size of his holding was, should build a house on it for his eldest son when he became of age so that he could get married.  That definitely shows how much he knows about this problem of land resettlement.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera, junior, took a different line, but I can forgive him for not being familiar with this problem of congestion.  I suppose the Minister and myself and many other members of this House can be forgiven if we are not very familiar with legislation or with the procedure of the courts.  I suggest that if lawyers enter into a debate like this and feel that they have not a perfect understanding of the subject, the best thing they could do would be to sit down and leave the discussion to be carried on by those lawyers who do know something about legislation and congestion.  We have talked so much on this subject of congestion and passed so much legislation dealing with it that, in my opinion, instead of making it easier to solve the problem, we are creating a sort of paradise for those who wish to punch pot-holes in the different Land Acts and thus delay a speedy ending of the whole business.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig told us that the land pool was running out.  We know that without getting any enlightenment on it from the Opposition.  We also know that there is quite a good land pool still left.  We know that there is an immense amount of land still being let on the eleven months' system for grazing. We know too that an immense amount of land has been purchased by people who should not be allowed to purchase land in this country.  We know that there is a large amount of land in the congested areas.  Congestion there is slowly but surely solving itself by reason of the fact that people have got tired of waiting for resettlement and have cleared out.  There is all that land, and there is no doubt but that if a genuine effort were made an immense amount of work could be done towards bringing about a solution of this question.  I am inclined to agree with those who say that it is doubtful if we will ever see the end <Col N="1222" /> of the congestion problem.  We can argue all day about bringing those congested holders up to a proper standard of living.  It is something that it will be very hard to do.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister is very just and fair in not accepting the amendments moved by Deputy Moylan or Deputy Cogan.  I had 20 questions on the Order Paper to-day addressed to the Minister for Lands.  My colleague, Deputy McQuillan, had something like the same number down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>I could have 20 different ones next week, all pointing to the need for resettlement.  The Minister was forced, not through any fault of his but through the fault of that something which is preventing this resettlement, to give the answers to these questions which were given here 20 and 25 years ago to Deputies of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  If something is not done to alter the legislation, the very same questions will be asked here in ten or 15 years' time and the answers will be the same as they have been in the past.  Therefore, why should we, who profess to know that that evil is there, object when something is going to be done to overcome the obstacle that is standing in the path of this resettlement?</P>
      <P>I think the Minister is doing a very sensible thing in giving to his senior officials the powers which he proposes to give them.  For my part, I have more confidence in those senior officials in the Department of Lands, and in the officials through the country who are administering the land code, than I have in the judicial members of the Land Commission.  I make no secret of that.  If the majority in this House were of the same mind as I am, we would very soon put the judicial gentlemen where they should have been put long ago&mdash;that is, out of existence as far as land legislation and the land code are concerned.</P>

      <P>I would ask Deputy Commons to read for me the words which give the Minister the power to formulate these rearrangement schemes. It is clear that he has taken power to name the allottees.  I would not object to that so much, although I think the principle is unsound, if I thought he was going to use it in connection with the powers which he has under sub-section (2)&mdash;that is the formulation of these rearrangement schemes in conjunction &ldquo;with or without&rdquo; other lands.  If I thought he was going to use these powers in relation to lands, no matter where they are situated in this country, I would go a long way with him, I believe Deputy Commons will in time find out that what I am saying is correct.  Does the Minister now state that he is giving himself powers to initiate rearrangement schemes?  I think he has sufficient powers and staff to go ahead and get some speed into this job without Section 10 at all.  That is all I want him to do.</P>

      <P>I accepted the implications <i>in toto</i> of the Emergency Powers Acts of 1939 which injured us very much in the West of Ireland in regard to this particular matter.  All I want the Minister to do is to allow the machine to operate, to allow the powers to operate as they are capable of operating and to ask the Land Commission to get down to the job.  I know they have been at it since the end of the war.  They have done some very good work in my constituency since then. There was a long period from the beginning of the war, but they have done very good work since.  I do not cavil in any way at the work the Land Commission does.  Anything I have seen done by them was quite good. There is no necessity to give the Minister any powers in relation to this because the Powers are quite ample.  I am satisfied that, because of what the Minister now proposes to do, there will be a slowing down in regard to this.</P>
      <P>I should like Deputy Commons to examine this question in the light of his experience.  The Minister referred to rearrangement schemes which do not require migration.  He made that remark in reply to a question of mine earlier this evening.  Let us take a case in which there are ten tenants and the holding requires to be rearranged.  I give the Minister four of these tenants as being adherents of his Party, three to Fine Gael and three to Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Heretofore, it has been very difficult to get the adherence of the tenants because nobody knew what particular lot would come out of the hat.  Under the power the Minister is now taking, the four Clann na Talmhan adherents amongst the tenants will consent immediately.  Whatever about the three Fine Gael men, the three Fianna Fáil men are going to be more hesitant under this new arrangement than they were formerly.  The four Clann na Talmhan men will use their local Clann na Talmhan Deputy to see that they get the allotments which they have their eyes upon.  They will know how the townland will be divided.  Most of these people will divide it themselves. If they find that the Clann na <Col N="1225" /> Talmhan Deputy is not able to get them the allotments on which they have their eyes, the fat will be in the fire.  You will have problems like that cropping up and the consent will be very difficult to get because of the Minister interfering.  The Minister must know of cases in which that is likely to happen.  Can he not see that he is queering the pitch rather than helping?  Will he not leave the position as it was and let the Land Commission operate?  They are quite capable of operating and only require to have the skids put under them to get them moving.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bartley has got a poor opinion of the intelligence of the average farmer, whether he wants rearrangement or whether he does not want it.  Let me tell him that when I took over office every inspector was warned of what would happen if he allowed himself to be influenced in the slightest by any public man, namely, immediate dismissal.  If Deputy Bartley or any other Deputy tries to interfere with an inspector of the Land Commission in the discharge of his duty, particularly in the allocation of land, the only result of such interference will be that he will be the cause of that unfortunate man having to look for another job.  I was most interested in the contribution of Deputy Derrig.  Three things emerged from his very noisy speech.  He was very perturbed about the fact that we are to pay the market value for land. That is strange to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought we had settled that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Derrig made a reference to which I should like to reply.  I ask him to explain what he meant when he said that once the State admitted this new principle of the market value for land he could not see how we could ever go back on it. I do not think it is too much to ask the State to do what every honest man would like to do, and that is to give a fair price for what he is buying.  I hope that no Government will ever attempt to go back on that principle. If any Government wants me as a <Col N="1226" /> Minister to purchase land at less than its value and act as a kind of nationally-appointed rogue I will not do it. They will have to get some other man to do it.</P>
      <P>The second thing that perturbed Deputy Derrig was the section before the House.  Deputy Derrig was Minister for Lands for a period, Deputy Aiken was Acting-Minister for Lands for a period and Deputy Boland was also Minister for Lands.  As a matter of fact, Fianna Fáil could fill the whole Front Bench with ex-Ministers for Lands.  They did very little with regard to rearrangement of holdings when they were on the Front Bench.  I have no business explaining the details of what this departure from the old system means, because Deputy Derrig apparently does not understand it or would not even if I explained it to him.  I cannot help that.  The system as it obtained up to this did not work.  The system that I am trying to put into operation I believe will work. I am certain that it will work and that it will bring relief to people who for many years have been expecting Government after Government to do something for them which these Governments would not do.</P>
      <P>Deputy Derrig is more interested in what particular duties the commissioners will have than he is about relieving congestion.  I am much more interested in the work of the Land Commission than the particular work that any official is engaged in.  The old system did not work and Deputy Derrig knows it.  He wants to make out that there was a great amount of migration carried out.  What rearrangement was carried out in Galway, Donegal, Mayo, Clare or any of the scheduled congested counties during the Fianna Fáil term of office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact remains that there was nothing done although they had land on hands.  In the early years of their Administration they took up land and gave it to those who did not appreciate what they had got.  Ten years later, under the 1946 Act, they evicted these people out of the land because they had not worked it, and the Land Commission is still engaged in taking up these holdings from people who did not <Col N="1227" /> honour their agreement.  Fianna Fáil made a complete mess of the job.  The fact is that Fianna Fáil knows now how things should be done and they want to stop me from doing them.  They will not stop me.  Inside an hour Deputy Bartley said that this section, if left unamended, would be one of the greatest disasters if put on the Statute Book and now he says it is not so bad. Evidently, he got a schooling from somebody who told him that it was all right for Deputy Derrig who represents a constituency that has not much congestion, luckily enough for themselves. He was evidently told that it does not matter much and the Leader of the Opposition was told the same thing.  Deputy Major de Valera made an eloquent legal speech and succeeded in talking for 25 minutes without saying anything.  Deputy Bartley has apparently realised his position.  Deputy Fagan astounded me when he said he was familiar with and had a case in point in Westmeath under this particular section.  If the position is as was stated in Westmeath, then it is time to open our eyes and do something about this problem of rearrangement.</P>
    <P>The basis of this section is to try to do away with congestion and the overcrowding, which, as Deputy O'Higgins has pointed out, resulted from Cromwell's work 300 or 400 years ago, the results of which still leave their mark upon us.  The Land Commission has been blamed for not doing this, that and the other.  Because of the statutes passed in this House, within the framework of which the Land Commission has to operate, that body was in the position of being asked to run a race and win with their feet securely tied. Fianna Fáil now wants to put a couple of more ropes on them.  I will not have that.  I want to get work done.  There is nothing sinister in this measure.  I made an offer to Deputy Moylan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I made an offer to Deputy Moylan before the Adjournment that I would accept any amendment he might put forward which <Col N="1228" /> would set his fears at rest.  All he has done is to give a few snorts and take complete fright at the entire section. He wants to destroy the section altogether. I maintain the section is all right as it is.  If the Deputy can prove to me that he can make it more watertight along the lines I indicated to him I will accept on the Report Stage any amendment he puts down.  But I shall not accept a complete disruption of the Bill.  It would be just as effective to abolish the Land Commission altogether as to establish a situation where one would have a Department of lands supposed to carry out certain work but prevented by legislation from the actual carrying out of such work.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Lands has accused Deputy Derrig of being a Judas.  His colleague, Deputy Commons, said he was neither sincere nor genuine.  Since the beginning of the discussion on this Bill the Minister has spent a good deal of the very short time in which he intervened in denouncing, abusing and insulting the people on this side of the House.  I wish the Minister for Lands and Deputy Commons would fight their cold war in Mayo and not take up the time of this House.</P>

The whole basis of the section according to him is to do away with congestion and the Minister has had the impudence to say that nothing was done by Fianna Fáil to relieve congestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Altogether 647,106 acres of land were divided to relieve congestion. Yet, Deputies say that Fianna Fáil did nothing.  What did the present Minister for Lands do in his first year in office?  He succeeded in <Col N="1230" /> reducing the work of the Land Commission. The division of land for the relief of congestion during his period so far has been the lowest on record since 1923.  He divided in 1948 12,280 acres.</P>
      <P>Again, I say that was the lowest on record.  He comes along here then and he wants power to speed up the work. It would be very easy for him to speed it up if he made an effort to get even half the work out of the Land Commission that Deputy Moylan and the other Ministers in charge got out of it when they were in office.  He could even improve by doing as much as was done with half the staff during the war years. Why did not the Minister for Lands, when he got back his staff in 1948, do something like the same division as was done by Fianna Fáil when most of the Land Commission staff were on loan?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true but unfortunately all the issues to which the Deputy is referring were raised.  However, the Deputy might come to the question of rearrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that the basis of this is to relieve congestion. If he is anxious to relieve congestion why did he not do so with twice the staff that some of the previous Ministers had.  However, the Minister claims that he must have these powers.  He claims that he must take back from the Land Commissioners the power to allot land and determine the price of land in certain cases.  Deputy Commons said he did not believe very much in the judicial functions of the Land Commission or in laymen exercising judicial functions.  Here, it is proposed to give judicial functions into the hands of a man, not with a judicial tenure such as the Land Commissioners have but a Deputy who is now a Minister subject to the needling that we see here every day the Dáil sits between the two Deputies from County Mayo. How on earth could a man subject to that needling, in competition for votes with his colleague from Mayo, exercise <Col N="1231" /> a reasonable judicial opinion?  The 1933 Act took certain powers from the Land Commissioners that they had at that time.  Prior to 1933, the Land Commissioners were absolutely and completely independent as a commission from any Ministerial influence or control.  The 1933 Act gave the Minister power to control the activities of the Land Commission except in relation to excepted matters.  It is of the utmost importance that a judicial function should be exercised by men who are not subject to day-to-day political pressure.</P>
      <P>The Land Commissioners, in relation to the exercise of their functions in regard to excepted matters, were given judicial tenure.  They are not subject to day-to-day political pressure from colleagues in a Party or from their neighbours or from Opposition Deputies. Are we going to turn our backs on the principle that has been established, I take it, though I am not a legal man, right from the time of the Magna Carta that the people cannot be interfered with in their rights at the arbitrary will of the State or of whoever represents the State?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That is untrue.  Is it right for us to turn our backs upon that principle and to give into the hands of an individual who has no security of tenure and who naturally, as a politican, wants to satisfy people, the right to play around with people's property in order that he may gain popularity for himself?  Fianna Fáil was accused of doing that although the Minister now admits they had no power to do it. There was a campaign abroad in this country for years&mdash;yapping&mdash;about all the lands that were being given to the members and at the request of the <Col N="1232" /> members of the Fianna Fáil cumainn. Reams of the Dáil Reports were taken up with accusations of that sort of political corruption but, for the first time since 1923, a Minister is now going to put himself into the position of exercising exactly that type of corruption.</P>
      <P>I am not particularly interested in the fight between the Minister for Lands and his colleague Deputy Commons. However, we know that Deputy Commons regards this particular section as an opportunity of accusing the Minister all round the place that he could have given the land to So and so only he preferred to give it to particular pals of his own, and that the Minister for Lands regards this as his particular chance of getting back into the Dáil again, because he would say: &ldquo;Well, I shall be Minister for Lands after the election and I will be able to allot you the land&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>What I am concerned about is that we should not depart from well-recognised and generally accepted principles just because there is a cold war going on between the Minister for Lands and the Deputy.  It is of the utmost importance that judicial functions, if they are not carried out by judges, should at least be carried out by men who have judicial tenure.  Deputy O'Higgins said that all the Minister can do in this regard is to divide out the land&mdash;redivide the land in the rearrangement scheme.</P>

      <P>However, Deputy O'Higgins has made the claim that there was going to be no land given out under this rearrangement by the Minister except the land to be taken from the people who had agreed to the rearrangement.  In practice, a rearrangement scheme involves not only the redistribution of the land involved in the mixed plots or the rundale but it involves adding to that land <Col N="1234" /> in the neighbourhood or getting land in some other part of the country to which tenants can be transferred.</P>

      <P>Everyone who has any knowledge of the problem knows that to get a rearrangement of a rundale one has to take a certain number of congests and transfer them either to land in the immediate vicinity or elsewhere, Why should the Minister have the power to take and to rearrange allottees not only in the rundale but all over the country on the excuse that, in the words of the Bill as he proposed it in connection with the distribution of lands, &ldquo;to facilitate the said rearrangement&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>In line 24, at the end of the first sub-section, we are told what the expression &ldquo;rearrangement scheme&rdquo;, on which plea the Minister can take over the powers of the Land Commissioners and exercise them himself, means.  It means a scheme &ldquo;which is framed&rdquo;&mdash; that particular word is supposed to be taken out by the Minister and it is no harm&mdash;&ldquo;or approved by an officer by virtue of sub-section (2) of this section for the rearrangement of lands held in rundale or intermixed plots whether with or without the distribution of other lands to facilitate the said rearrangement.&rdquo; When the Minister, therefore, seeks to carry out a rearrangement scheme in Mayo he can nominate a certain officer to carry out the rearrangement scheme and that gives him power, not only to arrange particular plots but to rearrange and allot lands all over the country, even though they are taken under the new Section 23.  I do not believe that the Dáil should give the Minister this power.  I do not believe that it should give the Minister judicial functions to allot and fix prices, in his own arbitrary way, of land on the plea that it is for the rearrangement of congests in Mayo.</P>

      <P>The Minister's great plea is that if he gets these powers and is able to nominate an official to go down to the rundale areas, he can in some way speed up the rearrangements of these holdings and do a much better job than the Land Commission.  Why <Col N="1236" /> should an official work more quickly because he is nominated by the Minister directly than by the Land Commission? I should like to know can I get an answer to that question.  If Inspector Murphy is sent down as the Minister's nominee directly to do the job, how can he do the job any more quickly than if he was sent down by the Land Commission?  The Land Commissioners work at least five and a half days a week.  That is what they are paid for. They are always in their office I hope. At least they can do that work more quickly than an individual who is running around the country in the car that used to cause the Minister so much concern&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of being repetitious.  I am trying to get somewhere on this particular amendment and maybe I had better read it in order to see exactly what it is.  The amendment proposes to delete the words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(other than any determination arising in or being part of a rearrangement scheme).&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lawyers on the Government Benches have talked about the intentions of the Bill and the views of the Minister.  I am not concerned with the intentions of the Bill nor am I concerned with the views of the Minister. What I am concerned with are the <Col N="1240" /> words which the Minister proposes to include in Section 10 (1) (d).  Paragraph (d) was part of the Land Act of 1933 which specified the excepted matters.  The Land Act of 1933 set out that certain matters would be excepted matters for the purposes of the section, excepted from the Minister's authority, and this one was the determination of the persons to be selected as allottees of land.  The judicial authority was to select the allottees of land.</P>
    <P>Now, the Minister has in this the determination other than any determination arising in or being part of a rearrangement scheme.  Whatever the intention of the Minister and whatever the views expressed by the various lawyers on the Government Benches are, here in specific words is the proposal and if this becomes an Act and goes before the courts for interpretation any judge in the court will decide, not on what the views of the Minister as expressed here are, and not what the intentions of the Bill are, but what exactly are the words that are in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Does the Deputy state that he did not use these exact phrases to-day, verbatim?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me once again assail your ears that are so fortified against my story.  It is because I know I have failed to carry conviction of the absolute truth of what I am saying that I am forced to repeat it again and again to try to bring home to the Minister what the position is.  Deputy Collins or Deputy O'Higgins, one or other of the lawyers, has said that the Minister in his attack on Section 10, and Section 6 of the Land Act of 1933, instead of curbing in any way the authority of the commissioners, has in fact extended it.  That is a moot question.  There are certain extensions, of course.  One is paragraph (g), which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The determination whether or not a holding has been used by the tenant or proprietor thereof as an ordinary farm in accordance with proper methods of husbandry.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The natural reason for the inclusion of that power in the Bill is because of the <Col N="1241" /> 1946 Act.  It arises directly from the 1946 Act.</P>
    <P>Then paragraph (h) reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The determination of any standard purchase annuity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is right that that should be handed over to the judicial authority and, in fact, that is how the standard purchase annuity was arrived at, I am sure. Paragraph (j) says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The determination of the sporting rights, fishing rights, and fisheries to be vested in the Land Commission, the prices to be paid for them, the persons to whom the fishing rights and fisheries are to be resold and the prices to be charged for them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely, the Minister never decided that at any time.  Paragraph (k) says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The determination of the easements and rights to be conferred, defined, extended or extinguished and any questions of compensation relating thereto.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely, the Minister never made that determination on his own.  It has been rather loose, and it is right that it should now be included in the authority given to the commissioners.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The determination whether any particular holding of tenanted land or parcel of untenanted land shall vest in the Land Commission on the appointed day.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would suggest that there should be an addition to that.</P>

      <P>May I suggest that, in dealing with this particular section, the members on the Government Benches, in seeking to make a case against my <Col N="1242" /> amendment, have quoted the fact that, instead of my amendment being necessary, actually the Minister had gone far beyond anything that I had asked for and had included a good deal.  I am trying to point out that there is nothing in that.  Paragraph (m) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The determination of the highest offer to be made by the Land Commission in the case of a proposed purchase under Section 23 of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle has suggested that, in dealing with an amendment on this section, I could not mention Section 23 of the Act.  Yet, here it is full of life, almost as big as the Minister, in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder will it be moved from the section now because the Ceann Comhairle has ruled it out of order?  Is the Minister in including it not as much out of order as I happen to be?  These words that I object to cannot mean anything other than the giving of a power to the Minister which he should not have.  I am not suggesting that it is a denial of power to Deputy Blowick, as such, but to any Minister who may sit in the seat he is in now.  It is given to a man who has a mere temporary tenancy of a judicial office which should be in the hands of people appointed in a judicial capacity. I do not believe it is going to make any particular difference in regard to the speed with which we are going to try and solve congestion.</P>
      <P>I want to assure the Minister that we on this side of the House are most anxious to find any solution that there is for congestion, to give him any help possible and to give him any authority in the Bill which we should give him; but we also want the House to look realistically on the thing and not to deceive the unfortunate people who live in congested districts, because it is deceit to try and persuade them in any fashion that we can get a final and adequate solution for congestion.  We cannot.  Unfortunately, there is not enough land to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1243" /> Deputy Commons pointed out that he asked 20 questions to-day and could ask 20 more to-morrow, and that for the rest of the session he could put down 20 more.  I want to know from the `Minister if he believes that the passing of this Bill into an Act is going to relieve him of the position which Deputy Commons' questions really displayed as existing in Mayo or elsewhere. I do not believe for a moment that it is.  I do urge on the Minister not to take upon himself for his own sake&mdash;for the sake really of the working of the business of the Land Commission&mdash;not to take this authority on himself but to leave it where it was &mdash;with the judicial authority so appointed.  Instead of sacking, as he proposes to sack, a number of the commissioners, I would suggest that the cheapest way of securing the necessary speed would be by appointing further commissioners: to put two younger men in association with one of the older and more experienced members of the Land Commission so that they might make periodical visits, when necessary, to the congested districts, and make the decision on the spot that the Minister needs so swiftly in conjunction with the local senior official. I think that is a fair proposition, and that he really should adopt such a proposal.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I may be allowed to answer a few points.  Some play was made about the word &ldquo;gift.&rdquo;  It is true that there is an element of gift in the giving away of land by the Land Commission. I am not suggesting that congests who get land or get the rearrangement of a holding get something for nothing, but there is undoubtedly an element of gift in it, because the Land Commission purchases land at its market value or market price; it pays compensation for disturbance and for damage and, eventually, hands the land over to the allottee or to the congest at a much lesser rate than the Land Commission paid for it.</P>

I shall just say this to clean up a statement made by Deputy Commons.  I think he pointed out that the Leader of the Opposition was in favour of the building of a dower-house, a second house on the land.  I have great respect for the Leader of the Opposition, but I was and am completely opposed to that idea.  I was surprised to find that members of the Olan na Talmhan Party were wholly in favour of it.  I think it is a wrong idea.</P>

      <P>There are certain matters arising very definitely on this section to which I should like to draw attention.  My approach to this has been from the point of view that what is the law under the Bill will rule rather than any reassurance of the Minister.  We have to take that into account.  I have sympathy with some Deputies who said that we should not get tied up with legal points but, unfortunately, in the case of the land code you are dealing with a very technical code of law which will be interpreted by reference to section after section. Accordingly, it is incumbent on us to inquire closely as to what in fact, once the Bill becomes law, its legal effect will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my first objections to this section, I objected on the grounds that it apparently was working on the principle of giving power to the Minister and only giving specially excepted matters into the hands of the judicial <Col N="1245" /> body, or, as I prefer to call them, the independent body.  It is quite true to say that that principle to a certain extent ruled in Section 6 of the 1933 Act, but that in no way modifies the submission I made on the matter.  But my objection goes further.  I think it is bad, as I have said, to legislate to give powers by way of an exception to an exception.  It is not the direct way of doing a thing, and the indirect way of doing a thing by such methods invariably gives rise to results that are not anticipated.</P>

      <P>It was Deputy Thomas O'Higgins, Junior.  It is quite true that, in the general framework, there is a similarity between Section 6 of the 1933 Act and this section, but there is a vital difference.  The similarity is this&mdash;that both in the 1933 section and in the proposed section in the Bill the powers to be exercised by the Land Commission unfettered are by way of exception.  There is, however, this significant difference which we must appreciate before we can appreciate the clause in parenthesis. The significant difference is this&mdash;that under sub-section (2) of Section 6 of the 1933 Act the Minister was given a very wide and, I should go so far as to say, an unfettered power of direction over the activities of the Land Commission. In other words, he was in a position to direct the Land Commission as to the manner in which they did these things under the excepted matters under Section 6.  That is not quite the position under this section. <Col N="1246" /> The position is rather peculiar.  Incidentally, there is some substance, in my opinion, in what Deputy Sweetman said as to the interpretation of &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  It probably is &ldquo;may&rdquo;, and that there are concurrent powers in the Land Commission and the Minister. Under the 1933 Act, the Minister has directing power in other than excepted matters over what the Land Commission can do, but the Land Commission does it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Collins is right.  I am not in any way suggesting that the Minister is fettered, but the agency is the Land Commission.  The section in this Bill is radically different. I invite Deputies to take these two sections and put them side by side.  In the Section 6 to which I refer, there is a sub-section with regard to excepted matters and there is the same in this Bill.  The first sub-section in each case deals with excepted matters.</P>

      <P>This is involved. The first sub-section in the 1933 Act provides for excepted matters and so does the first sub-section in the Bill. But the second sub-section, which is the sub-section that gives the Minister power under the 1933 Act, corresponds to sub-section (3) of this Bill, and sub-section (2) of this Bill is a completely new departure.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that.  The Deputy has raised a very nice point in that.  The reason why I have to go into all this detail is because of the lack of parallelism between the sections.  There is much more difference between the section in the 1933 Act and this section going through now than was at first apparent.  Deputies should realise that.  This is the kind of argument to which this Bill may be subjected in the courts and we might as well know what kettle of fish we are boiling.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (2) of this is something new.  It is abrogating power to the Minister to be exercised by the Minister in his capacity <i>simpliciter</i> under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, or whatever vehicle it is that constitutes him Minister, as apart from the statutory powers appertaining to the Land Commission.  Sub-section (3) of the present Section 10 in the new Bill is substantially a reproduction of sub-section (2) of the 1933 Act, and is substantially a re-enactment of sub-section (2) of the original.  That being so, the court will always try to construe an Act of Parliament as meaning something. A section will not be construed as being redundant.  Therefore, it cannot be taken that this sub-section (2) is merely a repetition of what is already contained in sub-section (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A court will always lean towards interpreting something new.  In effect, <Col N="1248" /> what that means is that in all matters, other than excepted matters, the Minister will have power to deal with them in his ordinary capacity as a Minister. He will have an option by virtue of sub-section (3), which is substantially the same as sub-section (2) of the 1933 Act, of using the Land Commission machinery if he likes; otherwise, he will have an option of dealing with these matters, other than excepted matters, in his ordinary capacity as Minister without relation to the machinery of the Land Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a possibility. I am putting it for consideration. If the Deputy will answer my argument <i>seriatim,</i> I, for one, will be very glad to hear the answer to it.  I merely put this for consideration by the House.  Deputy Collins need not be so agressive.  It is perfectly legitimate and proper to examine the implications behind what we are doing.</P>

      <P>Any power for the time being vested by law in the Land Commission may be exercised or performed by the Minister or by his officer.  But the Minister has a concurrent power with his officer.  If one goes back to the qualification with regard to rearrangement schemes one sees that the scheme is &ldquo;a scheme which is framed or approved by an officer by virtue of sub-section (2)&rdquo;. Any powers resulting to the Minister by virtue of that will be powers which are possible under sub-section (a), thereby leaving the Minister at large.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately the Deputy thought the question would <Col N="1249" /> relate to these very important matters. I come now to deal with sub-section (d) where you find the words&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;other than any determination arising in or being part of a rearrangement scheme.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>With these vital parallels in mind the fact is that the Minister is at large unless the matter is an excepted matter.  The Minister is at large unless the matter in question can be brought within the excepted matters provided for in this Bill.  Now, what are the excepted matters?&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the determination (other than any determination arising in or being part of a rearrangement scheme) of the persons to be selected as allottees of any land.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the crux of this amendment here.  &ldquo;Any land&rdquo; are the words used.  Deputy O'Higgins made comparisons between sub-section (d) of the old section and the new section.  I do not want to enter into a discussion as to the technical meaning of the words &ldquo;tenanted land&rdquo; and &ldquo;untenanted land&rdquo;.  The fact of the matter is that these are not quite comparable even when one deletes the particular words. One has to take the words &ldquo;untenanted land&rdquo; under the Act of 1933 in apposition to the words &ldquo;any land&rdquo; in this present measure.  The effect of the Bill as it stands is that where there has to be &ldquo;any determination arising in or being part of a rearrangement scheme&rdquo; any such determination arising in or being part of a rearrangement scheme is an exception within the exception and the Minister can do what he likes about it.</P>
      <P>I come now to the end of the sub-section where it is expressly stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;rearrangement scheme&rsquo; means a scheme which is framed or approved by an officer by virtue of sub-section (2) of this section for the rearrangement of lands held in rundale or in intermixed plots whether with or without the distribution of other lands to facilitate the said rearrangement.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;whether with or without the distribution of other lands&rdquo; immediately brings other lands which are in <Col N="1250" /> any way related to the scheme into association with the scheme.  Being captured, as it were, by the exception to the exception that means that the Minister can, in effect, dispose of other lands arbitrarily under the powers of sub-section (2).  Let me put a concrete case.  Reference has been made to Section 23.  That is releyant to the section to the extent that the Land Commission might buy land which might be available for inclusion in a scheme which could really be a rearrangement scheme in relation to this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to follow out the effect of that.  The Minister will bear with me a while.  That means that the Minister or the Land Commission, by virtue of the power vested in the Land Commission under Section 23, might acquire land in Meath or Tipperary. The lands so acquired in Meath and Tipperary might be combined with a holding of the nature contemplated in sub-section (1) in a congested area.  Those lands might be embodied in a scheme.  Could not that be so in relation to a scheme?</P>

      <P>There may be a case for it.  I am dealing with the legal content of the section now.  I shall answer Deputy O'Higgins' question to this extent.  Sub-section (d) in the <Col N="1251" /> first section referred to &ldquo;untenanted land&rdquo;.  Now, the lands I refer to, for the purposes of illustration, in Meath and Tipperary would be in that category and would ordinarily come under the reserved functions attachable to the Land Commission as things stand at present.  The effect of this Bill would be to give the Minister much wider powers in connection with these lands than are there already.  It is very difficult to see where one can end in following out the formula of legislation.  I have great sympathy with the Minister in his desire to speed up this matter, but I think this is the wrong way to set about it.</P>

I would not dare to go into the merits of the dispute at all but I appeal to the men concerned&mdash; to the various parties concerned&mdash;to have regard to the fact that very shortly after the buses stopped a Labour Court, which was set up by this House, intervened.  I hold that the moment the Labour Court intervened the men's protest against whatever grievance they had was successful and that an immediate resumption of the public bus services in that area should have taken place.</P>
      <P>There is a hush-hush air&mdash;a &ldquo;do not say a word about it because of the danger of saying something that might help to prolong the dispute&rdquo;&mdash;in connection with all this matter.  I and my colleagues who represent Dublin City, and especially those of us who represent North Dublin, want to see the dispute brought to an end.  We want to bring relief to those people who are now foot-sore and weary from walking an average of five miles to their work in the mornings and five miles back again in the afternoons&mdash;let me be right about it, four miles and four and a half miles to the Dollymount area where new schemes have been built. These people now think that those who operate the bus services have no regard to the fact that they are the customers who keep the bus services going and who keep them in reasonably good employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The municipality will have to consider very seriously any extension of their housing schemes any distance away from people's work if this bus strike is an indication of what may take place in the future.  I hold that <Col N="1253" /> the bus stoppage was unjustified.  I express my opinion on that matter very definitely&mdash;that the bus stoppage was unjustified and that its continuance is unjustifiable.  It is not a question of conditions of labour, so far as wages are concerned.  I am of the opinion that if all Parties in this House join with the Government in an appeal to the men concerned to go back to their work and have regard to the people who provide the fares and who provide them with that work, the appeal would be listened to.  It is not fair or proper that the people of the City of Dublin should be a shuttle-cock between any two sections.</P>

      <P>I would prefer every Deputy to avoid going into the details. We merely want the buses restored. The protest has been effective.  The Labour Court is doing its very best to bring about a settlement and I hold that the people of North Dublin are entitled to demand that every section of this House shall join together in an appeal to have restored to them what we promised them in our various Acts of Parliament.  Very large numbers of children, now living in the Dollymount area, have to go to school in the early morning&mdash;children from Dollymount, Clontarf and Donnycarney&mdash;and these children go to the city schools they attended before the new houses were built in the outlying districts. There are thousands of girls working on the south side of the City of Dublin, all around George's Street and Camden Street, whose homes are in the Donnycarney, Clontarf and Dollymount areas.  It is not fair that they should be treated as they are being treated by the people concerned in the bus stoppage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, I am not raising this matter for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the merits of the dispute. I feel, however, that if the men were to go back to work to-morrow morning or had they gone back to work the morning after the Labour Court intervened, their case would still get the best possible attention because of the desire of all the people to bring <Col N="1254" /> an end to the present unfortunate trouble.  Some people have said: &ldquo;Oh, is it not a very dangerous thing for you to raise the matter or to interfere at all?&rdquo;  If somebody does not do it there is a danger that the matter will drift and drift, that the men of all sections will become irritated and that the strike or stoppage may spread not alone in respect of buses but in respect of other businesses as well.  That would be deplorable.</P>
    <P>It would be better to face the issue now, find out what it is all about and bring it to a head in order, if we possibly can, by an appeal to the people concerned, to bring an end to the dispute. I appeal to the Minister, and especially to the Government, in this connection.  I am satisfied that if an appeal is made, it would have the support of every member of every Party in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to say that I am rather surprised at the Minister's saying that he has no function in this matter.  It may be technically correct to say that he has no function in the matter, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, whereby he can intervene. Surely, however, as a member of the Government who must accept responsibility for the general welfare of the people&mdash;as a member of that Government and on behalf of it&mdash;surely he could intervene in an effort to bring about a settlement.  I submit that his intervention cannot in any instance be construed as an attempt to settle the strike on behalf of one side as against the other.</P>
      <P>I, like Deputy Byrne, represent the constituency which is solely affected by the dispute.  It is felt that in the interests of these people and because of the hardships which are being inflicted upon them&mdash;and they are the innocent subjects of this dispute&mdash;it is the duty of the Minister, acting on behalf of the Government, to intervene in some manner in an effort to bring about a friendly settlement of the dispute. The people of North Dublin are looking forward to Government intervention in this matter.  All I can say is that I hope they do not look for it in vain.</P>

      <P>I should like to join in the appeal made by Deputy Byrne and Deputy Traynor to the Minister to intervene in an effort to bring about a settlement of this dispute which is affecting about 65,000 people in Dublin North-East.  The constituency of Dublin North-East has on its northern fringe the corporation housing areas of Marino, Donnycarney and Killester, and the very large population resident there are deprived of their normal bus services.  From the Killester housing area particularly the children have to attend schools in the City of Dublin because sufficient school accommodation is not available in the area and the only method of transport they had was that provided by the ordinary bus services.  I would impress upon the Minister that the longer this stoppage lasts the greater are the chances of its spreading.  I shall not delay the time of the House in arguing about the merits of the strike.  It is not for me to do that, but it seems to be a bit ridiculous that when there are only two members of one union&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sorry if I have transgressed, but I should like to point out that if the unions were to abide by the decision of the Labour Court, agree to work the transport services and so enable the residents of the area to enjoy their normal services, the position could be examined and gone into by the respective unions.  We have got the decision at the moment that agreement cannot be reached, but I should like to impress upon the leaders of the unions concerned, the Minister and the officials of Córas Iompair Éireann, that they should do their utmost to bring this strike to a conclusion and so remove this very serious handicap on the residents of that area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to join with Deputy Byrne, Deputy Traynor and Deputy Belton, as a representative of Dublin North-East, in appealing to every person concerned in this stoppage to do his utmost to bring it to a conclusion as quickly as possible.  As <Col N="1256" /> Deputy Byrne has said, and Deputy Traynor and Deputy Belton have repeated, thousands of people whom we represent in that area are very seriously affected by this unfortunate stoppage.  We say to the Minister and to the Government that there is a very serious responsibility upon them.  No one appreciates the difficulties of the Minister and of the Government more than I in that matter, but I do say that it is their duty to do everything within their power to bring this stoppage to a conclusion as quickly as possible.  Like other Deputies, I am not going into the merits or the demerits of the dispute.  I understand there has been agreement between Deputy Byrne and the Ceann Comhairle that nothing would be raised here to-night that might be considered likely to throw oil on the flames of the dispute.  I think that that is perfectly correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Belton has said, there is a danger that this strike may spread. To-night I heard very serious reports from members of the National Union of Railwaymen that their small number of members, three in number, affected by the strike, have received from Córas Iompair Éireann notices of dismissal.  I would ask the Minister in replying to this debate to deal with that aspect because that may again mean that some more oil will be thrown on the flames of the dispute. Every one of us knows, and we are all delighted, that at the moment conversations are going on between the Irish Trades Union Congress and the Congress of Irish Unions, in a sincere endeavour to bring about an end of the differences between them.  Every member of this House and of the public will wish well to the people concerned in these negotiations.  I understand that the representatives of the unions involved are sincerely endeavouring to bring about an end to the differences between them.  Let us hope that, through the intervention of the Minister and of the Government and the good offices of the representatives of the unions concerned, this stoppage will be ended as quickly as possible and that the people whom Deputy Traynor, Deputy Byrne, Deputy Colley, <Col N="1257" /> Deputy Belton and myself represent will be relieved of the very onerous burden cast upon them by the stoppage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to that of the other representatives of North-East Dublin in appealing to the Government to take some action to try to bring this strike to an end. It is pitiable to see the crowds of people from that area trying to find their way into the city and out of the city under present conditions, or to see the great number of workers on building schemes further out, trying to get to their work in the early morning and trudging home after their hard day's work.  It is a serious situation and if no steps are taken now it will lead either to deadlock or, as has been stated, the strike will spread.  Whatever may be the technical difficulties in the way of a settlement, I think it is our duty here to try to find a solution.  We make that appeal to the Government and I hope there will be some response to it.  I am sure if they use their influence they will probably be able to find some way out and save further hardships to the people concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Morrissey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to assure the Deputies who have spoken and the House that the Government are fully conscious of the very grave hardships which have been inflicted on the travelling public in the North of Dublin City arising out of this strike, hardships that lean particularly heavily on the workers, on the poor, on the aged and on the children, as has been stressed by Deputies.  It is a strike that, like most strikes, is to be deplored.  I would like, if I may, to compliment the Deputies who have spoken on refraining from making any comment whatever on the merits or the causes of the strike.</P>
      <P>Deputies have asked me to intervene in this matter.  I can assure the House that if I were satisfied that intervention on my part would be helpful, would be the means of bringing to an end this strike, I would not on any technicality, refrain from intervening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facts are as they have been outlined by Deputies.  Deputy Cowan <Col N="1258" /> mentioned that, even at the moment, well-intentioned efforts are being made to settle this strike.  Conversations are proceeding and, in the light of that, and without any desire whatever to burke discussion or to shed responsibility, I think at the moment the least said about this matter, the better.</P>
    <P>I think that there is now, anyway, a desire on the part of the two unions to try to reach a settlement at the earliest possible moment.  The best service that we can give to the people who are the innocent sufferers in this matter is to bring about that settlement at the earliest possible moment, and to bring it about in the best atmosphere.</P>
    <P>I do not know that the House will expect me to say any more at the moment.  The House even may consider that I have said very little, but I would like to assure the Deputies who have raised this matter, and to assure the public outside, that the Government are fully conscious of the hardship which is caused.  They are also conscious of the fact that has been stressed here, that the longer this strike lasts the graver the danger there is of its spreading.</P>
    <P>I feel the good sense of the responsible parties on both sides in this dispute will prevail, and I am sincerely hopeful that we will have a settlement very early.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should not try to say any more at this moment, unless to emphasise that, so far as I am concerned, there would not be any reluctance on my part to face up to the responsibility of intervening if I thought intervention was going to be helpful.  It is the easiest thing in the world to intervene in matters, but it is not always easy to determine beforehand whether that intervention is going to be for good or evil.</P>
