      <P>There is an item of cost attaching to purchases of houses under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts to which I think the Minister ought to give some consideration with a view to approaching the Minister for Finance in order to find out if the can bring about some alleviation of a hardship that exists.  I refer to the stamp duty. That duty is a heavy item of cost on the smaller houses.  I wonder if some arrangement could be made whereby this duty could be either reduced or eliminated.  The Minister should keep in mind that the stamp duty up to the present is not included as part of the cost of the house for the purpose of the loan.  It has to be paid separately. I think the duty ought to be eliminated on the type of houses purchased under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act. I am sure the Minister knows and appreciates that it is a hardship.  Perhaps he will approach the Minister for Finance with a view to finding out whether it can be eliminated <Col N="1050" /> altogether.  It is an unreasonably heavy tax on the particular type of house.</P>
      <P>Yesterday Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Cowan referred to the unsatisfactory state of housing in a manner which would suggest that no Dublin Corporation existed and that, if it does exist, the corporation as such has done nothing in the matter of housing.  I think it will be agreed by every member of the corporation here, no matter on which side of the House he sits, that the corporation and their staff have given very grave and constant consideration to this problem.  They have put in an enormous amount of time on it.  They have co-operated as far as possible in Government policy in order to get the job done as quickly as possible.  Some people do not seem to appreciate the enormous difficulties that exist.  Yesterday Deputy Cowan talked about putting people on for 24 hours of the day putting down sewerage in the Howth area.  I do not think the Deputy appreciates the enormous engineering problem involved. A certain amount of the land there is below sea level and, in putting in sewerage, one has to consider the cost, the technical difficulties and the pumping arrangements.  The matter has been under consideration for a considerable time.  It will ultimately be solved.  It cannot be done in the way in which Deputy Cowan suggests &mdash;putting his army on it for 24 hours every day until the job is done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister appreciates that in the existing charge to the borrower of money from a local authority there is quite a considerable item of expense.  I would like to draw his attention to a situation which has cropped up in the Dublin Corporation and which is causing difficulty and a certain amount of uncertainty.  It is costing the borrower of the money something extra.  In our recent loan, because of some situation which existed, we had to borrow money on a 15-year redemption basis.  Portion of that money had been earmarked for houses purchased under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  Because of the redemption liability on the part of the corporation at the end of 15 years and because of the <Col N="1051" /> further uncertainty as to what the rate of interest may be at the end of the 15 years, we had to include an over-all extra amount of interest chargeable to the borrower of money.  Because we loaned him the money at 35 years, the rate of interest had to be increased. I wonder if the Minister and the Government could give a special assurance to the Dublin Corporation that, no matter what the situation is at the end of the 15 years, money will be available to repay that loan in order to eliminate the necessity of imposing on the borrower an extra rate of interest charged because of some uncertain situation at the moment.  It amounts to a good deal.  The corporation got the money at 2½ per cent.  It is now paying ¾ per cent. higher, and it has now to charge the borrower 4½ per cent. That adds considerably to the borrower's annual payments and, when computed over the 35-year period, it amounts to a considerable sum.  We must not forget that costs have risen in every respect.  A house which normally could be bought ten years ago for £1,400 is now costing £2,000.  As I have said, there has been an increase in the rate of interest charged, there has been an increase in the cost of materials and a very heavy increase in building costs, due to increases in wages, so that in the output per £ spent, the cost to the purchase of a small house has risen very considerably. On top of all that, you have, as I have pointed out, the stamp duty. I would appeal to the Minister to consider all these things.</P>
    <P>There is one suggestion which I want to make to the Minister in all seriousness, and I hope he will have it considered. In view of the fact that there is almost standardisation in this type of house, would it not be possible to arrange something on the lines of bulk purchase of materials for the construction of the houses?  That system is in operation in the case of local authorities. We have the combined purchasing authority under the Minister's Department which is at the disposal of these local authorities to make bulk purchases for them.  Could not that body be used to make bulk purchases of building materials for local authorities <Col N="1052" /> or, indeed, for smaller builders in the case of people who make contracts for the building of their houses?  If large quantities of materials were purchased in that way, I imagine there could be a considerable saving.</P>
    <P>The individual who goes to buy materials for a house has to buy in a retail sort of way.  Every little item has to be bought, separately, and of course that is a serious matter for him because he is the type of person who has to get a loan for the building of his house.  The cost of material to him is higher than it would be if he were able to buy at a wholesale rate which would be specifically applicable to this type of house.  If that suggestion were adopted, it would, I think, mean a saving not only to the individual, but to the State.  I would ask the Minister to give the matter consideration and see what can be done.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made here to what are called site fines.  I think everyone subscribes to the view that something should be done to prevent the exploitation of persons who have to take little sites for their houses.  We know that, in many cases, these fines cost the purchaser of a house £150 or £200.  I would draw the Minister's attention to another point in that connection, and that is that there is another way of putting a fine on the backs of those who require a bit of ground on which to build houses, and that is the ground rent.  I am wondering whether the Minister could not now indicate if there is not to be a limit to the amount of ground rent which can be put on the backs of persons such as I speak of.  I have heard of people who have taken a field suitable for building purposes.  The field may be adjacent to an area which has been developed.  Instead of putting a fine on each piece of building ground, they calculate a ground rent which gives them an unreasonably heavy return for the amount of money they have invested in the purchase of the land.  In view of the fact that the State is encouraging persons to build houses for themselves and become the owners of them, I think the Minister should protect them and the public by exercising some control over the amount of ground <Col N="1053" /> rent that can be attached to a site for building purposes.</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks to meet amendments with regard to valuations for the purpose of giving loans.  Any solicitor who is a member of the House will know that when you value a property you must take into consideration the amount of ground rent which will be payable in respect of it.  The higher the ground rent, the lower the valuation from the point of view of its capital value.  I suggest to the Minister that he should have this matter examined, and see whether some form of protection cannot be provided so that ground rents of unduly heavy amounts will not be clapped on as a kind of escape from what one may call cash fines.  In the long run these make the property dearer and less valuable to the purchaser, and in the end they make the position with regard to housing more difficult.</P>
    <P>Reference has also been made as to the necessity of seeing that, as far as possible, ranges and grates will be installed in these houses which will be suitable for the burning of turf.  That request has behind it unanimous support. In addition to that, I would suggest to the Minister that some effort should be made to get a new design of chimney or flue.  In Dublin we have the experience that fires start very easily in the chimneys if one is a constant user of turf.  I think the Minister should try to get some new design that would help to overcome that difficulty.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, this Bill is welcome because it will help to improve the already great advances made in regard to housings.  I would like to say to the Minister that I think, notwithstanding all the improvements which it seeks to bring about, that when it comes to be operated a number of snags will come to light in it.  I think it is generally accepted that what we are all anxious to do is to make it as easy as possible for people to be able to avail of loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, and to acquire their own houses.  I referred yesterday to the method of calculation in regard to putting a value on these loans.  Who is to do that?  I pointed <Col N="1054" /> out that sometimes there can be too strict a basis in regard to assessing the repayment capacity of the borrower. When you get down to the point of fixing the figure at which a person with an income of not less than so much per week can get a loan, the question of shillings will arise, and so there should be some bit of elasticity in making the calculation.  That should be taken into account as well as the character of the person who is getting the loan, the type of work on which he is engaged, and the fact that he has been able to improve his position in recent times. A young person in that position who wants to get a loan should not be refused it.  He should not be forced, right at the beginning, into a rented, house, the rent of which would be higher than his total commitments would be for the repayment of a loan if granted one.</P>
    <P>These are points which the Minister should have examined in detail.  He should, I think, give a direction to the local authorities to be as elastic as possible when dealing with such applications. If the Minister gives a certain amount of protection to the potential purchasers of these houses, he will find, I think, that the use of this money under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act will be very much speeded up, and that a very great number of houses will be acquired in that way. If he can do something in regard to legal costs, stamp duties, fines or ground rents or maybe fines plus ground rents and the heavier cost of materials for the smaller type of builders on the lines which I have already indicated, then I think the all-over costs can be brought down considerably and there will be a great deal more satisfaction amongst the people concerned.  There will be an understanding that the State is really seeking the welfare of the citizen who wants to help himself in this respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>With other Deputies, I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on bringing it in.  I find one fault in it, however, namely, that the benefits will only be given effect to from &ldquo;the passing of the Act&rdquo;, so that those who are having houses built and who have signed contracts within <Col N="1055" /> the last two or three months will not get the benefit of the Bill.  I therefore ask the Minister to fix a date other than after &ldquo;the passing of the Act&rdquo; and thus give the benefits of the Bill to those who really inspired it, namely, the crusaders in the campaign by people to build their own houses. Young married couples went out and saw a house in the course of erection and negotiated with the builder and signed contracts within the last few months.  I earnestly hope that those who were the crusaders in the campaign will get the benefit of the Bill. I would say that there would not be more than 100 persons who have entered into these contracts for non-grant houses.  I sent the Minister one case recently where a young man signed a contract in March last and I do not think he will get the benefit of this Bill.  The Bill should be made retrospective in order to take in such people who went ahead with the building of a house without the Government's support.  They are worthy of our attention.</P>
      <P>I want to avail of this opportunity to congratulate publicly the Taoiseach and the Government on behalf of the Dublin Corporation for the way they stepped into the breach last October, when the corporation was left without any money for building.  They procured a loan of £5,000,000 in order to enable the corporation to carry on its building schemes.  It was because of their intervention that the corporation got this £5,000,000 and were thus enabled to continue their housing programme and the employment of 4,000 men.  The corporation will want another £5,000,000 within a very short time.  The last £5,000,000 was secured at 3½ per cent. interest and is for a period of 15 years.  That money, I think, will be exhausted by September and we will have to ask the Government's help again to raise another £5,000,000 in order to carry on our programme. The period for repayment, however, will have to be extended, as we advance money under the Small Dwellings Act for 35 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Different figures have been given by various Deputies as to the rate of progress of house building in Dublin. <Col N="1056" /> These figures do not coincide with the official information given by the housing department of the corporation. Deputy MacEntee, for instance, gave one set of figures.  I am officially informed that the corporation has in progress at present 3,000 dwellings. Over 1,200 of these have been completed and I think-the remainder are expected to be completed before the end of the year.  I hope the corporation will be able to get that output and that some of the people who are anxious to get houses will be taken out of the hovels they are living in at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick made a complaint as to recommendations he made with regard to houses for certain persons and wondered why persons with five and six children cannot get houses. There are five members of the Dublin Corporation in the Dáil and they will tell you that we get the same sort of reply that he got.  When we recommend cases, we are told that they will be given careful consideration with all the other applicants.  There are 21,000 applicants for houses at present.  I have not yet found a member of the corporation who could say that his recommendation carried any weight whatever with the officials who are allocating the houses.  Personally, I can say that I was inclined to be aggrieved in regard to this matter when I put forward exceptionally good cases of people with large families or people with tuberculosis, or people living in condemned dwellings.  The officials go into all the details and, so far as the members of the corporation are concerned, they do not interfere with the allocation of houses.  We have no power in the matter.  There is a special committee of officials who go out and do their best to see that the most deserving people get houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>And that information is made available and we know how every house is allocated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The list is there and anyone can inspect it and see whether the cases are deserving or not.  They can see who got the houses and if they can point to one case that was unworthy or less worthy than some other <Col N="1057" /> case, it will be investigated by the city manager and the director of housing, Mr. O'Mahony.  Sometimes I feel aggrieved when I put forward what looks like the saddest case of the lot and, for some reason or other, it is passed over.  The corporation are not dealing with 20 or 30 houses, but houses running into thousands.</P>
      <P>I want to find fault with something that happened in my area recently which, I am afraid, will interfere with corporation activities in connection with reconditioning schemes.  The members of the corporation, the news papers, and architects and others interested in housing have complimented the city manager on the reconditioning of the old Georgian houses. We took people out of these houses who were paying 4/-, 5/- and 6/- for a room. Having reconditioned them, we put a rent on these rooms based upon the valuation of the corporation valuer. The rent was increased because the tenants were given hot and cold water in their rooms and had a toilet provided for them.  Because of that, the commissioners of valuation came along&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a passing reference to the fact that our reconditioned tenements are being revalued over our heads and the rents of our tenants increased accordingly.  I ask the Minister to do something to see that once a rent is fixed on a corporation dwelling no outside body will have the right to come in and cause notice to be served on the tenants increasing the rent.  I have heard complaints about houses that have been revalued by the valuation commissioners, but that is another matter.  When they come in, however, and revalue our reconditioned tenements and get the corporation to increase the rent, I say that <Col N="1058" /> is wrong and it is time that we should put a stop to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would respectfully request the support of the House in drawing attention to the position in regard to our reconditioned tenement houses.  The rents have been increased as a result of the action of the Commissioners of Valuation in increasing the valuation.  That is the point I want to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must be content with what he has already said in regard to the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite content in asking that something should be done to remedy it.  I appeal again to the Minister to make grants under this Bill retrospective and not to adhere to the date set out in Section 6, Part II of the financial provisions.  That section reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, and subject to regulations made under this section, make, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, to a person purchasing a house on or after the passing of this Act&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a provision with which I find fault because, as I say, a number of crusaders borrowed moneys to purchase their houses and then found that the regulations in regard to market value prevented their getting a sufficient loan to complete the purchase.  In one or two cases they actually lost the houses.  They could not proceed with the purchase because of the fact that the market value, instead of the building costs, was regarded as the price of the house.  I should also like the Minister to make some inquiries in regard to the method by which the 5 per cent. <Col N="1059" /> tax is operated in regard to the transfer of houses.  Quite recently I came across a case in which the owner of a house, the father of a family, died. On his death the eldest daughter, on behalf of the rest of the family, took over the house.  Somebody then made it appear that the house would have to be transferred to her name and, would you believe it, the 5 per cent. tax was charged to that working-class family, who originally purchased the house under a corporation purchase scheme. As a result of something that arose between the members of the family, the estate had to be divided on the father's death.  A valuation was put on the house which, as I say, was transferred to the eldest daughter, and the 5 per cent. tax was charged to that family, although they already owned the house.  I think that that 5 per cent. duty is causing so much hardship that the Minister ought to make some representations to have it removed.</P>
    <P>So far as corporation schemes now in progress are concerned, I think I was incorrect in stating a few moments ago that there were 3,000 houses now in course of erection.  The figure given to me is 3,356 and 4,000 men are employed.  We shall want an additional £5,000,000 before the end of the year and it is feared that trouble will arise regarding sites.  Our next trouble is going to be sites within the city area. We had hoped that the Clontarf estate and other sites between the city and Howth would be available but the Howth main drainage scheme will take a couple of years to complete.  The engineers are working at full speed on it.  As I say a sum of £5,000,000 will be needed for housing.  About £1,500,000 will be spent on the Howth drainage scheme and we should then be able to provide a number of additional sites for housing which will benefit under the Minister's proposal.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is the question of ground rents in the city.  The corporation some time ago allotted a number of sites to utility societies and to young people to build their own houses.  I thought we had agreed in the early days that the maximum ground rent <Col N="1060" /> to be charged for one of these sites was £7 10s. but I find that because of certain costs that were incurred the ground rent for some of these small houses went as high as £12 10s.  There is no use in our posing as democrats and talking about ground rents payable to private persons, if the municipal authority charges rents of £12 10s. because of some extra cost incurred in connection with the scheme.  I do not think it fair to charge a ground rent of £12 10s. for these small houses acquired under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  I hope that the corporation will come back to a standard ground rent of £7 10s. for a terrace house and probably £10 for a corner house.  Sometimes one sees ground rents as high as £20 or £15 charged to people who can only deposit £100 or £200 on the purchase price of the house.  Some people are doing well out of them but the purchasers have to pay them.</P>
    <P>I have met hundreds of young people who are prepared to put down £100 as a deposit on a house.  I think that is evidence of their good faith.  Any young man who is prepared to deposit £100 as security for the house should, I hold, apart from whatever extra costs may arise in the way of solicitors' or architects' fees, be given a house on condition that he is prepared to meet the weekly payments which, in most cases, work out at about £2.  If such young men cannot give sufficient security themselves I think a guarantee from the parents or their friends, that they are suitable tenants and that they will be able to pay the rent should be accepted.  The rent of these houses will not be more than the rent they are already paying in many cases for a two-room flat.  I have in mind the case of one young man and his wife who, it was alleged, could not pay £2 a week for a house.  When I mentioned that to this young man he said to me:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am paying £2 5s. 0d. a week already for two rotten rooms.  Surely you will give me a chance and trust me to pay £2 a week rent for this house.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I earnestly hope that the difficulties confronting such people will be removed and that the Minister will <Col N="1061" /> watch closely what is happening in regard to ground rents.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I want to ask the Minister to accept the congratulations of the corporation on this Bill and convey to the Taoiseach and the Government our thanks for the £5,000,000 which they procured for it last year.  I hope that they will be able to provide a similar sum in the next few months.  I also hope that they will make some efforts to utilise derelict sites within the old city.  There are quite a number of these derelict sites at present but our officials are like other officials. They say: &ldquo;We are waiting for a comprehensive scheme.&rdquo;  These derelict sites can be seen in quite a number of areas in the city.  You can go around Dublin and see where three or four tenement houses have fallen down.</P>

      <P>I want the Minister to include the flat system.  If Dublin City is to be saved, if the schools, churches and shops in the centre of the city are to be preserved, Dublin City will have to begin on the large-scale building of blocks of flats everywhere tenement houses have fallen down leaving débris which should be removed.</P>

      <P>While I welcome the many advantages in this Bill I hope that the Minister will be more generous with regard to reconstruction grants for the occupants of county council cottages who have purchased their cottages.  On the 1st June I asked the Minister:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To enable cottiers who have pur chased their cottages to obtain (a) a reconstruction grant irrespective of the number of people occupying the house, and (b) a reconstruction grant for the erection of a bathroom.&rdquo; (Column 1134.)</P>
      <P>The Minister replied:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In view of the statutory obligation which rests on the local authority to put each cottage in good repair before vesting and in view of the very extensive claims on State and local funds in respect of housing generally, I think it is reasonable to <Col N="1062" /> confine reconstruction grants for vested cottages to cases where it is proposed to increase the living space in order to relieve serious overcrowding.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The people I have in mind are single people or elderly couples who, if they could obtain a reconstruction grant to build on a room or two, would be able, perhaps, to house young married relatives with a family and this would help to overcome the shortage of houses in that particular district.</P>
    <P>Another thing is that local authorities are being pressed all the time to have more extensive water supplies so as to bring these blessings to people in country districts in the same way as people in the towns have them.  I know various people living in cottages they purchased, where there is a water supply outside their doors, and if they could have a reconstruction grant to add on a bathroom they would willingly do it.</P>
    <P>I hope that on the Committee Stage the Minister will remember those two points: a reconstruction grant for cottages irrespective of the number of people in the house and a reconstruction grant for the erection of a bathroom.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">

      <P>The great fault in this Bill is that it is quite impossible of implementation.  I think it is a very cruel thing if people who are suffering as the people in Dublin are suffering in slums and overcrowded dwellings are given to understand that this is a Bill by virtue of which we will have tens of thousands of houses springing up in the cities, towns and countryside. Certainly so far as Dublin is concerned, that is just not the case.  Without further legislation the Bill cannot be implemented in the City of Dublin to any great extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is something misleading about the figures.  The Minister, two days ago, gave us very heartening figures with regard to housing, but we are up against realities here in the City of Dublin.  Deputies Byrne, O'Higgins, Briscoe and myself, who are members of the House and are also members of Dublin Corporation, know for a fact <Col N="1063" /> that at no time have we found it more difficult to get houses for the people who urgently need them than we do at the present time.  That is perfectly true.  As a matter of fact, when I first went on the corporation many years ago, bad and all as the situation was, we were able to house tuberculous families in any case much more easily and readily than we are able to do to-day.  That is the practical side of it.  We can only judge of the housing situation as we find it.  We still have at the moment families of four, five, six and seven, and in some cases eight, in one room in Dublin, and we can do nothing about it.  That is why, when we know that the Bill cannot be given effect to without further legislation, I think it is a cruel thing if, by any sort of propaganda, we lead the people to believe that the situation is going to be immediately improved in Dublin and throughout the country.  We know that it cannot be so.</P>
    <P>I would be the last in the world to suggest that the Minister intended to be misleading in this Bill or that there is the slightest trace of dishonesty on his part in presenting it.  That is the furthest thing from my mind, but I do know from experience of the propaganda that goes on at every crossroads, particularly before an election, either a local or a Dáil election, that the people will be told that houses are going to spring up like mushrooms because of this Bill.  We know perfectly well that that is not so and cannot be so.</P>

      <P>Of course, it is.  I was on a deputation with members of the corporation which waited on the Taoiseach, the Minister for Local Government, the Tánaiste and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister. They received us courteously and gave us very heartening assurances.  I was personally very grateful to them for the manner in which they received us and for the assurances they gave us. We may get the money, and we will be very pleased to get it, even on very hard terms, but we just cannot meet the terrible drain on the resources of this city in the repayment of these loans, so long as the interest which is being charged continues to be charged. We can do it only by bogging the people down in deeper and deeper rates.</P>
      <P>The Minister, the former Minister, Deputy Murphy, God be good to him, and Deputy O'Sullivan held that we should get money for housing purposes at 1¼ per cent. and they put down an amendment here to that effect.  I wonder does the Minister still think it right and proper that we should get money at 1¼ per cent.?  There is no hope of widespread building of houses, particularly in the city, until money is got much cheaper than we are getting it at present.  We are building up trouble for ourselves in the near future, and particularly in the more distant future, because remember that the very houses we are putting up, whether they are the ordinary corporation type of house or houses built under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts, are short-lived houses. None of these houses will have a long life and we will be up against rehousing possibly in the very areas in which these houses are within our own life-time. How are we going to do it and how are we going to continue the interest payments on these loans?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1065" /> Apart from the financial side there is a shortage of skilled labour, of tradesmen, and that, too, will militate against any quick implementation of this measure.  I urge the Minister to put the greatest pressure in his power on the Minister for Finance and on his confreres to shift the burden of the repayment of loans for building purposes from the rates on to some central fund, something on the lines suggested by the Minister and his colleagues in the amendment to which I have referred, because, until that is done, there is no hope of doing much under this Bill.  I do not want to play politics either inside or outside this House, but, unless we want to mislead our people, we will not tell them that under this Bill there will be tens of thousands of houses springing up all over the country.  It would be dishonest to do that and, if you get votes by that means, you will be getting them dishonestly.</P>
    <P>I hope that something will be done to shift the weight of these repayments from the rates on to the Central Fund, or to some new type of fund which we may establish, by which the burden of the payments will be spread over the country and will not fall on the already overburdened cities and towns.  I ask the Minister also, in order to give what effect is possible to this Bill, to deal with the land sharks and the legal sharks and also to consider&mdash;I do not want to describe the Minister for Finance as a shark of any kind&mdash;this stamp duty business, because the best will not be got out of this measure until these land sharks and legal sharks are dealt with and their activities curtailed.</P>

I hope that, when dealing with this Bill inside and outside the House, <Col N="1066" /> we will be honest with the people and will let them know that it is impossible of implementation without further legislation.</P>

      <P>Anybody who does not see the tremendous value this Bill is going to have for the people in need of houses, particularly in and around Dublin City and county, must either be out of touch with the housing situation; or must not have examined the Bill closer.  Those of us who are connected with local authorities in the Dublin area are very familiar with the housing position.  We are aware that the approximate need of houses in the City of Dublin is 20,000, and we who represent Dublin county, which suffers from the overflow of the city population, know that in the county housing needs are equally great.</P>
      <P>Those requiring houses can be broadly divided into two classes&mdash;the type who can take advantage of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts and those who must rely upon the local authority entirely for their housing requirements.  This Bill meets two very great needs.  I have found that the persons who, in recent years, have been endeavouring to take advantage of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts have met in many cases with insuperable difficulties which spring mainly from the fact that, as we all know, the cost of houses nowadays is at least two and a half times what it was in pre-war days.  That there has been racketeering in housing is beyond question and this Bill will, so far as it is possible, put a check, to some degree at any rate, upon racketeering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the alteration in respect <Col N="1067" /> of the deposit required of persons desiring to build their own houses, the provision whereby people who want to build their own houses can do so, provided they can deposit 5 per cent. of the cost, is, so far as the white collar workers, the tradesmen, or those in that particular grouping of workers, are concerned, the most progressive step taken so far.  Under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts, as they operate at present, every public representative in Dublin City and County knows that the difficulty, in the first instance, for the person desiring to build his house has been to get a deposit of sufficient size.  A person who desires to acquire an average house of that size, costing £1,800, on the fringe of Dublin, and who wants to get a loan from the local authority and to avail of the grant, would need to have at least £180, £200 or £250, and in many cases £300.  That is an impossible position for working-class people, even the better paid working-class people.</P>
    <P>We have many cases of young persons about to get married, who are anxious to avail of the opportunity to build a house for themselves, but who are denied that opportunity because of the very high deposit at present, in the case of a £1,800 house.  Under this Bill, they can secure such a house by depositing £90.  Anyone who says that that does not represent a tremendous advance on the previous position is not examining the facts as they should.  I consider that it is one of the best steps that have been taken.  We are lucky in Dublin City and County in that so many people are anxious to avail of the loans and grants to build for themselves. That represents a very substantial contribution in itself towards the housing problem and a lightening of the burden on the local authorities.  It is a progressive step, not only by making it easier for the person to build for himself, but it also means that the expense upon the National Exchequer will be all the less because, if these people did not build for themselves, the time would come when the local authority would have to build for them and subsidised houses would have to <Col N="1068" /> be provided.  In that sense, it is a progressive and very good measure. While I know Deputy Bernard Butler was stating what he believes to be true, he must have overlooked that particular aspect of the question.</P>
    <P>So far as the financial side of housing administration is concerned, we are all agreed that efforts should be made to provide cheaper money.  Undoubtedly, the interest rate represents a great disability. At the same time, Dublin County Council, being responsible for the area outside the city, are happy because over the past 18 months we have raised £1,250,000 for the building of houses for the people of the county &mdash;more than was ever raised or thought of before.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to Section 21 of this Bill, which is a very essential section. It adverts to the definition of &ldquo;agricultural worker&rdquo;.  This particular matter has given rise to very considerable trouble in County Dublin.  In the housing drive over the past one and a half years Dublin County Council has discovered some very bad cases, where people were living under most appalling conditions, in cowsheds.  There was one case of a family living at the back of a ditch with no shelter save tar barrels around them, in the depth of winter.  There were cases of people suffering from tuberculosis living seven and eight in one room which would hardly be sufficient to shelter one person.  Some of these cases have been recommended for rehousing by the local authority or by the county medical officer of health, who is the responsible officer.  We have come up against the snag that, because of the fact that the Labourers Acts make it clear that only agricultural workers or those who can be brought within the existing definition of &ldquo;agricultural worker&rdquo; can be rehoused under those Acts, the people to whom I refer have been precluded from getting a house.  This Bill, as I understand it, extends that definition and makes it possible for such people to be housed, but I would like the Minister to make this point clear when he is summing up.</P>
    <P>Take the case of a widow working as a domestic servant, who has been <Col N="1069" /> recommended by the medical officer of health for County Dublin for rehousing, as qualifying in every respect. Under existing legislation, this family cannot be rehoused because the widow, who is the head of the household, does not come within the extended definition of &ldquo;agricultural worker&rdquo;.  I would like that point to be clear. Under this Bill, will this matter be adjusted?</P>
    <P>I would like also to know whether pensionable officers of local authorities will be brought within the scope of this Housing Bill.  We have had experience in County Dublin of a mental hospital attendant being rehoused in the Swords area and later being served with notice to quit because it was discovered that he did not qualify within the Act because, the house having been built under the Labourers Act, this particular worker, being a pensionable officer, did not qualify within the extended definition of &ldquo;agricultural worker&rdquo;.  I think the purpose of this Bill, in part at any rate, is to remedy that very awkward situation.  I would like the Minister, in his summing up, to make that clear.</P>
    <P>I am trying to be as brief as possible. I do not want to intrude upon the time of any other member.  I would like, however, to make this point, and would ask the Minister to refer to it in his summing up.  There are cases in County Dublin of young couples who got married, who were living in County Dublin, just outside the fringe of the city, in an area like Finglas, who were born and reared and lived all their lives in the Finglas area.  When they got married, because of the pressure of the housing shortage, they were forced into the the city to live in slum dwellings.  In the ordinary course of events, where such people qualified, where their housing circumstances were so bad as to warrant rehousing, where they had a family, the Dublin County Council in the past has been willing to bring them back, after their short time in the city, into the county administrative area and to rehouse them in their native district.  Objection has been raised to that because, at the time of the allocation, they were not actually <Col N="1070" /> residing in the county health district. I think that is a flaw which needs to be remedied.  I would ask the Minister to give the matter consideration, and to see what can be done about it. In a number of cases it represents very great hardship.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment the Minister on this very fine measure. We have been waiting for it for a very long time.  No matter what may be said to the contrary, no matter what temporary difficulties Dublin Corporation may find in the matter of financial accommodation, I believe they can be overcome.  This is the enabling measure which was essential in order that the thousands of people who are living in most appalling circumstances in the City and County of Dublin may get houses more speedily.  Every Deputy should welcome it on that score.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have risen to speak on this debate because I feel that, with the great spate of oratory emphasising the needs of Dublin City and depicting the problem there and the problems within the problem, the country might be forgotten.  While undoubtedly this Bill goes a certain distance and is a step forward, it is by no means a final solution of the housing problem even in the country.  I am sure the Minister does not contend that it is so, because in the country we also have a slum problem&mdash;as I am sure the Minister very well knows&mdash;though, of course, not to the same extent as in the case of the City of Dublin.  In the country, however, even with the very generous grants that are being given, there are people who, even if the grant were to be doubled, would still be unable to erect a house.  I would stress that these people do not comprise an insignificant percentage of the rural population.  I know some of them.  Their houses are in a bad way.  It has been possible for a number of years past to obtain grants, but these people were unable to avail of them because they had not sufficient money of their own to supplement these grants.  I realise quite well that somebody may ask: &ldquo;Are there not loans to be had under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts?&rdquo;  Surely <Col N="1071" /> it should not be necessary for me to have to point out that loans under these Acts bear interest?  In our county the rate is 3¾ per cent.: I think it is 3¼ per cent. and that an extra ½ per cent. is added for administrative purposes.  Take, for instance, even a medium-sized house at present: it will not be in any way pretentious&mdash; in fact, it will hardly be as good as an ordinary labourer's cottage.  Such a house will cost anything in the neighbourhood of £900 or £1,000.  Taking into consideration the £225 of a grant, such persons as I have mentioned have to find the remainder of the cost.  It is possible that they might have £100, but then they have to find the remainder by way of loan.  That means that they must go to the county council for a loan of over £600.  The repayment of that loan over a period of 30 years would mean that they would have to pay something more than £20 a year.  I have not calculated the exact figure. We are all aware that there was a great clamour in the country when rents were high and that there is a great clamour going on at present in connection with the increase in rates.  When people of that type would have to pay these sums of money per year, they would be bound to remember what their fathers and their forefathers had to say in regard to rack rents.  The fact of the matter is that they are not able to avail of the grants&mdash;and that is a problem which I should like to hear discussed in this House.  It is a pity that legislation of this type should be introduced at the end of the session.  The housing problem as it affects the cities and the rural areas deserves very great consideration from many aspects.  Time could not be more advantageously devoted to any measure or business which has come before this House as to a full discussion of the housing problem. That, unfortunately, is not possible now because the time factor is against us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to make a suggestion&mdash;it may, perhaps, be impracticable and, indeed, impossible&mdash;that possibly a valuation of, say, £15 in the country might be fixed on the certificate of the county medical officer of health: the site would <Col N="1072" /> be free in the case of the people I have mentioned.  The local authority would build a house that would be much the same as a labourer's cottage: at any rate, it would be a big improvement on what they have.  They would repay the charges in respect of that house in the same way as the labourer repays for his cottage or some such similar arrangement.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the valuation limit in respect of the reconstruction of houses has been increased.  In fact, I should like to see it removed altogether just as in the case of the erection of new houses.  There is a section of the community whose valuations are from £40 to £80.  While they may appear, because of their valuations, to be well-to-do people, the fact is that they are finding it as difficult in many instances to make ends meet as any other section of the community. Furthermore, there is very little sympathy for them because of their supposedly comfortable circumstances. They get a remission of rates on the first £20 of valuation but then there are difficulties if they are not able to have the labour content.  Then again, they do not get the same sympathy in respect of health services and so forth as people with lower valuations.  I think that that statement will be generally accepted as being a true statement.</P>
    <P>Section 16 of this Act is, I presume, a very desirable section within limits, but it is capable, in my opinion, of being abused and of inflicting hardships. It enables local authorities to purchase sites for persons other than the working classes.  I quite agree that a number of business people and tradesmen find it very difficult to get sites or to build houses.  However, the way the section is framed at present makes it capable of a very wide interpretation.  I do not think abuse would be likely to happen in the City of Dublin or in the neighbourhood of Dublin, but this applies to urban areas such as Ballinasloe, and to town commission areas such as Tuam and Loughrea.  Undoubtedly, nothing is more popular than the acquisition of sites for housing.  When a site is acquired, you may be sure that it is a <Col N="1073" /> good site.  It might be a field of two, three or five acres belonging to a man who derived his chief means of livelihood from it.  He may have had two or three cows in it; he may have been using it for the purpose of producing vegetables, or something like that. They go in and take that field; after all, he is only an individual.  He has command only of his own vote and of the votes of whatever number of people may comprise his household. However, there would be room on that field for anything from 12 to 20 houses. The field would be taken over, therefore, and the price fixed by arbitration. The fact that it was his main source of livelihood and that he had a certain income from it might not always be taken fully into consideration. The members of the local authority are human beings, just like the rest of us, and they would have that site taken over and bought. Their idea, in my opinion, would be to sell it to the persons who would give them the highest prices for the sites.  In that case you would have perhaps, in the town, a business man who resided in his business premises, and who would have, perhaps, a £3,000 or £4,000 turnover a year, and he would come along to the local authority and would be capable of giving a good price for a site and, of course, he would get it.  That man would be in a far better financial position than the unfortunate man for whom that site was acquired.</P>
    <P>There should be some restrictive subsection so far as that particular section of the Bill is concerned.  If not, then, in my opinion, it is capable of being abused, and I am sure the Minister does not desire any such abuses and that he has brought in this measure with the best intentions.  I could give instances, even in the case of the acquisition of land for the working classes, where hardship was imposed on persons who could not be described as other than working people.  Their annual income was no more than the annual wage of the people for whom the houses were being provided, and they were deprived of that source of income and the compensation that was offered to them would not by any <Col N="1074" /> means compensate them for the deprivation that was caused.</P>

      <P>In so far as this Bill constitutes an attack on the evil of the housing problem which confronts this nation, I welcome it.  If, as a result of the operation of this Bill, a thousand houses are provided, I shall be glad; if five thousand houses are erected I shall be better pleased and, if the record figure of houses constructed under the Fianna Fáil regime is exceeded, I shall rejoice.  But I want to warn the Minister that the mere passing of this Bill through the Oireachtas and the securing of the signature of the President will not end all this legislation.  Unless the Minister applies his energies to the problem, this Bill will be like many other measuses that have passed through this House and it will provide little or no remedy for the situation it is proposed to relieve.</P>
      <P>I regret this Bill has been brought before the House in the circumstances in which it has been brought.  I regret that there is a certain restriction of debate on the measure.  I am afraid, because of that curtailment, that the Bill will possibly have many shortcomings. However, this Bill need not be the end of Bills endeavouring to provide a solution for the housing problem, and I am not going to be as pessimistic about its results as some of my colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that as a result of the passing of this Bill the people of this nation will find some relief.  Like Deputy Beegan, I have heard serious fears expressed in respect of Section 16.  If the section is properly and justly interpreted, I do not think the fears which have been expressed will be realised. On the other hand, it occurs to me that under Section 16 it will be possible to deal with the cases which were mentioned by Deputy McCann last evening.  If, for instance, some individuals endeavour to batten on the desires of people to secure housing accommodation, it is possible, through the medium of Section 16, that the land they are demanding exorbitant figures for can be acquired under the <Col N="1075" /> compulsory powers contained in the section.</P>
    <P>The rushing of this Bill through the House in the manner in which it is being rushed prevents the possibility of similar types of cases being brought to the attention of the Minister.  We heard Deputy Martin O'Sullivan last evening giving instances in respect of the exorbitant legal charges that are being imposed on unfortunate victims who are prepared to face almost any conditions in order to secure a house. Surely, it would be possible to standardise the fee in respect of legal charges connected with the buying of a house?  I do not see why a standard fee cannot be struck.  Deputy Martin O'Sullivan gave us instances where the charges ranged from a very high figure to a figure that might be described as modest and reasonable.  If a modest and reasonable charge satisfies one member of the legal fraternity, surely it should satisfy others who are charging the exorbitant figures which Deputy Martin O'Sullivan mentioned?</P>

      <P>Under Section 12 land which has been devoted extensively towards providing recreation grounds and sports fields can be acquired.  I hope that as far as the City of Dublin is concerned these sports fields will not be acquired.  I am as anxious, and perhaps more anxious than most Deputies, to see some kind of relief brought to the citizens of Dublin with relation to providing them with housing accommodation.  But I would be very sorry to think some of these recreation grounds and sports fields, which constitute an open lung in housing centres, will be taken away and built on.  I am aware that a number of these open sites are operated by large commercial firms, which apparently believe in the policy of providing proper outdoor recreational facilities for their employees.  I think that is something that should be encouraged. If an employer has a healthy staff, he will have efficient workers.  I think those employers who have provided these facilities are to be commended, and no obstacles should be put in the way of their developing that particular idea.  As far as Dublin is concerned, I know of at least two sites which are in danger of being acquired in spite of the fact that right around the particular recreation grounds there is virgin land which could be utilised for building just as easily as the grounds themselves. A large sum of money has been expended in providing these facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the definition in respect of labourers' cottages will not be applied as rigidly in the future as it has been in the past.  Any individual who occupies one of these cottages is a labourer of one kind or another; it does not matter whether he is a Garda, a lowly paid primary teacher or a motor driver, he still remains a worker and he should be entitled to apply and to receive consideration if he seeks to secure one of these hygienic, habitable cottages.  For that reason I congratulate the Minister on widening the scope of the definition, <Col N="1077" /> thereby making it easier for these workers to secure that particular type of accommodation.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the Minister that if he wishes to secure results in excess of those achieved by the former Government he will have to put his shoulder to the wheel since he will have to erect at least 14,000 or 15,000 of these cottages throughout the country to exceed the number built under the former régime.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by repeating something that I said on a former occasion with reference to this housing problem. This problem, which we inherited from a foreign administration, deserves to be treated as an emergency measure. Every speech I have heard on the matter confirms me in that opinion. While I know it will not be treated in that particular manner, I do hope that it will be given the attention, energy and drive it deserves and that the Minister will not rely merely upon the activity of his officials, but will give those officials a lead by his own efforts to bring about an even partial solution of this desperate problem.</P>

      <P>This Bill is a courageous attempt to solve the burning problem of housing, especially in the City of Dublin.  Its advantages will apply all over the country.  The Bill is impatiently awaited by those engaged in the building trade, apart from the homeless families which will eventually take up residence in the houses built under the provisions of this Bill.  I hope it will pass into law in the shortest possible time.  Applicants for houses are eagerly awaiting its passage. It is a tremendous step forward in comparison with previous housing legislation, particularly with reference to that section of the community which desires to avail of the facilities afforded by the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  It is particularly welcome to families needing habitable houses since it eliminates the discrimination which operated unfairly against such persons as Civic Guards, soldiers and employees of local authorities. Many people have sought proper housing accommodation under the provisions of these Acts because they could <Col N="1078" /> not afford the cost of building their own houses and were not qualified for houses under the definition of agricultural labourers.  For that reason the extended scope of the definition is to be welcomed.  I know of cases where applicants earning £5 a week and less are obliged to shelter in hovels, shacks and over-crowded houses although relatives of theirs and their families, with incomes ranging from £3 to £30 per week, could secure a house because they were eligible under the provisions of the Agricultural Labourers Act. This Bill will certainly eliminate the difficulties created in the past in that respect since it recognises the desirability of enabling wage earners, irrespective of their occupation, to secure habitable homes for themselves and their families.  In my opinion, the existing legislation was too narrow in its scope, and it had the effect of creating a housing problem rather than of offering an effective solution to it, so far as the application of the Agricultural Labourers Act applied. That is particularly true of County Dublin because preference was not given to men working on the land, and that created confusion in the minds of persons otherwise employed.  That difficulty will be eliminated by this new Bill.</P>
      <P>I think it will be welcomed by the building contractors who have met with considerable difficulty so far as the application of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act is concerned.  The question of final valuations certainly creates a good deal of embarrassment and hardship for people who innocently enough, I suppose, decided to avail of its advantages; but when the final valuation was made, they found that they had to put their hands in their pockets again or seek some financial accommodation to enable them to make the necessary deposit.  The provisions of this Bill will clarify that position because people will know what their financial commitments are going to be.  For that reason, I hope the Minister will have the Bill passed into law within the shortest possible time so that all those concerned can take advantage of it.</P>

      <P>This Bill is <Col N="1079" /> definitely a step forward.  It does not go as far as I would like to see it going.  I am of the same opinion as other Deputies, that the housing problem which is facing us to-day is so serious that it should be made a national problem.  I say that as a result of all the snags which I have come up against.  There is the problem for local authorities of borrowing money at a high rate of interest, and one for people who have to pay high rents for houses.  There is a problem, too, for people going into houses built by private enterprise.  For many of them their commitments are a shocking millstone around their necks.  A number of our people are finding it very hard to exist because of the high rents they have to pay in new houses and others because of the purchase price they have to pay for houses.</P>
      <P>During the last few years we have succeeded in building a number of houses in County Dublin.  I want to make a passing reference to one matter so that it may go down on the records here.  I do so in the interests of historical truth.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Local Government in 1942 found himself in the position of having to put in a commissioner because the neglect in regard to housing in County Dublin was something shocking.  His first duty was to ask the commissioner to have a survey made of housing needs in the County Dublin.  I am not making any excuse to Deputy Davin because the war was on in 1942, 1943, 1944 and 1945; but, notwithstanding that over 1,000 sites were procured, and just at the time that we were leaving office, a number of houses were under construction there.

      <P>I am dealing with the housing position in the County Dublin which was referred to by another Deputy.  We succeeded in procuring 1,035 sites; but the new Dublin County Council, about which we hear so much talk&mdash;what have they done?  They have succeeded in procuring only 137 sites since they took office in 1948, and on these sites they have succeeded in building only 20 houses.  I want to state again, as a positive fact, that the position of housing in the County Dublin is due to the previous Administration.  I do <Col N="1081" /> not want to say anything against the present Minister.  Since he became Minister, he has done his best.  What I have stated are historical facts, and I want them to go on the records of this House.  I hope we will not hear any more misrepresentation on this matter in the future.</P>
      <P>I was delighted to hear Deputy Martin O'Sullivan and Deputy McCann raise the question of ground rents and fines.  That is becoming a racket in this country.

I am sorry to have to take advantage of the House by referring to any citizen in that way.</P>
      <P>Last night, Deputy M. O'Sullivan, Deputy McCann and others referred to the question of legal costs.  It is about time that something should be done for the unfortunate people with regard to these legal costs, if they are not to be bled white.  I know families with an income of £6 a week living in four-roomed houses in the Ballymun area who have to pay £2 5s. 0d. and £2 10s. 0d. a week rent.  That cannot be allowed to go on.  Another point I want to refer to is the high cost of money to the borrower.  That is a very serious problem.</P>

      <P>If our people are to be enabled to live in decent comfort and if the cost of living is to be reduced, we will have to face that issue in a national way and legislation will have to be brought in to deal with these matters.  There is a housing association in my constituency building 500 houses. The people have to pay £2 5s. 0d. a <Col N="1082" /> week, plus 5/- a week rates for these houses.  This company has refused to avail of the grant under the 1948 Act, and the result is that the unfortunate tenants are bled white.  I should like to see a provision put into this Bill to deal with people of that kind who are finding it very hard to carry on.  They were forced into the position of having to take these houses and, with a family of three or four children now, they find it very hard to make ends meet.</P>

      <P>I want to strike a note of warning with regard to the question of valuations and market value.  I welcomed the section dealing with that in the 1948 Act when it was introduced.  I thought it was a wonderful section and so did every other Deputy at the time.  But not even the most far-seeing Minister could see the implications of that term &ldquo;market value&rdquo;.  Deputy Martin O'Sullivan last night suggested one way of dealing with that matter of valuations, namely, that the building surveyors who are employees of the local authority should value the houses.  In County Dublin the valuers are not carrying out the spirit of that Act as it was intended by the draftsman and the then Minister for Local Government.  There was a big margin between the valuation put on the houses and the actual cost of them.  The result was that a number of people walked into a trap.  It was never intended by the former Minister that that Act should be interpreted in that way.  This Bill should be made retrospective in order to come to the help of people who found themselves debarred, as a result of the valuation placed on their houses, from getting the money they were legally entitled to. So far as I am concerned I have nothing but contempt for these valuers and their idea of &ldquo;market value&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted that the restrictions with regard to the letting of council cottages in County Dublin and elsewhere are being done away with so that soldiers, Gardaí, local authorities' employees and lower-paid civil servants will now be eligible for them.  I <Col N="1083" /> am glad that the valuation limit for the reconstruction grant has been increased from £35 to £50.  In County Dublin very small holdings of land have a valuation of £50.</P>

      <P>That might be the case down the country where a big holding might be valued at only £50, but in County Dublin it is a different matter.  I know a man who got a holding of ten or 12 acres in County Dublin from the Land Commission and his valuation is £48.  Land in County Dublin is valued very highly.  I would ask the Minister to increase the valuation limit further.  I am not going to specify the figure.  I have given my personal experience of valuations in County Dublin and Deputy Dunne knows that holdings are very highly valued in that area.</P>
      <P>Deputy Traynor referred to the question of providing sports fields.  I should like to see provision made for them in this Bill.  I regret that no provision has been made for sports fields in some of our recent housing schemes.  Sports fields and playgrounds should be provided for the children on these housing sites no matter what the cost is.  I would impress on the Minister the necessity for dealing with the question of high rents for local authority houses.  I want to say to the Minister that in County Dublin the differential rents scheme is causing an immense amount of trouble.  The tenants are claiming that the houses should be let at a lower rent.  The rents charged for houses other than local authorities' houses are also a problem.  These high rents, of course, tend to increase the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this Bill represents a good attempt to improve the facilities whereby houses will be provided for people who need them and that it will be of special benefit to people who intend to purchase houses under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  The fact that they <Col N="1084" /> can now go round and select a house in itself will be an encouragement.  It will, in addition, be an encouragement to small builders and private contractors&mdash;some people call them speculative builders&mdash;and also to utility societies to proceed with the building of houses without having to wait for prospective purchasers.  I know of several cases in which such builders were held up in the building of semi-detached houses because they did not know whether they would have any applicants for such houses.  Prior to this Bill, the applicant had to make his application before the building of the house commenced.  I think, as a result, we shall see more of that type of house erected.  The prospective tenant will be able to go around as if he had already the £275 grant in his pocket. He will be able to make a good bargain; he will not be so restricted and he will not be under the necessity &mdash;at least I hope he will not&mdash;of incurring debts with builders' providers and of raising money in the banks while he is waiting for the grant.  I take it that this Bill means that if a man decides to purchase a house that is already built and which comes within the regulations, he will be in a position to purchase that house with the amount of loans secured from the local authority and this £275 grant.  I think that is an advance and that it will soften the way for a lot of people and young couples who intend to start off as owners of their own houses, as most of them who are in any kind of employment at all would prefer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of market value and of valuation has been raised.  It is extraordinary that down in Cork we have had very little trouble as regards the market value and the valuation put on these houses by the local officers.  A person who is having a house built under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, with the assistance of the corporation or the county council, is generally able to receive financial assistance, which is very close to the sum required for the building of the house.  There has never been much of a gap in that way and, whoever the engineers were, they were able to put a decent valuation on the building.  I am sorry to hear that <Col N="1085" /> the same state of affairs does not prevail in Dublin, where it would appear, according to some speakers, that people have to deposit anything from £250 to £400 of their own money before they can avail of the facilities provided by the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  I think that such a deposit is beyond the reach of any ordinary worker.  I do not know how far this Bill will go to settle this question of valuation, but I think that some provision should be inserted in the Bill to make it retrospective, so that people who are now burdened with what somebody referred to as a second millstone around their necks will get some easement.  It is a difficulty that appears to be confined to the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I should like if the Minister would define what he means by &ldquo;persons not of working classes&rdquo; in Section 16. Does &ldquo;working classes&rdquo; embrace Army officers, Garda officers and bank clerks?  I presume they are all regarded as working classes.  I know that, under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, the Cork Corporation have already purchased sites and leased them to Army officers and I think quite rightly so.  I think they are entitled to the benefits of these Acts, but I do not know what particular classes the Minister intends to cover by that definition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it mean that a manager of the Bank of Ireland, for instance, will come under this and that he will get this grant of £275 for his house?  Yesterday, when I was making a plea for grants for houses in Cork, the Minister made the statement: &ldquo;This scheme was intended for certain classes who can pay high rents.&rdquo;  I should like to point out to the Minister that I know several bus conductors, labourers and a couple of bookmakers' clerks who are tenants of these houses. Are people such as a manager of the Bank of Ireland or a manager of Guinness, going to get grants for their houses, while the people who are tenants of these houses in Cork will be <Col N="1086" /> deprived of the benefits of grants?  That is a matter on which I should like to get some explanation.  We are told that the corporation are not expected to make a profit out of the houses, but in a statement given to the corporation by the city manager in Cork, he told us that in one scheme the economic rent was £84 10s. 0d. and he was going to charge £52, while in another scheme the economic rent was £102 and he was charging £52.  That is a question that we may be able to develop at another time, but it seems strange to me that people with unlimited means can get grants for their houses, while the bus conductor and the labourer in Cork occupying corporation houses will not get any grant for their houses.  I cannot see the justice of that at all.  I shall not stress that matter further, but I hope that the Minister will rise to the occasion.</P>
      <P>As regards the qualifications of people other than agricultural labourers, there is part of Cork Borough electoral constituency which goes outside the county borough boundary and I should like to get some definition from the Minister in regard to the qualifications of people there. Deputy Burke said that in future Gardaí and soldiers will be entitled to houses built by the local authority.  I should like to be clear on that, because I had experience of a very sad case about six months ago of a Garda living in a village a few miles from Cork, whose wife had tuberculosis and who had several children.  The local authority, the South Cork Board of Health, were anxious to provide him with a house, but I understand that people in permanent and pensionable employment are debarred from getting such houses.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister, in his reply, to tell us that those Gardaí and soldiers who are living in rural areas would be entitled through this Bill to get houses that are built for letting by local authorities apart from agricultural labourers' cottages&mdash;what are described as &ldquo;non-municipal houses&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just propose to make a few observations on the Bill itself.  This Bill has been described in various ways as &ldquo;a puny Bill&rdquo; and &ldquo;a great Bill&rdquo;; quite a number of adjectives have been applied to it, but if we look at the Housing Bills that have been passed since this State was established we find a continuation, improvement and development right along.  Deputy MacEntee last night made quite a number of observations about the Act passed by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1932.  If we look at housing in an objective way we find that probably the most vital Act in the whole housing code is the Act of 1931 passed just before Fianna Fáil came into office.  That is a very important Act.  In 1932 Fianna Fáil improved it; there was a further improvement in 1948 and this Bill goes ahead and continues the improvement. If we look at the question from the point of view of a code we must welcome this Bill as a very important development in housing legislation.</P>
      <P>I would support the plea to make this Bill retrospective, certainly in the City of Dublin, where through very harsh interpretation of &ldquo;value&rdquo; applicants for houses who are now living in them were deprived of from £100 to £150 that they would have got under the Bill.  That has been a tremendous hardship to them, and if the Minister could agree to have an examination of these cases for the purpose of increasing under this Bill the amount payable under the Small Dwellings Act in respect of those houses, he certainly would do a good day's work for a number of people who are now put to the pin of their collars to exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the floor space in the Bill to be increased and I think that the Minister is the only person who can move such an amendment.  A private Deputy might have some difficulty, as such an amendment might be held to involve finance.  If the Minister <Col N="1088" /> did it, it would get us out of that difficulty.</P>
    <P>In the Small Dwellings Act there is a small defect which I think can be put right in this Bill.  Under the Small Dwellings Act, to get a loan you must be the sole owner of a house, and where a man and his wife owned a house jointly they have been refused loans.  I think that everyone will agree that it is a good precaution and sensible management on the part of a man and his wife to own a house jointly and where they do that they should not be debarred from facilities under that Act.  I would ask that to be put right or, if the Minister thinks it can be granted and local authorities think it cannot, that the position be clarified.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to stamp duties and I hope that stamp duties in respect of this will apply only to the value of the site and not to the value of the house.  That can easily be clarified in the section.  I think we will get over the difficulty which has been very properly mentioned by Deputies regarding the costs charged to purchasers of houses in Ennis.  That could be done by a very simple amendment saying that the legal costs payable in respect of houses built under the Bill should be assessed on the value of the site.  If that is done it will be found that the costs will be very small. They probably will not exceed £10 10s. 0d. and I think that will be reasonable.  If a house is being built on a site there is no reason in the world why legal costs should be involved on anything except the site value. There is no reason why they should be charged on the £1,600 or £1,800 it costs to build a house.  The situation is much different later where the house has changed hands a number of times and where there must be an investigation of title.  In that case a statutory fee is chargeable by legislation and that part of it is all right.  In the City of Dublin where houses are being built in this way my experience has been that solicitors ask only the minimum charge on the site value and very often something less than the scale of fees, so I was absolutely shocked at the revelation which was made here last night by <Col N="1089" /> Deputies O'Sullivan and O'Grady and others.  There is no conscience behind a charge of that particular type and in my view it is not right. The people concerned should avail of their legal remedies to have those costs taxed.  They have that right and they should do so.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should personally&mdash;or his officials could do it as we have not time to get down to a correct examination of the Bill&mdash;provide an amendment that stamp duty and costs will be in respect of the site value and not of the value of the house.</P>
    <P>I would like to see more houses built by local authorities for sale under the Small Dwellings Act to tenants.  In Marino, Donnycarney and elsewhere we have magnificent estates built by the corporation and sold or leased to tenants under the Small Dwellings Act 20 years ago and now most of those houses have been completely bought out by the tenants.  Those areas are some of the wealthiest, most respectable and finest areas in the city, and I would ask that that should be encouraged by the building of houses by local authorities for sale to tenants under the Small Dwellings Act.  It will probably be found in that instance that the deposit to be paid would probably be much less than even the 5 per cent. deposit mentioned in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I think this opportunity should be availed of to provide protection for the tenants of corporation houses against unjust eviction.  I am aware of one case where a tenant's child had a row with the caretaker on the 6th April last.  The caretaker, before the court proceedings, wrote a letter to the corporation requesting that that family be evicted because of that assault. The court proceedings for assault were dismissed, but on the 14th, eight days afterwards, Dublin Corporation served a notice to quit on that family.  They brought proceedings and the proceedings came before the district justice this morning and the district justice had no power except to grant a decree. I say that the executive machinery of the Dublin Corporation was not properly invoked in that case.  That notice to quit was served by a minor official and not by the city manager.  We know <Col N="1090" /> how the city runs and we know that, in view of the dates, 6th April and 14th April, in the way the Dublin Corporation is run, the matter should not have been dealt with in the way it was dealt with.</P>
    <P>That family is now, under the justice's order this morning, to be evicted in seven days from that house. That is a scandalous thing.  It is something the Minister would not stand over and which the city manager, if he were aware of the facts, would not stand over.  No decent person could stand over it.  I hope that, under this Bill, we will get a little protection and that, except in certain circumstances, like non-payment of rent, the local authority, corporation or county council will have to establish to the satisfaction of the justice its case for eviction.  I will try to get an amendment to that effect into the Bill, and it will be law before this eviction takes place, because an appeal will be lodged for the purpose of holding it up.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister ought to consider the position of housing in Dublin.  Unless there is a reorganisation of the machinery for the acquisition of sites and the building of houses, the number of houses we require in Dublin will not be built. I think there ought to be a housing board under the chairmanship of the Minister's Parliamentary Secretary to take over this huge job.  We have to build about 20,000 houses, and, when they are built, they can be handed over to the Dublin Corporation to be administered by them; but the job is too big for the Corporation to deal with, and it is because it is too big that we are not progressing in the way we ought to progress.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hickey has asked me to mention one point.  Apparently a man employed by a local authority, such as an employee of the fire brigade, is not eligible for a grant for the reconstruction of a bungalow under the Bill.  I ask the Minister to look into that, because I am sure that, if that is so, the Minister will put the Bill right in that regard.  Deputy Hickey has already spoken, and cannot speak again, and I am mentioning the matter for him.  I welcome the Bill and I hope that, even <Col N="1091" /> in the short time at our disposal, we will be able to do something to make it a better Bill before it leaves the House.</P>

      <P>I will not start by congratulating the Minister but by wishing him luck and success in the work to which he has set his hand.  I believe the Minister is sincere and I hope that anything I say will be a help in removing some of the obstacles which I know he has to face.  I was struck last night by the appeal Deputy McCann made in connection with ground rents.  Other Deputies, and especially Deputies from Dublin, made the same appeal about ground rents which are imposed by the landlords.  I do not think we can complain in this respect.  I am not taking the landlord's part but we cannot complain when our own local authorities are imposing the same ground rents.  I was present at the opening of a number of houses in Sligo town a few days ago and I was amazed to find that there was a ground rent of £10 on these houses imposed by the corporation. Example is better than precept and, before we attack the landlords, we should set a good example.  It is a shame that a corporation should impose a ground rent of £10 and I should like the Minister to look into that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statement has been made that the shortage of skilled labour is holding up our housing schemes.  I would not have intervened in the debate at all were it not for the fact that this morning I was shown a letter by a Deputy who has spoken already in the debate, a letter from a tradesman who came to this city looking for work after reading about all the work that was available and all the tradesmen required. He went to different contractors and was told that he could not get work until he was two years in the union.  I can have that letter given to the Minister, if he wishes.  I am not saying that I believe that what is stated in that letter is a fact, but, if it is, it is a shame.  I see in my own town&mdash;I am not blaming Labour because Labour are not responsible for it&mdash;the formation of a certain ring in order to cut out certain small contractors <Col N="1092" /> and steps being taken to see that no man is allowed into the Labour union in order to keep men from earning a decent livelihood.  I am speaking as one who is concerned with Labour. I believe that Labour is entitled to proper organisation and that a properly organised Labour element is for the benefit of the people.  That is why I make this statement and why I ask Labour leaders to look into this matter and to see to it that no men will be allowed to form a ring to keep out other men who are anxious to give a decent day's labour.  If any Labour representative wants particulars of these cases, I am prepared to give them to him.</P>

      <P>I will give them to the Minister, if he wishes.  I will have this letter placed in his hands, together with the facts of the cases in Sligo.  I am deeply concerned about these matters because they are doing more to hold up building and to give a bad name to the employers than anything else.  I said recently in Sligo that I was concerned with the cost of houses to the labouring man, that, on the basis of the pay at present earned by the labouring man, he is not able to pay the rent which has to be charged for the houses we are able to build. That is a matter which will have to be tackled because you cannot expect a man earning from £3 to £4 a week to pay £1 a week rent.  It is too high. I am not ashamed to say that it is something which should be tackled by the Government and that houses should be built which can be given to men of that class at a reasonable rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of this debate has been concerned with Dublin and most of the Deputies spoke about the need for houses in Dublin, so much so that I was nervous about intervening in the debate at all.  The cure of any ill is the removal of the cause.  There is a scarcity of houses in Dublin, but there is a scarcity of houses in the country, too, and the people in the country who are in need of houses see all this talk about the provision of houses in Dublin and they feel that nothing is being <Col N="1093" /> done&mdash;and, to a certain extent, they are right&mdash;to provide houses in the country.  If you give a man a decent house, he will not leave it, and, if the Minister would concentrate more on providing houses in the country, there would not be the same demand for houses in the towns and cities.  That, in my opinion, is the proper way to tackle the problem.  When you concentrate on the provision of the tens of thousands of houses in Dublin about which we have heard, the people in the country say to themselves: &ldquo;Why should we stay here?  There are thousands of houses available in Dublin, so we will go there.&rdquo;  Tackle the problem in the country.  A lot of lip service is paid to the problem of the flight from the land but you are going the wrong way about dealing with it.  Build the houses in the country and that will solve the problem.  Then you will not have people flying into the towns and cities in order to get houses.</P>

      <P>I want at the outset to congratulate the Minister on this measure. I notice that vast improvement in various directions is proposed under the Bill.  I have only one or two criticisms to make in regard to it.</P>
      <P>In regard to the floor space, which is now 1,250 sq. ft., and which it is proposed to increase to 1,400 sq. ft., I suggest that that could be further increased. That matter has been a bone of contention in regard to housing grants in the past.  Therefore I make the suggestion that the floor space should be further increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some months ago I raised the question of grants being paid for the same house twice.  I gave cases where people wanted to reconstruct houses for which reconstruction grants had been given 20 to 25 years ago.  Under existing legislation, these people could not get a second reconstruction grant. I notice that under this Bill there is <Col N="1094" /> power to make a second reconstruction grant provided that at least 15 years have clapsed since the date of completion of the erection of the house or of the reconstruction in respect of which a grant was made.  If I would be in order, I would put down an amendment that it would be at least 20 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another difficulty. Engineers recently rejected claims for reconstruction grants on the ground that the house was not fit for reconstruction.  The workers who applied for the grant applied for the erection of an additional room.  Simply because the house was not in good condition, the engineer reported that a reconstruction grant should not be given.  I will refer to that matter again in the hope that there will be some way out of that difficulty.  These people were advised by the Department to build a new house.  They cannot afford to build a new house.  Therefore, they have to remain as they were. If they were allowed to build a room on to the house to accommodate their families it would get them out of the difficulty, but great hardship would be imposed upon them by refusing a grant for that purpose on the ground that the house was not fit or not in conformity with the new instruction.  I would like to get that point examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is great difficulty in regard to the Small Dwellings Act and the question of loans.  The question of cost and title has held up the Kerry County Council over a long period.  There was a case the other day in the Killarney district where a man applied for a grant.  His solicitor submitted details in regard to title.  It appears that the man was a tenant on the Earl of Kenmare estate.  They went so far as to ask for the Earl of Kenmare's title.  That case was quoted by a member of the county council as one which <Col N="1095" /> required attention.  It was uncalled for, in his opinion.</P>
    <P>The question of legal costs is one of the major causes impeding the housing drive in this country in so far as small farmers are concerned.  I notice that, for the purposes of a reconstruction grant, the maximum rateable valuation is increased to £50.  I wonder could the Minister see his way to make that retrospective.  Many applicants, in the past couple of years particularly, were deprived of the grant simply because the valuation of their house was 10/- or 20/- over the £35 valuation. Certainly it was a hardship on them to be deprived of the grant.  I would be very grateful if something could be done in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Kerry County Council put up a proposal to the Minister's Department some time ago for grants for labourers to build their own houses.  I wonder if that can be done under this measure. The definition of &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo; is referred to in this Bill, but I would like to point out that some time ago we received a circular from the Department in regard to the definition of &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo; and it is somewhat restrictive.  According to that circular, a man could not qualify for tenancy of a labourer's cottage unless he is actually working for a farmer or working on the land. At least, that is the interpretation put on the circular by the Kerry County Council.  That is rather rigid and would exclude creamery workers, postmen and several other types of workers from being considered as eligible for tenancy of these houses.  I would like to have that position clarified and, if necessary, to have the circular amended so that there would be no doubt so far as local authorities are concerned in regard to the interpretation of it.  That circular was quoted recently at a meeting of the county council.</P>
    <P>I would like to get permission from the Minister, if it is required, to hand in an amendment or two not later than Tuesday next.  The Minister may see his way to accept an amendment to one or two of the provisions in this measure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1096" /> I realise that the Minister has tackled this Bill in the right way.  In this one important measure he has tried to clarify and adjust the snags and legal difficulties that were left over under all previous Housing Acts with a view to simplifying legislation and enabling the people to avail of the grants of which they were deprived through some technicality or otherwise in the past.  I congratulate him again on his efforts in this matter.</P>

      <P>It is a pity we have so little time to deal with this important measure.  While I am not prepared to speak in the superlative, as the previous speaker did, at the same time I recognise and am glad to see that this measure contains some important extensions of the existing code of housing legislation.  My approach to this matter is the same as that of Deputy Gilbride&mdash;the housing requirements in rural areas, and especially in so far as the problem affects villages and towns in the overwhelmingly rural constituency of West Limerick which I represent.  I am glad to see the extensions that are provided for in this Bill&mdash;for instance, the increase in the valuation limit for reconstruction grants from £35 to £50. I hope that that is only the prelude to the removal of valuation limits and the extension of such reconstruction grants, particularly in rural areas, to other sections who have not been able to qualify for them up to the present.  I should also like to see these reconstruction grants made available for people in small, urbanised towns.  I know several small traders and shopkeepers in small urbanised towns who cannot afford to undergo the expense of reconstruction their houses&mdash;of adding, perhaps, a room, of raising the roof or of doing some other reconstruction work of that nature.  The grant of £80 for reconstruction work will be a godsend, but I consider that the advantages of this scheme should be made available to these people also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another extension is the increase in the floor space limit from 1,250 square feet to 1,400 square feet.  Why is it, particularly where houses in rural areas are concerned, that we are continuing to have this floor space limit <Col N="1097" /> at all?  The amount of the grant made available for the erection of a new house is laid down specifically in the Act.  Building materials are now much more plentiful than they were three or four years ago or six or eight years ago and, with the flow of supplies becoming normal again, why should any person, particularly in rural areas, who wishes to build a new house be limited to any particular floor space at all?  The grant available is specified in the Act and the amount of the floor space of the house does not really matter except to the person who is building the house.  I do not know why the matter of the removal of that limitation in regard to the floor area should not be seriously considered and the grant made available for anybody who wishes to build a new house, leaving the question of maximum floor space to the discretion of the individual concerned.</P>
    <P>Another provision in this Bill which is certainly very desirable is that provision whereby a certificate of approval for a reconstruction grant can be issued after the work has started or even after it has been completed.  That is a welcome and desirable extension.  The matters to which I wish to refer are not really the provisions which are in the Bill but rather provisions which I should have liked to have seen included in it.  I am not in a position to put down amendments to have these provisions inserted in the Bill because the Ceann Comhairle would rule me out of order. The only thing I can hope for is that the Minister will listen favourably to my suggestions and deal with them on the Committee Stage.  In Section 16 of the Housing Act, 1948, and in the Second Schedule to that same Act, there is a provision whereby a special grant is made available for private persons erecting houses for their own occupation to enable them to install sewerage and running water facilities.</P>
    <P>When that Act was before this House I made an unsuccessful plea to the then Minister, Deputy MacEntee, to extend that provision to all rural dwellers.  I wanted it to cover all people whether they are building new houses or whether they are occupants of old houses.  I wanted that grant in respect of the installation of sewerage <Col N="1098" /> and running water facilities made available to all people whether they live in old houses or not, just as it is available for those who are erecting new houses.  Since then, a scheme has been announced by the Minister for Agriculture for the provision of running water in houses.  I think the whole matter should be co-ordinated and I think that the Department of Local Government is the proper Department to deal with it, because it should be available, not only for farm houses but for every type of house in rural areas. The Minister should consider that matter seriously between now and the Report Stage and consider the insertion of an amendment in this Bill to that effect.  As I say, I am particularly interested in rural areas and, anyhow, this matter does not arise very much in relation to urban areas, though it might arise in small towns and in certain urbanised towns.  However, in most towns of any size provision is made for sewerage and running water facilities.  The next matter I should like to see provided for in this measure also concerns rural dwellers.  Again, I am in thorough agreement with Deputy Gilbride when he says that we must start this at the foundation and that if we make conditions right in the rural areas we shall not have the same problem in the towns and in the cities.  The work of the provision of houses for agricultural workers, under the definition already provided in the Act, and the provision of houses in small towns and villages all over the country will be completed by the local authorities, as far as rural areas are concerned, within the next couple of years.  However, there is another class of people in rural areas for whom I suggest the local authorities should make provision in the future: I have in mind small farmers living in congested conditions on what are practically uneconomic holdings in my constituency in West Limerick. Limerick is supposed to be the Golden Vale but there are places in parts of County Limerick, particularly on the western fringe, which are as congested as some of the most congested parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister is familiar with the conditions down there and he must, therefore, realise that the people on those <Col N="1099" /> little holdings are not in a position to tackle the problem of building new houses for themselves.  This measure would be far more valuable if there were a provision in it whereby the local authorities would be enabled to tackle such building on the lines of the labourers' cottages scheme.</P>
    <P>The position may be different with regard to rents and matters of that kind.  I have come across recently certain rather pitiable cases of that nature where these smallholders are living under bad conditions.  They cannot do anything for themselves, even with the generous provisions that are available to them now in the way of grants or loans.  It is only right that the local authority and the State should come to the rescue in these cases.</P>
    <P>These are the only matters to which I wish to refer.  I am sorry we have had to wait so long for this measure and that we shall have to rush the discussion on it in the end.  Anything relating to housing is of the utmost importance to rural Deputies.</P>
    <P>I listened to a lot of talk about the position in Dublin.  It is admitted that the Dublin Deputies have a very serious problem to face in the solution of their housing difficulties.  In this connection the opinion of somebody who is outside that problem altogether and whose interests are completely rural, might be of some value.  The opinion I have, and it is the opinion of many others, is that the continued growth of Dublin is becoming a national menace.  In the development of housing in the future the question of the desirability of further extensions, pushing the city out further and further into the country, will have to be very carefully considered.</P>
    <P>Consideration might be given to some development of the central portion of the city from the point of view of the erection of flats.  Work in that direction has already been undertaken, and I must say that a very fine type of work has already been done.  I do not know the names of the streets or the areas of the city, but I have seen blocks of flats erected within the past 15 years <Col N="1100" /> in various parts of central Dublin, and I suggest that that is a type of development that should be continued more and more.  The extension of the city should be stopped in so far as it is possible to stop it, because it is really becoming menacing from the point of view of the interests of the country as a whole.  At the moment it is lop-sided, overloaded, over-populated.  That is the type of city that is developing at the expense of the country population.</P>
    <P>For what it is worth I make that suggestion.  In making it I am not at all anxious to interfere with Deputies who have a more direct interest in the city.  It is said that fools step in where angels fear to tread.  I am merely speaking as a country Deputy and I say that in the interests of the country as a whole this question of the further extension of the City of Dublin will have to be very carefully examined.</P>
    <P>The Minister is more lucky than his immediate predecessor.  He found when he came into office that the machine was ready and geared up for this important work that he is now continuing. We did not find that when we started in 1932.  The machine had to be created at that time, it had to be built up and there is no excuse now for any slackness or any delay in pushing ahead with this important work.</P>
    <P>I am sure we all wish the Minister God speed, and any help he may be anxious for from these benches in the solution of this highly-important problem in which we displayed so much interest when our Party was in office, will be given; whatever assistance and co-operation the Minister wants from us it will be willingly forthcoming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I am thankful for the generous reception that has been accorded to this measure by Deputies on all sides of the House. They seem generally to appreciate the measure for what it is.  It is really nothing more or less than a genuine attempt to remedy certain deficiencies or flaws which showed themselves in the course of the operation of earlier legislation.  The Act of 1948 was by no means an ungenerous Act, and I think it will be agreed that that <Col N="1101" /> measure has contributed considerably to the solution of the problem both from the point of view of houses built privately or houses erected by public authorities.</P>
      <P>Like most other things in this world, it is not perhaps the perfect machine, and I do not suppose that this measure, when it is completed, will be regarded as the perfect machine; but it is at least a genuine effort on our part to make good the chinks and the flaws that have existed in earlier Acts and to bring certain facilities from the point of view of housing within the reach of the people.  The scope has been widened in certain respects and we have endeavoured to cater for classes who were not covered by previous measures.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee started the debate on behalf of the Opposition.  Unfortunately, he made a point of harking back to a lot of petty little matters that I was hoping we had departed from.  I do not want any glorification for what has been or what is being done by this administration, nor am I anxious to hear any recriminations in relation to what was done by the last administration.  I have expressed the wish, and I was very glad to hear Deputy Traynor repeating it, that this matter ought really to be treated as a national matter requiring unified effort. These small petty things to which Deputy MacEntee referred, this harking back to what we did and what somebody else did, who did this and who did that and who shot Cock Robin &mdash;all that type of thing is not in the interests of a housing drive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy specifically reiterated statements claiming that the results achieved with the local authority housing campaign are the fruits of the preparatory work that was done by the Fianna Fáil Government.  He pointed out that if it had not been for what was done in his Government's time there would not be very much progress made either in Dublin or in other parts of the country.  The Deputy specifically mentioned Dublin City.  I will give some figures which no doubt will be of some interest in this connection. So far as Dublin City is concerned the sites in possession of the <Col N="1102" /> corporation in November, 1947, num bered 8,155; the houses built since November, 1947, numbered 2,838; there are 3,631 houses now being built and 5,734 new sites have been acquired. That makes a total of 12,203.  It might be well to note that more than 4,000 sites have been acquired by the Dublin Corporation since November, 1947.</P>
    <P>As regards the whole country, including Dublin, the sites in possession of local authorities in November, 1947, totalled 17,620; the houses built since then numbered 8,571; there are now being built 10,586 houses, and the new sites now acquired total 15,136.  Thus nearly 17,000 sites have been acquired in all areas since 1947; that is, sites for one quarter of the total local authority housing programmes.  I want to deprecate the continuous harking back by Deputies such as Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Butler.  Deputy Butler was merely re-echoing his master's voice.  Both Deputies repeatedly told us that if it had not been for the preparatory work carried out by their Government we might not have made a start at all.  The fact is that everyone is doing his bit in connection with this housing drive and those Deputies should abandon their childish by-play.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee described this Bill as a puny measure.  I resent that description.  It is a very unfair description of what is really a genuine effort to improve the housing code as we found it.  This is not by any means a puny measure; it cannot be so regarded.  It is a measure that will vitally affect all sections of the community. In this matter we are taking a big outlook and I must stress that it is not a puny measure.  It is taking down many of the barriers, many of the demesne walls in the country.  It cannot be considered a puny measure that will make available to our local authorities opportunities to build houses for many types of people who were excluded from the operations of the housing code up to now.  There is nothing puny in altering the rent restrictions as we are altering them to the advantage of people who will try to avail of our housing legislation. Neither is it puny if it makes it possible for people to get their houses <Col N="1103" /> more easily now, by going round if they wish with the grant in their pockets and buying from a builder without having to go through the old form of contract.</P>
    <P>These things cannot be regarded as puny and remarks of that type coming from an ex-Minister like Deputy MacEntee do not tend to constitute a good advertisement for this Bill&mdash;but I believe it will advertise itself anyhow. I think the Deputy would have been better advised if he had done the big and the decent thing and avoided coming in with that puny note of his in relation to a Bill that is not puny at all.</P>
    <P>There were several very interesting points raised by other Deputies and these will receive serious consideration between now and the Committee Stage.  For instance, Deputy McCann and other Deputies raised some interesting points in relation to finance.  I will say that if the financial provisions are not secure, then this Bill and the Bill we are working on will have no force, because if finance is not available, there is no use in talking about housing.</P>
    <P>So far as the Dublin Corporation are concerned, Deputy McCann must be aware of the discussions that the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, other members of the Cabinet and myself have had with the Lord Mayor of Dublin, the Chairman of the Dublin Housing Board and members of the Finance Committee of the Dublin Corporation.  Quite recently it was referred to by Deputy Byrne and others.  There was a perfectly satisfactory financial arrangement agreed to and the Lord Mayor and others felt quite satisfied that no barrier would be allowed to stand in the way financially of the Dublin Corporation or the country.  The money was provided on the best terms possible.</P>
    <P>I was asked by Deputy McCann to give some assurance as to the cost of repayment 15 years hence.  I could not make any prophecy, financial or political, in that way.  No one could tell the rate of interest 15 years hence. The Dublin Corporation were asking to <Col N="1104" /> have the money guaranteed for five years in advance.  The money of the State is not guaranteed for five years, as we work only from year to year; but an assurance was given in the most unequivocal terms by the Taoiseach that the solvency of the country would be behind the corporation in their housing drive.  It has not hampered or hindered the corporation in their work.  They have planned their sites and schemes in the knowledge that they will not be held up for want of money.</P>
    <P>On retrospection, this is a wide question in which I could not offer an open door.  There is a certain amount of retrospection in the Bill, but complete retrospection would be administratively impossible, apart from the financial aspects of it.  There are certain retrospective elements where we go back to 1947, but I could not go a further distance and give complete retrospection under all circumstances.  There must be limits to the scope of every measure.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCann said that Dublin would want more finances when the Bill becomes law.  It may not be a question of more finance but of speedier finance. Apart from the general guarantee of money being made available under the security of the Government, we will be introducing a new Housing Bill, making an alteration in the terms of the financing of housing, inside 12 months. That is not saying whether I am going to give more money or not.  It is a merging of the T.D.F. and the subsidy. This new form of financing housing will be introduced inside 12 months.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCann and others spoke on the landowners' racket&mdash;the best word to describe it, from the evidence adduced in this House.  Local authorities will have the right of compulsory acquisition and of having matters dealt with by arbitration.  That in itself will be one break upon it.  The other serious aspect of the question is the very heavy legal costs which have been cited in this House and which we are all aware of in the country.  We have already arranged to meet the Incorporated Law Society in the near future to deal with that matter.  Having regard to what has been said in this House and to the steps we are taking, <Col N="1105" /> we hope to put an end to the grave abuse and the hardship on the people who want to buy or build houses.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGrath spoke of urban authorities providing houses for the working classes.  He was worried as to the distinction between urban and rural.  The urban authorities provide houses for the working classes, the meaning of which has not been defined. The rural authorities provide them for the agricultural labourers, the meaning of which has been defined and has been frequently extended but is still limited.  The position under the Bill will be that the urban authorities can provide for the working classes and such others as they see fit, while rural authorities can provide in the same way as urbans.  The existing priorities for subsidy and T.D.F. will remain and will not apply to Section 16 houses, which will get nothing but an amount equal to the private grant.</P>
    <P>That means widening the scope and extent of operation of local authorities, and will leave it open to the local authorities to make further provision for agricultural labourers and others.  We are making provision now for Guards, soldiers and local officials.  These were barred before because of their pensionable employment. That is all wiped out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn spoke of the limitations on letting under the 1948 Act. The Bill is intended to meet the points the Deputy raised.  Apart from that, we have issued a second circular, arising from the Wexford worker incident. There has been some confusion about the priorities.  The term agricultural labourer is a very wide definition, but the first priority for agricultural worker is accorded to the man who works on the land, if he happens to have the same set of circumstances in family numbers and bad housing accommodation.  He would get priority over the man similarly situated who was a road worker.  That has been put in a special circular issued as a result of the decision given at Wexford.</P>
    <P>On the question of the reasonable cost of building and how it is to be de termined, my own suggestion is that a quantity surveyor employed by the local authority would be perfectly competent to say, even in advance from the <Col N="1106" /> plans, what should be the reasonable cost of the houses.  We must leave it to the local authorities who will get the moneys under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  They must have the right to say.  The appointment by local authorities of quantity surveyors will enable them to ascertain the cost of the houses.  They can then relate their loan to the cost, apart from the market value&mdash;which caused such a wide divergence in the past.  We tried to bridge the gap which existed before. We have reduced the deposit to £50. In doing that, I believe I am going to tap a new source of people and get them to build their own houses.  That will ease the burden on local authority housing.  Many people who have a fixed income and living up to it under a heavy rent would find difficulty in putting down £100, but the new £50 mark means that they will be giving a sufficient guarantee of good faith, as good as that of others who would put down £100.  We will thus widen the scope of those who are determined to own their houses.  The more we can bring in in that way, such as clerical employees and others, putting down the £50 and getting houses built for themselves, the more we will cheapen houses for local authority housing and do benefit to the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan spoke on the legal costs.  We are dealing with that in the best way we can.  It does call for attention and we hope to remedy the difficulty.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe spoke of ground rents.  Departments or local authorities cannot exercise any direct control on that, but we hope that the exercise by the local authorities of the powers given to them by Section 16 to acquire sites for private persons will be utilised to the maximum and to such an extent as to prevent exploitation.</P>
    <P>On the matter of utilising the combined purchasing system, it would be desirable to do that if it were possible. A certain amount can be done by having people grouped in utility societies.  We will look into the point and if advantage can be taken of bulk purchasing it will not be overlooked.</P>
    <P>On the Howth drainage question, Deputy Briscoe has accurately described the position as we know it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mrs. Crowley spoke of the reconstruction grants for vested cottages.  I still think that Section 8 is the best form of that. Under Section 8 provision is made for the second grant.  Sub-section (2) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A grant in accordance with this section may be made only in respect of the construction of a new roof or the provision of additional accommodation which involves an increase in the total floor area of the house and which, in the opinion of the Minister, will relieve overcrowding in the house.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think that is far enough to go in this matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dunne expressed some concern about Section 21.  He need not have had any anxiety about the classes he mentioned.  We are giving the county councils a whole new code and all classes of persons mentioned will be included.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Deputy Beegan spoke on the country slum question. The existing system of grants is being proportionately availed of in the congested districts.  The matter can be further considered by the 31st March, 1952, but so far there has been a heartening response from the congested districts for those grants.  He feared the same injustice might take place under Section 16.  The persons from whom land is to be acquired will have rights of appeal to the Minister against an order of the local authority.  The position is sufficiently protected at present. In the case of a person who may have a couple of cows providing milk <Col N="1108" /> in a particular district, that must be taken into account.  The matter can be decided in equity and the citizen has every protection that could be provided.</P>

      <P>Deputy Traynor spoke on the same thing.  I can assure him there will be no arbitrary use of those powers.  In the case where the acquiring of a site would cause grave hardship on the owner and perhaps loss to people locally, as in the case of milk, the local authority may have to go out further to look for sites.  Deputy Traynor also was afraid there would be an invasion of sportsfields.  He is pushing an open door there, as we believe in the provision of ample playgrounds and we have specified lungs for the city in that respect and we would be slow to allow any unnecessary infringement upon any sports grounds.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke says housing should be treated as a national problem.  It is news to me that it is not being so treated.  We have it operating nationally, through the representatives in the Dáil and the local representatives in county councils.  I do not think it could be a more national drive than it is. The Deputy also wants the £50 valuation increased.  When Deputy MacEntee was putting his measure through, raising it from £25 to £35, I asked him to make it £45.  He said that if he did someone else would want him to make it £50.  I have made it £50 and now someone wants it increased.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Keyes) Michael Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Keyes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Limerick City Management Bill, 1950, be read a Second Time.  In March last the Oireachtas confirmed a provisional Order to extend the area of Limerick City by the addition of approximately 3,000 acres.  The existing population of 42,987 is increased by approximately 4,700.  The corresponding population and members of the other county boroughs are as follows&mdash;in Cork City the population is 75,361 and the city council has 21 members.  Dublin City population is 506,635 and there are 45 members of the city council.  Waterford City population is 28,332 and there are 15 members of the city council.</P>
      <P>By reason of the extension of Limerick City the city council have requested that the existing city council of 15 members should be increased to 17 members, and the request was unanimous.  The number of members of a county borough council is not necessarily in exact ratio to population in comparison with other county boroughs and it does not necessarily follow that an increase in the area necessarily involves an increase in membership.  Each case must necessarily be considered on its merits regard being had to the views of the local authority.  As regards the local government electorate in Limerick City, the old city on the present register contains 24,954 local government electors and in the added area there are 3,501 local government electors so that the increase of two members sought by the city council is exactly proportionate to the increased electorate.  I consider that the request of the city council is quite reasonable and justified, and I commend the proposal to the House.</P>

      <P>There is one point I want clarified.  The Minister says that the membership of the city council will be increased under this Bill by two members.  I want to know how that increase comes about.  From what area will that representation be drawn? Is it the electoral area known as Limerick South Rural and Limerick North <Col N="1112" /> Rural?  Is it intended to have further legislation dealing with the representation of Limerick County Council? Will the electorate in these areas be entitled to vote for representation on Limerick Corporation and also on Limerick County Council?  The position appears to me to be involved.  This Bill gives two additional members to Limerick Corporation.  What is the position, then, as regards representation on the county council?  Will there be any subsequent legislation to deal with that matter?</P>

      <P>The aggregate amount of the nine Votes is £3,528,220, which represents a decrease of £191,310 on last year's Estimates.  Most of the Estimates show only slight variations from last year's figures, the only significant change being in the Garda Estimate, No. 30, which is down by £198,660.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1115" /> The main cause of the decrease in the Garda Estimate is that we are budgeting for a force of 7,116 as compared with 7,322 last year&mdash;a reduction of 206 men&mdash;and that last year's Estimates had to provide for arrears of pay increases from 1st November, 1948, to 31st March, 1949.</P>
    <P>The Prisons Estimate shows a decrease of £7,200.  The main cause of this is that we are making provision for a daily average of 560 prisoners as compared with 600 last year.  As a result it has been found possible to effect slight reductions in staff.  The District Court and Circuit Court Estimates show increases of £2,630 and £7,490 respectively.  These increases are due to provision being made for better salary scales for the clerks.</P>
    <P>The Vote for the Supreme Court and the High Court shows an increase of £1,260.  This is due in the main to normal salary increments and some staff changes.</P>
    <P>The Vote for the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds shows an increase of £4,080.  This is caused by provision being made for additions to the staff to deal with increased work in the Land Registry.</P>
    <P>I do not think that it is necessary for me to say any more in regard to the figures.  I should like to say a few words of general explanation, however.  In the first place I want to say a word about the Garda.  As the House is aware the Government suspended recruitment for the Garda pending examination of the question whether it might be possible, by reorganisation, to police the country effectively with a smaller force.  As I told the House when speaking on last year's Supplementary Estimate, a committee has been set up to consider this question and it is at present engaged on the task.  I hope that before the time for next year's Estimates arrives, I will be in a position to inform the House of the committee's recommendations and of the Government's decisions in regard to them.</P>
    <P>In regard to crime I am glad to be able to say that, although the crime returns are still very high, the figures for 1949 show a reduction.  In 1938 the <Col N="1116" /> total number of indictable offences reported to the police was 6,769.  The numbers increased rapidly during the early years of the war until in 1943 the peak figure of 17,305 was reached. Since then there has been a slow but steady decline.  The figure for 1949 was 12,242 as compared with 14,949 in 1948.</P>
    <P>In 1949 the police instituted 165,823 prosecutions for summary offences, as compared with 104,188 in 1938.  Of the total, 99,887 prosecutions were in respect of traffic offences, and 61,528 of these were for lighting offences. This big volume of summary proceedings wastes a lot of police time, and I should like to take this opportunity, if I may, to make an appeal to the public to observe the traffic and parking regulations which are made for their safety and convenience and not to cause themselves trouble and the State expense by making it necessary for the police to institute 100,000 prosecutions every year in an effort to enforce road safety.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to say that definite progress has been made towards improving the position of clerks in the Circuit Court and District Court.  As regards the Circuit Court officers it is proposed to give the unestablished officers an opportunity to qualify for establishment through the medium of a limited competition to be conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners and to admit to the competition all officers who, on 1st April, 1950, were between the ages of 18 and 65 years and who on that date had not less than one year's continuous service.  Of the 93 unestablished officers serving at present, 78 satisfy these conditions and will be eligible to take part in the competition. The remaining 15 officers cannot be considered for establishment for reasons either of age or of short service. Successful officers over 55 years of age on the date of appointment as a result of the competition will be appointed in an unestablished capacity.  All successful candidates whether appointed in an unestablished capacity or not will be placed on appointment on the appropriate scale at a point determined by their years of service, that is to say, they will be given credit for past service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1117" /> Deputies will not, I am sure, expect me to go into the matter in great detail at this stage.  In order, however, that the House might have some idea of what practical benefits will result immediately for the clerks concerned, I have had an analysis prepared which shows that for more than four-fifths of the clerks appreciable and, in many instances, substantial increases in pay will result from their appointment under the scheme.  About 16 per cent. of the clerks will get increases ranging from 4/6 to 20/- per week, 23 per cent. will get increases ranging from 20/- to 30/-, 16 per cent. from 30/- to 40/- and about 28 per cent. from 40/- to 56/- per week.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to make quite as categorical statement as regards the District Court clerks.  This much I can say however, that an arrangement has been reached under which a considerable number of the present unestablished clerks will secure established status and, in their case too, establishment will result for most of them in substantial increases in pay as they will be permitted to enter their new scales at points which will take account of their unestablished service. Legislation is necessary to implement the arrangement in the case of the District Court clerks and it will be ready for introduction early in the next session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration. At the outset, I want to congratulate the Minister on the fact that there is a reduction in the number of indictable offences.  Unfortunately, the figure is still very high compared to what it was in 1938.  It is probably due to the very large increase in the city population, or to something of that kind.  When I was on the other side of the House and had to present the Estimate, I generally referred to juvenile delinquency.  As I mentioned last year, when it comes to the police having to deal with crime of this kind, things would appear to have gone very far.  I think myself that the reform with regard to juveniles should start in the home or in the school.  I do not know what the position is at present about juvenile offences, but I hope it <Col N="1118" /> has improved.  I hope, too, that from now on it will improve still further.</P>
      <P>I hope that the motoring public and those who use bicycles will take notice of the appeal which the Minister has made, that they will be more careful in the observance of lighting and traffic regulations, and will not be causing the Guards, or users of the roads, so much trouble as, apparently, they are doing at present.  The position, in regard to offences of this kind, would appear to be rather serious and alarming, in view of the fact that it is necessary for the Guards to bring 100,000 prosecutions in a year.</P>
      <P>The sub-head for prisons shows a decrease of £7,200.  That is accounted for by a reduction in the number of indictable offences reported during the year.  The Minister did not say anything about the condition of the prisons.  When I was Minister, I had to listen to long appeals to me to do something about modernising the prisons, especially the Borstal institute. Deputies who were present during these years will remember Deputy Dillon, as he was then, appealing to me to do something&mdash;at least to provide a new Borstal institute so that modern treatment could be accorded to youthful delinquents.  The present Minister for Finance was also very eloquent in his denunciation of me for, as he said, degrading unfortunate people in Mountjoy Prison and allowing such appalling conditions as existed there. He wanted running water in every cell and all sorts of amenities which were simply impossible in an old prison like Mountjoy.  On another occasion&mdash;I think it was the last time I was responsible for the Vote&mdash;for hours we heard great condemnation of the Minister for not doing something about Sligo Prison.  Two Deputies who had been in Sligo Prison for a month spoke about the appalling conditions in this prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know something about Mountjoy Prison as I was in there on a couple of occasions.  I know that it required repairs. We had to break up that prison on one occasion, as well as the Belfast Prison on another occasion.  I know a lot about Mountjoy from the inside.  I was most anxious that we should try, if possible, to introduce some up-todate methods in the treatment of <Col N="1119" /> prisoners so as not to degrade them. Apart from the building itself, which presented a very big problem, one of the things I was most anxious about was to try at least to improve the dress of the prisoners, because I think the way some prisoners are dressed has a bad effect on them.  If they are not fairly well dressed, it has a depressing effect on them.  I did not get very far, but there may have been an improvement made since.  Before I left office we allowed prisoners who were serving long sentences to wear the new clothes that would be given to them on their release in the evening time and also on holidays and Sundays in order to try and restore some of their selfrespect. I must say I was disgusted when I heard of a speech made by the Minister during the by-election in West Cork about my activities and the waste of public money that I favoured.  The speech was not published and therefore I have to rely on the word of people who heard him.</P>

      <P>Recently, the Minister was speaking in County Mayo and his speech was reported.  Amongst the terrible things that the last Government were going to do the Minister said they were going to build a prison in Chapelizod which would cost £1,500,000.  The Minister shakes his head as if he did not say that. Members of my Party heard him say it in Schull.  When you have not a record of the spoken word you have to rely on the memory of those who were present. But the <i>Irish Times</i> reported a speech of the Minister's in County Mayo and put it on their front page. I have it here in case the Minister might be inclined to contradict me. He can take the matter up with the <i>Irish Times</i> reporter if it is not accurate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not put a figure on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure is given here.  Whether the Minister put a figure on it or not, it was an unworthy thing for him to say.  After all, this is a question in which we are all concerned. <Col N="1120" /> I was attacked in the Dáil during the war for not providing proper accommodation for unfortunate people who broke the law.  But I often said that if there was anything I could do to better the conditions I would do it.  Anyone who has studied prison administration or who examines it in an unbiassed way will admit that, short of making our prisons places outside which people would be queueing up to get admission, we have made tolerable improvements in the conditions.  It is too bad that a Minister responsible for the Department of Justice should attack me or the former Government because we did try to make some provision for the future.  As everybody knows, the first step you must take when you see building sites being taken up everywhere is to try and procure a site.  That is as far as we had advanced.  Whether we actually got the site I do not know.  I myself visited several places with the late Secretary of the Department and the official responsible for prisons to try and get a suitable site for a new Borstal institute.  We had to have regard to the convenience of the staff necessary for the running of that institution. Anyway, the Minister is reported in the <i>Irish Times</i> of 3rd July last&mdash;this bears out the report I heard except for the figure given&mdash;as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If he were to interpret Fianna Fáil policy as announced by the Party he could only come to the conclusion that it objected to this country's allocation of Marshall Aid being spent in this country&mdash;it would put the money in the bank or invest it in England to earn money for Britain.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Or perhaps,&rdquo; declared General MacEoin, &ldquo;Fianna Fáil would continue with this policy of capital expenditure&mdash;a new Parliament House costing £12,000,000, new Government Buildings costing dear knows how many millions to polish up the Castle, and £1,500,000 for a new jail at Chapelizod.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I say that that is an unworthy thing for the Minister to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not state here.  I must protest against the Minister making this sort of thing a Party issue.  I agree with what Deputy Dillon said when he was in opposition, that we ought to try to do what is in our power to alleviate the lot of unfortunate people who have to be imprisoned for social offences.  The Minister ought to keep off the line he has been following.  It may get a few odd votes down the country, but it is unworthy of a Minister of State to behave in that way.  I did not think I would have it in black and white.  If he had denied it like he denied the statement he was reported as making about my leaving festering sores, I would be in doubt about it, but it has been corroborated by the published statements. The general belief is that the Minister is saying that sort of thing and he ought to cut it out from this on.</P>
      <P>I now come to the question of the Garda Síochána.  I think the Minister and the Government are unwise in reducing the strength of the Garda.  Take Dublin alone.  The Minister on one occasion said that there were more Guards in Dublin City than ever. When I questioned him, he had to admit that there were fewer Guards. It must be six years ago that I received a very representative deputation from the Dublin Corporation on this question of the Guards in Dublin.</P>
      <P>There were Deputies and members of the corporation on that deputation, including members of the Labour Party. I told them that I would do whatever was possible and would ask the Commissioner to allocate some of the new recruits to Dublin City.  Anyone who knows the position in Dublin City is aware that the city is under-policed. There is no question about that.  I say to the Minister that that is false economy.  We are told, with some truth, that there is discontent amongst the Guards because of the increased work they have to perform in the city, due to the fact that they are under strength.  Money saved in that way is unwisely saved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that in the present world situation, when we do not know from one day to another what is likely to happen, that the Minister and the <Col N="1122" /> Government are badly advised to cut down the strength of the Guards in the country either.  I do hope, no matter what the commission decides, that they will keep their report in abeyance until at least the world situation has eased. I have the clearest recollection, after the descent of the first of the parachutists who came here, when we found his papers and discovered he was looking for particulars of landing places and matters of that kind, of having sent for General Murphy.  We went through this man's equipment and we decided there and then&mdash;we had only very short notice&mdash;to ask for the cooperation of all Parties in this House to set up the L.S.F., as it was then called.  Overnight that was done but that was only possible because we had in every part of the country a nucleus of Guards around whom the country could rally.  We all know the wonderful success it was but it could never have been established had it not been for the fact that we had in every part of the country a few Guards who were able to take charge of these units as they sprung up.  That served a twofold purpose.  There was an organisation in existence at the time, not a very big organisation, but the members were rather widely spread over the country, who were anxious to bring in one of the belligerents.  There was an eye kept on them as a result of how widespread the Guards were.  Also, if any parachute landings took place, we had even in the most remote parts of the country some representatives of the Guards.  I hope that whatever economies are contemplated in that direction they will not take place, at least until the world situation has cleared up.</P>
    <P>Apart from anything else, I think the Guards in a country barracks serve a very useful purpose for more than one Government Department.  The matter of non-police duties performed by the Guards has been mentioned several times.  I think that the Guards employed on what are called non-police duties are doing the work much better and more cheaply than it would be done if the Government had to employ special inspectors for collecting statistics and information of that kind. They are engaged in many activities <Col N="1123" /> connected with unemployment assistance, passports, travel permits and other matters which provide a convenience for the people generally.  Apart from that, we all know that the presence of Guards in remote country districts has very often resulted in brightening up these districts.  From a cultural and athletic point of view, they have been a great boon to different parts of the country.  Counties that were never heard of in Gaelic Athletic Association circles have sprung to the fore very largely as a result of the presence in these places of Guards who were good hurlers and footballers, and who could train teams.  That is something well worth remembering.  Along with that, the people always felt that they had some protection close at hand in case of need.</P>
    <P>The strength of the Garda is not the sort of thing on which the Government should economise.  This commission has now been sitting for some time and I think 12 months is a rather long period to wait for its recommendations.  I think that the Minister should hurry up its deliberations because there is some anxiety in regard to what these recommendations are likely to be.  He should not put the matter on the long finger because there is, as I say, anxiety amongst the Guards as to the form the recommendations will take. Some of them are rather afraid that they are going to reduce the strength of the force in country barracks, even if some of these barracks are not closed down.</P>
    <P>When in former years, some Deputies complained about Guards cutting turf, I had to point out to them that the Guards are not supposed to work 24 hours a day any more than any other person in the country, that they had time off and that if they used that time to cut turf or to engage in other activities of that kind, it was all to their credit.  If you are going to reduce the strength of any station below three Guards, and if you divide the 24 hours between them it will mean that each Guard will be on duty for 12 hours at a stretch and you do not allow one day off in the week.  That is not the sort <Col N="1124" /> of thing that is calculated to make them too content.</P>
    <P>Another question that is causing some anxiety is the matter of promotions in the Guards.  As we all know, it is a very big force.  I do not know what percentage of the Guards can ever hope to be promoted but it is a very small one, as the Minister knows. Therefore, I think when senior posts become vacant, the Government should not economise by not filling them.  I do not think I can be accused of advocating extravagance in making that statement.  I am informed&mdash;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong; this information may be a little too old but it would be correct up to a few months ago&mdash;that there has been only one promotion from the rank of sergeant to that of inspector in the last 12 months and that the last examination held for sergeants eligible for promotion was held in 1942 and that the last three vacancies that occurred&mdash;two for superintendents and one for inspector &mdash;were not filled for economy reasons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>They were not filled. That is the important point.  Perhaps the Minister when replying will be able to give me the reasons.  I have here the remark: &ldquo;bad economy&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would find that out.  I received this information from people who are watching closely and who had a hope of getting some promotion.  Another complaint I have is that, when a vacancy occurs, it takes six months to fill it.  These are grievances that cause a good deal of discontent and there should be some effort made to improve the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister brought in a pensions Order some time ago and he is to be congratulated on that.  It was something that should have been done in my time and whatever credit is due to him for doing what I did not do I freely concede to him, but I think he should press to have the four outstanding <Col N="1125" /> cases dealt with.  One man who has been writing to me gets £2 10s. 0d. a week.  He was injured on his way to work.  He was retired before this new Order was made and he is not covered by it.  He says definitely that when he produces his discharge papers they affect his efforts to get employment, as they show that he was discharged medically unfit.  There are only four of these cases and I do not think it is correct to suggest that, if the Minister makes the Order retrospective to cover these four cases, it would also apply to civil servants.  Guards are not treated as civil servants.  That point has already been established, if the Minister will look up the records.  When the increases in salaries were granted, it was held that Guards were not in the same category as civil servants.  I should like to point out that, if the present Minister for Finance has not changed his attitude since 1947, he reminded me then that the increases given to the Guards were miserable and that they should be quadrupled. He cannot have departed from that attitude very much since he became Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is that in 1947 we passed a Courts of Justice Act.  One of the principal matters dealt with in that Act was the reorganisation of the Circuit Court.  We provided for a President of the Circuit Court, who was to have the right to call on any circuit judge who had a light circuit to help in the circuit of another judge who was very busy.  There are some circuits, as everyone who knows anything about courts is aware, that are very busy.  There are others, on the other hand, that are very slack and I subscribed to the principle put forward by the present Taoiseach when he was on these benches that it was a bad thing to have either temporary judges or temporary district justices if it could be avoided.  In pursuance of that, in the Courts of Justice Act, 1947, we made permanent a Circuit Court judge who had been acting as a temporary judge, thereby increasing the number of circuit judges to 11, whereas the statutory number had been ten.  That power lapses when this judge's time is up and <Col N="1126" /> there will only be ten in the future. We hoped, with that extra power, the number would be sufficient to obviate the necessity of having any more temporary judges.  That was the whole idea.  I thought that that was a success and that it could be done.  Two thousand seven hundred less indictable cases were dealt with last year than we had the year before and it is the indictable cases that go to trial by judges.  That looks to me like a good reason why the Government should be able to do with the 11 judges but that does not seem to have worked out.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that a temporary Circuit Court judge was appointed some time ago and that the old procedure which we had adopted and which, as far as I know, had been adopted by the Government before us was departed from.  In our time a temporary judge was paid so much per every sitting day and when he was not sitting&mdash; no work, no pay.  There was an overriding maximum that he could not get more in any year than the full salary of a Circuit Court judge.  When there was no work to do for three months the Government actually put that particular person on full pay for three months.</P>
    <P>When the judge he had been acting for came back they kept on that temporary judge until a permanent vacancy could be found.  That is not good enough.  I know that he is very competent.  He is now a permanent judge and I am quite satisfied that he will be a great success.  He was appointed by the same process by which we always appointed judges when we were the Government and with which fault was found on the Opposition Benches, but, as I thought at the time, there is no better way to do it.  After all, the highest selection board in the country ought to be and is the Government, and you would get no better selection board anywhere. That is what we maintained and that is what this Government is doing.  The Minister will find it very hard to justify the appointment of temporary judges, with a decrease in the amount of indictable cases, with an extra permanent judge, with 11 judges where there were always only ten.</P>

      <P>We have plenty of time to deal with this thing as this is not like a debate on the Adjournment. Whether that document should have been given or not, whether it was proper procedure or not, although some Dublin papers applauded the Deputy who brought the matter up saying that he had performed a public service by doing so, there is a difference of opinion on that.  I think on the whole that it should not be done.  There are judges who would like to get all the information they can.  I do not think that it prejudices them and I think it may be to the advantage of the prisoner, but that is aside from whether it should be done or not.  During that adjournment debate I asked the Minister how many judges were concerned.  What I meant &mdash;and I think it could be clearly inferred from my question&mdash;was how many judges were in the habit of asking for these reports, but it may be that the Minister did not take it that way.</P>

In asking the question I meant to ask how many judges asked for reports but I did not say that clearly and I understand how the Minister said that there were 11, meaning that there were 11 <Col N="1129" /> Circuit Court judges altogether.  The Minister now tells us that he does not know whether what Deputy Lehane said was right or not with regard to the confidential document.  He does not know!  I say that in dealing with this matter he has shirked his duty. When a Deputy said that he had such a document the Minister had a right to find out whether he had or not.  Surely he had that duty, the duty of finding out whether it was possible for any judge who had been given one of these reports&mdash;and, as we find now, only a limited number of them did get these reports&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My view is that, on the whole, it is not a very good practice, but I am not going to give it all-out condemnation.  I have too much regard for the integrity of the judges to believe that they will be influenced to the detriment of a prisoner by any document given to them by a police officer.  If I did not think that, I would have very little respect for them. Although I am not a legal man, I know that it is not the judge who finds a <Col N="1130" /> man guilty or innocent; it is the jury does that.  If the judge brings into his summing up, or says anything which could be regarded as wrong, as Deputy Cowan said, the whole proceedings are vitiated.  It is the jury makes the decision, and, when there is talk about dodging, I say that I am trying to be as explicit as possible.  If I were a judge, I think I would do without these things, but I do not think it is very harmful.</P>

      <P>I do not agree.  So far as the sentence is concerned, when the case has been finished, it is the practice that the police say what is known about the prisoner, when he is convicted.  That, I think, operates more in the interests of the prisoner than in the other way.  If he happens to be a first offender, or if there are some unfortunate circumstances connected with the case, that practice may operate in the prisoner's interest.</P>

      <P>If I have not made my attitude to this procedure clear to Deputy Cowan, I do not propose to make it any clearer.  All I intend to do is to repeat that the Minister had a bounden duty, in my opinion and in the opinion of other people, to investigate this whole matter, and to find out whether the judge, in fact, did let this document out of his hands by his own volition or whether it was stolen.  My information is that it was stolen, either from the judge's pocket or from his office&mdash;and by a solicitor at that&mdash;and sent by post to Deputy Lehane.  In other words, it was stolen and the person who stole it can be described as nothing but a thief.  What can we say about the receiver?  The Minister, instead of expressing at least his disapprobation of that action, commends the Deputy who flaunts a stolen document in the House, and he ought to be ashamed of himself for doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter to which I want to refer in connection with a case tried in Naas.  It was a case of two rascals who attacked a widow's house in a place called Ballylinan, in County <Col N="1131" /> Leix.  This widow had two daughters and these men demanded admittance after the public house had closed.  They wanted to take part in some dance they thought was in progress there.  They got a month and I think they got too little.  They appealed and the appeal came before the Circuit Court in Naas. The judge who tried the case said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have rarely heard of a more blackguardly performance than that which took place on the night of 29th April or the morning of the 30th April outside Mrs. Davis's house.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I know my business a little better than that.  This case is not <i>sub judice</i> and that is what the judge said about these men.  The warrant was made out in the usual way and a dispute as to whether the warrant had been properly drawn up or not was set on foot to give Deputy T. F. O'Higgins an opportunity&mdash;and there are eye-witnesses of this&mdash;to get in touch with the Minister on the telephone. Inside one hour, the superintendent of the area got instructions not to execute the warrant.  That was bad enough, but what happened then? When the judge was getting into his car after dealing with the business of the court, to his amazement, the people he thought were <i>en route</i> to Mountjoy were standing on the footpath and they put their fingers to their nose.</P>

The Minister may have put the men back in jail since&mdash;I cannot say whether he has or not.  There is probably a petition before the Minister and it may be settled, but in any case that is not the way these things should be done. Before the court rose, an order came to the Guards not to execute the warrant and they did not do so.  If Deputy Davin has any doubt about it, he can find out very easily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one final matter I want to refer to which concerns Deputy Cowan.  I should say that it really concerns the Minister for Justice, but Deputy Cowan is involved. We all know that the Taoiseach is responsible for the Government of the country, but each Minister is charged with a special duty.  The Minister for Justice has the duty of seeing that public order is preserved and, so far as I know from the Constitution, there can be only one Army in this country, and whether the other <Col N="1133" /> body which this Deputy is trying to form, or has got some distance with, is called a volunteer force or otherwise, it ought not to be allowed.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach says&mdash;and when he was saying it he had his legal adviser listening in, and I am sure he got advice from his own advisers&mdash;that no illegal action was taken, that Deputy Cowan's action is not illegal.  People have come to me, who are every bit as competent legal people as any the Government has at its disposal, and they tell me that it is definitely contrary to the Constitution and specifically so to Section 6 of the Offences Against the State Act.  Whether it is or not, it ought to be made so.  If there is any doubt as to whether it is or not, it ought to be made so because, although we all know that Deputy Cowan is more or less playacting, some of the people that he may induce to take part in this volunteer organisation, as the Taoiseach calls it, may not be playacting.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach says he has no evidence that they are doing any military manoeuvres.  The Taoiseach must not be looking for evidence.  The Minister for Justice can easily find out, if he wants to, that these people are doing a certain amount of manoeuvring in the Phoenix Park, almost opposite the Garda Depot.  They have not, as far as I know, displayed any arms yet but, surely to goodness, we are not going to wait until they start to shoot. Is it going too far to say that this thing is not dangerous, that we have to wait till they start to shoot?</P>
      <P>Do not we all know that there is another organisation there which, naturally, is taking full advantage of all this?  We know it is.  I am glad to say that there have been no acts of violence since 1942.  Since the last Guard was murdered in Donnycarney, no Guard has been shot but is not this a dangerous movement?  Is it not possible that other elements in this part of the country may follow the Deputy's lead, people who would be far more dangerous?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say to the Minister that, in my opinion anyway, it is his duty to get the Government to make sure that this thing will not continue.  We have the <Col N="1134" /> F.C.A., if they want volunteers and soldiering.  As far as I can gather, it is not at full strength or anything like as strong as it ought to be.  Any young people who want to practise the use of arms have the F.C.A. there, if they do not want to join the regular Army.</P>
    <P>For goodness sake, this thing ought to stop.  I know the Minister's difficulty. He has not got a united Party behind him.  He has four or five Parties to please.  But, he has a fundamental duty, which he ought not to neglect.  There is no use in singling out Deputy Cowan and saying he is a sawdust Cæsar, as some papers said the other day, like certain people were when they started antics on the Continent. Small things like this often lead to very serious results.  The Minister is not entitled to take this thing complacently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The last point I want to make is this.  I think it is a bad thing to allow people not serving in the Army to have military titles.  I do not care whether they are on this side or the other side, whether it is Major de Valera, General MacEoin or Captain Cowan.  There is a danger in it.  I do not know whether they are legally entitled to carry these titles at all or not.  At the very least, it should be followed by the word &ldquo;Retired,&rdquo; such as &ldquo;General MacEoin (Retired).&rdquo; We know Deputy Cowan and we know what he amounts to.  We know very well.  I am not going to say, but we know him.</P>
      <P>People who do not know &ldquo;Captain Cowan&rdquo; think he may be a doughty warrior.  They think he may be a man who would actually lead his army from the front and not from behind and, in that way, when he attempts to start a volunteer movement or an army, he is more potentially dangerous than an ordinary civilian like myself would be if I tried to do it.  I do not know what the legal position is.  I have my doubts. I have grave doubts as to whether General MacEoin, as he is called, Captain Cowan and Major de Valera have any right to call themselves captain or major or general either. That should be dealt with.</P>

      <P>The only desertion was that by the Deputies opposite when they misled people like me into <Col N="1138" /> supporting them and then turned on the Republican movement which put them into office.  The Minister for Justice has been successful because to my mind, in the main, he brings two qualities to bear in the administration of his Department&mdash;(1) a broad charitable conception of human nature and all it means, and (2) plain ordinary honest-to-God commonsense.  I think I am being easy on his predecessor when I say that the charge I lay against him is merely that he did not possess the latter of these two qualities.</P>
      <P>I do not desire to inject heat into this discussion.  It was not started by me but by the Deputies on the Opposition side of the House.  Deputy Boland waxed very wroth at (1) the fact that the Minister for Justice did not condignly commit both myself and Deputy Cowan to Mountjoy Jail, and (2) because, in the opinion of Deputy Boland, the Minister had the appallingly bad taste to remedy a very vicious abuse that existed during the whole of the period of office of Deputy Boland.  I am not going to satisfy Deputy Boland's curiosity about confidential documents.  I am going to leave Deputy Boland and the Deputies opposite in a state of suspended animation as far as that goes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that, in bringing before this House notice of the fact that what, in the opinion of a vast number of the people and what, I submit was, in the eyes of the law, an abuse of the process of justice, I merely did my duty.  Were the same circumstances to arise again I would take exactly the same course as I took in connection with the documents to which Deputy Boland referred. Is it suggested&mdash;and Deputy Boland was evasive and refused to answer on this issue&mdash;that it is either correct, right or proper that behind sealed doors or by means of a secret document, a confidential report, the mind of a judge trying a prisoner on a criminal charge should be prejudiced or put into the position that it might conceivably be prejudiced in advance of the trial of that particular prisoner's case?  I submit that to permit such a practice to continue would in many cases negative the possibility of a person's obtaining a fair or proper <Col N="1139" /> trial.  It would mean that matter could be placed before the judge as facts which could not be tested by process of cross-examination.  In my view, there is very little difference between a document of that nature and the infamous <i>lettres de cachet</i> which were used in pre-revolutionary France.  Deputy Boland waxed wroth at the fact that I had the impudence and the effrontery to let the House know that this condition of affairs existed.  I make no apology to Deputy Boland or to anybody else for bringing that practice to light.  Presumably the Minister, in the view of Deputy Boland, is also deserving of condemnation because he ended the practice.  The only logical conclusion one can draw from that is that the practice is one which meets with Deputy Boland's approbation.  If that is so, I am prepared to leave the matter at that and let the people judge between us.  It would be far better for Deputy Boland to question his conscience as to whether his permission of this abuse during his tenure of office was responsible for any innocent persons being wrongfully convicted rather than come here to the House and try to make cheap, petty, political capital out of what he thought was a good point but which, when examined, can be dismissed as a point without any substance or foundation in fact at all. I am sorry to have wasted so much of the time of the House on Deputy Boland and his observations.</P>
    <P>There are one or two matters to which I should like to draw the attention of the Minister.  I am not quite satisfied that the position of the Irish language is safeguarded as well as it might be in the Garda Síochána force. I had occasion to draw to the attention of the Minister, by way of a Parliamentary question, the fact that the chief superintendent&mdash;an excellent officer in every way, I understand&mdash;in charge of an area comprising a very large portion of the Donegal Gaeltacht is unable to transact his work in Irish and that, as a result, the very desirable practice which had grown up amongst the Gardaí in that division of making their entries in barrack minute books and, in fact, of doing all their business through the medium of the Irish language <Col N="1140" /> has had to be discontinued.  It has had to be discontinued because the chief superintendent in the area has not a sufficiently competent knowledge of Irish.  I understand that otherwise he is an excellent officer.  The Minister may tell me that this is purely a matter for the Commissioner, but I suggest that it comes within the competence of the Minister to see that things are so ordered that the services of that excellent officer are utilised in some other district and that chief superintendents who are competent to do their work through the medium of the Irish language will be assigned to Gaeltacht districts.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I wish to refer and again I do not know whether it comes purely within the Minister's functions or those of the Government as a whole.  I think there is a statutory duty on the Minister and on the Government not to appoint a Circuit Court judge to any area in portion of which Irish is habitually spoken who has not got a knowledge of Irish sufficient to enable him to dispense with the services of an interpreter in his court.  The Government are bound by the terms of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, so to appoint, where practicable. I do not think it would be right to refer to specific cases, but I can recall one instance where the terms of Section 44 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, were not complied with both in the letter and the spirit.  I submit that it is the duty of the Minister to see that the terms of the 1924 Act are complied with in the appointment of judges to areas where Irish is the language of even portion of the people.</P>
    <P>A matter the Minister is often troubled with is the transfer of Guards.  The Minister, I understand, takes up the attitude that this is something peculiarly within the competence of the Commissioner, and is something over which he has no control. That may be, but I would like to underline for him the fact that there are many cases where Garda personnel, married and with families, anxious to educate their children, have been refused transfers to stations where better educational facilities would be available, and they have <Col N="1141" /> been refused even when alternative arrangements could be made without any disruption of the force, or any undue hardship on members of the Garda.  I think to leave these matters purely to the Commissioner, who is bound to take a rather rigid and probably semi-military line in the regulations, is unwise.  I suggest where grievous hardship is occasioned to Garda personnel or their families the Minister should have power to step in and see that whatever facilities can be given to them without any undue dislocation should be so given.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister, in the course of his opening statement &mdash;I was not here for the beginning of it&mdash;made any reference to the committee charged with the revision of the Circuit Court rules, or whether a report has been received from that committee.  I will be glad if the Minister will give us some indication in that connection.  There are one or two minor anomalies existing, some of which have been pointed out to the committee and some to the Minister himself, and these should be remedied, if they have not already been recommended for remedy by the committee.</P>
    <P>There is one thing in particular and, though it is a minor matter, it is one capable of causing hardship on individuals, hardship that can be alleviated. No provision was made in the rules for a proper period of time in the case of witnesses summoned on subpoena to the Circuit Court.  Cases crop up where witnesses receive a summons, with which they are bound to comply, sometimes eight, ten or 12 hours before their presence is required in court.  I know of one case where a man complied with a summons. He lost his employment and has been unsuccessful ever since in obtaining fresh employment.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by Deputy Boland to the need of better Borstal facilities, better accommodation and better treatment for youthful delinquents. Strange as it may seem, on this point I find myself in complete agreement with Deputy Boland.  Were more attention paid to the treatment given to youthful delinquents, perhaps there would be less trouble in dealing <Col N="1142" /> with our prison population.  In that connection, I think the Minister deserves to be congratulated on the fact that our prison population is probably the lowest in the history of the State.  This is one Department in respect of which I find it difficult to find points of criticism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The outstanding fact in this debate so far is that when Deputy Boland made the charge against Deputy Lehane of stealing a confidential document, Deputy Lehane did not deny that, and that is the only issue involved.  Any argument about whether a certain form of procedure is the right kind of procedure or not has nothing to do with the case.  The fact is that a document was stolen, and that was covered up by the Minister who, incidentally, has done a grave injustice to the 11 judges involved, because it attributes to some one of them the breaking of a confidence and giving that document to somebody he was not entitled to give it to.  The issue is whether the document was stolen, or whether the judge broke confidence and handed it out.</P>
      <P>The Minister might inform us, when he is concluding the debate, whether he has been able to do anything about better housing for the Guards.  Now, when we are moving from the housing debate to this debate, housing is fresh in one's mind.  If a housing scheme for the Guards were prepared, it would be a tremendous advantage and it would be easier for the Commissioner to move Guards about, if he wants to. This problem arises in every debate and, now that a housing move is being made, it would be a very timely thing and a very good opportunity to try to solve that particular problem to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Juvenile crime is exercising people's minds to a considerable extent at the moment.  It is true that by the time juvenile crime comes before the public, it is at the end of a series of causes. Have the Minister and his Department ever considered the advisability of inquiring into the causes and the development of juvenile crime?  I know that this is something which impinges, too, upon other Departments, such as the Department of Education and, possibly, <Col N="1143" /> the Department of Local Government, because of the necessity of having other things built as well as houses.  Houses are being built to a considerable extent at the present time.  New housing areas are springing up.  We all know the trouble that arose in some of the big housing schemes in the past where there were no facilities for the children and where they could not be properly looked after.  It is undoubtedly an important matter to provide these facilities because when children start on a career of crime they eventually create a criminal society when they become adults.  It is then too late to deal with the problem.  For that reason, I think a very searching inquiry and examination should be made into the causes in an effort to find out whether there is any effective remedy.  This might be done by way of inter-departmental committee since, as I have pointed out, other Departments are affected to some extent.  It should be the aim of this committee to stop the evil at its source.</P>
    <P>Road traffic undoubtedly creates a great problem at the present time.  The number of motor car owners is rapidly increasing.  Accidents are becoming greater in number.  The Minister did not give us the figure for this year.  He did give the figure for last year.</P>

      <P>I think there were 200 last year.  One must admit that driving is rather reckless on the whole in this country.  I was in London recently and I was travelling in a car driven by an Irish doctor.  He told me that if he were in Dublin he would be afraid to drive a car.  Apparently, people in London have to be much more careful because of the density of traffic.  To a considerable extent the people here have not yet come to realise that our traffic is just as dense in its own way and almost as concentrated as it is in other big centres of population.  I think the Minister would be well advised to carry out extensive propaganda for the purpose of warning people to take great care when driving. I had the tragic experience myself of coming upon the scene immediately <Col N="1144" /> after a very pitiful accident had occurred on the Bray road.  Perhaps I am going somewhat outside the scope of the present Estimate, but I do think that particular road requires some improvements in order to make for better traffic and to prevent such accidents occurring.  It would be a big step forward if Gardaí could be put on point duty on certain parts of that highway. Deputy Boland has pointed out that we have not a sufficient number of Gardaí at the moment, certainly not in the City of Dublin.  The number should be increased, even if only for the purpose of putting men on point duty at these danger spots.</P>
      <P>I think a certain amount of publicity was done by Deputy Childers when he was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government.  I think there was a certain amount of propaganda over the radio.  The Minister for Justice should continue that campaign and do all in his power to remedy the present position in view of the abnormal increase in the number of cars on the road.</P>
      <P>With regard to the jurisdiction of the District Court, I hope that the Minister will deal with that matter and take some steps to increase the present jurisdiction.  I do not wish to say any more on that point at the moment since it is a matter of legislation and not administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to go after Deputy Cowan but I think it would be better to hear what he has to say first as to his justification for his extraordinary antics.  He should be careful.  If he encourages young people to become militarily-minded in regard to this question of dealing with Northern Ireland, very tragic results may follow which he himself would regret more bitterly than anybody else.  There can be only one authority in the State in control of military activities.  Surely Deputy Cowan must realise that for himself.  That authority is the Government under the democratic control of the Dáil and the people.  No matter how good the object may be, any other military force extraneous to the authorised force may lead to tragedy in the future.  It is not as if we were talking in the abstract.  We have all had <Col N="1145" /> tremendous experience of that particular situation in the past.  No Government wants to be placed in the position of having to deal with a problem like that in the future.  We are all glad to see different people coming in here to take part in a constitutional movement. We ourselves, after the civil war, had to adopt the attitude of coming into the Dáil and accepting the situation as it was.  We are not surprised, therefore, to see others now following in our footsteps.  There is no resentment or bitterness in our heart but if certain people make charges against us of having taken life unjustifiably during the period of the emergency, they must expect to get their answer; the answer is that it had to be done because we might otherwise have been plunged into a war on one side or the other and what was done then was done for the protection of our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>No one is charged with that.  In opening his Estimate, the Minister referred to 12,000 indictable prosecutions in the last year and pointed out that that represented an increase of approximately 5,000 over the figure for 1938.  Now that may look serious.  Deputy Boland dealt with it as if it were serious and to some extent the Minister himself suggested that it was serious.  My interpretation of the statistics does not bear out the seriousness of it at all.</P>
      <P>It has been my personal experience over the past ten or 12 years that counsel are becoming more and more proficient in framing indictments and, where one charge would have sufficed ten or 15 years ago, there are now five or six charges.  It would be interesting to have a comparison if the Minister would give the number of persons charged rather than the number of charges on which they were indicted. Every time a person is now charged, he is charged with stealing, breaking and entering and stealing, breaking and entering and receiving; and the ingenuity of State counsel can even go beyond that in respect of a single offence.  I think if it is examined in that way, the volume of crime in the country is not bad at all, and I think we ought to congratulate ourselves that it is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1146" /> When judges go to the country to open Circuit Courts, there is some old tradition of presenting them with white gloves which is, of course, a fiction and a fraud.  They are not presented with the gloves, and it is very doubtful whether the gloves they are given to hold for a few minutes are white.  Probably there is an origin for that sort of thing.  I think it is all codology, and that it ought to be done away with. There is no sense in it.  When they go through this fiction, the judge swells out his chest and he congratulates the Guards on their magnificent efficiency, and it is because they are so efficient that the people of the district have not committed any crime.  I think that is an insult to the people of the country and should not be tolerated.  If the people have committed no offence, they have committed no offence because they do not want to commit an offence and not because of the Guards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

      <P>The Guards are efficient.  If a crime is committed they are so efficient that they will bring the criminal to book, but if there is no crime, and if there is anybody to be congratulated, it ought to be the people themselves and not the Guards.</P>
      <P>On this particular point of summary prosecutions, I think we have too many of them.  It is very hard for the ordinary, decent person in the City of Dublin to move around without breaking some law or some by-law or committing some offence.  In fact, in some parts of the country it is an offence to have a sense of humour.  Down in the County Limerick recently there was a gentleman who had a few drinks in. He was not drunk, and he was in at the market.  He took his horse out of the cart, got into the shafts himself and ran up and down the street a few times singing.  He was summoned for doing that, and not only was he summoned but he was convicted of impersonating the horse.  Now, if there was any sense of humour either in the Guard or in the district justice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In the neighbouring County of Clare, at Ennis&mdash;I have been there only a few times: it is not a town in which there is as much traffic on the footpaths at 10 or 11 o'clock at night as you would see in London or New York&mdash;a few lads went and bought a few pence worth of fish and chips, which they ate on the footpath.  They were up on the following day and charged with obstruction.  I think there is no sense in that sort of work at all. The Minister knows nothing about it until he reads of it in the <i>Evening Herald</i> or the <i>Mail</i>, but that sort of work has been done in the far recesses of the West.</P>
      <P>I think that, generally speaking, it would be a good thing if the Guards would exercise a certain amount of discretion, that, where they come across some petty or summary offence, they would give a few words of advice to the person concerned on the spot.  If they were to do that, it might be ten times as good as having those persons hauled up before a district justice and fined a shilling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find the same thing in Dublin in regard to what is known as juvenile delinquency.  I appear frequently in the Children's Court.  Long ago, in my young days, if a person boxed the fox or, as they call it now in the courts, stole some apples, well, if he was caught he got a cuff on the ear, and if it were known that he did any damage his <Col N="1148" /> parents were told and he got some punishment.  Similarly, if he happened to be passing a shop and was attracted by a nice display of sweets and took a few bars of chocolate, he was dealt with on the spot and reported to his parents.</P>
    <P>In Dublin the time of the Guards is taken up dealing with these little things as if they were the most heinous crimes.  The child is brought to the Garda station.  The mother is brought there and all the paraphernalia of warning and caution is gone through. Statements are read out, charges are prepared and the charges are brought before a district justice.  Fortunately, we have in Dublin, dealing with the juvenile court, one of the finest district justices in Europe, but that does not mean that he has not to have before him, day after day, those types of offences.  I would suggest that, probably in consultation with the district justices and the Guards, there might be a toning down of these footy little charges.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland in the course of his speech, referred to the observations of a circuit judge, when he was sentencing prisoners or confirming a sentence of one month's imprisonment on prisoners and when he called them blackguards. Not long ago there was the case of a man and his wife at Navan, one of those cases that arise frequently in the country.  The district justice, a very sensible and experienced justice, heard the case and came to the conclusion that the wife was at fault and refused to make an order for maintenance. There was an appeal which went to the Circuit Court.  The Circuit Court judge in open court said the husband was a blackguard, a scoundrel and a ruffian.  Now, that is bringing the administration of justice into contempt. Here was a judge and a district justice, one giving his view about the husband, and the other expressing his view about the wife&mdash;both opposite views.  Well, both of them cannot be right.</P>

      <P>These are things we must take notice of.  There is too much bandying around of epithets of that description&mdash;blackguard, scoundrel, villain, ruffian.  If a person commits an offence, the law says what the punishment is, but the law gives no right or sanction or authority for that type of abusive language.  I only hope that whatever little efforts I can devote to stopping it will stop it. There is growing up gradually a new form of tyranny, the tyranny of the Bench, and the sooner that tyranny is stopped the better for the country. Decent, respectable persons who attend as witnesses either for the prosecution or the defence or who attend as accused persons are very frequently offensively attacked and the only redress they can have is for some person in this House to mention the matter.  The law of this country gives judges powers and, in the exercise of their judicial functions, they are absolutely independent.  But, when they go outside their judicial functions and make offensive attacks <Col N="1150" /> on citizens, they are doing something for which they have no protection in this House or elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister has set out a programme of reorganisation of the Garda.  With the development of modern methods of crime detection and modern methods of travel, the old system of Garda barracks in particular places is not necessary.  What is required is probably more concentration of the force, more technical development, more speedy methods of getting around and, if the Minister succeeds by his reorganisation in bringing that about, I think he will. be doing a very excellent job of work If I might say so incidentally, the Garda as a force are to be complimented on the magnificent progress they have made in all the new technical methods of investigating and detecting crime.</P>
      <P>Reading as I do from time to time reports of police activities in other countries, police methods of detection and presentation of cases I think that our Garda force can hold their own with the very best in the world; in fact I would say they are much better than quite a number of them.  In the short period of less than 30 years since this State was established, it is a magnificent thing to have achieved that measure of success in the efficiency of our Gardaí.  I might also say that, for a force that was for many years badly paid and, in my view, not yet sufficiently well paid, there has been a marked absence of anything in the nature of corruption, notwithstanding all the temptations that there have been in the way.  The personnel of the Garda force are magnificent, honourable individuals, and every privilege that could be given ought to be given by the Minister, and I know that that would be the Minister's wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the City of Dublin the Garda are doing a magnificent job, particularly in the constituency I represent, in regard to the protection of children going to and coming from school in the morning and evening and during the lunch hour break.  They are doing that job well, doing it with humanity. It certainly is a pleasure to see the way in which they handle those numbers of children and to see the <Col N="1151" /> bonds of affection between the Gardaí and the little children as they cross the street.  I think that is a great thing, because the tradition in this country was that the people were against the forces of law and order. It is a grand thing that that new spirit of co-operation is developing right from the time at which our city children start going to school.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Minister on occasions to provide a Garda station in the North Wall-East Wall area.  It is a very big area; it is heavily populated, and the people down there wish that there should be made available for their convenience, because of the innumerable things about which they have to consult the Gardai, a station in that area.  I hope the Minister will see his way to establish a station there in the near future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland, before he concluded his speech, made certain observations in condemnation of the Minister because the Minister will not break the law in regard to the new volunteer force that has been established.  That new force, I am happy to tell Deputy Boland, and I am sure he will be glad to know it, is growing very much stronger day after day.  The significant thing about it is that it has increased substantially in strength since it was subjected to certain criticism by Deputy Boland in the country and by his Leader in this House.  I listened with amazement to the observations made by Deputy Boland.  I forgive Deputy Boland.  If Deputy Boland knew the effect of his observations, I am quite sure he would not make them.</P>
    <P>The difficulty with Deputy Boland is that he has an unfortunate past which he tries to justify on every conceivable occasion.  No Minister likes to have to enforce the law to the extent that it may lead to the execution of an individual and most Ministers who might be in that position, if the necessity ever arose, would have to express, and would express, their very deep regret that the onerous responsibilities of their office placed them in that position. Deputy Boland, instead of adopting that line, sadistically gloats <Col N="1152" /> over the fact that he had to enforce the law in a particular way.  A man with a mentality like that is not worth answering.  It is shocking that the affairs of this country, the very serious affairs of justice, were in his hands for such a long period at such a vital stage.</P>
    <P>Every person in the country welcomes the change of atmosphere that we have in the country.  Even on the buses, in the public-houses, when people talk their minds you will hear them say: &ldquo;Well, MacEoin is a decent man.&rdquo;  I think there is nothing I can say that would be more appreciated by the Minister for Justice than these expressions of his fellowmen.  He is a man with a broad humanity.  When he is asked to review a sentence of imprisonment, when he is assured by responsible people that the person who committed the offence was a decent person belonging to decent people, that he unfortunately broke the law and forgot himself on a particular occasion, the Minister for Justice approaches that from a humane point of view and, being satisfied that the ends of justice have been met, and that there will be no recurrence of the crime so far as that individual is concerned, he endeavours to release that person from prison.  Is that not what all of us would like to do?  For acting in that humane way, he has been subjected to criticism in this House and outside it.</P>
    <P>It is a grand thing that we can now live in freedom.  It is a grand thing that we can express our thoughts in public without the fear of being placed in prison or an internment camp.  It is a grand thing that people, whether they are State officials or local government officials, can now express their views, whether they are for or against the Government.  I think the Minister for Justice will have more respect for them if they express their views honestly against the Government than if, in order to curry favour, they express views in favour of the Government. This is the third Estimate the Minister for Justice has introduced.  I am proud to belong to a House in which General MacEoin is the Minister for Justice.  I hope that most of us, if not all of us, will be here for many long years to welcome the introduction of <Col N="1153" /> his Estimate because we can be assured that under his administration there will be a gradual improvement down the years and that this country, through the instrumentality of the present Minister for Justice, will go forward in the way this country ought to go forward&mdash;in decency, in courage and in respect for one another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The last time I spoke on the Estimate for this Department was two years ago.  On that occasion, I dealt with many aspects of the administration of the Department of Justice. On this occasion there are quite a few matters to which I wish to refer but I hope I shall not detain the House longer than is necessary.  I should like first of all to challenge some of the statements made by the Minister in his opening speech, one in particular in regard to the Garda Síochána.  He said that there is machinery in operation which will alter the organisation of the Garda with a view to decreasing its strength and to see if it is possible by reorganisation to police the country effectively with a smaller force.  When I spoke two years ago I made reference to the fact that Gardaí in some small stations are obliged to remain on duty for unduly long hours.  I do not think that situation has altered.  I do not think that under any reorganisation of the force it should be found necessary to man outlying stations, whether they be in the suburbs of the city or in the heart of the country, with fewer Gardaí and so perpetuate the unfortunate practice that has grown up for I do not know how long of compelling Gardaí to do duty at stretches as long as 24 hours.  I instanced on that occasion two years ago an occasion on which I had to make a phone call and I was amazed to find that the Garda whom I found on duty at some time around 2 o'clock on a Sunday afternoon had been on duty for practically 24 hours continuously. That, I am told, occurs regularly in stations in which there are very few Gardaí on duty.  Therefore I would ask the Minister, in any reorganisation of the Gardaí, in the interests of humanity and in the interests of the health of members of the force to have the situation examined with a view to devising some <Col N="1154" /> system whereby Gardaí will not be left on duty for unduly long periods.</P>
      <P>One other matter to which I wish to refer is the question of the housing of married Gardaí, when accommodation is not available for them in the local barracks.  Gardaí as a general rule get a fairly good housing allowance but unfortunately the type of house that they seek is not on the market to any liberal extent.  There is some regulation which precludes Gardaí from occupying local authority houses. There are many areas in the country in which there is little or no building done of a nature which would permit the Gardaí to rent houses.  I suggest to the Minister that whatever regulations preclude Gardaí from occupying local authority houses should be reviewed and abolished if necessary in order that such houses may be made available for renting by Gardaí.</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us that the long-awaited reorganisation of the Circuit Court staffs has now been completed and that the scheme, or whatever form this establishment is to take, is only awaiting the implementation of some scheme with reference to District Court clerks, before being brought into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Circuit Court scheme is ready to go on.  It has not to wait.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister what form this scheme is going to take, so far as this House is concerned. He stated that it is not a matter for legislation, so I presume he will bring in an Order.  The unfortunate thing I see about that is that when the Order is brought in the Minister will present to the House a <i>fait accompli</i> and the ordinary Deputy will have no opportunity of putting in amendments as he would have on a Bill and the Deputies who have legal experience and who would consider themselves competent to make suggestions that would better this scheme will be precluded from so doing.  All they can do is to speak for or against it and, if they are not satisfied, vote against it, but in so far as, I am sure, it will be a considerable improvement, <Col N="1155" /> no Deputy will vote against the Order the Minister will bring in to improve the conditions of Circuit Court staffs.</P>
      <P>Therefore I take this opportunity of bringing to the Minister's notice a few things which should be borne in mind in dealing with these staffs.  The duties of these officials are most complex and they require to be almost experts in many branches of law.  In many counties the county registrar is not only county registrar but local registrar of titles, local registrar in bankruptcies, local registrar in probate, registration officer and taxing master for costs.  It is hardly likely that any Government or Minister would expect the county registrar to perform all the duties associated with the individual functions he is supposed to supervise and he must of necessity therefore delegate many of these functions to his staff.  I will just take the one instance of the Circuit Court officer who must deputise for his county registrar in court.</P>
      <P>In many counties the duties in court for the official, be he county registrar or clerical officer attached to a certain court office, are very onerous and I suggest that if this scheme does not make adequate provision for the remuneration of these men who must perform duties which any man in the clerical grade could not be expected to perform the Minister should now or in some future provision arrange to give them a remuneration commensurate with the duties they perform in court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any man here who has experience of court work will know that on certain days when equity matters or other matters of a short nature such as licensing applications are before the court the official in court who acts as registrar has to enter in the minute book of the court orders which are in many cases up to 50 a day.  I do not say that that happens every day but there are several days in the course of their lives as acting registrars in the courts on which their duties are not only onerous but are very highly responsible. I can bring to mind cases where the orders as entered by these officials in the court book and as they have appeared afterwards in engrossed form have been challenged by solicitors <Col N="1156" /> on one side or the other, and these officials with their limited knowledge of law had to stand over the orders entered in the book and engrossed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephTimoney" hpid="Mr. Timoney Mr. Timoney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>There would not be 50 in a day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Not every day, I admit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephTimoney" hpid="Mr. Timoney Mr. Timoney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>Not any day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak from personal experience.  I know that it has happened in the court with which I am most familiar, the Circuit Court in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephTimoney" hpid="Mr. Timoney Mr. Timoney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the quickest judicial procedure I ever heard of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Since Deputy Timoney challenged my word&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephTimoney" hpid="Mr. Timoney Mr. Timoney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not challenge your word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I will instance how this thing can happen.  On the opening equity day Cork Circuit Court can have 30 applications for payment out of court to minors who want money for specific purposes before attaining full age, or having attained full age, and then there may also be licensing applications which, as the Deputy knows, occupy only a few minutes in court.</P>
      <P>There are other matters of a similar nature which mean that in the short hours of sitting, from 10.30 to 1 and from 2.30 to 5 as a rule, one has as many as 50 matters a day, at least in the court with which I am associated. I acted in this capacity myself and I did not consider myself adequately paid for the services I gave to the State and now that I am no longer in that position I may speak on behalf of the people who are doing that work now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have mentioned the payment of moneys in Circuit Court offices, I might mention to the Minister a thing which I know has been lying unattended for many years since the British time.  In almost every Circuit Court office throughout the country there are thousands of pounds lying in endowment accounts.  Nobody knows who the beneficiaries are, where they have gone to or whether they will ever claim it.  These moneys are lying; <Col N="1157" /> there to the credit only of a name. Therefore I would ask the Minister to have the accumulation of these moneys examined to see if he could conduct some kind of investigation into who the people are who are entitled to them and, if they are not found after a certain period, the moneys should be put to better use. I am sure that the Minister will find that what I said is correct and that there are several thousand pounds in every Circuit Court office in the country.</P>
    <P>There is one other officer in the service of the court to whom I should like to refer.  He is often spoken of in rather contemptuous terms and it is for that reason that I specifically advocate his case on this Estimate. I refer to the court messenger or what he is sometimes called the court bailiff.  These men perform very distasteful duties and the Minister must know that their salaries are certainly a disgrace to the nation they serve. Everybody knows that at some stage in the course of the administration of justice execution orders must be carried out on unfortunate defendants. It is only just that that should be done; otherwise people to whom money is owed would never get it. These court messengers are sent after the unfortunate defendant who has defaulted and they must either call week after week to collect a shilling or go to the extreme of putting a man's furniture out on the street in the case of an ejectment.  It is only by these means that the demands of the law will be finally met and satisfied.  Often these men must work for as little as 10/- a day and if the Minister has not taken them into consideration now I would ask that something should be done for them in his reorganisation scheme.</P>
    <P>As far as the District Court is concerned, the Minister has informed us that a scheme which will better the conditions of the staffs in District Court offices will come before us by way of legislation and therefore I will get an adequate opportunity of putting my views before the Minister then.</P>
    <P>The last time I spoke on this Estimate I also advocated that some effective system for free legal aid for poor <Col N="1158" /> persons should be started in this country.  In England they have a very generous Act from the point of view of the types of people and the types of cases that are met by free legal aid.</P>
    <P>In this country, it is limited to cases of murder, and I suggest that the Minister should take immediate action to see whether he could not extend, to some extent at least, the scope of free legal aid in this country.  I have seen people accused of crime, whether serious or otherwise, coming into court and listening to a long list of indictments. Anybody who has listened to these indictments knows that it is difficult for even the experienced practitioner to differentiate between the various forms of indictment referring to a single criminal act.  These people, when unrepresented, plead guilty, parrot-like, to every indictment on the sheet, whereas, in many cases, they may not be guilty at all.  The judges, of course, have regard to the fact that they are not professionally represented but I suggest that, if they were, that if they could afford to employ a solicitor or solicitor and counsel, in many cases these people might be able to prove, if not that they were innocent, that there was some defect in the indictment, which facility, at present, is reserved for the man who can afford to employ solicitor and counsel.  I know that the Minister will say that it is difficult to know where to stop, but I suggest that there are limited cases which the Minister could investigate and have remedied.</P>
    <P>With regard to young people detained in Borstal institutions, there is, at present, a very competent visiting committee in connection with the Borstal institution in Clonmel, or wherever the institution is now.  A similar committee existed in Cork when the Borstal institution was situated there.  These people, I am told, do their best, not only to rehabilitate these young offenders in respect of life later on, but in many cases procure positions for them, suited to whatever trade they may have learned before entering the institution or in the institution.  It is very difficult for these boys to find work outside.  The fathers often would be in a position to procure <Col N="1159" /> work for them, but, when such work is found, the Borstal authorities serve on the prospective employer a dossier on foot of which the employer must undertake to look after the wellbeing of the released subject, if I may so describe him.</P>
    <P>I suggest that, in certain cases, where the parents or guardians of such a youngster in a Borstal institution can show to the Minister's satisfaction that they are in a position, if the youngster were at home, to procure work for him, that boy might be released for a defined period, and, if the work was not found for him in that period, the period of release could be terminated. I know that a difficulty has arisen in at least one case to my knowledge, a case in which a father said: &ldquo;If I had my boy at home, I could get work for him but, while he is in the Borstal institution and the necessity arises for a guarantee by the employer, I am afraid I will not be able to get any work for him.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another hardy annual which I want to bring to the Minister's attention is the question of expenses for jurors.  I mention that matter in particular in so far as it affects my own county and city.  In Cork, as I have often said here, the borough boundary is very restricted.  The valuations about it are not as high as the valuations in Dublin, and we, therefore, find the same men serving on juries repeatedly because the scope is so limited.  Men who served last year during the autumn sessions find, when the next autumn sessions come along, that they are called on again for jury service.  It is a severe hardship on many of these men, not so much on men who have their own successful businesses, but on tradesmen and others who are living in houses with valuations sufficiently high to qualify them for jury service and who must attend the court and serve on the jury at their own expense. If the Minister is not prepared to provide expenses for all jurors, I suggest that, in particular cases, such as cases where tradesmen lose wages by reason of jury service, some provision should be made.</P>
    <P>With regard to County Cork, everybody known it is the largest county in <Col N="1160" /> Ireland and many of the Deputies opposite, when they went to Cork in connection with the West Cork byelection, found, when they reached Cork, that they had only got half-way to the point where they were to speak. Many Deputies on the opposite side expressed their amazement at this fact to me.  The city is the only place where the criminal sessions of the Circuit Court are held and jurors are called upon from all over the county.  They come from as far west as Castletownbere, which is something like 80 to 100 miles distant from the city.  When they come up for service, even though it is a matter of only one day's court, it means at least three days, and in many cases the best part of a week.  These men are mostly poor farmers who can ill afford to lose the time lost in attending court or the alternative of a £3 fine.  The fine of £3 does not relate only to attendance on the first day, because the judge has power to impose that fine for every day on which the juror fails to put in an appearance. That it is seldom done, I do not deny, but the danger is there and, in these two cases, the cases of tradesmen who lose work by reason of jury service and the cases of poor farmers who have to come unusually long distances, I think there is a strong orgument for the provision of adequate compensation or expenses. There is another case which I intended to put before the Minister but I think I will wait and have it dealt with by private treaty later on.</P>
    <P>With regard to the High Court on circuit, for some time there has been an agitation in Cork that the magnitude of the business in the Circuit Court warrants a permanent High Court sitting in Cork.  That would probably be asking a lot but, as the Minister knows, the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court in civil cases is only £300 and, in very many cases, particularly cases of car accidents, runningdown cases, as they are generally known, it is almost impossible for the plaintiff to keep his estimated damages within that limit.  Therefore, if he wants to claim what he expects to get in court, he must of necessity come straight to the High Court.  As everybody knows, it is rather difficult in a running-down action to say who will be the winner or loser.  Therefore, in <Col N="1161" /> many cases in Cork, to my own knowledge, plaintiffs have restricted the amount of their claim to £300 in order to avoid the huge expense of bringing witnesses and of going themselves to Dublin.</P>
    <P>In many cases people who have been successful in getting the full £300 under the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, feel that if they had gone to Dublin they would have got a great deal more. Therefore, I would suggest that the Minister should examine the possibility of providing, if not a permanent High Court in the City of Cork, at least more frequent sittings of the High Court on circuit.</P>
    <P>The present system, satisfactory though it may be, has a great deal of limitations.  There is one limitation which is general throughout the country. The High Court goes on circuit in March and July.  When cases are decided in July, the appellant or respondent has an unduly long time to wait until the following March before his case will be decided on appeal.  On the other hand, in July the judges find that the volume of business is almost one-quarter of what it had been in the previous term.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would suggest to the Minister that he should examine the position to see whether or not he could space the sittings of the High Court on circuit more evenly over the whole year.  If the July sittings are maintained, I suggest that the March sitting should be brought forward by a month or two.</P>
    <P>I wish now to refer to the land registry staff.  The Minister stated, and we all welcome the statement, that at last something has been done to deal with the volume of arrears in the land registry.  He has appointed four, if not five, officers, who are legally qualified, to deal with these arrears.  I would make a bet here and now that these officers will be temporary as long as they hold the positions.  They will never be able to overtake the arrears or, if they do, they will find that four extra staff will be required to keep abreast of the work when the arrears have been dealt with.  I suggest that these officers should be made permanent here and now.  It is very unfair <Col N="1162" /> to take a person, who may not have a very good practice, out of his profession and give him a temporary position for three, five or seven years and at the end of that time to say: &ldquo;Thank you very much.  You have done what we asked you.  Now you can go back to your profession.&rdquo;  As everyone knows, it is very difficult for a lawyer to take up again where he left off.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, suggest to the Minister that he should make these officers permanent when he is sure that they are qualified for the work for which they have been appointed and also to give them a salary commensurate with their qualifications.  I understand that at present their salary is something like £8 a week.  These men and women have spent a lot on their education.  They have staked all on following a legal career.  The paltry salary of £8 a week is very poor compensation for work in such a highly technical occupation as examining land registry titles.  I would ask the Minister to investigate the matter with a view to seeing if he could make these officers permanent at an early date and to review their salary scales.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to follow the line of some of the other speakers but I do not think I could let Deputy Peadar Cowan get away with his last remark.  This repeated blowing about the air of freedom we now breathe is about played out at this stage.  There was always freedom in this country, thanks be to God.  There is no extra freedom here now.  People have begun to realise that the present Government's predecessors worked along the lines that every other Party in the country has now adopted. Parties in the country did not see eye to eye with them.  Certain people went off the rails more than others.  They were brought back on the rails again. There is no greater air of freedom here now except that people who tried to flout the authority during the previous Government's administration are now following the line of the average nationally minded citizen in bringing the country to the state of prosperity and national integrity that it deserves.</P>
    <P>Deputy Peadar Cowan also referred to the present Minister's humane attitude in regard to prisoners.  I entirely <Col N="1163" /> endorse what he said.  I do not think the Minister will deny that his predecessor also had a humane outlook in regard to prisoners.  As long as I can remember, there has been a system of mitigation of sentences and fines in the Department of Justice.  I do not know how long the Petitions Section has been in operation but it was certainly in existence for many years before the term of the present Minister.</P>
    <P>That section worked to a set system which was very fair and which operated very much in favour of the convicted person.  A judge, having found a man guilty of a crime, and having felt that he must sentence him, imposed a term of imprisonment which fitted the crime, as the lyric writer, Gilbert, would say.  If that man, or his relatives or friends, petitioned the Department of Justice, the machinery was set in motion and I am sure that has been done often during the present Minister's term of office. The Garda are asked for a report.  The judge or justice is asked for a report. When the Minister has got all the reports and has evidence, which was not admissible in the courts, as to the background of the prisoner and, possibly, other extraneous matters, he is in a much better position to decide whether or not the judge had been a bit too hard, or possibly too lenient, with the accused.  In many cases the judge admits that certain facts which would not be relevant as legal evidence have come to his knowledge and he writes to the Department, I am sure, to that effect.  It was in such circumstances that the Minister's predecessor did release prisoners before the expiration of their sentences.  If that procedure has been departed from, I would ask the Minister to tread carefully.</P>
    <P>Every Minister for Justice, every judge on the Bench, must be assumed to be a humane man.  He would not be fit to hold his office if he were not prepared to examine the merits of a hard case, even when sentence has been pronounced, to examine the case having regard to the history of the imprisoned person and his family circumstances. I am sure the Minister would be the last to say that, in the matter of being <Col N="1164" /> fair to imprisoned persons, he has adopted any better course than his predecessor adopted in his term of office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely rise to mention one thing by way of personal explanation.  I was not in the House at the time but I have been informed that Deputy Boland, when speaking on the Estimate, referring to charges brought against two constituents of mine, who were convicted by the Circuit Court judge at Naas, said as follows&mdash;that after the conviction a dispute as to whether the warrant was made out in the usual way and as to whether the warrant had been properly drawn up or not was set on foot so as to give Deputy T.F. O'Higgins an opportunity&mdash;and that there were eyewitnesses of this&mdash;to get in touch with the Minister on the telephone.</P>
      <P>I want to say that that statement is completely untrue and that the person who so informed Deputy Boland did so recklessly.  I have no knowledge good, bad or indifferent of any such question or dispute and I may add that, in relation to this particular case, I am aware that the opinion of senior counsel has been sought on the question of <i>certiorari</i> proceedings in the High Court of Justice.  That matter is <i>sub judice.</i></P>
      <P>Finally, I should like to say that as long as I am in public life I shall be concerned to see that the principles of justice are not merely respected but are practised also.</P>

      <P>We have heard a good deal of talk about the human side of life.  I thought that the Minister, when he was replying to a parliamentary question put to him a short while ago by Deputy Blaney, was not as humane as he might have been in his outlook in respect of Gardaí making representations to public men if they feel they have a grievance.  We have <Col N="1165" /> heard a good deal of talk from all sides of the House about human beings and not one of us is supernatural.  When we speak about human beings we should go the whole way.  If a Garda feels that he is not getting a fair deal from his sergeant or superintendent or if he feels he is being transferred wrongfully&mdash;and there are likes and dislikes in the force just the same as there are here in Dáil Éireann&mdash;it is only human that if he makes a complaint and thinks that he is not getting a fair hearing he will approach somebody to plead for him with the Minister for Justice or somebody else in charge. That will go on to the end of time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making no charge.  I suppose that the answer to that is that it is either law or justice.  I have heard other Deputies refer in this House to the position of Gardaí in very small stations&mdash;especially where there are only three men.  If one man should get sick or have to be absent for one reason or another the other Gardaí in the station have a good deal of extra duty thrust upon them.  Even though people may say that their duties are not heavy, nevertheless, they have to be there for 24 hours and sometimes maybe 48 hours.  We should do our best to make certain that we are always fair and reasonable in so far as the health and working conditions of our Gardaí are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I first came into this House in 1944 I have been urging that the grave matter of the housing of our Gardaí be given attention.  I am most anxious that the Department of Justice will take a more active interest in this matter.  I think that the Minister for Justice has no direct responsibility except in so far as the giving of allowances is concerned but in certain cases the housing conditions are most inadequate.  As these men have nobody to get houses for them I feel that I should try to plead their case and for that reason I say now that the Department of Justice and <Col N="1166" /> the Department of Local Government should make it their business to ensure that Gardaí in country districts are properly housed just the same as other members of the community.</P>
    <P>I have heard complaints also, in an indirect way, to the effect that the bicycle allowances are inadequate, taking into consideration the amount of work the Gardaí have to do in certain areas.  I should like the Minister to look into the matter and see what can be done about it.  I am well aware that he is very humane in his outlook and I feel confident that he will consider any representations which I may make to him in that regard.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of District Court clerks, which has been referred to by other speakers.  I desire to add my voice also and to plead with the Minister and his Department to do everything possible to remedy the grievances which these District Court clerks have had for quite a long time.</P>
    <P>I have a special interest in the subject of juvenile delinquency and I listened carefully to what Deputy Cowan had to say regarding his experiences in that respect.  I have been present at sessions of the Children's Court and I desire to pay a tribute to the very humane way in which the district justice carried out his duties.  I may say, too, that the probation officers are experienced people who are doing a very good job. Nevertheless, I feel we should keep pace in this country with what is being done in other countries in this respect and for that reason I should like the Minister to consider the possibility of the appointment of a full time psychiatrist in connection with that court.  It often happens that a young person, through no fault of his own, is sent to an institution or to prison and when that happens he is branded for life as a criminal or even as a jailbird.</P>
    <P>I fully realise that every chance is given to a child so as to avoid having to send him to an institution or to prison as the case may be.  The only thing the justice can do is to consult with the parents, teachers and probation officers and that is why I feel he <Col N="1167" /> should have the advantage of the advice of a psychiatrist specially appointed to assist him in cases in which there is a doubt.  Instead of sending a child to an institution or to prison he should be sent to a place where he would get treatment.  If a young person is sent to prison there is the danger that he may come out of it with degrees in crime.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Captain Cowan's army has been very fully dealt with by Deputy Boland.  So far as the treatment of prisoners is concerned, while Deputy Boland may be misrepresented by speakers from the Government side, under him as Minister the prisoners were treated very humanely on all occasions.  So far as the prison system in this country is concerned, it definitely did improve under his administration. All precautions were taken and a very independent visiting committee was appointed to inspect the various prisons and report on conditions.  I hope that will continue.</P>
      <P>I am a great believer in this, that there is some good in all of us.  I believe that even in the greatest criminals, provided they are not soured completely against society and are handled as human beings, after justice has taken its course, there is some good.  Treat them as human beings and do not sour them completely against society and if you can get a small percentage out of a large number of criminals coming back to the right road, then your experiment will be worth while.  My experience of meeting some people of that type is that they become soured against society and they say &ldquo;there is no hope for us.&rdquo;  If they feel someone is anxious to give them a helping hand over the style, there is a great possibility that they will react in the right direction and that they will definitely come back to be useful citizens again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very glad to hear the Minister's introductory remarks and I want to congratulate him for telling us that he is preparing legislation to give the benefits that are long overdue to clerks in the District Courts.  I notice Deputy Boland did not touch on that.  It is satisfactory to observe that this matter, which has been a burning question for years, will at last be remedied and that the representations made are bearing some fruit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make a brief reference to the uniforms worn by the Garda.  I fail to see why the Department of Justice <Col N="1169" /> cannot realise the need for some alteration in the Garda uniforms.  The Department of Defence has realised the necessity for introducing a better type of uniform for our soldiers, such as the open neck on the tunic.  It should be possible to do something like that for the Garda.  It is only fair to those men that some consideration should be given to them.  There should be some better style introduced in connection with their uniforms.</P>
    <P>There was another matter referred to by some Deputies and in connection with it I think the existing situation is a disgrace to the Department.  I refer to the housing conditions for the Garda.  I realise that under another measure which we were discussing to-day members of the Garda Síochána may in the future be provided with houses by the local authorities in country districts.  I think in this matter the Garda have been unfairly treated. Back over the years, no matter what Government was in power, the Garda were neglected in the matter of housing. They should have been provided with decent houses in country districts years ago.  It may be said that the Garda are given an allowance to cover house rent.  In South Cork, even though they are getting that allowance, they are forced to live in condemned hovels because they cannot get a decent house.</P>
    <P>I want to raise what may be considered a small point, but it is an important one and it has reference to the Garda doing point duty in cities and towns.  It should be possible to provide a raised dais for these men and not have them standing in the centre of the streets, as we so often see them in Cork and Dublin and elsewhere during the winter months in very bad weather.  This is really a small point, but the grievance could easily be remedied and I trust the Department will give it sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which the Department could usefully attend and this has reference to barracks where electric current is already installed.  I suggest the Minister should frame some regulation which would give the Board of Works authority to install an additional circuit for power current.  This <Col N="1170" /> would make a big difference for the Garda.  At the present time they have in Garda barracks, for lighting purposes, a 5 amp. fuse and for that they are paying at a certain rate.  If they want to use electric heaters it would mean that the rate they would be paying for the current would be higher.  I believe it would be a simple matter and would mean only a little extra wiring to install a 10 amp. instead of a 5 amp. fuse.  If that were done it would give the Garda in these barracks ample current for electric heating at a cheap rate and they are entitled to something like that.</P>
    <P>It is a common expression down the country that there are people at the present day&mdash;I am now speaking mainly of motorists&mdash;getting away with murder.  I honestly believe, and I have expressed this view to many people, that this is a matter that must be faced in a far more drastic way than we are now facing it.  It is a matter of vital importance to people down the country, at any rate.  I have no intention of interfering with the powers that be in the courts, but I think&mdash;and I can only go by the evidence I see in the papers &mdash;there are too many cases where motorists are gallivanting around the country, very drunk at times, and when these people get into trouble, by taking lives or maiming people for life, the period of six or 12 months that they may get in jail is not sufficient.</P>
    <P>Secondly, taking the driver's licence away for 12 months is not sufficient. The attitude down the country sometimes is that as the judge has a car himself he will be lenient.  That is a dangerous view.  Where it is proved that drivers of cars or lorries were dangerously under the influence of drink&mdash;there is a lot of quibbling sometimes and there are doctors on each side, but I am referring to cases where it is proved&mdash;there should be not only a severe penalty but the driver's licence should be taken from the offender for life.  It is one way of making motorists face the responsibility.  I am not speaking of the ordinary motorists, the big percentage of whom are careful but I am trying to protect, as well as the ordinary citizen, the careful motorist, from the blackguardly type trotting off to dances and race meetings and who <Col N="1171" /> are a danger, not only to themselves but to the whole community.</P>
    <P>Coupled with these car accidents is a vicious circle whereby people are definitely placed in the wrong at times. Take the motorist who, through no fault of his own, meets with an accident when another crashes into him.  The insurance companies adopt a knockfor-knock policy and as a result the companies get away with murder themselves. These matters must be tackled.</P>
    <P>In connection with checking up on drivers, it would be better if we had a little less of Guards round the country watching the poor devil trying to get a pint of Beamish and Murphy down in Cork&mdash;I am not blaming the Guards, as they have to carry out the instructions they get&mdash;and if we had instead a proper patrol system between village and village and between town and town.  Those of us who have to travel round a lot know that one of the rules which motorists are failing to comply with is the decent courtesy of dimming. Nearly every Deputy knows of accidents caused by motorists who refuse to dim their lights.  By the patrol system I mention, where they would be provided with a car and slip round the country, they would get more cases in one week than by hanging around towns and villages for 12 months.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan mentioned the three little boys who, when eating fish and chips on the footpath in that decent respectable town of Ennis, were rounded up by the Guards.  The Minister may be anxious to round me up as soon as he can, but I say in conclusion on this point that there were old words and they are true:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Though justice be thy plea,</P>
    <P>Consider this</P>
    <P>That in the Courts of Justice, none of us</P>

      <P>I was interested to hear the last Deputy mention that some people were getting away with murder. As far as I can see, under the Minister's administration there are certain people getting away with murder and that is what this House should stop in this Estimate.  If we refer to the Ballylinan <Col N="1172" /> scene in which some people described as hooligans by a Circuit Court judge and sentenced him to one month's imprisonment and who were not sent to jail, obviously on the intervention of Deputy O'Higgins, who defended them, that is a typical case of &ldquo;getting away with murder&rdquo;.

      <P>This is merely introductory.  One can understand mistakes, but in this event the matters which I am raising have happened too frequently to pass without comment. The second point is that the present situation is such that, in the opinion of many of us, we should devote some attention to building up the Defence Forces.  That is by way of preliminary remark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the 28th February last, the Minister made a statement in respect of the Defence Forces.  I do not want to go back over the Minister's mistake.  I accept that it was a mistake.  I have already commented that it was a surprising mistake.  I want to point out that that mistake tended in the direction of representing that we had a stronger Defence Force than we had and that we were building it up.  The questions were then prompted by a <Col N="1175" /> report appearing in the daily papers of June 30th, which reported the Taoiseach as saying at Mullingar:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For the present financial year, the strength of the Army is over 12,000 men, costing almost £4,000,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is patently clear that that statement, like the Minister's previous statement, is not true.  The strength is very considerably below 12,000. Taking those statements in conjunction with the fact that in the Seanad the Minister slightly exaggerated the number of recruits which he got according to his later figures on one occasion, and slightly exaggerated here in the House the number of cadets he had on another occasion, I submit that this poses a serious question&mdash;is the Government trying to pretend or represent that the numbers in the Defence Force are growing, when in fact they are not?  The Taoiseach went on to make a comparison with 1939. What was the factual position?  It is true that the establishments in 1939 were 10,000, just as the establishments to-day are 12,000, but it is also true that when war broke out in 1939 the strength of the Regular Army was in the vicinity of 7,500 men, a very respectable percentage of 10,000, and that the strength of the Regular Army at the present moment is in the vicinity of 8,000, which is a much smaller percentage of the present establishment of 12,000.  The suggestion in these statements is that we are in a better position than in 1939.  Are we?  In 1939 there were approximately, between Regular Army and Reserve, 20,000 First Line men available, of which approximately 19,000 were mobilised in 1939.  On the present figures, as given by the Minister over the past few months, the First Line strength has remained generally in the neighbourhood of 14,000.</P>
    <P>Consequently, our First Line strength is considerably below the 1939 figure.  It is true that the F.C.A., the Second Line, is there and that was dealt with on another debate; but the strength of the Second Line, of the F.C.A., has also been falling.  It is for these reasons that we have urged the <Col N="1176" /> Minister to devote some attention to trying to build up the numbers of the Defence Forces.  It is for these reasons that we were very glad to see that, from December last up to March, the Minister was able to get over 1,000 recruits.  I think it was a very good thing.  The disappointing thing is that since March the strength has remained approximately static.  If I wanted to be pernickety about numbers I could say there was a slight decrease.  The fairer thing is to say that the position is static, that is to say, that when the recruiting drive stopped the strength remained as it was.  In view of the statement by the Taoiseach on the date I have mentioned, it is well worth remarking that the strength of the Regular Army in December of last year was below&mdash; though not very much below&mdash;the strength of the Regular Army on mobilisation in 1939 and the First Line Reserve was very much below that figure.  Those are the true facts and when publicity has been given to erroneous statements I think it only right that the true state of affairs should be told to the country.</P>

      <P>The Deputy asked for information.  He got that information.  The question was not formed on general Government policy but on the numbers in the Army.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach made a statement in which he represented that the strength was 12,000 now and that it was more than it was in 1939.  My answer is that the strength is not 12,000 and that it is not very appreciably more than the strength in 1939.  That is the net point, as far as that part of the picture is concerned.</P>
      <P>The Minister, no doubt, will say that the Taoiseach was referring to establishment. I accept that, if it was. Unfortunately, the statement which appeared in the papers, that the strength was 12,000, was misleading and erroneous.  One would imagine that in such a serious matter the impression would be corrected.  The Government Information Bureau, which is being used so frequently to correct information when the Government so desires, might very well have elucidated this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> The Minister chose, of his own accord, when I mentioned this matter yesterday, to make a charge of sabotage. I think I am entitled to deal with that, too.  The Minister accused some of us of sabotaging the Defence Forces.  What is the truth?  The truth is that, from the time the Minister came into office, we pressed him not to reduce the strength of the Defence Forces but to go on building it up.  When he assumed office, admittedly the strength was below establishment but there was a recruiting drive on and every preparation was being made to continue it and build up to establishment.  That the Minister stopped.  We tried to dissuade him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister goes back over the speeches made at that time he will find that there were reasonably constructive arguments put up to him as to why he should not take that course.  I do not know what the Minister is denying.  The strength when the Minister took over was greater than it is to-day at the figure of 8,672, according to the Minister's own calculations. It was below establishment. There had been a recruiting drive. Another was in process of organisation. That was stopped by the Minister and the Minister said in debate on that occasion that he was going to aim, for his first year in office, at 8,500, slightly less than the figure at which he took over.  That was his object, but he did not maintain it.  He let it drop below that figure.  The Minister has accused us of sabotaging the Army.  I think it is a good job there were some people prepared to face the problem because, judging by what the Minister and his Party said before they came into office on the question of defence, the situation to-day might be very much worse than it is.</P>

      <P>The Deputy might resume his seat.  The Deputy put a question down yesterday and that question was answered.  In a supplementary question, the Deputy referred to a statement made by the Taoiseach.  I have doubts as to whether <Col N="1178" /> it is legitimate on the adjournment to combine the two.  The Deputy may, of course, at any time raise the second point as a special matter on the adjournment.  But matters of general Government policy are not to be raised and at the moment the Deputy is opening the whole question of the defence policy of the Government, which is far too wide.</P>

      <P>I bow to your ruling.  Frankly, I would not have pursued that matter but, in answer to my supplementary question yesterday and references to fact, the Minister chose to indulge in his usual retort of &ldquo;sabotage.&rdquo;  If there is any accusation of sabotage in the matter, I merely wish to answer the Minister with the facts.  I agree that the point in issue here is that erroneous, incorrect and untrue information has been given and the answers to the questions elicited information to prove that.  I shall not go any further than draw attention to that matter.  I do not know in how far, however, the figure given by the Minister yesterday is a subject for discussion. I think it is unsatisfactory that the strength should be at that figure.</P>

      <P>The facts are as stated.  There is another statement of <Col N="1179" /> the Taoiseach's to which I am entitled to refer as it arose on the supplementaries and I gave notice that I wished to deal with the supplementaries as well.  The Taoiseach made a reference to the comparative position in 1939. The people who were in charge at that time are only too ready to-day to acknowledge the lessons that were learned at that time.  We are only too ready to admit the actual inadequacy of the then position, but we got by on it.  The point is that we are now dealing with this particular year and this particular moment.  We have to face the problem as we find it.  The inadequacy, or otherwise, of our Defence Forces is a serious matter.  As I have said, I can understand that the Taoiseach misread establishment for strength; but the Taoiseach is in a very responsible position and should not misread one thing for something else when he is making a public pronouncement for the scrutiny of the entire country.  He should have been properly informed just as the Minister should have been properly informed on a prior occasion.</P>
      <P>Going back over the period of these errors, one notices that they have all been in the one direction.  I think that is a dangerous thing.  The Chair has ruled that I am precluded from discussing policy.  We shall do that on another occasion.  All we ask now is that the Minister should give prudent attention to these matters and do what can be done.  Misleading the public, whether accidentally or otherwise, does not help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to that little lecture from the Deputy, both to the Taoiseach and myself, perhaps it will be permissible for me to deal in the first place with the ordinary normal parliamentary courtesies, which the Deputy does not seem either to appreciate or understand. Any time the Deputy wants to get absolute accuracy in figures, he is quite long enough in the House to know that the way to get absolute accuracy in figures is to put down a specific question and get a specific reply.  The figure used in replying to a supplementary question or in debate is generally a figure that springs from a man's <Col N="1180" /> recollection.  As everybody knows, the strength of an army based on short time at a station and voluntary recruiting does, of course, vary from day to day and month to month, upwards and downwards.  Any Minister replying from recollection will give some recent return he has seen.</P>
      <P>With regard to recruiting figures being higher on one date than on another, the system in the Army is that so many men go in through the barrack gate and are accepted.  These are recruits taken on to the Army strength that night.  There is then what is called an auditing of those recruits and, as a result of that auditing, subsequent examination and subsequent reports, the numbers drop; so many go out again. That is the explanation of the two figures given for recruiting.  In this House or outside it, no one who claims to be an honest man is entitled to have two heads on the penny he proposes to toss.  The Deputy seems to take unto himself the unique right to toss this two-headed penny.  It is criminal and of the utmost gravity if the Taoiseach happens to quote the established strength of the Army, the approved established strength as the strength.</P>
      <P>It is an error that no man in a responsible position should be guilty of making and repeating; but when the Leader of the Deputy's own Party in a reference to the year 1948-49 uses and repeatedly uses the establishment strength of that Army and repeats it as late as Sunday-week, it is no crime and it is no mistake for a man in a responsible position.  Every year for three years in the Estimates debate here, the Leader of the Deputy's Party, the ex-Minister for Defence and the ex-Minister for Finance, have claimed they left to me an Army of 12,500 men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, &ldquo;We regarded as the minimum an Army of 12,500 men.&rdquo;  The Deputy told us a few moments ago that, in 1948, they had an establishment of 12,500 which they aimed at filling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>But, in their Book of Estimates presented to the Dáil in 1948, was a demand for money to pay so many men, and they reduced in their Book of Estimates the demand by a quarter, so actually, far from aiming at 12,500 you aimed at that less 25 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference was we aimed at an increase for the existing figure and you aimed at a decrease.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we are getting the quibbling.  I did not interrupt the Deputy.  The establishment was that your 12,000 odd was to cost £3,000,000. In the next page of the Book of Estimates there is the figure &ldquo;deduct 25 per cent&rdquo;; that leaves three quarters or 8,000 odd, and that is the army that you asked the Dáil to pay for in 1948-49.</P>
      <P>The Book of Estimates this year is made out in exactly the same way. The establishment is 12,000 odd and on the next page &ldquo;deduct by 25 per cent.&rdquo;  I come to the Dáil and I say honestly that that is what I am looking for&mdash;only 8,000 and not for the 12,000 odd.  The position is exactly the same except that I am honest enough to tell the public in simple language the number of soldiers I am asking the public to pay for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

      <P>One was corrected half a dozen times and I accepted the correction but repeated the mistake. The other was only corrected once, and I take it will not repeat the mistake.</P>
      <P>The other thing the Deputy referred to was that recruiting, and when the Deputy's Leader said that here in the House and when I told him that I had never stopped recruiting, he accepted that, and said he was very pleased to hear it, but he repeated that charge in Ennis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is merely a small boy playing a part in a big campaign, and that campaign is to discredit this Army in the eyes of people at home and abroad.  He gets quite hot under the collar if anybody might think that the Army is slightly larger than it is, or that it might enjoy a little bit of increased prestige if people for a second believed that it was larger than it is.  He must tear that little bit of prestige from it and he must minimise it.  He must tell people not only at home but abroad, and keep repeating, that we are unprepared, that we are defenceless and that we are not preparing for our job, and he claims that that is in the national interest.</P>
      <P>I am standing for the same Army that my predecessor stood for, and I am standing for it more honestly than my predecessor did because I am prepared to say what strength in men I am looking for and I am not sheltering behind the intricacies of a paper establishment. A paper establishment is not a defence force.  Even men in uniform do not constitute an army, but if the things inside the uniform are trained and, in addition, equipped then you have an army.  In my time there is not going to be a sham army either inside or outside barracks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy says that the strength of the F.C.A. was reduced.  It was not reduced, but it was watered down to effectives, so that we would know our real strength any time if taking the <Col N="1183" /> field.  I could claim that the strength of the F.C.A. on paper is greater than it was three years ago, whereas the figure that was there was for lobbying around three years ago, a figure in the neighbourhood of 48,000.  I got the officers of the General Staff, Sunday after Sunday, for two years to go out and find out how many of those in fact were effectives, and to write off so many every week of ineffectives so as <Col N="1184" /> to get the real strength and so as to have a real force and not a paper force. If it is a crime to be honest I plead guilty; if it is a crime to make a defence force a reality, I plead guilty, and I have no apologies to offer to those who are not only trying to humbug the Dáil but to humbug the electorate outside.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. to 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 11th July, 1950.</P>
